### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [R.J. Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36968)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 77, UCF - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Duke University head coach Mike Krzyzewski with student-
athletes Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Obviously, Johnny's team was magnificent. They were so well
prepared. That's as high a level of any team that we've played against all
year. They were men. Aubrey wasn't outstanding; he was magnificent. Our guys
hung in there. We got that seven-point lead. We missed a shot, made a
turnover, and they went on that barrage of shooting.  
  
These kids, my guys, hung in there. They hung in there because just the
momentum of the tournament, what's going on, you could be defeated right
there, and instead, they hung in there. We waited forever about the call for
the shot clock violation, and during that -- it was 2:09 left, and we talked
about these kids are made for these two minutes. They fought, and Cam hit a
huge three.  
  
The will to win of Zion and R.J., you can't measure it. It's just there, and
it's -- they're young -- we're a young group, but what they did right at the
end of that game in willing us to win was just absolutely sensational.  
  
But, again, congratulations to Johnny and his group. They certainly were
deserving of winning, also.  
  
Q. Zion, what was your thoughts on the final drive looking down at a guy
who was almost a foot taller than you when you took it to the basket?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: You know, it's March Madness. A lot's going through my mind,
but like Coach said, at that 2:09 mark when they were reviewing the play --
you know, I consider him the greatest coach of all time. When he looks at you
and tells you that you're made for this moment, it's like the most confidence
you can be given. So when I went to the basket, I knew it was going in.  
  
Q. R.J., what was going through your mind when you hit that shot at the
end off the Zion missed free throw?  
R.J. BARRETT: I was just thinking what can we do to win this game? I remember
watching March Madness and watching a whole bunch of games and seeing missed
free throws, somebody gets a rebound and a putback. So I thought, I'm just
going to try to do whatever I can to get this rebound.  
  
Q. This is for Zion and R.J. At what point in the game did you guys see
that this guy, Tacko, was going to be a different challenge than you have met
offensively and defensively?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Before the game, obviously.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We didn't overlook him.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, he's 7'6".  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Or underlook him.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like Coach said, he's 7'6". He's a big man down there, so you
just have to run the right offense for it. You know, he played great. Like,
hat's off to him. He played an amazing game, but I think we just hit some big
shots, and we were able to get the win.  
  
R.J. BARRETT: It was definitely a different challenge. Never really played
against something like that before. Definitely, it was challenging, but we
definitely hung in there. So that was great.  
  
Q. R.J., did the way Aubrey Dawkins played today, did that surprise you
at all? 32 and looked like he had that last tip.  
R.J. BARRETT: No, it didn't surprise me. I knew he was going to come out and
try to be aggressive. He really grew up with Duke, so to play against us is
probably a dream come true for him. He played his butt off, and he was tough
to stop for us tonight.  
  
Q. Zion, when the big man was on you, number 35, it looked like he did
not want to come out of the paint to cover you. Did you feel pretty
comfortable in your three-point game today?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yes, sir, and I always feel comfortable with my three-point
game because my teammates and the coaches are always telling me shoot a strong
shot, and they trust me to shoot it. So when I saw he was playing off, I was
just shooting it with confidence.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their last possession, what Coach told you in the
huddle, and kind of how that went down? It looked like they were going to hit
that tip. What did it feel like on those last microseconds?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Go out there and play like defense. You've got to play like
there's no tomorrow. Tre played great defense and got -- shoot like an off-
balance shot. Dawkins came flying in. I mean, when he tipped it, you talk
about microseconds, when that ball rolled around the rim, it looked like it
was going in, but as Coach K talks a lot about the basketball gods, they had
our back tonight.  
  
Q. When you're playing in the backyard, these situations are ones that
you really think about and want to really emulate. Now that you've been able
to do that, how does it kind of feel in hindsight?  
THE MODERATOR: R.J.?  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Did you have a backyard?  
  
R.J. BARRETT: Yeah, I used to play with the older guys. I mean, it's a surreal
feeling. I can't really describe it at all, but just to be out there on the
court, the fans and watching all the games. It's been amazing. So to be in
that situation, it's like we know it's win or go home. So we're trying to give
everything out there because, if we lose, that's it for us for the season. So
just a surreal feeling, and it's great to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. Questions for Coach Krzyzewski?  
  
Q. Coach, you said obviously you don't like playing your guys in games.
I guess this is one of the reasons why. A long embrace with Coach Dawkins
after the game. If you could share a little bit of what you said.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I love Johnny. I'm going to start crying. That's what I told
him. I love Johnny Dawkins, and the moments, the times that we've spent
together building the program, ten years on our staff, and the connections
that we've had while he was at Stanford and Central Florida. He's a member of
-- we're family. I feel bad that they lost. I'm happy -- it's like a yin and a
yang here because they were deserving of winning. They were so good, and I'm
so proud that those kids played at the level of their coach.  
  
It's hard to describe. That's why I hate -- obviously, we're happy we won
because unless you're an idiot (laughter). Although some of you might say I
fill that description. It's a tough moment, and it will take me a little while
to get through it, to be quite frank with you.  
  
Same thing with Aubrey. You see him grow up from a little guy. You know, even
on our staff, Johnny was kind of like Nolan's father. Nolan's dad died early,
and when Johnny was the assistant for us, Nolan really looked to Johnny as a
father figure. So Aubrey for him, too, is like a brother. All these
connections, they're just hard to explain, but they're all true. That's what
makes it very difficult. And especially Aubrey, Aubrey was the best player on
the court today. He was magnificent.  
  
So there were so many good things, great things, and it was a great game
because both teams played hard. I mean, really, we haven't had a team play any
better against us than they did. They were fantastic.  
  
Q. It seemed like, when you made that time-out run at three minutes,
when you guys came out, there was more of an emphasis on getting to the
basket. It seemed like you guys were trying to get that fifth foul on Fall.
Could you just go through that scenario?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It wasn't so much trying to get the fifth foul because you
don't know how the game, the way the game was called, was very physical for
both teams around the bucket. So you really -- I think that's over analyzing a
moment. If that's what you're going to do, you're going to lose.  
  
Basically, I just tried to get the ball into the hands of my two best players,
guys that -- these two guys. And then when Cam came back in and transitioned,
Tre found him for the three. Basically, you just try to -- it's not as much
coaching as allowing your players to make you look good, and if they don't do
it, you have their backs, and our guys know that.  
  
Q. Just curious, with such a talented but young group of freshmen in the
biggest moment of their athletic career at this point with two minutes left
after the shot clock violation being reviewed, like what did you tell them to
try to keep them calm and keep them focused?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We had a lot of time, one. It was a long time to do that. And
on the court, I said, look, no matter what the decision will be made, there's
going to be eight to ten, maybe more possessions in this game. And you guys
were made for these two minutes and just be yourselves. And they are.  
  
You know, we had a lot of foul trouble, and we are young, and we're not deep,
but we're good. But we had a lot of stuff go on today that was difficult for
us, and they were still able -- and the most difficult was the other team, and
we were able to find a way to win. These kids are that -- they have it. They
have it. Hopefully, we can continue to advance, but I love who they are, and I
have confidence in them. If they didn't come through, then I got their backs,
but they did come through.  
  
By the way, just thank you for the City of Columbia; wow. What a beautiful
city. Everything about it, the arena and especially the state troopers. The
state troopers are the best. I know some of you probably don't like them
(laughter). They're really a classy -- so classy in everything that was going
on. So a thank you to all those people. Thank you.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 63, Oklahoma - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Oklahoma head coach Lon Kruger with student-athletes Christian
James, Brady Manek, and Kristian Doolittle. Coach, a brief opening statement.  
  
LON KRUGER: Virginia dictated there early, got off to a great start. Thought
we got our feet under us a little bit after that. Virginia is good. They're
really good. I thought we had a rhythm on our offensive end. I thought they
did what they wanted to on their offensive end. As they do, they dictate to
you, and we didn't fight that quite well enough.  
  
But proud of our guys. Our guys fought like crazy throughout the year.
Opportunity to qualify for the tournament and get a good win on Friday and
didn't get the result we wanted tonight, but proud of them. These guys have
represented well, and happy for them.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, they made a change in the starting lineup, put
Mamadi in the starting lineup covering you. How much did you think that
affected your ability to get to the rim and make plays?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: It changed a lot. Him being 6'10" and being very athletic,
he was able to alter my shot and block a few of them there at the beginning of
the game. Credit to him for playing really good defense. He made it really
tough on me to get the shots that I wanted, and even when I was open, just
kind of wasn't in a rhythm, just being inconsistent on my part. So credit to
them for that.  
  
Q. Brady, you had 13 in the first half. Christian James, you had 13 in
the second half. But you didn't score in the other halves. What was happening
that each of you had a really good half but struggled in the other half?  
BRADY MANEK: I just think they got us out of rhythm. They played really good
defense, solid defense. They're a good team. I had some open looks, but it
wasn't really the shot I wanted. They just played really good, and I just
think that the second half I got a little flustered, and it showed in that I
was missing shots.  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: As Brady said, they're a great team. They did a great job of
dictating on offense and defense. First half, I missed a couple open looks,
kind of felt good, but they didn't go in. The second half, I seen one go, and
from there, they all felt good. Credit to them. They definitely took me out of
my rhythm a little bit. They're a great team.  
  
Q. Christian James, was there any thought when you all were able to
absorb that 7-0 blow, have that run where you took the lead, did you think
that maybe you could get that punch in that might psychologically wound them
enough where you could just knock them out?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: I wouldn't say knock them out. We knew they were going to
fight. We knew it was going to be a battle from the beginning. We did go on
that run. We thought we could be able to go on another run after that, but it
didn't go like that. They did a great job on defense. Like Brady said, they
kind of took us out of our rhythm.  
  
Q. Christian James, you've played on a Final Four team. Did that look
like a Final Four team to you, that Virginia team you were playing?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Yeah. They're a great team, and they're going to the Sweet
16. Anything can happen from there. It's March, and it's all about who wants
it more. But they slowed the pace down on offense, and they run their sets
well. They do a great job on defense, helping, getting back recovering. They
doubled us on the post. They did a great job of that. They're an all around
good basketball team. That's why they're the Number 1 seed.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle and Brady, you're going to lose a bunch of
seniors, including the guy on your left. What do you like about what's coming
back and the core of the team that will be here next year?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: This will be a starting point, taken from this game. We
know what it takes to get here. So it will be up to me and Brady to kind of
lead the pack this next year for the new guys coming in, freshmen and
whoever's coming in. We have to tell them what it takes to get here, hold
ourselves accountable as well as holding them accountable whenever we're doing
our off-season workouts, starting from day one. You can't take anything for
granted because there's probably some things we wish we could take back to
change the outcome of the game, but you can't do that. So you have to start
from day one starting good habits.  
  
BRADY MANEK: Yeah, what he said about just we're losing a lot of good guys, a
lot of good players, guys like Christian that shoot it, guys like that can
take it to the rim. Jamuni, Miles, Aaron, they're all very good. And we have
very few of us coming back. We're going to have to have some young guys, some
JuCo guys, guys like Austin Reaves and Kerr, they're coming.  
  
Next year, we'll just have to start over, like Doo said, and just work from
the beginning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. It looked like you played with them most of the game, but they're
clearly just a superior team. What do you need to get back to that level you
once were at? What do you need?  
LON KRUGER: Again, this group fought and did a good job, but I think you're
always looking to -- Virginia's a club, using them as a standard, that they
can score in a lot of different ways. A lot of different individuals can make
plays. They're so sound defensively. Communication-wise, they're great. Coach
Bennett does a fantastic job. So the group we got coming back and the group we
got coming in, it will be exciting to see where they go. We have to challenge
them to take this as a base and take it a step forward.  
  
Q. You had Trae Young and he went off to the NBA. You're picked 8th in
the Big 12, if I'm not mistaken, preseason. What do you think about this team
and what they were able to accomplish getting into the second round of the
NCAA?  
LON KRUGER: They did a good job. Even if you look back into the middle part of
the Big 12 where we lost five in a row, they were down and out at that point
and kept fighting and kept plugging, and we'll always have a great
appreciation for the fact they kept working. It would have been pretty easy
with the conference schedule coming up at that point. We're going to TCU, and
they're tough at home, and we were able to win there, then come back home and
beat Kansas in a big way. Then again, I thought they played as well as they
have all year against Ole Miss Friday night.  
  
So, yeah, a lot to hold their heads up. Again, you'd like to go through and
win them all, but when you get to that point where you're down and out a
little bit, to respond is a pretty good challenge and a pretty good test of
their character and their togetherness. They hung in there and had the
opportunity to play in the tournament.  
  
Q. How do you use games like this against this level of talent as
teaching moments for your team?  
LON KRUGER: Christian and Brady said -- and Jamal, who played a lot of
minutes, those guys coming back, a little different reference point. They know
what a Number 1 seed looks like more clearly now than if they hadn't played in
the tournament. They'll learn from it. They'll be a bit more motivated in the
off-season; spring, summer, fall.  
  
They're a good bunch that likes to be in the gym and likes to work. So they'll
get better.  
  
Q. Tony made a change in his starting lineup, put Diakite in to cover
Doolittle from the start. How much do you think that affected Doolittle and
the entire game?  
LON KRUGER: As Doo said, probably hard to measure, but definitely blocked a
couple three shots, changed a couple of others. I think it probably had a
pretty big impact on him. He's a long rangy defender that made Doo play a
little bit differently than he did Friday night for sure. So I think Diakite
did a fantastic job.  
  
Q. Followup to that, the way Doolittle's progressed, especially since
January, I think, he's become sort of a go to player. Is it hard for you to
win at this point in the season without him having a really good game? But
does that also bode well for the future that he can become an even more
impactful player?  
LON KRUGER: Probably so, yeah. When he or Christian, Brady, those been the
source of our scoring throughout the years. So if you take one or two of them
out of the mix, it's makes it tough, especially against a 1 seed and a very
good club like Virginia. These guys will get better. Jamal, I thought a little
uncomfortable in the first half. I thought he played much better in the second
half. It's a good experience for him to learn from and gain from. And
certainly Doo and Brady will, as well.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 77, UCF - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: From the University of Central Florida, head coach Johnny
Dawkins with student-athletes Aubrey Dawkins, Tacko Fall, and B.J. Taylor.
First an opening statement from Coach, and then we'll have questions directed
to our student-athletes.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It was a great basketball game. I thought both teams rose to
the occasion and played their best basketball on the stage where it counts the
most. Hats go off to them for their ability to continue to keep fighting and
competing.  
  
I was very impressed with the way that Duke, especially with freshmen, were
able to withstand some of the shots we were making, and it says a lot about
their will, it says a lot about their overall mental toughness.  
  
And with regards to our guys, I'm just very proud of them. What we were able
to do this year as far as competing at the level we wanted to compete at,
making the NCAA Tournament, winning a game in the NCAA Tournament says a lot
about our senior class because they led us all the way, and I'm just really
proud of everything they've done for our program.  
  
Q. Aubrey, if you could just sum up the last chance you had there and
what you saw and what you felt immediately afterwards.  
AUBREY DAWKINS: I had a chance at a putback on B.J.'s floater, and it just
didn't go, caught it on the rim. I mean, heartbreak. That's the only way to
sum it up. We spent all this time trying to get to this stage, and obviously
we want our journey to continue. When you invest this much in it, it breaks
your heart.  
  
Q. Aubrey, how long did it feel like that ball hung on that rim before
it fell off on that last one?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: An eternity. It was up there forever, I felt like, in slow
motion. Once I saw it go past the midpoint and roll out, it was, at that
point, nothing left to do.  
  
Q. B.J., your final shot looked like it was going to go in, as well. Can
you talk about that?  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah. I mean, Coach drew up the play. We executed it. We got the
shot that we wanted. It's a shot that I shoot -- you know, I've been shooting
that shot ever since I've been playing for Coach. It just didn't fall. It
kills me that it didn't fall, but I guess that's how it goes sometimes. But
that was the play. We executed it. We got the shot we wanted.  
  
Q. To all three players, if you could just quickly sum up how you guys
feel about the effort you put out there against the Number 1 team in the
nation.  
TACKO FALL: I feel like all the guys came in ready to go from the jump.
Everybody gave their best effort. Even the bench was very active throughout
the whole game, very involved. We left it all out there. I don't know what to
say right now because the emotions, but I'm very proud of the guys. It didn't
go our way at the end of the day, but we left it all out there, and that's all
you can ask.  
  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Same as Tacko. I'm very pleased with how we played. I thought
we played really hard and gave our best effort, and that's all you can ask
for. Yeah, great game for us.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, we left it all out there. We played as hard as we
could. I think we showed a lot of people across the country that we were a
serious basketball team and that we really could play with anybody. I know
coming into this game a lot of people had us losing by 15-plus to these guys,
and they're a great team. Like Coach said, they fought and played extremely
hard, but I think we represented UCF as best we could. I think we did
everything we could to win that game. It just came down to a couple plays.  
  
Q. Tacko, on Zion's last drive there, did you feel you had position?
Wonder if you thought you'd done enough to get a charge call there.  
TACKO FALL: I just tried to stay big and make a play. Obviously, I was in foul
trouble, so I was being careful. But I just tried to make a play and make him
miss, and it didn't go my way.  
  
Q. Two-part question, one for Aubrey, one for B.J. Aubrey, Zion said he
thought your last tip-in was going to go in, and the basketball gods had
Duke's back today. Is that just how it goes sometimes? And for B.J., was there
any contact on your final shot, and could a foul have been called?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: You miss and make shots, and you've got to live with it. We
got the opportunity, and it just didn't go.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: My last play, it's kind of a blur. I just remember I got to the
spot I wanted to get to. Like I said, that's a shot that I shoot all the time,
and it just rimmed out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Dawkins.  
  
Q. Coach, just what do you say to your team immediately after a game
like that?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's tough. We invested so much, of course, like we do every
season, and when you invest as much as we did, it's going to be a tough locker
room, and it was. But that's the way it should be. Everyone was down because
everyone knew how much we invested in and how much we sacrificed to be in this
position.  
  
So we talked about that, talked about how proud I am of my team and of our
program, and I thought we represented UCF and our community great all year
long. I thought our guys were great on and off the court, and I'm just so
proud of the men that they've been.  
  
Q. Johnny, Mike was tearing up a little bit when he was talking about
you earlier. I saw you guys shared an embrace after the game. Can you kind of
share with us a little bit about that? And did you ever envision, when he came
to D.C. to recruit you, that you'd be in a position like this having to coach
against him?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No way. I never thought we'd be in this position. It's tough.
Like you said, we're family, and our embrace was one -- you know, I love that
man. That man, without him, I wouldn't be where I am today. So he's meant a
lot to me throughout my life, and that's what type of an embrace it was.  
  
Q. Can you describe Aubrey's performance and the shots he was making to
keep you guys in the game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Aubrey was terrific. You've been part, you've seen us a lot
this year. He's capable of having moments like that, and he had one tonight on
one of the biggest stages you could have it on. He couldn't have picked a
better time for that for us. I thought that really helped us throughout the
game, his ability to knock down shots, open some other things up for us, and
he had a terrific evening.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, you had an historic season marking a milestone,
winning your first NCAA March Madness game. How do you build upon the success,
and what do you tell your team, especially the seniors like B.J. and Tacko?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I just thanked all the seniors, especially in front of the
team, for everything they've done for us for their careers. For us, going
forward, we need to use these type of moments to build on. Now our guys
understand what it takes to be in these moments, to be in the NCAA Tournament
team, and now we need to grow from that.  
  
We'll lose some valuable players, guys that helped do some things at UCF that
hadn't been done before, and now we need the players that are returning to
understand the importance of continuing that legacy that the seniors left
behind.  
  
Q. Coach, when you saw Aubrey's tip-in, did you think it was going to go
in? Just your viewpoint.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I did. I thought it was going to go. I thought he got a good
look at it at the end. I thought B.J.'s shot was very close to going, also.
When that one didn't go and it rolled out, I saw Aubrey come into the picture
real quick, and he had a quick tip at it, and it just kind of hung there, and
it just rolled out. As he mentioned before, it's part of our game. It's a fine
line, and he just came up a few inches short. You have a different outcome.  
  
Q. About Tacko's performance, everybody talked about Tacko and Zion
coming into this game. He dealt with some foul trouble, and you played him
with some foul trouble. Just talk about his performance today.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Tacko was amazing, and he has been for us. He's been one of
the most dominant bigs in the country. I think his last probably six weeks of
the season, I can't think of too many guys that's played any better than him
at that position. Just really, really proud of him. He was a leader in the
locker room. On the floor, he led by example. He went out there, and he would
compete for us. He had a presence on both ends. I thought he affected the game
offensively for us around the basket, and he definitely affected the game
defensively. He was terrific around the basket guarding our rim.  
  
Q. Coach, Zion's final drive to the hoop where he got Tacko fouled out,
were you comfortable with that call? And can you talk about the missed free
throw, where R.J. Barrett got the rebound?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Definitely. You have a terrific game, and I thought the game
was ref'd great. I have no issues with how the game was ref'd. It's a game you
have to make plays. Unfortunately, we just didn't make enough plays. They made
one more play than we made, and that's how it was going most of the evening.
They came up with one more big one.  
  
That's all it was. I think his drive to the basket was strong, and you have to
call what you see. I have no issues with that. So that's the nature of our
game.  
  
Q. R.J. Barrett?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: R.J. Barrett, I haven't seen that play over again, so I'm not
sure. Same thing, the ball kind of bounced his way a little bit, and the kid
made a great play. A lot of guys don't see those plays to make. R.J., you've
got to give him credit. He was staying in the moment. He made a terrific
basketball play also, the rebound putback.  
  
Q. B.J. talked about when he was out here how it kills him the shot
didn't fall. Aubrey, same thing. I wonder as a coach, for you, how long it
would take for you to kind of get over this kind of game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I can't put a timetable on how long it will take. I just know
that, when we have games like this, we have to use them to become a better
team and a better program. So we need to use this opportunity that we had to
grow. For our players that were in that locker room that aren't seniors, for
our staff and everybody involved, we need to use this opportunity. So the
feeling shouldn't go away right away. I think that still having that feeling
is not a bad thing. We need to utilize that to become better at what we do.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 63, Oklahoma - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: With head coach Tony Bennett and the University of Virginia, Ty
Jerome, Mamadi Diakite, and Braxton Key.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Obviously, just excited to come away with a hard fought win. I
thought these guys really came to play. They played for each other
defensively. I hope -- they did it at the end of the first half all through
the second half against Gardner-Webb, and then all game they just rotated and
covered and made it hard for Oklahoma.  
  
They ran their hard stuff. You know, an uncharacteristically cold shooting
night from Kyle, but they withstood that, some foul trouble from De'Andre.
These guys that are on the podium and the guys in the locker room, they
stepped up and big plays were made and it certainly felt good.  
  
Q. Ty, it seemed like there was some carryover from the opening game.
You played very loose in this one, very relaxed, as opposed to some of the
pressure you mentioned feeling in the opening game. Did it feel a little bit
more comfortable tonight?  
TY JEROME: Yeah, but like I said, after last game, just a testament to our
coaching staff really. They're doing such a great job of giving us that
freedom offensively and just getting us to play hard but allowing us to play
free. That's just such a great job by them.  
  
Q. Braxton, what did you think when Kyle fed you that little pass there
on that one play?  
BRAXTON KEY: Kyle, he's an underrated passer. He can make a lot of plays
passing the ball, creating for teammates, stuff like that, but he just has
eyes in the back of his head. It was a good find. I should have dunked it, but
my legs were a little tired.  
  
Q. Mamadi, another big scoring game for you. Kind of what do you
attribute to your last few games scoring? What's been clicking for you?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: I've just been very patient and letting the game come to me. I
wasn't trying to force anything, pretty much.  
  
Q. This is sort of playing off of that, Mamadi. You really seemed locked
in tonight from being able to hedge past the top of the key and still sprint
back and defend in the post. Were you locked in? Was it your night?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: Yeah, I was locked in, and I was trying to respond to the
challenge Coach gave me. He started me tonight, and I wanted to prove him that
I was ready to play. So I did so.  
  
Q. Braxton, in their first game, Oklahoma was able to get to the rim
very easily against Mississippi. Obviously, the way you guys played defense,
it's designed to stop that, but how much of a focus was keeping them away from
the rim tonight?  
BRAXTON KEY: It was huge. Our coach just told us I think they got most of
their points from a two-point field goal. So just trying to get in the pack
and make it more difficult for them to get inside. When they got inside, just
post trapping their guards and try to give them different looks that they may
not have seen prior to today.  
  
Q. Ty, talk about advancing to the second weekend for the first time in
a while for this group. What does it mean to you?  
TY JEROME: It means everything to me, honestly. It's my first time in the
Sweet 16, like I said. After last game, I told you I've never been to a Sweet
16. Everyone is talking about a Final Four, but I've never been to a Sweet 16.
Just the opportunity to play with this group again for a whole 'nother week
and practicing with this group and traveling with this group, that's what
means the most, I think. Just to keep playing with this group of guys.  
  
Q. For all you guys, coach just talked repeatedly about urging you to
enjoy the joy of pursuing a championship. How much does the enjoyment grow, I
guess, game to game, round to round, as you get some momentum and you get
really into this?  
TY JEROME: Yeah, I don't think the joy necessarily grows because every time we
step on the basketball court, you have to understand how blessed you are to
play the game you love. I think it's just, like I said, another week, more
opportunity to play with the teammates you love for the coaches you love and
for the fans you love.  
  
But we're nowhere near relaxed, nowhere near satisfied. We're not even close
to our end goal. Just got to come day by day and get ready to practice on
Monday.  
  
MAMADI DIAKITE: Thinking of what he just said, we try to enjoy every step that
we have, but, again, the job is not done yet. We've got more games to go, more
preparations, and we have to know what other teams have for us. In order to
get to the next phase, we need to prepare ourselves.  
  
Q. Mamadi, you said that you wanted to respond to your coach's challenge
because he decided to start you today. When did you find out you were
starting, and what exactly did he want to challenge you to do?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: It was this morning, and I mean, starting is a big -- to me,
it's a big challenge. He's telling you, okay, you have the responsibility to
help the team, and we're trusting you. So I just answered to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Bennett?  
  
Q. Tony, Ty said the other day that a big reason for Mamadi's success
this year is because of how much he's grown as a person. Have you seen that,
and how has that sort of manifested in his play?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he's matured. I think a key, I said it after the game, is
he allowed us to play Doolittle one-on-one in the post. Mamadi's quickness off
the floor to bother maybe his midrange shot and just work so we didn't have to
come and trap. That puts a lot of pressure on their defense with your ability
to shoot from three, especially their four man, Brady Manek. When we could go
one-on-one, that was significant.  
  
I think Ty made a great statement. We got off to a rocky start last game,
Mamadi, all of us, and Mamadi responded. He just kept playing and stayed
steady. So certainly maturity, resilience, those are things that -- you know,
it's just part of the maturation process that each player kind of comes at
differently, and I say it all the time. He's newer to the game, and he's young
and joyful and all those things, and to be able to handle adversity or a hard
start, that's a separator for a lot of players. He's definitely coming in the
right direction, and he was terrific yesterday and today.  
  
Q. We already asked the guys, but it seemed like maybe there was some
tightness or pressure in that opening game. Certainly, the circumstances of
the game played into that. Tonight they seemed like they played very relaxed
and free. Did you notice that? Did you notice it pregame, during the game, or
do you think I'm crazy?  
TONY BENNETT: No, only the guys in the locker room and the coaching staff who
were part of last year's team and this year's team can truly appreciate and
understand -- you know, we tried to get back to this spot. Even to be a 1 seed
and then to have to go into the situation and to be down in that game,
definitely pressure in terms of the game. So that was real. You could feel it.
And to show the resilience to kind of get through that.  
  
Then I was hopeful that they could play -- I don't think it was no worries.
There's pressure and excitement and tension to try to advance in this
tournament, that's always there, but it was a different feel. It's unlike
anything -- well, no college basketball team really in the history of the game
has had to go through that. It's our doing. We were the first 1 seed to lose
last year, and then all of a sudden to fight back and become a 1 seed, and
then to be in that situation again. You talk about trying to focus in and then
getting down, it was real. So I think those guys will have that as something
they can always draw upon to say we faced a giant and battled through it.  
  
So I think that, for sure, they were in a better place to start this game. We
tried to be in a better place. That's a credit to how Gardner-Webb played to
start the game, as well.  
  
Q. Tony, I seem to keep feeding questions that people asked before me,
but to my trained eye, this looked like one of the best games you guys have
played in a while. Everything seemed to go smoothly. The rotations on offense
and defense went well. Is that the way you saw it?  
TONY BENNETT: I thought we played enough quality basketball. We had to be
ready from the start, and we got off to a real good start, and then we had a
little trouble at a stretch there. But we were steady and got good lifts, and
again, to absorb not shooting as well from Kyle and the foul trouble from
De'Andre, different guys -- Braxton stepped up, Kihei was terrific, Mamadi.
Obviously, Ty and all the guys did the job, but I think that there was a
playing for each other defensively, as I said in my opening statement, and
sharing the ball and just trying to -- you know, you get into these possession
games trying to impose your will or outlast, and that was part of it. Both
teams were playing hard, and fortunately, we just had enough good plays and
stops at the right time.  
  
Q. Tony, when did you decide to start Mamadi? And how important was he
to that fast start and then rebounding back from that little run Oklahoma had
after you went up?  
TONY BENNETT: He started the second half against Gardner-Webb, and we thought,
well, Jack Salt is so physical, and we thought maybe he could play one-on-one
against Doolittle. But what we wanted to do offensively, I thought there was
some more scoring opportunities for how we were going to attack for Mamadi,
how to roll and get on the rim and make some plays. And then his quickness, I
thought might be a factor. That's the reason why, and that was planned on.  
  
I was mulling it over. I told him at the morning walk-through that my plan is
right now to start Mamadi, but I'm not 100 percent sure. So I had an out in
case I didn't start him, but that's how it played out.  
  
Q. Tony, you didn't mention him yet, but it seemed like Jay Huff gave
you a big lift in the first half.  
TONY BENNETT: Yes, absolutely. Terrific.  
  
Q. Two big baskets that got the crowd going and a couple of blocked
shots also defensively.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, absolutely, Jay, his length, he scrambled. He did a good
job defensively. His dunk, the three. That's what you need in these settings
for different guys to come in and step up. We know who our main three guys are
scoring, but you saw it from Mamadi and Jay and Kihei with big baskets and
timely plays. I was going to play Jay in the second half, but our defense was
going and the matchups were right, so I did it and he was phenomenal on the
bench. He's coming. His best basketball is there. He and Mamadi are continuing
to improve, but big lift from Jay.  
  
Q. I know you're going to enjoy this one, but have you thought ahead a
little bit to Louisville and a place you're familiar with, you've been to,
you've had some great moments there in that arena?  
TONY BENNETT: Not really. Just survive and advance. Now we go and play there.
I'm not even sure who we play, if that game's over or not. So we'll get to all
that stuff. But we will enjoy the pursuit of what we're doing.

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from Duke University, Zion Williamson and
R.J. Barrett. First question on the right, front row.  
  
Q. I'm actually going to hand you my cell phone. You guys create a lot
of highlights. I don't know if you'd seen that photo from last night and just
get your reaction to that photo if you take a look at it.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I think we both saw this photo a lot. It's something we both
do. We like to celebrate for each other, so whenever one of us gets it done,
you'll probably see the other one in the background jumping just as high as
him.  
  
Q. To that point, for both of you, what does that mean -- like what does
that photo mean to both of you? Because the other one everyone remembers is
Dwyane Wade and LeBron, when he threw the alley-oop up for LeBron, and Dwyane
Wade is already celebrating, and he can't even see LeBron throw it down. Take
us through just the connection you two have. It's almost like you're one
player on the court. You guys experience the same emotions. You have the same
energy, and you celebrate and enjoy each other's dunks, moves, points the same
way.  
R.J. BARRETT: It's cool. It's great. Definitely -- when we're winning and
making winning plays, just to see my brother out there doing his thing, doing
great, making a highlight, I've got to get excited. It's like that for all our
teammates. When someone makes a play, you've got to be excited for him.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Just like he said, it just brings energy to the table. We're
always happy to see each other do well and succeed. So when somebody makes a
big play, we don't even have to be on the court. We're going to celebrate.  
  
Q. Zion, if you've seen the picture, you may have seen this, too, from
Tacko Fall, the comment not allowing you to dunk on him, where he said I won't
allow it. I won't allow him to put me on one of his highlight tapes. Your
reaction to that?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: What is he supposed to say? Is he supposed to say like I'm
going to dunk on him? He said the right thing, but I'm not really focused on
that. I'm just focused on trying to help my team win the game.  
  
Q. On that note, regardless of what he said, he is a different kind of
player than you've seen all year. What is your impressions, kind of, what it's
going to be like playing against someone that tall and the kind of balance
between your strength and power and jumping and his just sort of raw height?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: He is a very unique player, and I got a lot of respect for
him because for him to be that size and be able to move the way he does and
have as much skill as he does, he's a great player. I think we're just going
to have to come together as a team and figure out what we're going to do to
try to stop him.  
  
Q. I'm curious, Zion, who the biggest player is that you've gone up
against in terms of height in your career. I don't know if you've faced
anybody that tall in high school? I know you've faced a few probably close to
7-footers in college. Is there anybody you've faced close to that height-wise,
like 7'6 "?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, just Florida State's big man, Koumadje.  
  
R.J. BARRETT: What is, is he like 7'4" or something?  
  
Q. You said he's got to say what he's got to say, but do you find when
you're matching up with guys, that they appreciate the challenge against you?
They want to show themselves off, and they use you as the stage to do that? Or
do you find guys are a little bit intimidated? Or is there a balance between
the two?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Nobody's going to be intimidated on the court. I mean, it's
not like he came out and just said it himself, like that's the media asking
him those questions. Like I said, he's not going to sit here and say, yeah,
he's going to dunk on me, like he's a competitor, so obviously, he's going to
say he's going to block my shot. Like that's just basketball.  
  
Q. Zion, you were asked the other day about sort of dealing with the
tension over the course of the season and how your parents have kind of
prepared you for that. So I was wondering, as the season has progressed, how
have you continued to lean on that support system, and how have you gotten
better as the season's gone on?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I've definitely gotten a lot better with it as the season's
gone on. Just having my parents and, obviously, Duke staff. They help a lot
with, I mean, handling the attention because it is Duke University. They've
been doing this longer than I've been born with this attention. I feel like
coming here was the best choice with handling the attention.  
  
Q. So last night Tre said that, yes, it was an exciting win, it was the
first win. He's taking all of his energy and focusing it on tomorrow. Are you
guys giving yourselves the opportunity to kind of enjoy at least the first win
or is it all just refocusing for tomorrow?  
R.J. BARRETT: I felt like last night was the time to enjoy that win. Now today
we just have practice preparing for tomorrow's game. We've got to take it one
game at a time, and we've got to look at what's ahead and not the past.  
  
Q. R.J. and Zion, it seems like the last couple weeks in the ACC
Tournament and last night, you guys have really struggled out of the gates.
What's been a common trend for you guys in getting out slowly in those games,
and what do you guys have to do to get out strong?  
R.J. BARRETT: I think teams really take it to us at the beginning, and we
really can't let that happen. We actually have to throw the first punch and
keep throwing punches throughout the game. We've just got to come out more
focused.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like he said, we've just got to come out more focused and
more prepared for what the team's going to throw at us because it's not like
we're only game planning against them. They're game planning against us, as
well. So I think it's just a matter of like on-time adjustments, like making
the read while it's happening.  
  
Q. Zion, I imagine that you heard about the sort of Zion Cam that was
being used for the game. I was wondering just what your thoughts were on
having something like that being used to kind of follow your action throughout
the night?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, I think one of the managers might have showed me that,
but I wasn't focused on that at all. I was just focused on trying to go out
there and help my team win.  
  
Q. Kind of to piggy-back off that a little bit, R.J., you came in as the
Number 1 recruit in the country and obviously have a very bright future ahead
of you. Has it been weird for you to kind of see the attention that's been on
Zion throughout the year? And do you think in some ways maybe it's been good
for you? Would you have been as comfortable with an R.J. Cam following you
around all day? Or do you think the roles that you kind of have been put into
have suited your personalities fairly well?  
R.J. BARRETT: I mean, it's been great. I wouldn't ask for this year to be any
different. I love -- I'm very happy that he gets all that attention and people
pay attention to him. That's not going to stop me from playing my game or
whatever. No, I mean, I'm just very happy to be in the position that I'm in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski.  
  
Q. Mike, you generally do not play your former players or coaches in
regular season games. I wonder if you could elaborate on why that is and what
does that make tomorrow's game against Johnny Dawkins?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Why would you want to? They're family. If you don't have to
play against him, I'm not going to do it. But this presents an opportunity for
both of us in a great setting. So both teams are winners.  
  
Johnny's done a fabulous job of establishing his program at Central Florida.
They're having an historical year. Once the game starts, I don't look at the
other sideline. So it's all about my team, just like when he played for me.  
  
Q. Zion, for how aggressive he is, how big he is, really doesn't get
into that much foul trouble. I'm curious, what's your take on that? Why is
that that he's so able to, one, control his body, but, two, also not do what
conventionally would be a foul the way he plays?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: God is good, and God gave him extraordinary ability but also
extraordinary intelligence on how to use the ability and a work ethic to blend
the two. He's a magnificent athlete, and people just look at it as jumping.
His lateral movement and his ability to move with speed and change directions
is phenomenal. So he avoids.  
  
He probably gets fouled a hell of a lot more than they're called. In fact, I
know he does, because he's able to finish. He's one-of-a-kind. He's just one-
of-a-kind, and he's going to keep getting better.  
  
I think the arena that he'll play in, like the stage that he plays in,
elevates that. So that's been elevated this year playing in our conference,
all the big games, playing the NCAA Tournament. And then when he goes pro, it
will be elevated. It will keep getting elevated, and he'll keep learning.  
  
Q. When you have a player like Zion who's garnered the spotlight, he has
the Zion Cam and everything else, how do you as a coach kind of help him
manage that over the course of the season and stay focused on the task at
hand?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He's very level-headed. None of that fazes him. He's all
about his team, really, and about winning.  
  
It's amazing, when people who are really good don't seek attention, they get
more. It's the people who don't necessarily have the ability, they seek
attention, and then they get pressured and all that. He doesn't seek
attention. He seeks winning and playing really well. He sees pure. He's pure,
bottom line.  
  
He's been amazing to coach and amazing to be his friend. He's got it all and
brought up the right way. He's got great parents and value system, everything.
It's remarkable, really.  
  
Q. Mike, when you have a player like Zion who does the things he does,
do you ever catch yourself --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You guys always say like Zion. Why don't you just say you
have a player named Zion. I don't have another player like Zion. If I did,
both of them would start, and we'd be really, really good.  
  
Q. That being said, do you ever catch yourself going into fan mode on
the bench sometimes --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, no, no.  
  
Q. \-- and thinking, wow, what a player?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No. My thing is to coach him. He came to Duke to be coached
and learn. And as he progresses, how we can not put a ceiling on him. Even
yesterday, we added something during the game that went real well because you
keep learning about a player, and that's how I like to coach is to keep
adjusting.  
  
Q. Two coaches on the staff at Central Florida, you got to coach. You
inherited Vince Taylor, you recruited Johnny Dawkins.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I would have recruited Vince Taylor, though.  
  
Q. I know you would. How important are they to you, and what did they do
for you in your early career at Duke?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: In Vince's case, we were going through an amazing transition
there. He was captain of my team, and we were 10-17, but I can remember in the
last game we're playing Wake Forest in the ACC Tournament. There are about
four people left in the Greensboro Coliseum, and he had 30-something points
and played his heart out. We've become great friends. I'm glad that he and
Johnny are together.  
  
And in Johnny's case, obviously, he was the start of us developing our program
at Duke. Our first great player, although in his class, there was another
great player, Mark Alarie. Don't let Bilas tell you that he was the other
great player, but he was a real good one. And then adding Amaker with
Henderson, it was just a great combination. His senior year, I'm not sure
we'll ever have a team of guys like we did in '86 where you have two head
coaches, Amaker and Dawkins. Alarie was a pro and is very successful. Bilas is
the best at what he does. Henderson is a scout for Cleveland. Billy King and
Danny Ferry have been -- Danny was an 18, 17-year pro, both of them GMs. Quin
Snyder is the head coach of Utah.  
  
What a collection of great guys who really understood the game. It's been all
uphill from then, but a really -- up mountain, let's put it that way.  
  
Q. I know Aubrey Dawkins spent some time, while Johnny was there, he'd
be in the gym with you guys. Do you have any memories of him being around when
he was a young kid?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Not really. Again, their family is really close to ours. In
fact, I think some of the family still lives in the Raleigh-Durham area. I
don't remember.  
  
Q. Were you able to follow his journey and talk to Johnny about him as
he went through high school?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Not really. You know, not really. I followed him once he went
to Michigan. I was amazed that he was not able to play for his dad at
Stanford. That's why we never recruited him. I thought -- come on. He should
be able to go there, but apparently, that didn't work out.  
  
Q. Real quick on Coach Dawkins again, 35 or 37 years ago, when you
recruited him, you were struggling a little bit early in your career.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: A lot, yeah.  
  
Q. Was he sort of the pied piper, hey, it's okay for elite players to go
to Duke?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's not as defined as it is today with recruiting and all
that. Basically, we have to put together a great class. We actually turned --
we did not accept two kids who wanted to commit to us at guard, and I just
held off for Johnny, and it worked out. And I can remember the first time I
saw him, it was in the Jelov (phonetic) League. They used to have an outdoor
league in D.C. I was there watching him, and I said, holy mackerel, this guy
can play. And a guy named Reginald Kitchen, he's an AAU coach in Northern
Virginia. He came up to me and said, are you the Duke coach? I said, yes, I
am. He said, there's a kid better than him in the next game. I said, you've
got to be kidding me.  
  
So I watched the next game, and it's Amaker. It was amazing that on that day,
I saw my -- one of the great backcourts in the history of the game, and I can
remember Alma Amaker in the stands. It's probably a recruiting violation, but
I just waved to her.  
  
(Laughter).  
  
Is there a limit? 30-something years? Maybe not for me. And I told Mrs.
Amaker, your son's going to look great in Duke Blue. The basketball gods were
good for me that day. It was a sunny day, and I saw my backcourt.  
  
Q. Since you're talking recruiting and you're here in the state of South
Carolina --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I wasn't talking recruiting. I was talking about two of my
great players.  
  
Q. Right. The popular thinking back when Zion was going through the
process here in the state was Clemson looked very strong with him and even
leading up to his announcement day. So I'm wondering with you, can you recall
maybe a turning point in the recruiting?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, there's not -- no. I don't want to talk about recruiting.
We recruited him hard, and I think Zion always had a love for Duke. There's so
much that's said about recruiting on a day-to-day basis that doesn't have much
substance. All the things with Zion and his family were substantive. So we
never looked at it as being in a race or anything like that. It was just keep
developing a relationship with him.  
  
Q. Mike, should the NCAA put some protections in place for the kids who
jump at the G League $125,000 this summer?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Let's just wait until all that is -- all that isn't ironed
out yet. All the parties, they haven't met, and they haven't done it. Let's
give them an opportunity to do that.  
  
Q. And will you give your reflections on the one-and-done, which will
officially end but not be --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: The one-and-done is not going to end because, even if kids
come out of high school, there will still be kids who go to college for a year
who will leave after a year. So the early entry into the pros is not going
away. It just will be added that the early entry will include high school
players.  
  
But like one-and-done hasn't hurt college basketball. It's helped college
basketball. How many questions are there of Zion today? Come on. The more
talent, the more good players, and really the more -- you're not going to see
everybody just jump at that because going to college and being in all these
unbelievable programs around the country, at the schools, there's a maturation
process that takes -- that goes on both on and off the court that an 18-year-
old needs. In some respects, a 17-year-old needs. And they're much better
prepared with any amount of time they spend in college.  
  
That's not just to say financially. Part of going to the pros is not just
getting into the pros, it's staying in the pros, and you're not going to stay
in the pros unless you've got balance and you've got maturity. So you'd better
be careful that you don't just jump. You take advantage of what our
institutions have to offer and the great programs around the country have to
offer.  
  
Q. Coach, you know better than maybe anybody how important --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Don't say that, please.  
  
Q. How important leadership it.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Someone's going to say Coach K said he knew better than
anybody.  
  
Q. Well, you know how important leadership is, especially this time of
year. How have you seen somebody like Javin take to that role?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Javin's been excellent because he's improved -- I think it's
helped him improve as a player. A big part of when you have a lot of talent in
a freshman class is for the upperclassmen not to feel inferior, not to feel
less, and where they feel secure about what they do. Our freshmen have been
great about that. They're secure. And our upperclassmen have developed that.
We have a really great unit.  
  
But it doesn't just happen. It happens because those kids work together and
make each other feel that good. Just watching us at team meals and stuff like
that, everybody's sitting with everybody. Just little things. Last night, they
were having something to eat, and they were coming down at a little bit
different times, and one table had one seat available, and Antonio was sitting
at another table, not all the guys were there. Marques came down, and all of a
sudden he's getting ready to sit down. He saw Antonio, and, boom, he went to
that table. So you may think that's a little thing. It's not a little thing.
Our guys just have done that naturally, and it's been beautiful.  
  
We've loved being with this group. They've been sensational every day.  
  
Q. Coach, you coached against Johnny about four years ago in a Coaches
vs. Cancer game. I wonder if you have any memories of that game.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't even remember it, to be quite frank. What day is
today?  
  
Q. I was going to ask if the emotions of that day will be similar to
what's going to happen tomorrow.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: My wife didn't give me my name tag. I'm sorry. Once the game
starts, it doesn't matter who I'm coaching against, really. And then once it's
over, I don't have a rearview mirror. I'm on to the next thing. I don't even
remember it. I think we won. Did we win? Yeah. Thank you.  
  
Again, I've coached a lot of games, man. If I start trying to remember all of
them -- there's only so much space, mind space, especially as we get older.  
  
Q. Mike, what's Jack White's availability for tomorrow?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We don't think he's going to play. He had a decent workout
today with band work and that. He'll try it out probably and warm up, but I
don't think so. But Marques came out really well from yesterday's game. I
thought he did a good job, especially guarding. They have a lot of shooters.  
  
Q. Is game planning for Tacko Fall any different than maybe game
planning for the Florida State guys when you see them?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, because Florida State's -- they're both big teams, but
they play different styles, and how Leonard uses his big men, both of them,
and Kabengele is a lot different. But I think it's helped playing against
Koumadje, but Fall is stronger, bigger, and they go to him more, and he really
just takes up the paint. He does a great job.  
  
Johnny's team plays excellent defense whether he's in or not. They're a
veteran defensive team.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from Oklahoma, Jamal Bieniemy, Kristian
Doolittle, Christian James, Brady Manek.  
  
Q. Christian James, can you talk about playing a big role on the Final
Four team and sort of your mindset at that point thinking this is going to
happen every year and all those things, and then three years later, you
finally got another NCAA Tournament victory, and just the frustrations of
fighting through what you -- I assume you sort of expected was going to happen
a lot.  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Definitely coming in as a freshman, you don't know how hard
it is on a collegiate level to make it into the Final Four. My freshman year,
I thought we were going to go every year. It's definitely a lot harder than it
looks. I'm having great guard play and just great players on my freshman team.  
  
We had some struggles my sophomore year and my junior year, but I'm just doing
what it takes. Just hard work and dedication. I'm locking in every game. Have
to take every game seriously. I feel like this team -- we have a pretty good
team. We can do that. I feel like we can go on a big run. We got a lot of work
ahead, though.  
  
Q. This is for Brady. The numbers would indicate that yesterday was your
best -- the team's best offensive game of the season. Did you as a player
perceive it as such?  
BRADY MANEK: Yeah, I think so. I think yesterday was probably the most fun
we've had as a team. I mean, we came out, and we hit them first. Everybody
contributed, whether it was find an open guy or knocking down shots. I think
everybody played a really big role in yesterday's victory.  
  
Q. I guess this is for any of you all. Do you -- in a region that has, I
think, three double-digit seeds left, and y'all are the 9 seed here, do you
feel like a Cinderella at all because you've got to take on the top seed
tomorrow?  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: No. We expect to be in this position. That's what we worked
for all season, and we kept chipping away. That's just our expectation.  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Like Jamal said, we've worked hard. We worked hard all year
just to get to this point. I don't want to say a Cinderella story, but we've
worked hard, and we kind of expect to be in this situation. We just want to
take it one game at a time, lock in and focus. When the lights come on, we
just want to show up.  
  
BRADY MANEK: I don't think we want to take anybody lightly. Just we know what
we have to do. Now we have to bring energy like we did yesterday and just play
hard and play together.  
  
Q. Brady and Christian, UVA is a pack line defense. Everyone knows about
it. They play to keep teams out of the paint. You guys have a really strong
inside-out game. What do you think about that system, and what's the key to
maybe competing against that system?  
BRADY MANEK: I think just moving the ball, finding the open guy, finding a
possible mismatch here and there, just doing small things correctly and
hopefully getting better results.  
  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: You're asking me? Moving the ball, like Brady said, inside
and out, just being able to make the right play, not really forcing the issue,
like we did the other day. Being able to just take the right shot and just
trusting the offense that we have set in stone for the game.  
  
Q. This is for Christian James. Christian, Virginia is ranked among the
top ten nationally in defensive efficiency, but so too are Texas Tech and
Kansas State, teams you're very familiar with. As f.  
You have studied Virginia -- I don't know how much you've gotten into yet --
but do you see any similarities between UVA and, perhaps, Texas Tech and/or
Kansas State, especially on the defensive end?  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Most definitely. They're both long teams, very long, and they
play with great help defense. When we penetrate, they do a great job of
swarming to the ball. That's something that they have in similarities and
things like that. They're great teams, great teams. We've been watching them.
We've been studying them. Like Brady said, we just have to move the ball and
find the right guy, find the open man.  
  
Q. Christian James, you guys are a senior-dominated team. The four up
there, you're the only senior. Do you find yourself as a senior being more
desperate when you reach the NCAA Tournament, realizing, hey, this is my last
chance? Got a bigger sense of urgency maybe than you did before your senior
year?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Most definitely. Most definitely. Last year and my sophomore
year, I was really frustrated. We made it to the tournament last year, but it
kind of hurt me a lot. Just looking forward and being in a situation again, I
don't want to take anything for granted. Being a senior on this team, just
making plays or just getting somebody else going, that's really big for our
team because we have a lot of great players. I just want to come out and do
whatever I can just to get a win.  
  
The energy has to be there, and I'll make sure my team is ready to play.  
  
Q. Brady, three of the last four games, you got 22, 21, and 18 points.
What's the reason for your game sort of accelerating to such consistent high
production?  
BRADY MANEK: I think just having guys like Jamal on the court with me, find an
open guy, having other threats on the court, too. They can't just face guard
me the whole time. They have other guys on this court to be threats on the
offensive end. I think just everybody having their confidence up. We played
well yesterday.  
  
Going back to the Texas and Kansas games, everybody really had their
confidence high, and I think that plays a big part in how everybody and myself
score like that.  
  
Q. This is for any one of you guys who would care to answer. If they
didn't look so much alike, would you know that the two Coach Krugers are
related just in the way they act or the way they interact?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I mean, Kev has his own personality. We call Coach
Kruger's son Kev because they're both Krug. Kev has his own personality. He's
a young guy, so we have side conversations with him all the time. Big Krug
been through it all, so he's speaking from experience whenever he's telling us
something. We can relate to Kev whenever we're just sitting around talking or
chilling. But to answer your question, I mean, that's kind of tough. I'm
pretty sure Big Krug was just the way Kev is when he was younger. So it's kind
of hard.  
  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: I spent a lot of time with Coach Kev, and I can definitely see
some similarities, and I can see Coach Kruger acting like Kev when he was
younger.  
  
Q. For Christian James, it looks as if you had that five-game losing
streak, went to TCU, got the win. What kind of turning point was that in your
season?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: It was huge for us. We went on a losing streak, and we went
to their place and got a win, so that was big for us just to go get an away
game just to get our momentum rolling again.  
  
Q. Brady, what was missing during the five-game losing streak? Why did
that happen, and what's better now?  
BRADY MANEK: I don't know. I just think we had a few close ones, and then they
kind of brought us down, and getting that TCU win brought us back up. I think
just our confidence level was kind of low at the time, and I think winning a
few games got it back up and led to where we are now.  
  
Q. For Kristian Doolittle, want to get your impressions on Virginia's
bigs, in particular Mamadi Diakite, and what kind of challenges he brings on
the defensive end?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Can you say their names again?  
  
Q. Mamadi Diakite, 25.  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: That's better. The Coach was telling us today all their
bigs are tall and long. They read the post on every post touch, whether it be
the bigs or guards. Passing the ball around would be very tough. Being able to
throw around hands. With that said, we have to make them pay for doubling, so
just making the right play and knocking down shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Oklahoma head coach Lon Kruger. We'll start questioning on the
right-hand side.  
  
Q. Coach, I was talking to your son about the experience of playing for
you, working for you. I'm just curious, as a coach who's seen all that it
entails in the business, did you want Kevin to go into coaching after
basketball, and what has that experience been like?  
LON KRUGER: It's been a great experience. What he chose to do, as any parent,
you want your kids to be happy and enjoy what they do. I'm not disappointed
that he decided to do that for sure. Surely, it was his decision. But it's
been great, from the time as a player, when a young guy or daughter leaves
home after high school, you really don't expect to be around them on a daily
basis ever again, perhaps, and we've been blessed with the opportunity to
spend a lot of time together since he graduated from high school and graduated
from Arizona State when he came back as a fifth-year grad to UNLV and now back
on the staff. So it's fantastic. You can't beat it.  
  
Q. Coach, Kihei Clark for Virginia yesterday was very active in terms of
chasing loose balls, getting steals, getting rebounds. What have you seen from
him so far, and how do you prepare for a player like that who's so active?  
LON KRUGER: He's engaged in everything. Like you say, he's active defensively.
He's alert. All the players do a great job of being alert, focused on each
possession. He keys a lot of things they do offensively. Terrific leader for
them, it appears. Does a good job on both ends.  
  
Q. Lon, how has the recruiting of international guys changed since you
first became a college coach?  
LON KRUGER: Back then, it was probably rare to have a foreign player on the
team. Now, it seems like a majority of teams have at least one from outside
the country. So just the numbers of foreign players have changed a lot. I
think the technology, the video, the information that's available today on
foreign players is much greater than it was 40 years ago for sure.  
  
Q. Do you find yourself recruiting them more through that technology, or
do you get out and get feet on the ground and go see those guys? How do you do
it?  
LON KRUGER: Usually, it's the technology. You get video on someone, and you're
intrigued, and maybe you have an international competition or you may catch
them when they're touring the United States. We did that with Matt Freeman. We
saw some video, and he was playing an event in Vegas actually that we watched
him four or five summers ago and liked him more. Usually starts with a video,
though, on someone that gives us a heads-up on someone.  
  
Q. Coach, you competed against Dick Bennett back when you were both in
the Big Ten. As you study Virginia on film, do you see Dick Bennett in what
Tony Bennett does?  
LON KRUGER: Tony does -- he's got his own standpoint for everything he does,
but certainly, how difficult it is to score, the great job they do
defensively. His dad's teams are always like that. So maybe a little bit
different style in a way, but still the difficulty in playing against him is
very similar for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, Virginia is known for its pack line defense. What have you
seen out of the defense, and have you faced anyone this year that you can
compare their defense to?  
LON KRUGER: They're very, very good. Not many people as good in the country as
they are. Probably out of our league, the two teams that are a little bit pack
line, very, very tough to score on. Texas Tech, Kansas State, probably reminds
you more in preparation than any other teams, and we had trouble scoring on
those teams. So we've got to improve for tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you're approaching tomorrow's game, do you kind of play the
psychological angle that, hey, you're the 9 seed, you can be Cinderella, or do
you go at it, hey, you play in the Big 12. You play teams like this all the
time, and we'll just have at it.  
LON KRUGER: Combination probably of the two. We want to play. We want to be
aggressive. We want to attack. We want to be dictating. We try to go into
every ball game thinking that way. Certainly we've played a lot of good teams
in the Big 12, and Virginia is every bit as good as them based on the
rankings. So, yeah, we'll go in, swing away and go ahead and try to do the
best things that give us the best chance to be effective.  
  
Q. Couple more on your son real quickly. He mentioned that earlier in
your career you were not a guy to sit. Your demeanor on the sideline has
changed. Is that older, wiser? What's behind that?  
LON KRUGER: I don't know if it's -- I don't think about how it's changed
necessarily. But, yeah, probably -- I don't know about the wiser part,
certainly the older part for sure.  
  
Q. In terms of your relationship away from the court and away from -- do
you have to guard against being too much Oklahoma basketball with him and
trying to have some other -- or do you -- is every family dinner Oklahoma
basketball related?  
LON KRUGER: I think a good mixture. Certainly, when you start the season in
early October, there really aren't any days off until it ends in April. So
it's kind of just every coach's life. I don't know that you ever go through a
day not thinking about basketball and talking about basketball. So there's
certainly a blend of that. But there's a lot of other interest, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, the numbers would indicate that yesterday was your team's best
offensive performance of the season, if not going back even farther. From a
coach's more critical eye, was that indeed the case?  
LON KRUGER: Probably one of the top ones for sure. Three weeks ago, probably
Kansas had a really good, similar type performance against Kansas in Norman or
had a good margin throughout the game and kind of played for 40 minutes. I
thought yesterday the key was being able to sustain it for 40 minutes. Getting
off to such a great start, and they made a little run to start the second
half. Then we scored quickly right on the heels of their run and kind of
widened the margin back out.  
  
I thought the guys were really focused for 40 minutes and took good care of
the ball, and shot selection was good. Like the guys mentioned, moved the ball
well and trusted each other and made good plays.  
  
Q. Christian James, I believe, was on your Final Four team as a
freshman. How much have you leaned on him this season for leadership?
Specifically in this tournament environment, how much do you lean on him to
kind of guide the younger guys?  
LON KRUGER: We've got seven or eight seniors. It's a case where collectively
they do a good job, Christian being one of them. He's played a big role for us
all year long, he's made big shots for us. I thought he really had a good game
yesterday, not just offensively, but his focus and engagement on the defensive
end and rebounding the ball and just the complete game, I thought, was really
good from him yesterday.  
  
Q. Coach, 25-year anniversary of your Final Four team at Florida. What
do you remember about that team? What did you learn from that team? Sort of
just the legacy of that team?  
LON KRUGER: It was a great group of young guys. I think probably the biggest
thing is they really trusted each other. I think they really respected the
abilities, expected one another to take care of the responsibilities. They
really came together as the year developed, a lot of confidence out of the
group, great leadership out of Dan Cross and Andrew DeClercq, Dametri Hill,
Brian Thompson, Craig Brown -- you go down the list a long way. They were very
secure with themselves and trusted each other and enjoyed playing together.  
  
Q. Lon, your teams have always run really great offense, even through
the period of time when things got really difficult to move. So I'm wondering,
now that we're like three or four years into the freedom of movement thing,
sort of really going at it from the rules standpoint; what you've thought of
that initiative and whether you think it's effective in making the game more
attractive.  
LON KRUGER: I think the intentions are great. I think people want to see
movement. They want to see scoring. I think it opened up a little bit. I don't
know that we've fully maximized on our goals. It's tough to score in the low
post, all the physicalness of that. I think that's why you see more people
going to the three-point shot. It's such a higher percentage shot. It takes a
really skilled guy to score in the low post with all the contact that occurs
on every shot. I think that's not necessarily healthy for the game. I think we
would like to maybe get back to re-examining where we're at and where we want
to go and maybe try to clean it up even a little bit more.  
  
Today a guy keeps his hands back, he can do pretty much anything he wants with
his body, in the low post especially. There's a lot of walking under, a lot of
moving into guys as they shoot the ball. So it makes it a tough to score in
there.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at Ty Jerome and the way he sort of commands
things offensively and defensively, what challenges does he present? And
specifically, his willingness to take threes from just inside of the half-
court line, how does that enter into your defensive plan?  
LON KRUGER: He's terrific. Like you said, he can score from deep. He can get
in the paint and score. He's very, very good with ball screens and making
plays, finding big guys. He just puts the pressure on the defense all the time
because he sees the floor. He's got great vision, great imagination. Really a
good player.  
  
Q. Lon, you mentioned the difficulty about scoring in the post. When you
look at Virginia's bigs, particularly Mamadi Diakite, what do you see out of
him and the challenges that he presents?  
LON KRUGER: He's terrific. He's long, rangy in there. They've got great poise
when they catch it inside. He did a great job last night of catching it a
couple times in a crowd and just collecting himself and letting the defense
kind of make a mistake and then score. And, again, Hunter's great. Salt brings
a different dimension to it. So their big guys are good.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

### [Tacko Fall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30561)

### [Aubrey Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28523)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from the University of Central Florida,
Aubrey Dawkins, Tacko Fall, and B.J. Taylor. We'll open the questions from the
floor at this time.  
  
Q. B.J., I wonder if there was any talk this morning about the game last
night at all.  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, we went over some of the things we did good against VCU,
some of the things we did bad, and we moved on to our next opponent. That's
our main focus right now is getting ready for the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for B.J. or Tacko. If you didn't know that Aubrey was Coach
Dawkins' son, like how would you describe kind of the relationship of father
and son? Do you guys see it strictly as coach and player, or can you tell at
points that it's father-son?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, he's -- I see them not really as a father and son, but as
a player and coach. Obviously, he coaches him really hard, like he do for the
rest of us, and he treat him the same way that he treat all of us. I would say
basically pretty much all of us are his sons, the way I see it.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, what Tacko said pretty much. I mean, to add, Aubrey is such
a good person and such a good teammate, that he makes it easy to just like be
one of the guys and just fit in with us because of his personality and just
how he is and how he approaches every day.  
  
Q. Off that, Aubrey, what's your favorite thing about playing for your
father, and how has that dynamic kind of evolved over time?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: The best part is building our relationship. And now being a
young man in this game and having the ability -- or having the chance to be
around him at this stage in my life and my career in basketball has just been
priceless. That's what I love most, just going every day next to him and
learning from him and us getting closer as a father and son and also as a
player and coach.  
  
Q. Tacko, it seemed like last night you were maybe having some fun with
the idea that Zion might try to dunk on you in the game tomorrow. In here
earlier, he said, he kind of had fun with it too, and he said what are you
supposed to say? Do you feel like he is going to try to go at you just to
prove a point because you're the tallest player he's ever played against?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, I don't know. I don't know what his mindset is, so I
cannot speak for him, but I can speak for myself. I'm just going to go out
there and try to win the ball game and do everything I can to help my team win
the ball game. Basketball plays are going to happen. I'm going to be out there
and be aggressive and be the protector that I am. Zion is obviously a very
talented kid, great kid. I've seen nothing but positive things about him, and
great high ceiling too. And he also has great teammates, great bunch of kids,
but he's going to do his job, and I'm going to do my job, and whatever happens
happens.  
  
Q. Aubrey, you played at Michigan before you came here. Then you joined
a team with a unique player like Tacko. Did you have to relearn or adjust to
what he does to both the opposing team and how he changes your team as well?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: He just makes the game easier, which is -- that's all I can
really say. You have a guy back there that you can trust to block shots if you
get beat on the drive or a guy that's going to score 75 percent field goal
percentage at the basket. It's nice to have that, nice comfort back there.  
  
Q. Aubrey, as much affection as you know your dad has for Duke and Coach
K, do you think he'll do anything? How do you think this matchup is affecting
him, if at all?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Not -- he's a game-by-game kind of guy. Same mentality whoever
we play. The name on the jersey doesn't really matter to him. Just play our
game and focus on the win. That's really it. Yeah.  
  
Q. Aubrey, going off that, do you have any memories of -- I know you
used to spend time with him when he was a coach at Duke and being around the
team. Do you have any memories from any specific teams or any specific players
that you grew up with?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Yeah, I spent a lot of time around the guys, especially
growing up. Chris Duhon, Dahntay Jones, all kinds of players I can list off.
And just seeing them as I worked out and worked out in the gym after practice
was done or working out in the college gym. So, yeah, a lot of good memories.
It was good for my foundation to see that.  
  
Q. This is for all the players. You already made history. This was UCF's
first NCAA win. Does that kind of -- do you get to play a little looser now, a
little freer? What's the mentality going into this matchup?  
B.J. TAYLOR: It's the same mentality we've had for every game this season, to
just try to go 1-0. That's my focus for this game and the same focus we have
for every game.  
  
TACKO FALL: Same thing he was saying, we just try to go 1-0. Obviously, we
made it that far sticking to our principle, so why change it? We're just going
to keep the same mentality and move on.  
  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Yeah, what they said, just try and get a win as best we can.
Whatever we can do to get that win is the goal. Focus on our principles and
what we stick to and let the rest take care of itself.  
  
Q. For B.J., you're one game into your NCAA Tournament run now, and
you're playing one of the most storied programs in basketball history, five
National Championships, all the attention that Duke has gotten. How do you
approach that? And is it a little staggering to think what you face
tomorrow?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I mean, for us, like I said, we're going to approach it the same
way we've approached every game this season. Coach does a great job of making
us treat every game like it's a championship game, making us treat every game,
no matter who we're playing, like it's the biggest game of the season. So
we're prepared for this, and now it's just about going out there and
executing.  
  
Q. Tacko, you guys, this is your first time in the NCAA Tournament as a
group. So is there a difference in the attention paid? Does it change anything
about going through and preparing for the game and going through the game?  
TACKO FALL: We've been preparing for this moment all season. So nothing has
changed. We've been taking the championship approach to everything that we've
been doing so that, when times like this come, we will be ready. So nothing
has changed from how we approach things. We've been following the same
process, just following the coach's plan, and just taking care of business.  
  
Q. Tacko, what are the keys to using your height advantage to make sure
that you don't end up on any Zion Williamson highlight reel?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, obviously, I'm a great defensive player, but I just don't
want that game to be about me and Zion. Obviously, it's very exciting. You got
a guy who's 7'6". You got a guy who's a freak athlete, very talented. But at
the end of the day, it's a ball game. It's basketball. We can't make it bigger
than what it really is. I don't want it to be like a freak show between Zion
and I. It's bigger than that. It's UCF versus Duke. They have great players,
talented guys. We have also great players, very experienced, talented guys,
and we're going to go out there and do whatever we can to win the ball game.  
  
Q. B.J., so what would it mean to this program, to the team, to you if
you guys do win tomorrow?  
B.J. TAYLOR: It would mean a lot. That's our focus. That's what we're here to
do. Everybody is here to win. So like I said, before we get to that, we're
just getting ready for practice today and just trying to prepare to make that
happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach Johnny Dawkins with the University of Central
Florida. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. During the season, how often do you and Mike Krzyzewski on average
talk? And when was your last conversation prior to the tournament?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, we're always going to be in touch. That's just going to
happen. I can't say the frequency, but we're always in touch. Probably the
last time, formal conversation, I want to say probably two weeks ago maybe or
less. So we had a good conversation somewhere around then, just talking about
one of our wins. He called and just kind of caught up with him, he caught up
with what we were doing.  
  
Of course, we follow each other's progress and see how each other's team is
playing and stuff. So I would say quite frequently.  
  
Q. How do you process the many ties that your team has to the Duke
program? You played there. Vince played there. Your son grew up around the
program. What kind of impact will it have on this game, and what kind of
impact will it have on how you prepare for this game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: For us, having been a part of the Duke family, of course, it
was special. We all realized that. We all felt fortunate to be a part of it.
We all felt fortunate to play for Coach and work for Coach in my case. For my
son, growing up in Durham, that was special. He was always around the team,
always in the gym working out afterwards, so I'm sure it's a unique feeling
for him as well.  
  
It's one of those things where, for all of us, it's -- like I said, it's
awkward, too, because you don't feel -- it's someone that you've worked for,
you're very close with. Like I said before, no one looks forward to that type
of situation. It's something that happens because we're in the tournament and
it means we've done well because we're all moving forward, but it's not
something you look forward to.  
  
Q. There may be elements of what Jeff asked you to this question too.
Obviously, there's been a ton of water under the bridge, and you're colleagues
and friends now, but is there still a part of you that is like Johnny Dawkins
the freshman who showed up to Duke and he was your coach?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: That's always there. He'd probably put me on the line now, and
I'll probably start running suicides. That's just part -- once someone's
coached you, they're your coach for the rest of your life. That's how it is. I
have, of course, the utmost respect for Coach and his program. Like I said, I
was a part of it and loved it, and I love Coach. So that's easy.  
  
Q. You went through this at Stanford a few years ago when you guys
played Duke up in Brooklyn. Does that take away some of the awkwardness that
you've been through this before? Do you draw on that experience as far as
being able to set all that stuff aside and approach the game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, I think it does help some that we've done this once before
where we were in this environment. It's still the same. You still don't relish
it, but it's still something you've already experienced. You understand
everything that's kind of -- that will be around this. That's a good thing for
me, and I'm sure the same thing for Coach. He's done it with several former
players before. I had never done it with Coach until that time. So it was good
to kind of understand what that was all about.  
  
Q. Johnny, you said the other day you hadn't had a lot of chance to
watch the Duke guys play. I assume that you've watched a bunch more film now
in preparation. What do you think of Zion and R.J. and Cam and the rest?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Very impressive. They don't play like freshmen. Really, really
talented young men. And I've seen a lot of freshmen over the course of my
career, of course, that have been talented. They have a certain will about
them. They have a certain togetherness about them that oftentimes only happens
with maturity and playing a lot of games together. I watch them. They seem to
have fun playing together, making each other better on the floor. A lot of
times with young players, finding that chemistry is difficult. They seem to
have found that. I think that's why they're having so much success.  
  
Q. Specifically on Zion, how do you prepare to guard a guy like him?
When you watch the tape, I assume you've seen four or five of his games. He's
playing extremely well those games you watched. How do you prepare for a guy
like him with his size? You obviously know what you have at the rim with
Tacko, but outside of the painted area, how do you prep for that?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We have to understand that he's a great player on any level.
His skill set with his size and his explosiveness makes him unique. You're not
going to stop Zion. We don't go in, we're going to stop Zion. No, we want to
try to contain a player like that, and that's a success for you if you can try
to just contain him because he's going to find ways to score the basket. He's
going to find ways to make spectacular plays. He's done it all his life.  
  
We have to understand that we can't let that be a distraction to what we do.  
  
Q. Johnny, what are the challenges and the rewards of getting a chance
to coach your son? I'm not talking about in Pee Wee ball or AAU, but high
Division I basketball.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's been really special. I didn't know what to expect. I've
said this often. I really had no desire to coach him early on because I'd
worked with him every single day. We'd be in the gym after I finished work at
Duke. I'd bring him to the gym, and we trained, and when I was at Stanford,
the same thing. So we've done that pretty much all his life. So like I said,
the last thing I wanted to do, if we're doing this every single day, and now
I'm going to grab you and coach you. So I kind of avoided it. Just the timing
worked out where we could get together.  
  
The time was right, and I think he was ready as far as where his maturity
level was. I was ready where my career was. And it's been terrific. Other
coaches had told me, Steve Alford being one of the main ones, Ray McCallum,
another coach. They all said, you get a chance to coach your son, you should
do that. That always kind of stuck with me as I was coaching in my college
career when he was of age. When the opportunity presented itself, we did it,
and they were absolutely right. I've enjoyed every moment of it. It's really
been special.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it was 37, 38 years ago, but can you recall why you
chose Duke when Duke was struggling at the time when you could have gone
anywhere?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, absolutely. A few reasons. One, of course, Coach K. He
hadn't accomplished what he's accomplished now. He's arguably the greatest
college coach to coach our game, but back then I still had a belief in who I
thought he could become. He painted a really good vision for us as a team,
what he thought we could do. He painted a great vision for me, what he thought
my career could be like. So that trust in him, that person was important.  
  
And they did a great job recruiting. They spent a large amount of time
recruiting me, you know, years of developing relationships. It wasn't
something just happened that first year on a whim; they started recruiting me,
and all of a sudden, I'm going to go to Duke. It was years of recruiting. That
was a great commitment.  
  
So with his commitment, with Duke University being the institution that it
was, they made me feel real comfortable. They made me feel it was the right
decision.  
  
Q. Coach, do you get a sense of how your team, not only facing in a
tournament game, but facing the tournament's Number 1 overall seed, the Number
1 team in the country. Do you get a sense of how your team is sort of
attracted to that kind of challenge?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I think my team will come out with a sense of maturity. I
think they'll come out with a focus. And that's where they've been all year.
They've come out, and they've competed against everyone we've played against,
and that's, I think, largely because of the leadership. Our senior leaders,
guys that have been around. They've demanded that from all of our players. I
think they'll continue to lead the same way they have all season.  
  
Q. Yesterday Collin Smith played eight minutes. I wonder what you said
to him after the game and what you really need from him in this game
tomorrow.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, Collin -- every game is different. We found something
that worked well for us during the game versus VCU, and when something's
working well for you like that -- and we've done this during other games
during the season. I'm sure you know that, where minutes may be divvied out
differently, but based on our opponent and what's working well for us. So it
was a night where things were working better for us, so we stuck with those.  
  
Collin is always a player that we believe in, and we know he can make huge
contributions for us. So just based on personnel basically, and that decision
was made.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like the last few games Frank Bertz has really
contributed coming off the bench late. Last night had a couple of threes and a
couple of big offensive rebounds. Talk about what he brings to tomorrow
night's matchup and coming off the bench for you guys late like that.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: As much as he contributes making threes, I just love his
energy and his effort. He makes a lot of winning basketball plays, a lot of
plays that can kind of go unnoticed. He'll make threes, and everyone sees him
knocking down and getting points.  
  
I just love his overall game. He plays with great energy. He plays the right
way. He plays to win.  
  
Q. Johnny, having grown up in Mike's system, is there any advantage to
you tomorrow knowing the way they like to run their sets or the way they do
things?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's different from when I was there coaching and when I was
there playing for him. As you know, Coach is -- he's the master of adapting to
change and times. I was there over a decade ago. This game has changed so much
since then. Coach has adapted to that. How they play now and the schemes they
use aren't the same schemes they used when I was coaching there and definitely
not the same schemes when I played for him.  
  
He's changed a lot. I've been watching a lot of tape, of course, all last
night and this morning. It's a different team. They're different players he's
coaching, and there's a different style he's utilizing to bring the most out
of those guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
COLUMBIA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBIA)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes from Virginia, Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome.  
  
Q. Both of you guys can take a shot at answering this. You're pretty
aware of guys that have come before you in the UVA program and what they've
accomplished and been able to do. In terms of your group, if you're able to
have a deep run in this tournament, what do you think that would be for your
legacy, and where do you think you guys would fit in?  
TY JEROME: Just to be in the same boat or be able to be mentioned with those
guys is a huge honor, and we're extremely thankful for that, all the wins
we've been able to achieve. But we're not really worried about entertaining
that right now. For us, it's just about trying to do everything we can for our
team. We just want to play with this group more and more, and we have to win
to be able to do that. We just want to win for us and for the coaches and
Coach Bennett really.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, we can come back to that conversation when our careers are
over. We've got more important things on our mind right now. Like Ty said, to
be mentioned with Malcolm, Joe Harris, and guys that are excelling in the
league or guys making money professionally or whatever they're doing is truly
an honor.  
  
Q. I know it's embarrassing, Kyle, asking Ty to talk about you. The
other day Kyle said he invited himself to your house when you were in high
school for the All-Star Game. You said he started following you on social
media. Kyle seems to be a unique guy in a lot of ways. He helped a guy up
yesterday, he'll congratulate people on the other team if they beat you guys.
Have you met many guys like him, and what's it like to have him as a friend?  
TY JEROME: First of all, we're teammates, not friends. Strictly teammates. It
stops there (laughter). Yeah, he's really unique, and one of the best things
about him is how confident he is in his own skin. He's not really worried
about a lot of people's opinions. He's really confident. He can annoy you a
lot, but honestly, he doesn't care really. He's super confident on and off the
court. He's funny. He's fun to be around. He's just a really unique person,
like you said, and it's fun to be around somebody who isn't worried about the
outside world.  
  
KYLE GUY: Thanks, man.  
  
Q. Kyle, how much college basketball do you watch on television during
the season? How well do you know teams at Oklahoma's level?  
KYLE GUY: We're definitely a basketball junkie group. We watch basketball
together all the time. It's kind of how we bond off the court. Playing cards
and watching basketball is what we do. We got a chance to watch Oklahoma in
Battle For Atlantis, obviously, because they were there. We've watched teams
from all over. We know they're a good team and I'm looking forward to playing
them.  
  
Q. Kyle, with a night to sleep on it, is it a relief to have finally
gotten that first round out of the way? Do you still have that pressure on you
from the fact that with all the high seeds Virginia's had the last several
years, they haven't made it to a Final Four?  
KYLE GUY: I would say the outside world is always going to try to put pressure
on you. Sometimes you can find yourself putting pressure on yourself. But
we're just trying to have -- Coach was referencing the Friday Night Lights,
"clear eyes, full hearts." So just trying to focus on what's important. We got
out of the first round my freshman year. Last year we weren't as fortunate.
This year we got the job done. So just looking forward to playing Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Kyle, I know you've mentored Kihei a little this year. Was what he
was able to do yesterday on defense, chasing after loose balls, getting
rebounds, steals, sort of a good example of the value he brings to you guys?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, he may not be scoring the most points every night, but he's a
very valuable player on this team. The little things he does is kind of Isaiah
Wilkins-esque. Obviously, he's not as big as anybody on the court, but he does
some things that -- you know, picking up full court for 33 games now, you
don't see me doing that. So he's a selfless player, and he doesn't care about
stats, and he does a lot of little things that help us win.  
  
Q. For both you guys, going back to some of those players who have come
before you, was there anybody early in your career and/or now that you stay in
touch with who's had a big influence on you in terms of the guys who came
before?  
TY JEROME: I stay in touch with everybody that we've played with, even the
guys that transferred, like Marial, D.T., Darius Thompson. So I stay in touch
with everyone really. I still speak to Devon almost every day. I speak to
London all the time, Isaiah all the time. We have a relationship with all
those guys who have left.  
  
And then even the guys we haven't played with, like Malcolm and Joe and
Justin, I spent weekends with them, too. So our alumni base, basically
everyone reaching back and wanting to see all of us succeed is great.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, that's one of the special things about this program is how all
the former players really just buy in to this program and want to give back
and come back and hang out with us and mentor us in any way they can. We're
all open ears for that kind of stuff whenever -- sometimes we don't listen to
Justin Anderson very much, but all the other players -- no, I'm kidding.
Because he's got experience and he's obviously in the league doing just fine.  
  
That's a brotherhood that this university and program has, and we're thankful
for that.  
  
Q. What kind of things do they counsel you on or what kind of mentorship
and advice do they give you?  
TY JEROME: Before the tournament, Malcolm texted me, and he said just don't
put so much pressure on yourself, continue to lead the group, and just be
yourself and trust your work. And then after the game, he texted me good job.
Now go make it through the weekend. Really just little things like that, where
he didn't have to text me. He's going through his own rehab process right now,
and for him to be worried about or be concerned about what we're doing shows
how selfless he is and shows what a great group of guys have come through
here.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, for me, I talk to Isaiah a lot, and he's just a fun-loving
guy, as you know him. He's all about taking care of your business but remember
to have fun in it. So that's what he told me leading into this tournament.  
  
Q. Oklahoma prefers a fast pace. I just wondered if you guys prefer a
pace. Secondly, they've been getting good performances from Doolittle and just
wondered about your thoughts on the inside. They got a lot of paint points
yesterday.  
TY JEROME: They probably want to play a little faster than us. We're really
about getting the best shot, and we want to keep teams out of transition, so
sometimes the game will be slower if we have preference. And I think Doolittle
has been playing great. He had a great game yesterday -- or two days -- yeah,
yesterday. So we'll have to put different matchups on him, throw different
coverages at him. They're also really balanced, too, so it's not just him.  
  
KYLE GUY: We already watched some film on them, and we're going to watch more
tonight. We don't know exactly what we're going to do, but we know they do
have a balanced offensive scoring attack. I think four guys had more than 17
yesterday, I believe. They do want to get up and down. We're fine with that.
We try to keep teams out of transition. I know we take what the defense gives
us, so whether that's fast break points or a quick shot or a late shot clock
shot, whatever is the best shot is what we're going to take.  
  
Q. Ty, how much of a benefit was it, if it was a benefit, to be
challenged the way you were for a half yesterday?  
TY JEROME: I mean, not necessarily about benefit or non-benefit. It's just
you're in the tournament, so every team is good. The whole -- you're playing a
16 seed. The game shouldn't be close, that whole stigma is kind of nonsense
because every team is good. They won their conference tournament. They came
out playing at a high level. So we had to respond. Now it's kind of just move
on. You survive and advance and focus on the next team.  
  
Q. This is for Kyle. You were talking yesterday that you're very
competitive on the court, but that isn't going to make you forget how you were
raised. Could you talk for a moment, if you don't mind, about how you were
raised?  
KYLE GUY: I have a unique family setup. So I have two stepparents and
obviously two biological parents, and they're all best friends, which is
something that you don't see. My stepdad and dad would go on road trips with
me when I was in the recruiting process. They drive down to games together.
That in itself is hen -- obviously, they butt heads, because that's just how
life is, but they keep that away from me because they want what's best for me,
and I owe them a lot for that. Then I have five siblings, which is why I wear
the number 5.  
  
We were just raised to be good people, be kind to everyone, no judgment, no
discrimination. So that's just kind of how I've always been and how I want to
try to continue to be.  
  
Q. Kyle, you mentioned seeing OU in the Bahamas. Wondering if you had an
impression of them back then and how much of a challenge do they present to
you all?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, they're a big, physical, athletic team, which against anybody
can impose their will. I think they really found their rhythm now, as compared
to Battle For Atlantis. Then again, we weren't playing at a highest level
either then. It was early in the season. They've grown and gotten a lot
better. So I think it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Kihei said that he tries to pick your brain every chance he gets and
absorb the knowledge that you have. What have you seen, how far he's come and
what improvements do you think he's made this year?  
TY JEROME: I think the biggest thing for him is that he's grown on just
understanding the value of every possession. He's always had that work ethic,
that competitiveness and that drive from day one, but I think he was a little
sloppy with the ball at certain times when he came in. Everyone who comes from
high school is just used to playing with a huge leash in high school. So I
think he's grown so much from day one in that aspect. I think that his biggest
asset to this team is his selflessness. He could care less how much he scores.
He's just all about winning.  
  
We have certain plays where he'll take -- he'll bring the ball up. He'll play
the point guard position on certain plays that don't involve ball screens, and
then the plays that do involve ball screens, he'll ask me if I want the ball.
He's just super selfless. He's all about winning. He's all about the team.
He'll give up his body for the team. And we have to tell him to be more
aggressive, too, sometimes. So just a great teammate and an ultra-competitor.  
  
Q. Kyle, we kind of joked about what people are going to ask you guys
once you get past that 1-16 game, but it was a relief for a lot of folks
yesterday. Can you break down the dynamic, it's still the NCAA Tournament,
you're not going to be relaxed now, but still getting the, quote, unquote,
monkey off your back and moving forward?  
KYLE GUY: I think how we won yesterday is a huge testament of our growth from
last year. Last year, we were in the same situation, and we panicked as an
entire program, and this year we didn't, and we took care of business and got
the job done. Yeah, we can breathe a little bit easier now, but at the same
time, it's the NCAA Tournament, so like you said, we're not relaxed. We're not
content by any means. We still have our foot on the gas and just trying to go
as far as we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Virginia head coach Tony Bennett. We'll start with questions on
the front right.  
  
Q. Tony, Kyle Guy seems to be sort of a different type of person. He's
very happy. He's very accessible. I've seen him go out of his way to
congratulate opponents who have beaten you guys, which is rare, of course.
Yesterday, he accidentally knocked down a Gardner-Webb player, went over and
told him it wasn't intentional. You seem to have a pretty good relationship
with him. What is it that makes him the way he is, and what is it you find
refreshing about him?  
TONY BENNETT: I think I've been fortunate to coach a lot of guys that are just
a strong character, and that comes from, I think, how he's been brought up
from his family. He is, he's a kind person. He enjoys the game. He has a love
for the game and is lighthearted. So I think that's a credit certainly to his
family. Again, he just has always been that way. He's a competitor, but yet
enjoys it and understands the big picture in regards to that.  
  
Q. Tony, I think it's fair to say maybe a portion of the fan base had
maybe been down on Kihei at times this year because of his offensive
production. Was what he able to do yesterday defensively, chasing loose balls,
getting rebounds and steals, sort of indicative of why he's continued to be a
big part of your rotation in starting?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he's been so valuable. You can't concern yourself with the
opinion of others. He's helped us. He guards the ball hard. He scraps, and
he's made some good offensive plays for us, gives us a dimension that we
haven't had in a long time. Again, you asked specifically defensively, and
it's that, when you play against certain kinds of teams that have elite
quickness and you can set your defense with good ball pressure, that's really
important, and he's allowed us to do that.  
  
Again, offensively, he can touch the paint, and he's made some really good
plays and passes for us. He's so competitive, and he brings that. I think that
is contagious when you watch that, when you're behind that and he's setting
your defense and you're a player, I think that can be inspiring or get the
guys going. Taking charges, he's done that over the course of the year.  
  
Q. You've told us a few times this year that you've encouraged the guys
to take joy in the pursuit of a championship. You've also told us in past
years that your disappointment in losses stems from wanting your guys to win,
wanting them to experience success, Final Four is the thing that they want.
I'm curious how you strike a balance of finding joy in the pursuit of a
championship versus any pressure you feel to get some players that you
obviously care about as far as they can go.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, we talk -- it was actually a quote in a book I read, "the
joy of competition and the fun and the pursuit of a championship." That can't
define you in terms of who you are, but it's worth it to go after it for all
you're worth. These guys have been gifted. All the players and teams in this
tournament have such gifts. It's a worthy goal to go after.  
  
Only one gets it, but I think you, as a coach, certainly you have goals and
dreams for yourself, and when you spend as much time with these young men
getting to know them, going through the ups and the downs and the battles,
it's just they're an extended part of your family, and you want to see it go
well for them and the program.  
  
So I think it's just our theme this year is united pursuit, and that's, I
think, a good way to kind of summarize what it's about. You're so united in
everything through this pursuit. That means in success, and that also means in
failure. If you can keep that balance, I think that helps, but it certainly --
it's a great desire for everyone.  
  
Q. Tony, you've taken some transfers at Virginia, and they've usually
been players who were starters at their other schools. What do you tell them
about playing time? Everybody wants to play. And also, for guys like Nigel and
Braxton, who are immediately eligible, how challenging is the pack line and
your system in general to learn so quickly?  
TONY BENNETT: I think, when you come into a program that has been fortunate
enough to have success, you just -- you have to say, do you want to be a part
of this? And you can't guarantee anything unless you know here's a spot, X
amount of minutes, but that's so fluid. You just want guys that are willing to
go get everything that they earn. Sometimes they maybe earn less than they
get, but will they be willing to be united in the pursuit of what we're trying
to do?  
  
I think there is always a learning curve when you come from a different
system. I think the experience that transfers have as playing in this game,
and they understand the physicality and the intensity -- a guy like Braxton,
who played in the SEC and played in an NCAA Tournament game or two, that's
invaluable. And he was an important part in this, I think it was 12 minutes.
Every game we've seen this year, sometimes it's more minutes, sometimes it's
less. But he understood, when he became eligible this year, when DeAndre and
some of the established guys there, it was going to be -- we'll talk about
that. We'll plug you in where we can and you'll get what you earn, and we'll
just keep plugging because he's an important part of this.  
  
Q. OU hasn't had the season it wanted until yesterday when they played
really well. They're a senior-dominated team -- six, I think, play. Did you
sense, when you watched them play or through the video, that those guys have a
sense of urgency now that they're end of the road? And in your experience, is
that a factor, do you think, in the NCAA Tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Of course it is. Just playing high level ball at the right time.
We were in Atlantis in the early season tournament over Thanksgiving, and they
were playing a little different. Now they're playing real big. I think
Doolittle is playing the three sometimes. They have the talent. Coach Kruger
is one of the best coaches there is. When I was at Wisconsin, he was in the
Big Ten, and I've followed him and have a great amount of respect for him.  
  
What he's done with last year's team was very good, and how he's taken this
team and used the versatility as strength and how it culminated yesterday --
and other games. It wasn't just yesterday, but was impressive. So to have
experience, to have veterans and sort of that end of the road or seeing the
light at the end of the tunnel, there is certainly a sense of urgency. So they
showed it at a high level the other day, yesterday, and they cause some or
present problems matching up with them because they score in unique ways.  
  
Q. Tony, you said a moment ago Kyle is lighthearted. Is he all business
on the court, in practice and everything or do you sometimes have to remind
him that this is a business-type deal? How did you find out about him, and how
did you get him to come to UVA?  
TONY BENNETT: I think he enjoys -- there's a joy to the game. He enjoys
playing. He has fun on the court, but he's competitive, and he plays hard. I
haven't had a problem with him, say, be more business-like because he works
hard. I found out about him -- we were watching another guard, and Coach
Sanchez said, hey, look at this skinny guy on the other court. I think it was
in Chicago at an Adidas event. We kept watching. He's pretty thin. I don't
know. He kept making buckets and, again, was real competitive. You just kind
of, your eye caught him, and we followed him more and loved him and thought,
boy, he could be really good.  
  
So we got involved and weren't sure, being a kid from the Midwest, Indiana, if
we could lure him or get him interested in us, but it worked out. We
connected, and I think he really took off, I think once he committed to us,
then he became a McDonald's All-American. He was highly recruited, but I think
we got him committed, and it just went to another level. So I'm glad we got in
early, and I'm glad Coach Sanchez pointed out the skinny kid on the court to
the left of me.  
  
Q. How has Mamadi's game developed offensively over the last few years?
I think back to last season at Syracuse, he made a bunch of acrobatic jumpers,
falling away, awkward angles. Is that kind of an underappreciated part of his
game?  
TONY BENNETT: I think he's just gotten better and better. Ty made the comment
yesterday. It was a little bit of a shaky start for everyone. Mamadi's matured
in the sense that he fought through that and he gave us some play on the
offensive rebounding, some post moves and finishing, and he does have touch.
It's just in increments. It's just gotten better every year. I think it's just
maturity. It's experience. He's always, I would say, a little newer to the
game than most kids from America, and he's, again, showed great flashes, and
that's become more consistent. He had a really good outing yesterday in a big
time setting.  
  
Q. Coach, Oklahoma had a big day yesterday in paint points, and it seems
you stressed that. Do you and can you talk about that matchup?  
TONY BENNETT: We stress that on offense or defense? Keeping them out of the
paint?  
  
Q. Just the paint points. Yeah, you defensively.  
TONY BENNETT: They shot -- I think it was 62 percent inside the three-point
line from two-point range yesterday. Scoring 95 points, and I think they only
took 13 threes. That shows you their efficiency and how they run their actions
and, again, how their bigs can back you down and their guards and post you up
in play. It's going to be a war in that regard. It's kind of going to be bend
but not don't break because they have the ability to create their own, and
that's the test because they can space it.  
  
I don't know if Brady would be their four or their five, but he can space it.
Doolittle can go to work as he's working in the post. So they put some
pressure on you with that. But we have to be as good as we can at making them
shoot the contested shots. That's our goal every game defensively. That's kind
of the pack line mentality. Can you pressure the ball but be jammed up and
make people shoot the majority of their shots contested and bothered, not at
the rim.  
  
Q. Before the opener, the guys were talking about the TED talk that you
showed them, and earlier, Kyle mentioned that you quoted Friday Night Lights.
I wonder how recent that was. And also, when it comes to finding things to
motivate them or push their buttons. Do you enjoy kind of playing part coach,
part psychologist when it comes to that stuff?  
TONY BENNETT: I love movies. I love quoting movies, movie lines. Kyle loves to
quote Fletch. So there you go. Oh, he already left. He was asking -- did he
leave? He wanted to know more about Kyle's kindness. I guess I didn't give him
enough the first time. He can quote a lot of Fletch lines. Friday Night Lights
-- "clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose." Everybody knows that, and that's
such a good thing.  
  
As a coach, you're always trying to find a way -- I don't know. I can remember
quoting a line from The Karate Kid, and I'm talking to our guys, and they're
looking at me sort of blank. And I'm thinking of the original Karate Kid with
Ralph Macchio, and they're thinking the one after that. Sometimes my age shows
up, and I can't quite connect. But you try to motivate in different ways, and
I think that's the fun stuff seeing how you can connect with the guys. Some
things just click with the guys and respond. That's part of coaching --
teaching, motivating, trying to inspire them, encourage them, challenge them,
get after them. It's all mixed in.  
  
Q. Tony, you mentioned -- Kyle mentioned that, with you guys going to
the Battle For Atlantis, you saw Oklahoma then. Did you have a first
impression with them? And also, to kind of add on to that, how much do you
guys feel you've grown since that tournament, as well?  
TONY BENNETT: They were huge. The way they were playing their size. They were
one of the bigger teams. Playing now -- at the time, they would play
Doolittle, Kristian it is, at the three at times. Now they're playing them
sometimes again four, five. But I just remember their size. We did not end up
playing them. We played solid basketball, had a good tournament and ended up
winning that. So we just saw, I think it was -- they played Wisconsin. I think
we would have played the winner of that, if I can't remember, the Wisconsin-
Oklahoma game. One of our coaches said, I haven't seen a team that big.
Wisconsin had a good game against them then.  
  
Have we improved since then? I think every team improves in certain ways. I
think we've just become more settled. Different guys have stepped up. Braxton
Key has -- he's been good for us, and he's established himself more and more.
Mamadi, at times, Kihei, those guys who are a little more experienced now have
really added to our program.  
  
Q. With the Friday Night Lights reference, first, what was kind of the
message and the point you were trying to get across with that? Could you see
the guys kind of get it? Do you have any Friday Night Lights fans on the
team?  
TONY BENNETT: I don't know if the guys got it or not. No, it was the quote,
"clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose." It's just, if you clearly understand
who you are as a team, your identity and what you hang your hat on, either as
an individual player or as a team, and you have a full heart in your pursuit
of it, you can't lose. Maybe someone will beat you, but you can't lose. It's
pretty simple.  
  
I think I asked, have we got any Friday Night Lights fans? I think most of
them knew that quote, so that was the idea. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it
doesn't. But I like the movie, so it was good.  
  
Q. Tony, you mention often that you tell guys who maybe don't start or
get the full complement of minutes, be patient, your time is coming. I can't
tell you when, but it is. It's easy for you to say. How difficult is it for
them to accept that and be patient? And on the flip side, are you pleased with
the patience guys like Braxton and Mamadi and Jay have shown? Because at
times, including yesterday, they've been invaluable for you.  
TONY BENNETT: Of course, they're a huge part of that team. Every guy is so
valuable. That's the hardest thing. These guys come from high school, and
they're the main player. Sometimes delayed gratification is very hard in
today's society, with all of us, but for young people, it's the instant
gratification. Those who are willing to wait and work, it's rewarding, and
it's doing stuff for them beyond which I think will produce fruit in their
lives, way past just the season, but that is the challenge.  
  
I'm sure friends, family, hey, you should be getting more opportunities. I
think that's also why there's such a transfer. The numbers are so big. But
those usually who fight and wait it out, good things happen. I couldn't be
more proud of those guys. At times, they're playing big minutes, and their
time is still coming. Some guys -- not everybody can play 30 minutes a game or
35, but I've liked their attitudes, and I love that at just the right times,
they've stepped up.  
  
Q. Was there a tipping point for your recruitment of international
players, or has that just gradually grown as the game has grown that way?  
TONY BENNETT: When I was at Washington State, I try to think who our first --
was it Aron Baynes from Australia? I had spent some time in Australia and New
Zealand after playing. And then Kirk Penney, a guy who played for my father at
Wisconsin, is like a little brother to me, is from New Zealand. When I lived
over there, I got to know him. One of my assistants, Ben Johnson, at
Washington State played over there. So we had that connection, then we got
couple guys from Europe.  
  
When you're at Washington State, Virginia, schools, I think sometimes finding
those hidden gems, guys that are academically sound that are excited to come
over, a lot of schools are doing it. Sometimes you can find players that maybe
you wouldn't be in such a fight for here, or you would be in a fight, I'm
saying, if there's a player of that caliber. If you have connections, if you
can get to them early, sometimes you have a better chance to land them
whereas, if they're in the states, they're so exposed, and it's such a
recruiting battle. So you try to find your niches. That's what we've done.  
  
Q. What are the specific challenges with finding those guys?  
TONY BENNETT: It's connections over there. More guys are exposed over the
Internet and all that. It's just trusting people, getting your eyes on them,
getting video, all those things. Trying to assess the competition that they're
playing against, and you don't always get it right, but we've been fortunate
where some of those guys have been terrific for us.  
  
Q. If you've already been asked this, I'll get it off the transcript,
but are there advantages to being scared a little bit or being challenged the
way you were in the first half yesterday?  
TONY BENNETT: I already answered that, so get it off the transcript. No, I'm
just kidding. I didn't (laughter).  
  
You know, that was -- you felt, certainly, the way Gardner-Webb played, as I
said, was challenging because of how they use their fours and fives, the way
they're shooting, their quickness, and to get down like that and feel the
crowd turn. We were in that spot last year, and human nature says this could
happen again, but you've got to keep fighting. That was the thing that, I
don't know if it was good or not, but we just talked about that at halftime.
You got to fight. You can't panic, but you've got to fight.  
  
As I said, only the guys that played and were part of that team last year and
that were in that locker room this year and understand all that was there will
appreciate them responding the way they did in light of that. Like I said, I'm
glad that we, they, all of us could experience that turnaround in that
setting, which pressure, stress, those things, they put you in stuff, and you
see some of the best players and best athletes in the world. You can come
unravelled in that, and we have at times, and we fought through some of that
stuff and came out on the positive end. So I think that was important for
sure.  
  
Q. Kyle and Ty were talking about former players, how they stay in
touch, they mentor, they text. One, what does that give your current guys,
hearing from them? And what does it mean to you the guys who are in the NBA or
rehabbing from injuries, things like that, still take the time to be involved
in the program?  
TONY BENNETT: It's everything. It kind of leads back to the question why you
want success for the young men that you coach, because I know the kind of
young men they'll become, and I know how they're going to pour back into the
program and what they're about. So you just desperately want it. When you have
a healthy alumni base or former players that are helping your current players
or just come back and work out with our strength coach and they keep in touch
with us, that's the most -- some of the most rewarding stuff as a coach, I
would say. That's the stuff that's going to last.  
  
I see that with my father when guys from whatever teams he had, his high
school players, they'll still go and visit with him. They'll play a round of
golf, or they'll just go and sit, and my mom will make them their hot fudge
sundaes she used to make when my dad would recruit them. They'll sit and tell
stories and send me notes and all that. That's the good stuff. That's the
lasting stuff.  
  
You're bonded together through experiences with most of your guys through
life. You really are. That is so rewarding in this game. There's a lot of
things that can be challenging, but those are the memories, and I think a lot
of reason why many of the coaches do it and go through the things that we go
through. So we've got great former players all the way from my first year here
up until now. Can't tell you how good they are. You guys know that. You've
covered them.  
  
Q. Tony, the way the offense has changed this year with the sets that
you guys are using, have the new offensive sets kind of become the best sets
for the offense? Is the new stuff kind of the future of the UVA offense?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think you look at your personnel every year, and you
make adjustments, and a lot of the stuff was born out of either struggles
you've had in years past or, again, personnel that you have and what spots
they're in. So you're always challenging yourself as a coach. You have to keep
improving. The game changes. You have to try -- I mean, there's certain things
that are constants, but certainly those are things that I think have helped
us, and we worked hard on some of the things that have been key for us this
year through the summer, fall, during the year.  
  
Like I said, a couple things we've brought back from previous teams because we
have that kind of personnel that can use it. So it's always evolving. Is it
the future of UVA offense? Kind of depends on the personnel, but you're always
trying to move that needle.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 85, North Dakota State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have North Dakota State head coach David Richman with
student-athletes Vinnie Shahid, Jordan Horn, and Tyson Ward.  
  
DAVID RICHMAN: Obviously, Duke was the Number 1 overall seed there, especially
in the second half, they get out in transition like that and turn you over,
they're elite. That's an exceptional team, and it was a pleasure to coach
against Coach K and for our guys to compete in that environment.  
  
More so than anything, what our guys accomplished in the last three weeks in
particular and over the last six weeks is tremendous. But that doesn't come
close to what I'm really proud of. What I'm really proud of is how they did
it. We talked a lot about representing a school, a community, a fan base, a
state the right way, and to me, these guys did it.  
  
We talk in our program a how is way greater than a what. Our guys, how they
attacked this, how they stayed the course from a group that was 2-7 at one
point, it was just an absolute pleasure to be around.  
  
Appreciate it. This is a great opportunity. Our guys stayed in the moment. I
asked them in the locker room to stay in the moment for one more minute and
challenged them to what are they going to sacrifice to put ourselves in a
position where we can be right back here next year?  
  
Q. Vinnie, Coach K just called you a dominant leader. What does that
mean hearing that from a coach of his stature?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It means a lot. A lot of it has to do with what my teammates
do. They give me confidence. They trust me with the ball. But it means a lot
to hear that.  
  
Q. Vinnie, you've known Tre for a while now. What was it like battling
it out with him?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It was very exciting. You grow up with somebody playing on the
same team as them, and then you compete with them again through high school,
and then you see them on the biggest stage there is in college basketball in
March Madness. It's very exciting.  
  
Q. Tyson and Vinnie, the stretch that Zion had at the start of the
second half was something else. Have you guys ever seen anything like that,
and how would you describe what happened there with him going off there?  
TYSON WARD: To be honest with you, the game just went by in a flash. So I
can't really tell you like what really happened at certain points in time. But
he went on a stretch where he got some rebounds, and he does what he does, and
it makes him a good player.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: Yeah, he's a really good player. He capitalized in transition
and on the offensive boards, and he's finishing around the rim. Probably one
of the best athletes I've ever seen with my own eyes, but he's a really great
player.  
  
Q. Question for any of the players, Coach mentioned a minute ago, guys,
taking a moment in the locker room to think about what you want to accomplish
and get back here next year. What do you guys each take away from the last
three weeks building toward the future?  
VINNIE SHAHID: Coach just said it, staying in the moment a lot. If you go back
to June, we had a lot of ups and downs throughout the season, starting in June
and going 2-7 and then going 5-0 and then losing three. A lot of it was just
staying in the moment and learning and growing from those experiences.  
  
JORDAN HORN: I kind of have to agree with all that Vinnie said, kind of hit it
on the nail. But, yeah, we just stuck together through the whole process.
Since June, since we've been here in the summer, we've all had our ups and
downs personally and as a team. To get through what we went through and do it
all together as one, it's very special. We all know we want to get back to
this moment, to this stage, and make it even further. We know what we expect
from ourselves, so we'll be right back.  
  
TYSON WARD: We can take just how hard we worked, how much perseverance we went
through, and when we get back, it starts then, preparing for that first game.
Actually, that first practice in the summer or first practice in the spring,
just preparing for those big moments and those little moments.  
  
Q. To Tyson and Vinnie, can you talk about the opening stretch? You led
most of the first half and got out to a 12-5 lead. What was the feeling like
when you were executing and scoring and taking a lead against Duke here in
this scenario?  
TYSON WARD: It was just playing basketball. You know, 40 minutes were up, and
we came out teed up, ready to play, and when we played with a whole bunch of
excitement, we're a tough team to beat.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: I feel really good. I think we were getting some stops on the
defensive end, and we were scoring on offense. So it wasn't allowing them to
get out in transition as well as they usually do. It definitely feels good to
have a lead. Only down four going into halftime.  
  
Some things we had to clean up coming out in the second half, turned the ball
over a little bit, but it feels really good.  
  
Q. Did playing against Mike Daum multiple times during the season help
you prepare for Zion, and who on your scout team had the impossible task of
trying to emulate his play this week?  
TYSON WARD: I think they're two totally different players. Mike Daum, he's a
great player himself, and Zion Williamson is a great player himself, but you
can't really compare those two. I think that you just come out and play
basketball at the end of the day.  
  
JORDAN HORN: I would say the same thing. They're both really great players,
and playing against both of them, it was nice to see them and play against
them and stuff like that, but I think they're two totally different players.
In practice, we kind of challenge each other on both ends, whether they're on
the scout team or in the rotation. With the scout team, playing against Mike
Daum, we didn't really get that much time to go over Duke as a scout, but just
pushing each other in practice was huge, and preparing was a big stage for us.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: They couldn't have said it any better.  
  
Q. Tyson, you guys struggled in the first half and most of the second
half shooting three-pointers. That's usually your bread and butter, making
three-pointers. What did they do to make it so tough on you?  
TYSON WARD: They just weren't falling. Sometimes you get a little bothered by
their length and athleticism, but you've just got to prepare for that and
shoot your shot. You can't be overthinking sometimes. I think that's what kind
of happened a little bit. Overthinking really might have affected our shot a
little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Congrats on a good season. Questions now
for Coach David Richman?  
  
Q. What do you do when that second half starts and you can tell the
whole thing is about to slide down? Is there anything you can do? Or do you
just go, we gave it our best shot?  
DAVID RICHMAN: That's not what we're about, just throwing our best shot.
Obviously, it's Duke, the Number 1 seed. We knew it was coming. It's really
tough when they're so well-coached, the length and athleticism. When you get
them out in transition, we talked about it to our guys the last couple days.
They're elites, and it's hard to get a stop when that gets going.  
  
Q. On preparing for a guy like Zion, because you don't see a guy like
him ever because you can't practice --  
DAVID RICHMAN: Is there any guys like him besides him?  
  
Q. Exactly right, and you're not in the ACC, where you see him twice a
year. All those things considered and you have two days to prepare for him,
how do you prepare for him? Because it seems what you guys did in the first
half is as effective as you could have been in the first half?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I think it's just real important. We talked about. You've got
to be solid. You've got to be disciplined. You've got to make him earn it. He
hit a three, something he hasn't done at a high level this year. But early in
the second half, he got that offensive rebound off the free throw. It's things
like that that breathe life into a guy who might have been quote, unquote,
might have been struggling a little bit and just got his energy going. That's
why they talk about him being the Number 1 pick overall. He's a special
talent.  
  
Q. A whirlwind of a week for you guys. Winning in Dayton, late night
flight here to Columbia. What does it say about your team that they came out
and competed and fought the way they did?  
DAVID RICHMAN: When I asked at Selection Show for people to help tell our
story, I think it's something that I've known, our staff's known, our guys
have known. This is a terrific group. Being a student-athlete is extremely
tough. It's a lifestyle. You give up a lot of things. You've got a head coach
that's on your tail all the time asking you to be better and probably not in
this voice all the time. These kids keep showing up. They've done tremendous
work in the classroom. They're doing tremendous work in the community. Just
extremely proud to be the leader of these guys.  
  
Q. Jones against Vinnie, what do you know about their history together
and watching them battle it out today?  
DAVID RICHMAN: We were talking about it in the back. Jordan played AAU with
them. Those guys are really tight. Vinnie Shahid is like a pied piper in the
twin cities. Everybody knows Vinnie. Same with Jordan. They're at every open
gym. Whether we play somebody from Omaha or somebody from Denver, from the
twin cities, everybody knows those two guys. So it was a cool experience for
them. We want to wish Tre all the best, too. His mom is battling some cancer,
we understand. We want to wish Deb, I think she's got some North Dakota ties,
all the best.  
  
Q. Coach, to have a lead on the Number 1 overall seed and to fight for
40 minutes against that team, what does that do for your guys that you bring
back every single guy on the roster next year? What does that do for their
confidence moving forward?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I think it's just that. I think it breeds a lot of confidence
on the biggest stage against the best in the biggest tournament in one of the
greatest -- obviously, I'm biased -- but in the greatest sporting event there
is. We competed. What we've got to understand is we put up 40 minutes. We
weren't able to do that -- and by no means am I or we ever going to be about a
moral victory, but there's an extremely -- I and we can be extremely proud of,
again, a lot of things we were able to do.  
  
Q. Dave, how did you position this game with your team going in? Did you
say, guys, we're going to go in and win the game, we're going to play our best
and see what happens? How did you approach the game philosophically with your
team when you started talking with them about it once you knew you were going
to play after Wednesday's game?  
DAVID RICHMAN: We talked about three things. Do the necessary, do the
possible, and you will achieve the impossible. When you tie in the necessary
and the possible -- it wasn't necessarily that we thought it was impossible,
it was everybody else thought it was impossible. I get it. I get the
percentages. I get the rankings, all those things. But it's just a weird
feeling being around our group, and you could see it. You saw it Wednesday
night. You saw it in the tournament, the poise and the confidence they play
with down the stretch. It just never felt like you were going to get beat
until they really got going and things got out of hand in the second half.  
  
Q. I think you shot about 13 percent on three-pointers in the first
half, which is not your norm. Did you almost feel like you could have had a
lead at halftime if you'd have made some more threes? You were only down four,
I think, at halftime.  
DAVID RICHMAN: Yeah, but that's Duke. The length and athleticism is something
that we don't see. You have to experience those things. You get sped up. I
give Tyson a lot of credit in his answer to it, but they have the ability with
their length and athleticism to speed you up, and that's what happened here
this evening.

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [R.J. Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36968)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 85, North Dakota State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: From Duke University, head coach Mike Krzyzewski with student-
athletes Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett. First, an opening statement from
Coach Krzyzewski.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I thought we beat a really good team today, a championship
team. The last month of their season, I thought they were the best team in
their league. They lost a heartbreaking game against South Dakota State at
home, which they dominated, and really, that knocked them back a couple games,
I think. They got it back, and they've been playing beautiful basketball. I've
watched at least six of their games.  
  
Extremely well-coached. The kid, Shahid, is a dominant leader, and he played
so well today, especially in the first half. They don't turn the ball over.
They make you play defense and then multiple shooters, multiple scorers, well-
conceived. They're good. They're very good.  
  
I thought we started out just taking jump shots and not working the ball. Once
you get behind, there's the confidence level of the other team and the
pressure of the game. I thought our defense then picked up for the rest of the
game after about ten minutes. In the second half, we played just beautiful
basketball for those 12 minutes, and then we subbed, and they subbed.  
  
But it was a good game for us and applaud them. They return, everybody, watch
out, man. Watch out. They're going to be that team in their conference. That's
my prediction.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Zion, for you, there's obviously a lot of attention on you. Nothing
different there, but to be in your home state, to deal with this, and then to
come out the way you guys did in the second half, how did that feel for you?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Obviously, it's nice to be in my home state, but like I said
in our last press conference, I can't put my personal happiness before my
teammates. We did start out very sluggish. We weren't playing very well. But I
think in the second half we calmed down, and we just started playing Duke
basketball.  
  
Q. This is for both players. Going into the game tonight, it's your
first tournament, was there any nerves, excitement? Or how did you feel going
into tonight's game?  
R.J. BARRETT: I felt like we were excited, definitely excited to play. We've
all been growing up watching the tournament for many years, and we're excited
to get out there and just -- we didn't really have as much energy. We weren't
really playing as well at the beginning. Thankfully, we were able to pick it
up.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like R.J. said, I think we were very excited because,
especially for me, I remember watching March Madness, like live-streaming it
in high school and middle school, just watching the intense games and telling
myself I was going to be a part of that. So I think last night, when I was
sitting in my hotel room, I'm like, wow, I'm actually here. It's very
exciting. But you've got to put the excitement aside and just go out there and
try to get the win.  
  
Q. Zion, to start the second half, you were on a stretch where you had a
dunk, you had the steal, picked up the loose ball and went down and made the
layup. You had quite a stretch there where you kind of almost took the game
over by yourself. Can you explain what happened there and what led to that?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Before that even happened, my teammates were in my ear. They
were just like be me, like be myself. My teammates, and obviously coach said
the same thing. When they're constantly telling you to be yourself, it just
gives you energy, and I just try to bring energy for my team. I think in those
situations I just happened to be in the right spot. Like R.J. could have did
the same thing.  
  
Q. For R.J. and Zion, I'm curious, you guys talked -- or Coach K talked
the other day about talent helping talent. I wonder if you could talk about
what your relationship has been like this year or how each other have helped
each other's games throughout the season.  
R.J. BARRETT: It's been great, definitely playing with this team, playing with
Zion. Especially for me, we had a little joke that, whenever I'm in trouble,
he always bails me out. Every time I get stuck, he always cuts, and I can just
throw it anywhere and get it to him. So we definitely bail each other out, and
it's been a lot of fun to play with him.  
  
Q. R.J., can you talk a little bit about Shahid for NDSU's performance,
especially in the first half?  
R.J. BARRETT: He was taking it to us. Very dominant leader, like Coach K said.
He really got them going, got them on their run. They were pushing it down our
throat, but we regrouped at halftime. So it was great to see what we did in
the second half.  
  
Q. Zion, on the missed free throw, were you surprised? It didn't look
like anybody got a body on you, and you went ahead and threw down the dunk,
and that seemed to turn things. Did anybody try to get out on you at that
point?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Honestly, I just think it was one of those simple mistakes by
both teams. They both crashed, and the ball just kind of bounced right over
them. But, yeah, like you said, nobody was there to box me out. So I just went
and dunked it.  
  
Q. You guys have a good, strong relationship, good friends, have a lot
in common. Is being left-handed -- is that something that just adds to the
bond that you guys have?  
R.J. BARRETT: I got it. I mean, it's cool for sure.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Being right-handed is cool, too.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: It's not your turn (laughter).  
  
R.J. BARRETT: It's great being left-handed, and we can both use both our
hands. So it's amazing to see, you don't really know which way we're kind of
going to go in the name.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, it makes the connection deeper (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.  
  
Q. Coach K, in the second half, can you point to something that turned
it to let your team get out of the gates quickly and make that big run to open
up that lead?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, we were just more ourselves. We didn't start the game the
way we have played. We started it being jump shooters and just being fast
break. Most of our possessions had no passes, and therefore, we had no
rebounds. I think we were outrebounding us about 14-6 because we weren't
running good offense. They run very good offense, but they're going to get
even more confidence when we take one and miss, and that's it. How do they
feel us? They never felt us on the offensive end of the court.  
  
Then we started getting stuff more inside, and then they started to feel us on
both ends of the court. But we didn't start the game well, and they did, and
that's why they were ahead.  
  
Q. You said that you all just played some beautiful basketball in the
second half. What was your favorite part about that first 12 minutes of the
second half?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Just that we're winning, man. It's the most beautiful thing.
We're winning, got a double-digit lead, and we're hungry, and we want more. To
me, that's beautiful. It's not one play. You're not going to win this with one
play, no.  
  
Q. Coach, Jordan came in with the team down seven and kind of helped
spark the defense. Can you just talk about the energy he brings and the
improvement he's made to where he's now a household name in the rotation.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He's part of our rotation, and he's earned that, starting
with the Louisville game. He's a very good athlete, and he plays defense on
and off the ball, tough. He does not turn the ball over, makes simple plays,
and then he hit a big three. That's added. He's a valuable guy for us right
now, but he's earned everything.  
  
And also, what he's earned is the confidence. He has confidence in himself,
and he knows that we have confidence in him. So it's a good place.  
  
Q. Mike, how would you assess the toughness of this job or compare it to
others in the past with having as many high level freshmen as you have, but
obviously guys who lack experience playing games on this stage?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Nobody thinks I have a tough job, so I'm not going to talk
about a tough job. My job being tough? We've been the leader of the pack for
about 25 years, so we get everyone's best shot. That's the toughest thing. Our
guys need to be ready for that each time. I'm not saying we're the only leader
or the only -- but we're one of a handful that does it every year. So getting
kids, young kids to understand that. They don't get that in high school. They
never play more than two. They hardly play tough games because they're the
best players by far. And all of a sudden, every game they play is a T-shirt.
They have blackout day, game day, the most viewed game -- all those things.  
  
Although I do think it prepares us for this moment where everyone thinks is
the biggest game. We've played a lot of big games, and I think that's why our
kids responded in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, you've coached some incredible players throughout the years,
but with Zion and everything that's been written and said about his
generational ability, do you find even yourself sometimes saying wow to the
things he does on the basketball court?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, but I've had a lot of wow guys. Yeah, he's there, but
R.J. is a wow guy. Tre on defense. When Cam comes down and hits those trail
threes or fast breaks. Javin makes a block. I get excited for all my guys, and
obviously I get excited a lot about him because he's a hell of a player.  
  
Q. NDSU is a really good three-point shooting team, and you guys shut
them down. Was that a point of emphasis coming into the game, to take away the
three-point shot?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Obviously. They had to work for their shots. The thing that
they did, though, when they missed in the first half, they got their rebounds,
and we were not defensive rebounding.  
  
Look, they're a really good team. I watched six of their games, and I told my
guys, I said, look, they don't beat themselves. They don't beat themselves.
They play solid, really good basketball. And each kid has a confidence in his
role. Very, very well-coached team. I'm very impressed with them. We beat a
good team today. It's a good win for the Duke Blue Devils today. Thank you.

### [Rashard Odomes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37019)

### [Christian James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30613)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Oklahoma - 95, Ole Miss - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Oklahoma head coach, Lon Kruger with student-athletes
Rashard Odomes, Kristian Doolittle, Christian James, and Brady Manek. Coach,
if you have an opening statement. After that, we'll have the questions
directed first to the student-athletes and we'll allow those individuals to be
dismissed and follow with questions for coach.  
  
LON KRUGER: Just really happy for the guys. I thought they were really sharp.
A lot of respect for Coach Davis and the Mississippi program. These guys had a
good week of practice. I thought they transferred things from practice to the
game today from start to finish. Pretty solid. Good communication defensively.
That really moved the ball and identified some matchup advantages on the
offensive end.  
  
Proud of them. Happy for them. Ready to go watch some ball games.  
  
Q. Christian James, I just want to ask you, you opened up with two
threes to start the game. Did you have a really good shootaround, feeling
really good opening the game? Because you guys were offensively explosive to
start the game.  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: We did have a good start. We've been having a lot of good
practices, just getting reps up and things like that. The ball felt good
today. It felt good today. Trying to give my team a boost.  
  
Q. Guys, just how much momentum does a performance like this give you
moving forward looking ahead to Sunday?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: I think it gives us a lot of momentum, just moving forward.
Ole Miss is a good team. So we just want to go out there and get momentum and
just get as much momentum as possible and just keep it rolling. We're going to
watch some ball games and regroup and get ready for Sunday.  
  
Q. I guess, Doolittle, this one's for you. Did you think you could have
this kind of dominating performance inside? 15 rebounds, I think 19 points.  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Going into the game, I couldn't have predicted I'd have 19
and 15, but I'm glad to have it. Just doing what my team needed me to do and
getting it going early in the first half. Then my teammates took over for the
remainder of the first half, and the points were spread out evenly across the
board. So just taking what the defense gives me, not really forcing anything,
just following the game plan.  
  
Q. Rashard, that was one of y'all's best shooting performances, I think,
of the season. Maybe West Virginia was just a tick better. Did you feel like
you all were going to have that -- have you had practices in the shootaround
and everything? Did you feel like it was going to be that kind of night for
you?  
RASHARD ODOMES: Yeah. Like Kristian said, the previous practices have been
great. We've been having great energy in it. Just locking in and making shots.
We felt like what we did in practice really just transferred to the game.  
  
Q. Brady, you guys -- what you guys each do individually, you did today,
but you also did some new stuff, like when Freeman posted up and you ran
baseline, he hit you with a bounce pass. I don't think I've seen that all
year. Did you add some new stuff today for Ole Miss?  
BRADY MANEK: I think we were just playing basketball. We came in. We wanted to
have a lot of energy. I think we did that, and we just played together and
just played basketball. I mean, I don't think that was a set play or anything.
We just made a play and went from there.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players. When you get off to a start like
that, does that pretty much just loosen you up today where you didn't have any
pressure or any nerves and you could go out and play your game?  
RASHARD ODOMES: I don't know. I think it just sets the tone for the whole
game. I felt like we just carried that momentum throughout the whole game, as
well. We just wanted to deliver the first blow. When you're doing things like
that, great outcome comes. That's all we wanted to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kristian Doolittle, if you'd like to add to that.  
  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I guess he said it basically the way I would say it.  
  
Q. This is a question for Rashard. Obviously, you all came out as a team
collectively, just really filling up the basket, but you specifically with 20
points. Was it something about your matchup that was just favorable to you or
just good sight lines in this gym, or what was it about you for your
performance tonight?  
RASHARD ODOMES: Just the team really got me going, you know. Before the game,
we were all hyped, and it's just the way everyone's been practicing
previously. So the team found me for good looks, and I just finished,
honestly.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, you guys came out red hot both halves, I think 8
and 9 to start the game and 7 of 8 to start the second half. Played good the
rest of the time too. Why specifically do you think you came out of the locker
room both times so efficient?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: To start the game off, we knew we had to come out with a
lot of energy, be able to hit first, set the tone for the rest of the game.
Shooting the ball well really helps do that. We were able to get stops on
defense and force them into tough shots and be able to rebound the basketball.  
  
The start of the second half, they came out with a lot of energy. They made a
couple of their first shots. So as far as us on the offensive end, we were
able to take our time and be able to get the looks we practiced on. Going
through all of our reads and getting the matchup that we wanted and be able to
execute.  
  
Q. Kristian, on those fast starts, they threw a lot of different guys at
you, a lot of different guys guarding you, but you were able to really just
kind of have your way. What were you seeing defensively from Ole Miss?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: We were planning on them to double the post whenever I got
it going in the post, but they didn't do that. So whenever I have a one-on-one
matchup, it's pretty much my world, whatever I want to do, be able to make the
right play, whether that's to shoot it or pass it or to keep the ball moving.
So I felt like I did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about your balanced scoring. You had two
players with 20, one with 19, one with 18. That's pretty good.  
LON KRUGER: We've had different guys different times in the year step up and
be key scorers for us, not always the same guy. Today they kind of all hit on
the same date. But the guys moved the ball. They got good looks, like they
said. Duke played great out of the post. Christian James making shots early,
Brady, I thought Rashard, perhaps one of his better games of the year. A lot
of different guys stepped up and played well.  
  
Q. Never gets old for you, does it? The fifth time to the playoffs and
the Final Four, and just like you said, on Odomes, he came in and was
averaging a little over 6 points a game, he goes, runs for 20. You just went
crazy out of the game. Ole Miss made a run, and you're still up 15 or so. So
great defensive effort. What goes into all of that?  
LON KRUGER: Like the guys mentioned, they've been sharp in practice, really
focused. I thought they really transferred the things they've done all week to
the game today. Got off to a good start. That always helps reinforce
confidence, reinforce the things they've been working on in practice. Again,
just happy for them. It's a special opportunity to win tournament games.
They're hard to win. Any time you can do that, it's a good memory for the rest
of their lives.  
  
Q. Lon, you had a good inside presence today. You shot well from the
outside. Is that the kind of thing you need to do when you face who you're
probably going to face in the second round?  
LON KRUGER: Of course. To have a chance against, if it is Virginia, they're
one of the best teams in the country. You've got to get everyone playing well
and make shots. That's probably the biggest thing against good basketball
teams, making shots. Easier said than done, but, again, if it is Virginia, we
know hands will be full.  
  
Q. How different is it coaching this team compared to last year's team
with Trae Young?  
LON KRUGER: Usually different. Any time you've got a player like Trae that led
the country in scoring and assists, a lot of things revolve around him. Pretty
much everything did. Here you've got a situation where we need more balance,
need more guys contributing, and that's kind of the other extreme, if you
will. So different guys at different times throughout the year have stepped up
and been our leading scorer.  
  
Kristian Doolittle, Christian James, Brady Manek certainly at the core of it,
but different guys, like Rashard tonight. He's worked awfully hard and very
happy for him.  
  
Q. Coach, what will the next couple of days look like for you and the
staff, watching games, getting ready, scouting? And should you face Virginia,
what stands out about them offensively with the way they've shot the ball, as
well?  
LON KRUGER: They're terrific. They've got a lot of terrific players. Tony does
a great, great job. They're very secure in what they do. They do it as well as
anyone in the country, defensively and offensively. So they're fantastic.  
  
Q. Coach, Ole Miss threw a lot of things at you man-to-man, one-three-
one, two-three, and you guys were able to seamlessly pick that apart. What
went into that, and how were you able to just easily dissect them on the
offensive end?  
LON KRUGER: In the end, making shots makes it look good for sure. I thought
guys recognized things well, again, transferred things from practice to the
game today. When you do what you work on and then shots also go in, it works
out pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, as you saw Kermit Davis transform a program from how they did
last season, just some comments on what you think Kermit Davis has done.
Despite beating them today, what do you think he's done with the program?  
LON KRUGER: I think Kermit is fantastic. Everywhere he's been, he's done a
fantastic job to go in and get a team immediately to the tournament, it's
amazing. It doesn't happen very often. He's got good players, but I think his
ability to get everyone working together and doing things that they do well
individually and trusting one another. I think that's the strength of Coach
Davis and the great job he's done everywhere he's been.  
  
Q. Lon, what do you think it meant to your guys that Trae showed up, and
were you surprised that he made the drive?  
LON KRUGER: That's great. Not that far from Atlanta, I guess, but still the
middle of his schedule, it's not easy to take a few hours out of any day. And
Trae's playing so well. He's playing great, especially in the last month to
six weeks, fantastic to see what he's doing, and certainly our guys appreciate
it a lot.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
UCF - 73, VCU - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Central Florida head coach Johnny Dawkins with
student-athletes Aubrey Dawkins, Tacko Fall, and B.J. Taylor. Coach will have
a brief opening statement followed by questions to the student-athletes.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We beat a very good basketball team. Of course everyone knows
the tradition that VCU has. Coach Rhoades has done an amazing job with his
group. And as you know, everyone in this room knows the tournament is very
unforgiving. We're fortunate to be moving on.  
  
I thought they made a great run in the second half, showed who they were down
the stretch defensively, making threes. Hats off because they played for the
full 40 minutes, and I'm just proud of our guys for staying focused and
winning a very good basketball game.  
  
Q. B.J., as you know, this program has waited a long time for a moment
like this. It's part of the reason why you stayed in Orlando to go to UCF. Can
you articulate on behalf of yourself and your teammates what this victory
means to you and to the program tonight?  
B.J. TAYLOR: It's great. It's a great step. It's hard for me to talk about it
right now because we're in a moment, and we are already getting ready for the
next one. But it's great for the program. It's a great win. But we'll reflect
on that after the season's over. Right now we're not satisfied. We want to
keep this thing going. So we're ready to get on to the next game.  
  
Q. Tacko, kind of the same question. I wonder if you could talk about
also the impact of being able to say that you were part of a team that notched
the first tournament victory in this program's history.  
TACKO FALL: It means a lot to us, to me, to the fans, finally being able to
pull it off after all these years has meant a great deal to us. But as B.J.
said, we're not satisfied. We want to keep going as far as we can, and we're
going to bring it every night no matter who we play against.  
  
Q. Tacko, you had your double-double tonight, UCF's first double-double
in the NCAA Tournament. What did you see on the court tonight against VCU?  
TACKO FALL: Obviously, we had the size advantage. I think we pretty much have
the size advantage over anything we're going to play against. We took
advantage of it, and my teammates trusted me. I was out there being
aggressive, just like I'm supposed to do every night and just trying to make
plays for us to win the ball game.  
  
Q. Aubrey, B.J., when you guys were running into the locker room, it
sounded like you guys were yelling Duke, Duke, Duke. What does this next
matchup mean to you guys?  
B.J. TAYLOR: First off, to answer the first part, I didn't hear nobody say
that. I didn't hear that. But it was a great first win for us. Like Coach
said, we beat a really good basketball team tonight. Duke is our next
opponent, and we're going to treat them like every other opponent. We're going
to prepare. They're a good team, and we have a lot of respect for them, but
we're going to treat them just like we treated every other team we played this
season and just try to go 1-0.  
  
Q. This is for Aubrey and Tacko. What was going through your minds when
VCU was making that run, and what did Coach say to you guys to maybe calm you
down during that time-out?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Just got to lock them up defense and cut their water off. We
knew they were going to make runs. Basketball is a game of runs. We were
prepared for that, but like I said, we figured we've got to cut their water
off and end it right there. Our defense is what did it.  
  
TACKO FALL: Like Aubrey say, basketball is a game of runs. We know teams are
going to make runs. They're a really good basketball team, so it's only right
that those things happen. So we just have to lock in and just stick to our
principles and just make plays.  
  
Q. Aubrey, about 13 minutes ago in the first half, it seemed like you
guys really started clicking into gear offensively. What changed? What was
different just to kind of get you guys going out there after the slow start?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Just shake the nerves off. It's a big game. The biggest stage
that UCF has been on. For us, we have to shake the nerves off and get in the
flow of the game, and that's what we did. Once we got used to the flow, things
started to click for us. We played good basketball, moved the ball, played
unselfish, and good things usually happen when you do that.  
  
Q. For Tacko, 18 boards tonight, 5 blocks. You altered a bunch of other
shots. You talked about being aggressive. Being in the tournament, did that
make you even more fired up?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, I feel like I've been the same. You don't just turn it on
and off. You got to do it every single night to prepare you for nights like
this. But it's all credit to the guys and the coaches, just pushing me every
day, trying to make me do my best out there, and it's paying off.  
  
Q. B.J., I know you said you're in the moment, you guys are in the
tournament, and you don't want to think about it. You talk about leave your
legacy basically every week, and leaving your legacy on that. Is this at the
head of that, this kind of win at the head of that statement?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I mean, yeah, at the moment. Like I said, we want to see how far
we can take this thing. We're not satisfied. I mean, yeah, we all came here to
leave our legacy. That's why we came here, and that's why we stayed and played
for Coach Dawkins. Like I said, right now, we're going to go to sleep tonight
and wake up and get ready for our next game.  
  
Q. Aubrey and B.J., how long does this win last? You guys talk about
moving on, but how quickly does that actually happen?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Right away. We don't have the option. We don't have the luxury
to think about this victory. We've got to keep winning. We're motivated. We're
not satisfied with this. We've got to move on to the next one.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of firsts this year -- first NCAA Tournament win for
this program. What's it mean for your building?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I think when I look back on it, it's going to be really
meaningful. I think right now, we're in the moment, so we're still happy that
we still have more basketball to play. So that's what we're excited about. I'm
just really proud of our guys. They worked hard to put themselves in this
position. I'm happy to see them take a first step in this tournament. I'll
think about all the things about this season they've accomplished along the
way when we finish, but right now, we just stand in the moment.  
  
Q. From your vantage point, Marcus Evans, their point guard, how healthy
did he look? What impact did he have on the game? Was he the player you
prepared for?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We felt he'd be ready to go tonight, and he was. I'm not
saying he was 100 percent. I don't know that because I'm not in their locker
room. But I thought he came out to compete. They're a very good defensive
team, and so are we. I think we really did a good job of game planning for him
to be at his best, and I thought our guys really were locked in in trying to
take away the things we knew he liked to do.  
  
He's a terrific player. He's a first team All Conference player in their
league, and I think he's a terrific point guard. He has a bright future.  
  
Q. What stood out to you most during the 19-0 run that you guys were
able to really stretch the lead out? What stood out to you most during that
run?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought we played some of our best basketball both ends of
the floor. I thought defensively, Tacko's presence down there was amazing. I
thought we rebounded it well. We knew they were going to crash the glass hard.
And then offensively, as Aubrey mentioned, I thought we made a lot of
connecting plays. We shared the basketball. Guys found shots and rhythm shots
they would normally take, and they were knocking them down tonight
consistently, and I think that helped build the run for us.  
  
Q. It's early, but do you have any impressions of Duke? Obviously, I'm
sure you've seen a lot of them maybe this year.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Actually, I haven't. When you're doing what we do for the last
six months, we don't have much time to see anyone other than your opponents. I
have seen them play bits and pieces, three minutes here, four minutes there
throughout the season when you're taking a break from your scouts. I haven't
seen much of them. I'm looking forward to seeing them this evening and
tomorrow as we start to prepare.  
  
But I know Coach. He's amazing, and I know the young men I've heard so much
about like Zion Williamson, R.J. Barrett, Cam Reddish. Those guys are
terrific, terrific players along with the point guard Jones and the rest of
their players. I know they're really talented, and it's going to be a good
challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, can you elaborate on Tacko's play tonight, his performance? He
seems to have really gotten better the last half of the season. Was tonight
sort of the ultimate in that?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We've been challenging Tacko all season long about really
imposing his will on the game. I think probably the last six weeks, you
started to see a turn in that. He started to see what he was capable of doing
out there on the floor. So I'm excited for him. He gets 18 rebounds in an NCAA
Tournament game, a double-double, that's having a huge impact on a game, and
he's capable of doing that. So I'm just really happy for him. I'm happy he's
realizing the type of impact he can have on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to be the coach of a team that gets the
program's first NCAA Tournament victory?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I'm proud of our guys. I'll always look at it as me being
proud of my team, proud of my coaching staff. I look at the guys that really
make this go, and we have terrific coaches. Tacko's improvement you've seen
over the last three years is a result of how hard these guys have worked with
him. B.J. doing the things you've seen him do, transitioning into the position
he's in now. Again, our coaches. I think we have amazing coaches. They're very
talented guys, and that's a huge factor in, I think, the development of our
overall student-athletes.  
  
And then you look at our strength and conditioning coach, and you look at our
trainer. These guys have kept these guys going, kept them healthy all year,
kept them playing at a high level. It takes a team to accomplish these things,
and I'll always think about that. I'll think about all the contributions of
the staff. I'll think about the contributions of each individual player that
I've had a chance to coach.  
  
Q. Duke has meant so much to you, obviously, as a player and an
assistant coach. If you had your druthers, would you rather not -- would you
rather play somebody else? I don't think Coach K likes playing his guys, does
he?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, I feel the same way. I was like -- we'd rather not play
each other, of course. We're friends. I played for him. I've worked for him
for over a decade. It's not something you look forward to doing. We know in
this type of setting -- and we're all competitors. We do what we have to do,
but it's not something we would pick, let's play each other. That wouldn't
happen under any other circumstance other than a tournament.  
  
It is what it is with that. You've got to get ready to compete. They're going
to do the same thing, and both teams will come out prepared.  
  
Q. How did you feel like your guys handled their press?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought for the most part we handled it well. I've watched
so much tape of those guys and what they do. Their weapon is their depth. They
just keep coming at you with body after body, playing at a high level. You're
going to wear down. You're going to have some mishaps with the basketball.
That's inevitable. I thought for the most part our guys handled it well. The
turnovers we had, not a lot of them led to easy baskets for them, which was
good, our guys were able to scramble and get back on "D" and make them set up
or take a tough shot. I thought, all in all, we handled it fairly well.  
  
We had 15 turns, and I'm disappointed, but I thought under the circumstances,
that was a good number for us.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Oklahoma - 95, Ole Miss - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Ole Miss head coach Kermit Davis, accompanied by
Terence Davis, Devontae Shuler, and Breein Tyree.  
  
KERMIT DAVIS: It was a really disappointing day for our team. Just right from
the start, Oklahoma, give them all the credit. They totally outclassed us,
out-toughed us in every area. Give Oklahoma a lot of credit. They played
really, really well. This is not going to define who we are, based on when we
took the program over a year and how much progress we have made in a year. I'm
so proud of these guys, these three guys. They were unbelievable all year
long. Obviously, we didn't play like we wanted today, but to be with this
group the whole year, extremely excited about our future. But just give Lon
and Oklahoma a lot of credit. If they play like that, they'll have a chance to
win in next round, Game 2.  
  
Q. Terence, that's your last game as an Ole Miss Rebel, and you went out
playing really well. Just what was it like out there in your final game. Going
out there, was it tough for you?  
TERENCE DAVIS: Definitely going out that way was tough for me. They jumped on
us quick. I think it was like 11-0 I looked up. You've just got to give them
all the credit, man. They made the tough plays. They exploited mixed messages
and things like that. But, yeah, it was pretty tough.  
  
Q. Breein, last couple games for you, two tourney games, really
struggled there offensively. What was it that kind of you struggled with as
far as getting your shot going? Were you frustrated with that?  
BREEIN TYREE: Just couldn't make a shot. It's unacceptable. I've got to become
a more consistent player over this off-season and just got to be better.  
  
Q. Terence, they got off to a particularly hot start in the post with
Doolittle in there. What did you see? I know you weren't matched up against
him so much early on, but what allowed them to be so effective with him in the
post early?  
TERENCE DAVIS: That's part of his game. I would say he got better throughout
the season this year. I think it's like most improved player in the Big 12. He
just went, exploited mixed messages, that's what Oklahoma does. That's what
they did with Doolittle.  
  
Q. Breein, I know this probably didn't end the way you guys wanted it
to, but as a player, are you able to process the step you guys made as a
program this year?  
BREEIN TYREE: Of course. As a player and as a competitor, you want to win
every game, especially our first time being in March Madness. I know, when we
take a step back probably a few weeks from now and look at what we did this
season, we had a great body of work. We all got better as people and as
basketball players on and off the court this year. So there's a lot of
positives, but never happy or satisfied with losing like that.  
  
Q. Terence, rather than just dissecting this game, having a full year
with head coach Kermit Davis, I just want to expand on what he's meant this
year, coming in and flipping a program from 12 wins to 20. Just comment on how
your relationship has been with Kermit so far this year.  
TERENCE DAVIS: The first time meeting Coach, he looked me in the eye and said
it wasn't going to be a rebuilding year, and I believed him. We all believed
him. He brought so much success upon me, my teammates, and this program.
They're going to do great things here at Ole Miss.  
  
Q. Bree, you talked Thursday about just how you guys have maybe a lot of
basketball experience but not a lot in the tournament. How much do you think
that factored in, especially the first ten minutes. Nerves? Experience?  
BREEIN TYREE: They got out to a really good start. Oklahoma is a really
experienced tournament team. I think they made it like four of the last five
years. Got to give them all the credit. In my matchup, whoever I was guarding
was exploiting me for most of the game. I know it. Everybody saw it. I'm not
happy with it, but back to the drawing board we go.  
  
Q. Devontae, with T.D. gone, Kermit's already said he thought you were
the most important player on the roster this year and what you did. Do you
anticipate taking another step as far as leadership is concerned and
establishing yourself in that way?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Definitely. Me learning from T.D. and practicing with him
every day, I learned a lot just from him being tough on the court and his
mindset off the court. I learned a lot. I'm just trying to work on myself
getting better.  
  
Q. Devontae, turnovers for you guys in the first half, was that a part
of nerves or their toughness, or did you guys just not start like you wanted
to?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: We didn't start like we wanted to, but I think the main
thing, we weren't really running offense, we were just shooting the ball on
the first side. We usually have a high percentage getting on the second and
third side. I think that was the most thing. They just out-toughed us on
rebounds. Like Breein and T.D. said, they just explored on mismatches.  
  
Q. You guys came out with a lot of energy in the second half. Looked
like you guys cut it down to about 12. What were they able to do offensively
that just threw you off again in the second half.  
BREEIN TYREE: We did make a pretty good run to start the half. Coach was
trying to tell us at halftime, just get it down to a manageable game and see
what they do. Credit to Oklahoma. They stayed with it and kept moving the ball
in the zone or in the man. We were throwing at them, and they were making
shots and making plays. They expanded the lead back out; and you saw what the
outcome was.  
  
Q. This is for Devontae. Being a hometown kid, obviously, does it make
it easier or harder for you to take this loss, maybe in the same town that
kind of helped you?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I don't think it really was a hard loss for me. I think me
just coming back home and playing in front of my fans and family for the most
part, that was the main thing. The fact that we lost is not what I wanted to
happen, but it's nothing I can really do about it. Just keep working.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.  
  
Q. Kermit, you went into this matchup saying that Dom and Bruce guarding
Doolittle in that front line was probably the biggest match of the game. They
struggled there. You've been talking about front line help all year. Do you
anticipate this off season being really important as far as adding up there
and trying to get bigger and longer and more athletic?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It's got to. When I started watching Oklahoma the first five
minutes, I knew it was going to be a problem. We were playing two five men,
and Doolittle, you're trying to guard him at wide post areas at 15, 17 feet.
They've got big guards. James and Odomes are big, big physical guards. Kind of
puts you in matchup problems at 16, 17 feet. It's kind of a one-on game. It's
not something we've been great at all year.  
  
We did get exploited right there with Bruce and Dom. You're right. We've got
to improve the guys in our program and improve our team with a couple of guys
in the spring for sure.  
  
Q. Kermit, you called a time-out with less than two minutes into the
game. What was it that you saw right then and there that showed you something
wasn't right with your team?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It just seemed like we wouldn't contest a shot. We would guard,
and their hands were down, and it was just so easy for them. I saw kind of a
different look on our team, and I just wanted to call a quick time-out and
just kind of sell into our team. It didn't do a lot of good because they went
on another 8-0 run. But I just saw a different look, and I was just trying to
get our guys' attention to kind of settle in. Obviously, we never really did
until the first maybe four or five minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. Just like I said with T.D., rather than just dissecting this one
game, season as a whole, Coach Kruger has said you did a phenomenal job, when
I asked him from Oklahoma saying how well you developed these players, to flip
a program from upside down. So I just want to ask you what have these boys
meant to you? Obviously, very emotional with T.D. being his last game. But
just from an emotional standpoint, how great has the season been for you and
those players?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It's really been probably one of the most rewarding years I've
ever had as a coach, as far as a team maybe overachieving. Our staff did a
great job. These guys did a great job. I know it wasn't the last couple games.
Breein Tyree may have been the most improved guy in the SEC. Went from a no
team preseason, averaged 9 or 10, to second in the league in scoring. Devontae
Shuler has never played point guard in his life, played point all year long.
And T.D. had a great year. It was, but we'll reflect back. I think it's what
they said, in about a week. The biggest thing I take away is just so
appreciative of how the players and the fan base connected, how we grew there.
We've got a lot of work to do. There's no question about that.  
  
But what Ross and Keith and just the people in the administration, the
opportunity they gave us, it's going to be hard for me for about two or three
days. Then we'll get right back on the road recruiting, and there's a lot of
positive things to think about.  
  
Q. Kermit, you made a late switch to start Dom instead of Bruce. What
did you like about that matchup with Dom early?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Dom had been better in practice than Bruce. We always reward
guys on practice. I told Blake or K.J. who had the most rebounds, and then the
four or five practices leading up to the start, and Blake had more rebounds
than K.J. I knew it was going to be a tough matchup for both of them, and Dom
didn't get off to a great start defensively.  
  
Q. Kermit, do you feel like this year expedited the process of what
you're trying to build at all? Does it change your outlook going forward at
all?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It expedited fan interest. I think it hopefully expedites
recruiting, just from a national level, just because of what people saw -- not
today, but just the tournament, so our fan base and those nationally televised
games in the pavilion. I really did. We've got a lot of work now. We've got a
lot of holes to fill, and we've got to get guys better, but I do think it sped
up the process.  
  
Q. Kermit, now the year's over, how much of this team looked like what
you would like it to look like down the line? Did you ever get close to
molding it into your image? How far along do you need to come, where does it
need to get fixed?  
KERMIT DAVIS: From an emotional standpoint, it's almost like we got it
together and won at Missouri to kind of get us in the tournament, get us 10-8
and 20 wins. I think the Tennessee and Kentucky games, we played as well as we
could play, one-possession losses at home, and the crowd was unbelievable.
Then in the Alabama game, we were up 16, and the thing kind of took its toll.  
  
It didn't ever really look like what I really wanted it to look like. I was
really proud of their improvement, but for us to really be a contender in the
SEC, bodies have got to change. We've got to develop a lot better depth.
There's still a lot of work for us to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you brought a team in here that had never played in the NCAA
Tournament. How much do you think that that kind of factored into it,
especially how they opened the game? And how much does that experience in the
tournament help moving forward?  
KERMIT DAVIS: You know, I just -- I don't know how much experience mattered,
or is it just Oklahoma was just better? They were just better. And they got
their head up, and then they made a couple tough shots. I mean, James probably
has made -- for the Big 12, probably had a little disappointing year in the
Big 12. He wasn't shot making. And today, boy, he got off to a great start,
and then like I said, Doolittle made shots.  
  
I think it probably -- it has a little effect. I just really think Oklahoma
was just better in all phases today.

### [Issac Vann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36972)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
UCF - 73, VCU - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Virginia Commonwealth University head coach Mike Rhoades is
accompanied by student-athletes Issac Vann, Malik Crowfield, and De'Riante
Jenkins. We'll have an opening statement from coach, allow questions to be
directed to the student-athletes.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Credit to UCF and Coach Dawkins. They played a great game. It
was an exciting game to start off with. It was back and forth a little bit. I
thought we had some momentum. I thought our defense got us going a little bit,
but then we just missed some shots. You're not going to score like other games
around the basket, as we have most of the year. We knew that.  
  
But we had opportunities. We had some open threes we didn't make that they
made, and they got a run there. Then in the second half, we just -- very
uncharacteristic of us, but we lost our composure there and they made a run
there that really got them going. That had a lot to do with the result for
sure.  
  
Q. Guys, what do you feel like is maybe the biggest factor in some of
the shooting struggles? It seemed like you guys were getting some looks but it
wasn't falling. What do you think was the biggest factor there in some of that
early on?  
ISSAC VANN: Definitely in the paint. I mean, Tacko is 7'6". I mean, some of
those shots that we usually get at the rim is kind of hard to get those with
him down there. We got some good open looks from three. We just couldn't knock
them down tonight.  
  
MALIK CROWFIELD: Based on what he just said, like Tacko's 7'6". Like he's
holding the paint down. So we had open shots, but in the first half we
couldn't hit nothing. But in the second half, we got it rolling.  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: They pretty much said it all.  
  
Q. De'Riante and Issac, when there's a 7'6 " guy rebounding, does that
even affect your shots from the perimeter knowing that most of the time
there's only going to be one shot? Does that put any extra pressure on you?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Over the course of the game, we don't even really think
about it. I didn't think about it until you just said it. You just gotta
outwork him. That's what we tried to do tonight. Unfortunately, he did a good
job.  
  
Q. Malik, what started clicking down that stretch, about ten minutes to
go in the second half. You guys started hitting some shots. What do you think
kind of led to that? You had back-to-back threes there in a sequence and you
went on that 11-0 run. What really sparked that run down the stretch?  
MALIK CROWFIELD: They made a huge run, so I'm thinking on the bench I need to
bring more energy so we can keep this game close. When I got in the game, I
started hitting three threes in a row, and De'Riante started hitting threes,
and that's what got it going.  
  
Q. For all the players, could you guys go through what you felt like you
accomplished this year, what you learned, what you gained, and what you carry
into the off-season and next season?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: I believe that the work that you put in, it tends to show.
For a whole group to get out of their own way and just want to see each other
succeed, you get the thing that happened to us, like winning regular season
championships and having a great year, going on winning streaks, and having
our fans show support, and everyone rooting for us. We've just got to build on
it and come back even stronger next year.  
  
MALIK CROWFIELD: Based on what D.J. just said, we had everything going into
the summertime. We had to push ourselves in the summer to get back to being
VCU, and it really showed in the regular season when we went on these winning
streaks.  
  
ISSAC VANN: Just the fact that from the end of last year, everybody bought in,
and everybody locked in. All that hard work paid off. Just because it ended
tonight doesn't take away the fact that we had a great season.  
  
Q. Kind of piggy-backing off of that, what are you most proud about this
year? Again, kind of the turnaround you guys were able to experience? Seeing
that work pay off? And how does that propel you into next year and all the
pieces you bring back next year?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Seeing everyone, how the work pays off at their given time,
you never know. It was days when some dudes were down, and they just kept
working, and eventually they had that game where all their hard work paid off
and everyone was excited for them. We all just want to see each other succeed,
no matter who it was. We didn't care who was the hot man tonight. We just
wanted to win. Overall, it was just a great season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Marcus Evans told me that he told you, I don't have it tonight,
essentially. What did he have, and what did you think of what he gave you?  
MIKE RHOADES: I thought he gave us some -- just him being out there was great
psychologically for our guys, without a doubt. He did some good things. He got
us going in the press with pressure on the ball, just that -- you saw him.
There's certain movements going to his left and to his right laterally that's
just tougher. You play with that bone bruise like that, there's certain things
you can do, there's certain things you think you might be able to do, but it's
not there.  
  
He did some really good things, but you struggle too when you're not a
hundred. He's been through a lot. He wanted to play. He wanted to play in the
NCAA Tournament with his guys. When we knew he would be able to play
yesterday, you could see the guys really excited for him, and that says
something about what everybody feels about Marcus and each other.  
  
But not one of his finer games when you look at the box score, but his
presence out there is what we need, and it just -- we fell short, but that guy
needs an off-season. He hasn't had an off-season in a while, and he'll be back
stronger than ever.  
  
Q. With them having sort of maybe not being quite at the level you
wanted to be, how did that affect maybe the offense, shot selection with him
at the point --  
MIKE RHOADES: You try to maybe throw one up there and try to get some momentum
and all that stuff. He forced a couple -- I thought he got off the ball at
times. In the first half, he had the ball moving here and there. We just
didn't make open shots. I want to go back and watch the tape probably tonight.
They made a run there. They made two. We had two wide open ones, we missed it.
They had two wide open. Marcus got the ball moving a little bit.  
  
But it wasn't there for them like you've seen throughout most of the year.
It's tough, but he wanted to make sure he was with his guys, and we wanted his
presence out there and his experience out there, and that's how it goes.  
  
Q. Mike, everything in the paint, everything around the rim is going to
be really challenging for you tonight. Do you think that it does affect --
that it has any effect on perimeter players when they know it could be a one-
and-done shot?  
MIKE RHOADES: I'm not sure it's as much about one-and-done, but you can't mix
up your game as much. You're a perimeter guy, and guys are running at you
because you're known as a three-point shooter. You don't tend to maybe --
you'll get by that guy and get by his close out really quick because Fall is
in there.  
  
Early in the game, we attacked -- we had a couple of plays where we created
contact. Some things didn't go our way. We had a couple of good finishes. But
they don't help as much as other teams because they don't have to. So they run
some three-pointers down and maybe take a couple of contested ones or you do
take a tougher two. I didn't think we took awful twos in the first half. I
just thought we missed some wide open threes. We knew going into this game
we're not going to get some easy ones around the basket, or we're not going to
power over him throughout the game. So we knew we had to make some shots. When
we got downhill and moved the ball, we got some open shots. We just didn't
make enough of them.  
  
Q. One more on Marcus. Obviously, he went to Texas with you to Rice,
came back here to VCU with you. What is your relationship with him on a kind
of more personal level like?  
MIKE RHOADES: We've been through a lot. When you become a head coach for the
first time and you get your first recruits, it's a special thing because you
don't have much of a track record to say -- you know, there's a lot of belief
in a relationship before you even get on the court. It's almost like you talk
about taking a chance, you take a chance on people. I recruited him hard to
take a chance on him, and he took a chance on us. We had some special things
go there.  
  
His sister went to VCU and, of course, the same high school as Briante Weber,
so he's familiar with VCU. We recruited him a little bit when I was an
assistant. He was really excited to come to VCU. He's been through some stuff.
He had a pretty awesome year this year for everything he's been through.  
  
It's a cool relationship. We're tough on each other because we both want to
win, we've got an edge, and I think it's awesome. Also, being through some
experiences, it makes you not want to let each other down.  
  
Q. What do you take from this season? What did you establish? What's the
foundation you've built, and how does it carry forward now?  
MIKE RHOADES: This stinks right now. This hurts. I didn't want to see these
guys go out because I've had a blast with these guys. But culture, the
culture, the culture, the culture. After last year, I just made it a point of
it. There's certain things we're going to do in this program. We're going to
demand a certain level of work, accountability, approach, and these guys rang
the bell, man. I'm so proud of them. They made it about each other. They
worked really hard together.  
  
When the lights aren't on and it's in the summer and there's nobody around but
the players and they're doing all the work, we built a culture based on work
and making sure we're taking care of each other. I think that makes it hurt
more when you lose, but you celebrate more when you win because you're doing
it for your brothers and the family approach that we talk about.  
  
So as much as this stinks right now, I'm very proud of -- a lot of people
counted us out and never thought we'd be in this position. I told the guys
this time last year that, if we really work and put the program and the team
first, great things are going to happen, and throughout the year they really
did. I'm proud of these guys for that.  
  
Q. Going to last off-season, the priority was defense. With what you
guys have been able to accomplish this year, what's your priority heading into
this off-season and looking into next year?  
MIKE RHOADES: Get better. Flat out get better. That's everything to me. If you
stay the same, people pass you out. We've got to get better. A lot of things.
We'll go back and reevaluate the program from how we tie our shoes to how we
throw the ball in the post to how we shoot and how we play defense. That's one
thing that I believe in. You've got to reevaluate everything in your program
all different ways so you can evaluate it and make it better because that's
the most important thing.  
  
I want these guys to grow. I want them to get better. I want them to be better
than they were tonight. I want them to be better as young men. That's very
important to me. We'll go back and reevaluate every part of the program, from
the head coach all the way down -- heck, to the managers -- to make it better
because that's what these guys deserve. Let's help them get better.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 71, Gardner-Webb - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gardner-Webb head coach Tim Craft with student-athletes David
Efianayi, D.J. Laster, Brandon Miller, and Jose Perez.  
  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, I'm just unbelievably proud of our team for really just our
entire season. This hurts to lose, but in our second half, we just didn't play
particularly well. I thought Virginia had a lot to do with that. I think
Virginia's a terrific team, obviously.  
  
Just really proud of our group, proud of these guys up here and all the guys
in our locker room and what they've done for our school, for our university,
for our alumni, our former players, our community. This run that they've been
on, that we've been on, has just done so much for a lot of people in our area
and that are associated with Gardner-Webb.  
  
So just very thankful to coach this group of guys, to coach these three
seniors, and just very, very thankful.  
  
Q. This is for the players. Talk about the great start you got off to
and the support from your fans. It looked like you really fed off your fans in
the first half.  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yes, sir. I think we just came out with a lot of energy. We
were moving the ball well, and we were making great shots.  
  
D.J. LASTER: At the beginning of the first half, our fans really had us going,
and we fed off their energy. We were just playing well as a team -- passing
the ball, making the right cuts, making the right plays. It was a really good
experience for them to all show support, and even at the end, they were still
showing support.  
  
BRANDON MILLER: Pretty much the beginning of the game, the nerves kick in.
Everyone's excited. We're moving the ball, we're scoring. The first bucket,
everyone was going crazy. First one for us in March Madness, it was a great
experience. The fans, the best I've ever seen in my five years. That really
motivated us to do better and just keep Gardner-Webb happy at the end of the
day.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: It was a great atmosphere here. I just want to thank the fans for
traveling from Boiling Springs down here. It's a small town. Looked like there
was about a thousand people here supporting us. It was a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. Obviously, first time, we've written a lot about that. You mentioned
a little bit of it, Brandon, for the players. You all didn't seem to play
nervous early on. Was it because it was going well? Everything looks good when
shots are falling, but how did you fight off not being nervous coming into
this historic first game for you?  
BRANDON MILLER: I mean, we just played our game. At the end of the day, we all
strap up the same way. So no matter what school you're going to, at the end of
the day, the ball goes in one hoop, you know. So for us, it was just being
ready, be prepared. We had a couple of days to prepare. Practice was crazy
good. A lot of guys communicating and talking. At the end of the day, we want
to win. We didn't really care about anything else but winning.  
  
So definitely us staying locked in, staying together, and just communication
is best. Guys were just flowing together, you know. No one wanted to be a ball
hog today and be a hero. That was something that really lightened my eyes as a
guy that didn't play much, but such an experience. A crazy experience and
something I will never forget.  
  
Q. Brandon, you mentioned that you wanted to win, but when you get some
time to kind of look back on this, you won the Big South Tournament, two road
games -- yeah, it wasn't happily ever after with Cinderella, but you were up
14 in the first half. Is it something you think, when you have a little time
and distance to look at, you'll be like, that was pretty amazing?  
BRANDON MILLER: It's amazing, but you don't want to settle for it. You want
more out of it. We're hungry for more. It's not enough to settle for it. Yeah,
we're up 14, and all of a sudden give up the lead. We're dogs. At the end of
the day, we want to keep pushing that lead as much as we can. It didn't go our
way like we wanted it to. They figured it out a little bit. This is just
motivation for the guys coming up next, especially for Jose and all of them.
They're going to stay hungry, and they'll be back next year for sure.  
  
Q. I know the end result was not what you wanted, but what does it mean
to each one of the players to have the opportunity to participate in March
Madness in an NCAA Tournament?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: It was a dream come true. As a player, you want to play at the
highest level, and March Madness is basically the high level in college. So
it's a dream come true for me and for all the guys just to be playing at the
highest level.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Yeah, like he said, just a great experience, like something I'll
never forget, something I could tell my kids that I participated in. It's just
good that we were able to do it for the school and do it for the community
also, and I just thank God just giving us the opportunity to play in this.
Just through success and failure, I still give God all the glory for just
giving us the opportunity to compete and play against the Number 1 seed and
showing that we can compete with them in the first half. We just let it go a
little bit. But still give God the glory through success and failure.  
  
BRANDON MILLER: For me, it's unforgettable. I could carry this on for the rest
of my life, and no one can take it from me. You can do what you want at the
end of the day, but we're Conference champs, made history at Gardner-Webb, and
that's something no one can take from us, and we take pride in that.  
  
I'm going to dream about this tonight for sure. It was a great experience, and
the fans have been amazing. There's no better way to go out senior year than
going to March Madness.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: Well, as a freshman playing in March Madness is like definitely a
dream come true, and being a part of it with these guys, they're like family,
especially Dave, D.J., and Brandon. Those are guys that in practice pushed me
every day, even when I was going through the motions sometimes. They just push
me to become better every day. We can compete with anybody. Unfortunately, we
didn't come out with the win today, though.  
  
Q. For you, Jose, obviously, those three seniors, you said pushed you.
You talked a lot about how the seniors have tried so hard to get to this
point. You've got a chance to come back. How much have you learned through
this process, and how much of their leadership will help going forward with
the program?  
JOSE PEREZ: I've learned a ton from them. They're like my role models, even
though I don't tell them because they'll probably pick on me for that. But,
yeah, I learned a lot from them on and off the court, like how to move and
stuff like that. It's just great. It's sad it had to end today, though.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Craft?  
  
Q. In the second half, as they decided to use their size to their
advantage a lot more, how difficult is it for your guys to cover a guy like
De'Andre Hunter, who is an NBA lottery pick, and they're able to really kind
of stretch out that floor?  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, I think it was difficult for everybody in the ACC this year
for the most part, so it was going to be a difficult challenge for us. We
ended up -- they did, they beat us up on the glass. I thought they made some
good adjustments, both offensively and defensively, to exploit some areas that
in the beginning of the first half, they weren't.  
  
But they were getting it on those pick-and-rolls like right to the block and
being able to kind of finish over our smaller size. And then when they missed
jumpers, they were getting them back a lot early. Credit those guys for
getting to the glass, for fighting on the glass. I was a little disappointed
with our effort on the defensive glass. I didn't think it was -- obviously,
not good enough. But I did think they made some good adjustments to kind of
get it to a spot that was hard for us to guard, and Hunter was -- yeah, he's a
monster for us to guard, and most of the country.  
  
Q. How did you approach halftime? What was going on in your mind, and
what did you tell the team?  
TIM CRAFT: We felt like we had a great half, obviously, and we talked about
some of the things that we felt like led to us getting stops and led to us
being able to get good shots and just kind of emphasized trying to continue to
do those things. We really emphasized trying to communicate defensively on
that far end because they weren't going to have our bench, you know, kind of
talking to them and calling things out and to try to stay connected there.  
  
I think in that first four minutes, I really thought that first four minutes
was going to be critical, whichever way it went. If we were able to make a run
there early, maybe we put a little pressure on them, but that didn't happen. I
thought, when they made a couple buckets and we struggled to score and had
some bad offensive possessions, then we started to break down defensively. We
started to give stuff up that we didn't give up in the first half. Some of
that was mental, just not responding to adversity in the way that we needed
to. That was unfortunate.  
  
But I thought that Virginia really made some great adjustments there to attack
us in some weak spots. But that's what we talked about at halftime. We just
tried to emphasize the game plan again, and we said, hey, let's try to do it
again for another 20 minutes.  
  
Q. At that point, the elephant in the room is you're leading the Number
1 seed. Did you address that at all, or was that all basketball?  
TIM CRAFT: No, it was just about, hey, here's what we've done well. In the
last four minutes, they got a couple offensive rebounds. We've got to keep
fighting on the glass. Here's the keys that we talked about before the game.
Let's make sure we're continuing to do these things well, and let's make sure
we stay connected down on that far end because we're not going to be in your
ear.  
  
And when they make a run because they're going to make a run, we'd better stay
together and be able to come back and have good offensive possessions.  
  
No, we're trying -- we came into the game, obviously, knowing we're playing a
great team, but we certainly came into the game with a game plan and with good
players that we felt like, if we have a chance to execute, we'll have a chance
in the end.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett referenced that last four minutes of the first half and
thought that kind of gave them a little bit of momentum. Surprised that you
started as well as you did? And did you think that that kind of shifted the
game's momentum?  
TIM CRAFT: Well, I wouldn't say I wasn't surprised necessarily. You hope to
start well. You prepare to play well. So when you play well, I don't think
that you're going to be surprised. But our guys played with a lot of
confidence. I think they -- I think probably them talking about some things in
time-outs, talking about some things at halftime as the game wore on and they
got a little bit of a rhythm guarding us, and they made some adjustments. They
started switching Jose Perez's pick-and-rolls, which he had made some threes
early. So that took his threes away. Then we were trying to post him on the
smaller, 0, Clark, their point guard, and they were doubling the post, and we
didn't handle that great.  
  
D.J. Laster had some success inside there early, and they began to double the
post. Their length bothered us when they came with the double-teams, and we
were getting passes deflected. Just our offensive rhythm was out of sorts.
That last three minutes, and I thought a lot of the second half as well.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 71, Gardner-Webb - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Virginia head coach Tony Bennett, accompanied by
student-athletes Kyle Guy, De'Andre Hunter, and Ty Jerome.  
  
TONY BENNETT: I thought the way these guys on the last part of the first half
to get it back to a six-point game was pivotal for us because Gardner-Webb's
good. They move hard. They're quick. We understood that. They had a great
backing, you could feel that.  
  
But I thought the way these guys came out and fought.  
  
And then the second half, there was a few adjustments that we did, but these
guys really stepped up and played, and that's a pressure, there's no doubt
about it. You know, when you're in that spot, you feel the crowd, but it's
something we had to go through. I'm glad I'm up here this year feeling a
little different than when I had Ty and Kyle with me last year.  
  
But it's the beauty of the tournament. You just don't know. But we played well
in the second half and the end of the first half, which we needed to do. I was
proud of these guys the way they responded when it got a little -- well, it
was just intense. That's the reality of it.  
  
Q. De'Andre, I know you said the other day you didn't really go through
your head what you could have contributed last season, but it sure looked like
you were trying to make up for lost time the second half. How much did you
take it upon yourself to make sure you guys were going to advance this time?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: I was just trying to score on the offense. I didn't play
outside of it. I just tried to be aggressive when my team needed me and make
shots.  
  
Q. What did you learn from last year's disappointment that you think
maybe helped to get you through the adversity that you went through first half
today?  
THE MODERATOR: Start with Ty.  
  
TY JEROME: That's crazy. The first thing is we came into this game knowing
real well we were going to be in for a battle. It wasn't going to be -- last
year was our first time being a 1 seed. So we came into this game knowing how
capable Gardner-Webb was going to be. They punched us in the mouth, but we
just said we've been in that position before. We were at Louisville down 14 or
15, and we came back and won that game.  
  
It's just about doing what we do, staying united, not looking around. Just
staying in the moment.  
  
KYLE GUY: We had an author come and talk to us last year, Joshua Medcalf, and
one of the things he said always stuck with me is be where your feet are. So
some of those outside pressures that can creep into our minds is all external,
and it comes from thinking too much about the future, too much about the past.
So we just tried to be where our feet were and positive reinforcement all the
time and stay united, like Ty said.  
  
Q. Ty and De'Andre, what kind of sparked your second halves, your second
half individual performances, was one of those situations where things kind of
snowballed for you when you saw some shots going. What was the spark for what
you guys were able to do in the second half?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: Like I said, I was just being more aggressive. Got some easy
buckets at the rim, got a couple and ones, got the energy going up. I felt
like that helped us in the second half, and he started to make shots, as well.
So I feel like those shots helped our team a lot.  
  
TY JEROME: For me it was coming out and being in attack mode, trying to touch
the paint and get guys shots. If the shots didn't fall, keep telling them keep
shooting them. As long as we get good shots, I could live with whatever
happened. I just told my guys to keep on the fly, especially Kyle. He's been
doing it all year. Key hit Kyle, Mamadi gave us a huge lift in the second
half, and like you said, Dre was great. The main thing was stops. We knew, if
we could get stops, the ball would eventually go in. So for us, it was really
about getting spots.  
  
Q. At each time-out, it seemed like Coach Bennett was saying things to
keep you calm and keep your heads in the game. What was he saying during the
first half, and what did you guys talk about at halftime that enabled you to
come out and play as you did at the start of the second half?  
KYLE GUY: These answers are going to become redundant, but that's what got us
through the game. Like Ty said, we knew we were in for a battle, and Coach
reminded us that we already knew that, and we've stood the test of time. Now
we're just playing our game and staying in attack mode and getting stops and
getting good looks, and we'll live with the outcome.  
  
TY JEROME: Every time-out, we had a different mindset because, I mean, I
remember last year, halftime against UMBC, one of our coaches came in
screaming at us, and we -- (laughter).  
  
TONY BENNETT: I was out there doing an interview. So it wasn't me.  
  
TY JEROME: We felt their panic last year at halftime, and that was one thing I
remember, not doing a good job keeping everyone calm. That's what I pride
myself on, too. Every time-out, it's just a matter of keeping guys calm,
keeping guys calm, but also keeping our edge. You've got to find a balance.
You can't come out, everything's going to be okay, stay calm. Just trying to
find the right balance of staying calm and keeping our edge.  
  
Q. De'Andre, after one of your three-pointers, you sort of spread your
arms really wide and smiled. After not being able to play in this tournament
last year, how gratifying was it for you to be able to contribute and hit some
of those three-pointers?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: It was great. I was having fun. As Kyle said, I was just
being in the moment, being where my feet were in. I was happy because I was
missing some, and when I made that one, I was really excited.  
  
Q. Just want to ask Ty, you mentioned Mamadi. Talk about his development
offensively, and do you look for him more now than you did maybe earlier in
the year?  
TY JEROME: I think the biggest difference -- first of all, we don't
necessarily look for certain people. We're never going to not throw a ball to
somebody that's open, you know what I mean? For us, it's just about getting
the best shot we possibly can. But I think the biggest difference, what I was
most proud of Mamadi for, he did something today, and I don't know he could
have done it at the beginning of the year. He came out and had a shaky start,
and the way he responded was huge for us. We needed every bit of it, and
that's something he definitely couldn't do last year, and that's just a
testament to his growth as a person, really, more than a player, just his
ability to respond and fight through adversity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Tony, was that a conscious thing to try to stay a little calmer and
keep everybody a little calmer in the halftime locker room this time around?
And what was your message?  
TONY BENNETT: It was a different halftime than last time. It was just the
ability because I thought we had fought back, as I mentioned, at the end of
the first half, to get ourselves in a spot where there was a lot of basketball
left. It was one thing I said to my staff, and we just talked right before we
went in there. I said, uplift them, and we talked about don't panic, but play
with fight, because that's what got them back in.  
  
When you look at the stat sheet, I think the difference was some offensive
rebounds, some scrambling for loose balls. We had ten steals. I don't know how
many we had in the second half versus the first half. Yes, we made some
adjustments that I think helped the guys out there, but it was, you know,
don't you dare leave anything in this locker room. You don't panic, but you
play the right way with, I guess -- I don't know if calm is the right word,
but I thought that they did that with the fight. Last year, you could feel
that. You could feel it at the game. You ask any coach who's been in that
game, and it gets tight and we're the only one who's really experienced the
other side of it, but that's real stuff.  
  
I thought the guys just kept plugging, and Gardner-Webb missed some shots.
Maybe they got fatigued. I thought the resolve of our team was good to weather
that storm and have a good second half.  
  
Q. You guys outscored them 22-5 to start the second half. To build that
lead, it looked like you were attacking inside. Was that part of your strategy
at halftime?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, we wanted to give them something where they could be
assertive and not mix things up, and say run this, run that. Just here's our
base and play out of it, and get on the glass. I thought we did that. If
there's something inside, yes, try to get to the lane. Then, obviously, some
shots went down, and it was definitely part of it. We had to, without forcing
or taking too many bad shots. So I thought there was a good balance.  
  
Q. What did you know about Gardner-Webb, and what did they do that was
so effective for them early on?  
TONY BENNETT: I knew -- one of our assistant coaches, Kyle Getter, was at
Liberty with Coach McKay. Just watching them play, I watched them against
Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, even Virginia Tech. They didn't have D.J. the first
half against them. But then in the tournament, how -- when you play teams that
are five guards or four guards that shoot 40 percent from the three, their
offense is fast. They slip ball screens. That was hard. We tried to prepare as
well as we could, and we struggled. I think the nerves were there, but they
were banging shots and had us chasing, and they did a good job defensively.  
  
So we had all the respect. Those guys said it right. You know that. Certain
teams in matchups are challenging. I mean, they all are at this level, but
that's a tough one. You don't play a lot of teams like that in the ACC. Their
quickness was noticeable, how fast they played offensively, and then again we
turned it over. We were a little tight, I think, early with our turnovers, and
all of that started feeding in. In some ways it felt like a road game with the
crowd, too. Being less than two hours, Gardner-Webb people came out and
supported them, but the Virginia faithful were there, too. You had a lot of
those dynamics going. Much respect for Coach Craft. He's good, really good.  
  
Q. Tony, do you feel like today's win kind of, I don't know, gets you
past what happened last year, and now these guys maybe can relax a little bit
and play in the NCAA Tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Did you watch Oklahoma play? I didn't get to watch it, but my
staff said they were impressive. So that will always be part of our story. I
understand that. I'm sure a lot of people thought it was going to be part of
our story the second year in a row. But it's just now, this is a new year.
This is trying to be in the moment, and that's a challenge to the best of your
ability. So now you get your rest, you prepare for Oklahoma, and get ready.  
  
So I'll tell you that after the game on Sunday, but I think it was important
for those guys, a lot of them were hoping to be in this position again, and
they stepped to the challenge even though it was a little wobbly at times.  
  
Q. Tony, you were talking about scrambling for loose balls and being
more aggressive. One guy who seemed to be really doing that quite a bit was
Kihei. Would you mind talking about what he gave you today and what Mamadi
gave you today?  
TONY BENNETT: When you go against these quick teams, you have to sometimes
match the quickness to the best of your abilities. Last year, we didn't have
Kihei or De'Andre, so that allowed us to be a little more versatile to match
their quickness and then to switch some of those ball screens. I thought his
competitiveness and his ability to come up with loose balls was significant --
banged a three, just did some things that were good. He played, obviously,
very poised and well for a first-year.  
  
And then Mamadi, I think Ty hit it on the head, and it wasn't all Mamadi's
fault. It was just a little hard early, getting used to their pace. Again, we
made some adjustments that helped him defensively, but, boy, he really did a
good job on the glass playing hard, finishing some stuff, and that lift was
huge because you have to get some easy baskets. You can't just live and die by
the three. I thought we tried to do a little better this time.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have our student-athletes from North Dakota State
University. We'll introduce the athletes. Tyson Ward, Deng Geu, Jared
Samuelson, and Vinnie Shahid.  
  
Q. Is this now the dream or the nightmare scenario for you?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It's another basketball game. For 40 minutes, we're going to
compete and plan on winning.  
  
JARED SAMUELSON: We're really excited for this opportunity, obviously, to go
out and compete and play another game.  
  
DENG GEU: Every opportunity to play March Madness is still part of the dream.
Just come at it like another basketball game. Just come ready to compete.  
  
TYSON WARD: What they said.  
  
Q. Guys, you're 5-0 in March. What is it about this month where you
seemingly figured it out and are playing such good basketball?  
TYSON WARD: Every game is a big game, no matter who you're playing against. 40
minutes are up on the clock, and you know you don't want to go home. You put
that in your mind and put it in the game plan, you don't want to go home. You
just set your jaw and get ready for a good game.  
  
DENG GEU: I think it's a win or go home factor. It brings out everyone's
competitiveness and you play to the best of your ability.  
  
JARED SAMUELSON: We're just playing our best basketball right now, which is
obviously what you want in late March. So hopefully, we can keep that up.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: I think we're doing a good job of hammering the details and
staying in the moment. March is a fun time of year, and you can see our guys
are having fun playing the game in the month of March.  
  
Q. Tyson, growing up in the southeast, did you watch Duke a lot growing
up and one of those kids who always wanted to be a Blue Devil?  
TYSON WARD: They're always on TV, always a good game to watch. Always have a
great competition, great team. Wherever I could go, whoever gave me the
opportunity to play was going to be the place where I'd be, and North Dakota
State was the place to be.  
  
Q. So how do you put that aside and just try to treat them like another
team then?  
TYSON WARD: Just exactly like you said, just treat them as another team. It's
40 minutes on the clock. It's 0-0, ball's tipped, and you just play
basketball, do something that you've been doing for your whole life.  
  
Q. Tyson, can you speak to Sam Griesel's growth this year? True freshman
coming in and has improved seemingly throughout the season. Can you talk a
little bit to that?  
TYSON WARD: He's been big time. You can tell he's been in the gym a lot this
year. A couple of the guys have taken him into the gym personally and just
hammered some things with him. He's willing to listen and get better and do
everything it takes to help this team out. It's a true testament to what he's
been doing on and off the court. You can see that it's been reflecting into
this late March, and he's been playing real well.  
  
Q. Vinnie, can you just take us through your travel the last couple of
days? Normal, or has it been a little bit hectic?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It's travel. There were some late nights. Definitely not an
excuse for tomorrow when the ball tips up. It's definitely a little different
for us, but there's definitely no excuse there.  
  
Q. Did you get here today or last night?  
VINNIE SHAHID: Last night.  
  
Q. Deng, how do you try to match up with Williamson, just the sheer
size?  
DENG GEU: I think just come out and compete. Don't know what's going to
happen, but you just come out and play as hard as you can and at the end, see
what happens.  
  
Q. This question's for Vinnie. Vinnie, a lot has been made that not a
lot was expected of this team going into this season. What was your guys'
expectation as a team meeting in fall ball? Was it to be here in March
Madness?  
VINNIE SHAHID: Definitely. I think we saw this plan at the beginning of June.
When we came together as a family, we saw this happening. Through the ups and
downs, many people were like, they're too young, they can't do this. But I
think our locker room stayed together, and we definitely kept our mind on the
goal at stake, was to get here to March Madness, and not only to get here but
to win some games.  
  
Q. I know you guys have said it's just another game. Has there been any
talk at all in the locker room or from the coaches? You're going to face Coach
Krzyzewski tomorrow, you're going to face Duke. Bill Raftery and Jim Nantz are
out there calling the game. Has there been any talk at all about the bright
lights and the focus?  
VINNIE SHAHID: We're aware. We're human. Anybody that doesn't think about it
or tells you that they don't think about it, they're lying to you because
we're human and we do think about it. At the end of the day, like Tyson said
earlier, when the ball goes up and it tips, it's something we've all been
doing our whole lives, 40 minutes goes on the clock, and it's the basketball
game.  
  
Q. Tyson, just take us through the experience so far of going through
the Selection Sunday, traveling to Dayton, now here in Columbia. What's the
experience been like for you here so far?  
TYSON WARD: It's every college basketball player's dream. You know you put in
a lot of work from when you're a young kid. You fill out your brackets, and
you're like, man, I really want to be on a team to play in the NCAA Tournament
and win some games. It's a dream come true. It's just been surreal. Sharing
this moment with these guys and just being able to live in the moment, it's
just been great and a great opportunity, and I've been blessed -- we've been
blessed to share this journey.  
  
Q. Tyson, can you speak a little bit to the job that Coach Richman has
done this year. Again, these guys have touched on the expectations maybe
weren't high to start the season, but you're playing your best ball now. What
has Coach Richman done to get you to this point?  
TYSON WARD: Been doing the same thing, just getting us better in every
practice. Making sure we're making our way with Coach Miller and just doing
the little things because that's what really keeps us to think about the
little things, the things that have gotten us here. Just constantly hammering
on us like, hey, defense, defense, defense. Just little things. That's really
all I can say is just hammering the little things.  
  
Q. Jared, what's this team's mentality been like shooting from beyond
the arc? Just the ability to hit three-pointers and being able to get to the
rim and space the floor? How has that been an attribute the last couple
games?  
JARED SAMUELSON: Shot selection is big for us on offense. We're confident
shooters out there. We've been working in the gym and stuff like that. We have
confidence in ourselves, and that's how you become a good shooter. We've been
doing a good job of sharing the ball, setting each other up, and just got to
rise up and knock it down.  
  
Q. Deng, your season, the international experience, can you sum it up a
little bit in the last several months?  
DENG GEU: This summer I got the opportunity to compete for the Uganda national
team in the FIBA World Cup qualifiers. It was a great experience, just going
out there, meeting new people, and getting a taste of professional basketball.
I think it really helped me this season with confidence and just slowing down
the game.  
  
Q. Did you face anybody the caliber of what you might be seeing tomorrow
in the tournament?  
DENG GEU: Yeah, there was a couple of NBA guys on the Nigeria team, but
obviously, Duke has some really good talent. So I think so.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
North Dakota State head coach, David Richman. Opening statement, and then
we'll open the floor for questions.  
  
DAVID RICHMAN: A few more people here than Dayton the other day. Obviously,
we're extremely excited to be here, unbelievable opportunity and unbelievable
challenge for us tomorrow night. We stressed to the guys along the way, going
back to the Thursday before we left for the summer league tournament, that
make sure you embrace this journey. We talked about that all year, but make
sure you stay in the moment. Enjoy this along the way, but also come 7:10
tomorrow night, be ready to compete.  
  
Obviously, against a team that I don't really need to explain. Duke is Duke.
Coach K is Coach K, and the success that he's had, a lot of challenges, a lot
of just great opportunities for us. We'll be excited and ready to compete
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You're a guy that spent almost your entire life in North Dakota. I
think you went to Northern Iowa for a little bit, and tomorrow night you're
going to be coaching against Coach Krzyzewski on the biggest stage. Can you
just put that in perspective, what that means for a North Dakota kid?  
DAVID RICHMAN: It's obviously really, really cool. I think at the end of the
day, you are who you are because of your roots. I was raised by two wonderful
people. My mom and dad, John and Marsha, and my sister, great family that
really is the core of who I am. Again, hopefully who I am is a guy of
tremendous virtue.  
  
But to be on this stage tomorrow night, CBS, to coach against obviously a Hall
of Famer, a legend, I don't know if I could have dreamt this, Mike, a couple
years ago.  
  
Q. Are you ready for it?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Absolutely. Ready or not, here it comes. With a great challenge
comes a great opportunity, and certainly, I'm going to be ready for it, and I
know our guys will, as well.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to talk to Coach Krzyzewski?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I have not had a chance to talk to Coach.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, when you go up in a matchup like this against a
team with future NBA players, a guy like Zion, who's obviously taken over
college basketball. Do you, as a coach, kind of view this as a stressful,
challenging situation or something you're excited about? How do I scheme
against these guys? How do I make this come together?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Coach Miles, the guy who I started working with, said when he
left college, he got into college coaching because of the environment and the
experience of college. I get the narrative about stress and all this, but this
is fun. You think about it. We get to play college basketball. We get to coach
college basketball. So I think maybe, if there was any pressure, it was the
other night, Wednesday night, in Dayton for some of our guys to just
experience that, but that's gone away, and we're all excited for the
opportunity.  
  
Q. Dave, facing Duke, I think Vinnie sort of addressed this, saying
we're human. Any fear of deer in the headlights with your guys, a team with no
seniors?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I was just thinking about that. They don't have any seniors
either. Really, again, I think we just kind of addressed that in the last
question a little bit. I think some of that deer in the headlights, I did see
a little bit of that the other night against a really good North Carolina
Central team, and I think some of that's gone. We expect a lot of pressure
from Duke. We expect them to come out, teed up, ready to go, like the Number 1
seed would. We'll see. I think it's important, like we've stressed to them all
along, the quicker you can figure out you're doing something you've done your
entire life, the quicker your chances of success will be.  
  
Q. Coach, whether it's at a shootaround or even having the guys on stage
before you came up, there's a certain chemistry and camaraderie among the
guys. Was that something that was present from the start of the season? Did it
develop throughout the season? What was Vinnie's role in all of that?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I was thinking about that. It really has, and it really went
back to about May, early June, when our guys went on an FCS like week long
deal in the twin cities and really formed a great bond. There was a great
bunch of eight guys that stuck around in the spring and had a tremendous
spring. And then they welcomed and embraced those six new guys with open arms.
For a guy like Vinnie to come in and to be named captain five, six weeks,
maybe a couple months into it is pretty darn neat.  
  
But you can see his personality. You can see his smile. You can see his sense
for the moment that his guys embrace him, and he embraces them real quick.  
  
Q. What changes have you seen in Sam Griesel throughout the year, from
the start of the year, true freshman up until last night, I guess?  
DAVID RICHMAN: One of the biggest things with Sam is Vinnie. It makes more
sense to me when you're there at 6:00 a.m. in the morning for lifting sessions
and just different things, where Vinnie just breeds confidence in everybody,
myself included. When we were able to get Sam in late May, we knew we had
something really special. That's a young man that looks the part, just attacks
his job with great resolve every day. He's been more invested in the weight
room and the diet and those things than I anticipated.  
  
But I think you could see from the moment we started him, that he was going to
be pretty good. Then he had that injury, and I think it was really telling,
when he came back in that Omaha game, that he didn't play great, but he didn't
play with fear. If you think about it, sitting there with five, six weeks with
a knee injury like that, he could have been hesitant. He's grown. He's come
out of his shell a little bit socially, been more comfortable, getting
outward. I think a big part of that is Vinnie and his teammates just breathing
confidence into him all the time.  
  
Q. You played Gonzaga as a Number 1 team, in Spokane in late November.
Do you use that game as a template at all coming into this game at least from
a mindset point of view?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Maybe the first ten minutes. That's it. We had a lot of other
extenuating circumstances at the time, some tough travel. Sam was out. It's a
game where Cameron got hurt. But also, I think it showed us that for the first
ten minutes, when we were locked in and fresh, so to speak, we can compete. We
know that we're a different team. Duke's obviously got more experience now
than they did at that time of the year, like Gonzaga would this time of year.
But there's certainly some things I hope we can lean on.  
  
Q. Dave, how much did Dayton, the first four game, just kind of help get
the taste in the mouth of your team in understanding what an NCAA Tournament
atmosphere is like?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I'm hoping it helped a lot. I saw some things that, again, I've
said it all along about this group. This is an experience group. What I mean
by that is you can talk to them about the experience, you can show them
experience, and they don't quite get it until they actually live the
experience. Wednesday night was them living the experience. Hopefully, that
will help us relax, get that deer in the headlights out of us, so to speak,
early in the game.  
  
Q. Who's the toughest guy on your team to say let's just play
basketball, let's just go out there and play a game?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Jared Samuelson; no hesitation. If you go into our video room,
there's a big sign that talks about being tough and together. Jared Samuelson
is tough, and he's together. His teammates love him. You've really got
something in the huddle. Jared doesn't say much at all, but when you get into
some of those moments, you go back to Santa Barbara at home, you go back to
the other night, last night, when he's teed up and he's locked in, it's pretty
cool because his teammates really embrace that, and it starts with his
toughness.  
  
Q. Follow up on that Dave, we like to talk about Jared's three-point
ability, but how about his ability to take charges? Smallest guy out there,
and he's diving on the floor getting burns. Just talk about his tenacity
defensively?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I think that's the beauty of March. If you flipped open a
dictionary and looked for a Division I basketball player, Jared Samuelson is
probably not the first guy that shows up. What you can't measure is somebody's
heart. What you can't measure is someone's basketball IQ. From the time you
saw Jared at a camp three or four summers ago until today, in a sense, it's
really not surprising. He's a guy that we talk about setting our jaw and just
competing. Jared sets his jaw every day. Not just in games, but in practice
and film sessions. He's at the edge of his seat.  
  
And in a kid that we couldn't hide more his first or second year trying to
guard the ball, now he's guarding the opponents' best perimeter guy. It's a
pretty neat deal.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe the biggest game in the history of North Dakota as far
as a sporting event. With so many eyeballs back home watching on CBS tomorrow
night, what would be your message to the people back home who are tuning in
and maybe seeing the Bison for the first time this year?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Hopefully, we represent the people back home. North Dakota is a
great state, and I like to say this, it's a state that for three, four months
out of the year gets really cold, but that keeps the riff-raff out, and it
adds some toughness. I think what you'll see tomorrow and I think what you've
seen the last back end of the year, when we've got some experience on these
guys, is a blue collar mentality. In Fargo, North Dakota, West Fargo, the Red
River Valley, Moorhead, the State of North Dakota, there's some tremendous
people with great resolve and toughness, and hopefully that's what this Bison
men's basketball team looks like, as well.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from Virginia Commonwealth University,
Marcus Evans, De'Riante Jenkins, Marcus Santos-Silva and Issac Vann. Please
introduce yourself and let us know your affiliation.  
  
Q. Marcus, can you give us an update on how the knee's feeling, what
you've been able to do this week?  
MARCUS EVANS: It's feeling better each day, still day-to-day. I got in
practice today and got moving a lot. So it's starting to feel better. I'm
looking forward to Friday.  
  
Q. Marcus, how would you describe your evolution over the last year or
so, especially as a defensive player? From your time at Rice now to your time
with Coach Rhoades at VCU.  
MARCUS EVANS: I think it's changed a lot. In the off-season, we all decided to
buy in. We knew defensively, it was a thing we had to improve on. In practice
especially, with a team as talented as this, you're going against guys every
day who are just as good as you. As the season progressed, we knew that was
going to be the key to our season. I just took it more personally as the
season went on.  
  
Q. This is for De'Riante. You're one of the few players on the team who
was in the 2017 tournament with that team. What was it like last year not to
be in the tournament, and what is it that you guys would like to accomplish
and prove to people this year?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: The feeling was strange to sit home watching the games on
TV, wishing you were out there and knowing the things you've got to work on
and improve just to get to this point in the season. We're just going to play
our style of basketball, and that's going to take care of itself.  
  
Q. De'Riante, you're one of the few that have played on this court in
high school. What do you remember about those state championship games and the
memories you have? Pretty good ones when you guys beat Newberry.  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Yes, it was a great feeling. The second year we lost, so I
just tried to redeem myself and get the good feeling in the crowd and in the
locker room, and everyone just feeling that, and we have to go from there.  
  
Q. Marcus, just talking about the knee, you say it's getting better
every day. Do you feel limited in any way, in any activities you have to do?
Do you feel limited, and are there still improvements you think you can make
before game time?  
MARCUS EVANS: Obviously, I'm still working each day rehabbing, but I haven't
felt anything to hold me back so far, and everything I've been doing,
obviously, it's hard to simulate a game situation until you're out there, but
like I said, I've been feeling better each day, and we're all just looking
forward to Friday.  
  
Q. Marcus, as you look at the matchup with Tacko Fall and that,
particularly the size difference, how do you prepare for something like that,
and what do you see from him on film?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Just focus on what he's good at, and, of course, he's
really tall, and just do what I've been doing the whole season. I feel like
I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Is there any matchup you can compare to that one?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: No, not at all.  
  
Q. De'Riante, what has Marcus brought to VCU basketball this year that
perhaps you guys didn't have last season when he was sitting out and also
hurt?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Competitive edge. He's a tough player. We know we get out
of him every single night. He's going to heat the ball up and bring his
energy. We feed off of him every single night.  
  
Q. For anyone other than Marcus Evans, how important is having him in
this game? And how difficult or challenging is it to have the uncertainty of
maybe not knowing how full strength he might be?  
ISSAC VANN: He's an important part of our offense and defense. It's huge.
Whether he plays or not, we know if he plays, we know what he's going to
bring. If not, we know he's going to be a huge supporter on the bench.  
  
Q. Again for Marcus, you talked about Tacko Fall and how it's difficult
-- you can't compare it to anything. Have you tried to simulate that in
practice? You've got like broomsticks or ladders or something like that?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: We've been simulating it in practice. One of our
assistant coaches, Coach Scott, he's been practicing too because he's really
tall and big. We've used like pads to simulate him blocking shots. But nothing
really until you actually play the game.  
  
Q. Question for I.V. We've heard a lot about Tacko, but what has Coach
Rhoades stressed to you this week? What has Coach Rhoades stressed to you
about what UCF does well?  
ISSAC VANN: We've just got to move the ball. Once their defense is set, we
know they're a solid defensive team. We can't play one-on-one basketball.
We've got to get the ball hot and move from side to side, do what we do.  
  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Also, pressuring them when they're on offense, and don't
let them get comfortable at all and just deny everything. Then just do what we
do, and we'll be fine.  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: He's big on style of play. It's a style of play game, he
said. Their style of play versus our style of play, and which one is going to
win over.  
  
MARCUS EVANS: I mean, they said it all, yeah.  
  
Q. Marcus Evans, we've never really heard what exactly happened that
injured the knee. Did you just land awkwardly on it and something went out?  
MARCUS EVANS: Yeah, when I came down, kind of hyperextended it. Obviously,
with my history, I didn't know exactly what it was until we got in the back,
and our trainer kind of informed me everything was still intact. Then like I
said, just this whole week he's been great with me, just rehabbing, just
trying to get me back to feeling 100 percent.  
  
Q. Marcus, was there ever much doubt that you were going to have a
reunion with Coach Rhoades after he left Rice for VCU and considering how
close it is to home for you?  
MARCUS EVANS: Yeah, when I left Rice, I obviously looked around, was looking
for the best opportunity, but after talking to some coaches and narrowing down
the list, having an opportunity to come home was huge for me. And then like I
said, the familiarity of VCU and the coaching staff kind of just made sense.  
  
Q. For all you guys, VCU sort of launched as a brand, as a big underdog
story. Now all these years later, and you guys have been to a number of
tournaments, do you still feel like you have any of that underdog persona when
you think nationally? Or do you think you're more of an established brand at
this point?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Definitely yes. I feel like people still doubt us of
things we can do. I feel like this whole season we've been doubted a lot. We
definitely feel like we're still the underdog and still need to prove to
people who we are.  
  
ISSAC VANN: Definitely. Going into each and every game, we've got an underdog
mindset, even before the season, we were picked seventh and ninth. We've seen
the disrespect all year. That's just a mindset we have every day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: De'Riante or Marcus, you want to add to that?  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: No, they pretty much said it all. That's just who VCU is.
That's what we feed off of, and that's how we built this from dudes in the
past until now as the underdog.  
  
Q. De'Riante, the NCAA's new metric this season ranks your nonconference
schedule among the top five in the country. How did those games prepare you
for not only the Atlantic 10 season, but perhaps this stage, as well?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: We learned each game. We learned each game, and we use each
game as a measuring stick and come back in practice and just learn. In
conference play, it helped us. We seen ourself in those situations in
conference play, and we just learned from it.  
  
Q. For Marcus or De'Riante or both, BJ Taylor, their point guard, what
do you see out of him? What type of player do you think he is?  
MARCUS EVANS: He's a crafty guard. Obviously, he's strong. One of the things
that we realize is he draws a lot of fouls. So the thing about it is just
being disciplined when we guard him. Keep the ball in front. Any good player
is going to make tough shots, so you can't be discouraged if he hits a few
shots. You just try to make it tough for him, make him take tough shots every
game, and we'll be fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: De'Riante?  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Marcus said everything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for our student-athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
VCU head coach Mike Rhoades.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Just really excited to be here. Appreciate everyone and their
hospitality. It's been great. Our guys are excited. They can't wait to play.
We've got a long wait tomorrow, but we're looking forward to being a part of
March Madness.  
  
Q. Mike, can you talk about what you've done in practice to simulate
Tacko Fall's size and height, and how you prepare the guys for that?  
MIKE RHOADES: I wish we could say we got up on a chair with some broomsticks,
but you can't really move very well that way. We've just did a couple drills
like that, when we talk about awareness drills of teams we play who have a
different style or a different player or somebody with great size or great
quickness. We talk about breaking down parts of the game, and we call them
awareness drills, to be aware of a really fast player like a Briante Weber
guarding you or a guy like Tacko Fall around the rim that you're not just
going to go in and shoot a finger roll. That's not going to happen.  
  
So a couple of awareness drills for guys to understand it's got to be on the
front of their mind when they're playing in the heat of the game, without a
doubt. A lot of it is prepare for the opponent, but it's all about us and
making sure we're ready to go.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
MIKE RHOADES: We had a guy on our team like that, like Larry Sanders, where if
you're going to attack somebody that big and they're waiting for you and ready
for you, it's probably not a good decision. We've got to play they way we do
with our style of play and move that ball and be fast and do what we always
do, try to get our opponent chasing and being a step or two late. But if
they're standing there waiting, it's not going to work.  
  
Q. Larry Sanders is 6'11 ", and he's still seven inches shorter than
Tacko Fall.  
MIKE RHOADES: Right.  
  
Q. Could you talk a moment about how you got Marcus Evans to Rice, how
your relationship with him has grown over the years, and the defensive impact
he's had on your team this year?  
MIKE RHOADES: When I was an assistant with Coach Smart, of course, we always
recruited that area of the 757, and Marcus was an underclassman at Great
Bridge when I was recruiting Briante Weber. I knew of Marcus. I knew he played
for the Boo Williams AAU program, which is one of the best in the country. I
just kept an eye on him, kept a tag on him, and he kept getting better every
year. He wasn't the shooter that he is now, but he was just a dynamic type of
guard the way he moved, and stayed in touch with him and his coaches.  
  
Then when the Rice -- we were recruiting him and staying in touch with him
when I was an assistant at VCU, but when all that went down with Rice and I
was going there, he was one of the first phone calls -- I think I called him
before I called and offered some assistant coaches a job. I think it was a
good move. And just the neat thing about Marcus is his competitive spirit, his
competitive edge. I knew it would fit my personality really well, and I
thought then, and I still feel it now, but probably his greatest strength is
he just has a competitive spirit that his teammates catch, too. That's the
biggest thing.  
  
You see that when he plays defense ball. He can guard the ball different ways,
but he can just constantly put pressure on the game with his defensive
pressure and his knack. I guess there's something in the water at Great Bridge
because on-the-ball defense, we've been very fortunate at VCU to have some
guys from Great Bridge that can really guard the ball and pressure the game
and impact the game just by his defensive presence.  
  
Q. Obviously, forcing turnovers is big for you guys, so what are your
impressions of their guards, BJ Taylor and Terrell Allen?  
MIKE RHOADES: Very good players. You can't play in that conference with a
really good team -- be a really good team and play against all those other
guards if you can't hold your own and do more. BJ is a really talented player.
I remember him for a number of years now. He can make plays. He's strong. He
handles the ball. He's an upperclassman. Allen can really play and handle the
ball. Everybody can handle the ball. Guards are really good when you get to
this point in the year, without a doubt, and they've seen all types of
defenses. It doesn't mean you're just going to turn somebody over and get a
steal every time down the court, but that's just what we do. We play. We want
to have great pressure and mess things up for the other team as best we can,
but you're playing against really good players, too, so number one, you've got
to respect them, and you've got to have a plan against them. But also, we're
going to do what we do, and hopefully, that's enough.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke about this year being a learning experience. Is
there any team that you can go back to in your nonconference schedule or
regular conference season that has a style or tendency of UCF? Anything look
similar or familiar?  
MIKE RHOADES: I think Temple, playing Temple early in the year is similar with
that, the way they play, and the two games that they played against each
other. You saw some similar tendencies. And probably some of the teams in our
league are similar with really strong guards, confident guards, and then
really solid around the rim and guys that can make plays.  
  
So we've played a really tough schedule, and I think all our games this year
really helped us. We had some games where we got the style of play going. We
had some games where we had to grind it out, some games we didn't shoot the
ball well but our defense showed up. Hopefully, all those experiences help us.
There are some teams similar. I would think Temple is one of them, for sure,
and then I think it's more about preparing for whoever you play in the NCAA
Tournament. You've got to make sure your team's right, more important than the
plan itself.  
  
Q. What did Marcus Evans' workload look like over the last day or so,
and what will it look like over the next 24 hours for Friday night?  
MIKE RHOADES: He's worked really hard. He's rehabbed. He's pretty much lived
in the training room since Saturday. Each day has been a little bit better.
Workload, probably more today than he has all week. Probably tomorrow, we'll
move him around a little bit and shoot around. We'll see where he is. He's not
100, but he's going to give it a shot, and we'll see from there.  
  
Q. Mike, how good does it feel to be here after not being here last year
for the first time since 2011? And how tough is it to be in the 8-9 matchup
where neither team is really favored, neither team is really an underdog?
Since '85, it's 68-68 in those games. What do you want to prove, and what can
you prove from that spot?  
MIKE RHOADES: Just to be back here -- I said this numerous times throughout
the year. We had to go through a year like last year for us to sort of
recalibrate who we are. You have to go through some stuff to build your
culture. You have to go through some stuff that you don't always like to build
the program the way you want it. I'm not saying we got spoiled because this is
something we want to do all the time, but we've got to make sure we're always
doing it the right way on and off the court and that we're never taken it for
granted.  
  
I think this year everybody is very appreciative the position we're in, but I
think it was -- the reason we're here is because of all the work these guys
did in the spring of last year, the summer and the fall, when nobody was
watching, when the lights weren't on. That's what I'm most proud about. That's
building and working on our culture, which if you have that, then it gives you
a better chance to get to the NCAA Tournament each year.  
  
On top of that, I think the experience of this season, we probably surprised
some people and then kept getting better and better. That gives us confidence
to go in a tournament, whatever your seeding is. 8-9, you're exactly right,
very similar teams, but it's about how we prepare and how we go about it. We
played some really good teams. We played a bunch of teams that are in the NCAA
Tournament. So I think our guys are going to be really excited, but I don't
think they'll be nervous. I think they really want to play, and they deserve
it for sure.  
  
Q. If you're facing a team that's got a really dominant left-handed
player -- and, obviously, you're going to go over that in the scouting report
-- but do you find that still, sometimes guys in the heat of the battle, that
kind of eludes them a little bit, and they might shade towards the right hand
accidentally?  
MIKE RHOADES: Yeah, absolutely. Sometimes you do all the scouting report, and
then the ball goes up, the scouting report's out the window. We've all been
there. If you coach long enough, you see it. But we talk about having
awareness all the time. You might do it once because we shoot for a perfect
game, but you're not playing a perfect game. But if you make a mistake, own
it, have awareness, and move on. When you have a clear mind and clear head and
your teammates are helping you, that's maybe when you don't make that mistake
a second and third time. If you make it a second and third time this time of
the year, your season's usually over.  
  
So we talk about having great awareness, and when something doesn't go our
way, own it, move on, and play with a clear head.  
  
Q. Have you found in your experience that lefties tend to use both hands
better than righties do?  
MIKE RHOADES: We really talk -- in our scouting report, we really talk about
personnel and who we're guarding and stuff like that, so our guys know. We're
really big on talking about the scouting report and personnel. So it's just
not a report that the coach gives because he's supposed to do that. We want to
get to a point in our program where our juniors and seniors are pretty much
running the scouting report and personnel and holding their teammates
accountable. We're getting there. We saw that throughout the year.  
  
So tendencies of players, I know a lot of good players that are righty but go
better left because that's what the coaches tell you at a young age and vice
versa. We've got to work on it. We show our guys a lot of tape. We do a lot of
stuff on the court when it comes to personnel of other teams, and we want to
make sure they own the scouting report from that way.  
  
Q. Obviously, the NCAA Tournament is a goal for so many players. Once
they get here, what is the mental preparation like both from an individual
basis and as a team, especially for guys who haven't been here yet, to make
sure they're focused and ready to go for tip-off?  
MIKE RHOADES: You know what's greater than getting in the NCAA Tournament,
winning a game in the NCAA Tournament. Look, their whole lives, these players,
they're pushed. Their first goal is to be a Division I player and get a full
scholarship to get a free education; check. Then the next thing, they want to
go to a basketball school where they can win a championship; check. Then they
want to make the NCAA Tournament; check. You know what's better than all that?
Taking your teammates that you love to be with, your brothers that you're
going to have for the rest of your life, and going in the NCAA Tournament and
winning games. Why not go after that? That's the fun of it. I think you've got
to get your team excited about being here, but go win. That's why we're here.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, it didn't result in a win, but losing Marcus last
Friday night, but seeing Issac Vann, seeing De'Riante talk to the team, work
those guys around, communication was key. What did your team -- what did you
find out about your team in that moment on the fly last Friday?  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, there was definitely a level of fight, and the guys were
trying to figure it out. I think some of the guys were really nervous for
Marcus because they thought it was like a career-ending injury. They're
thinking of the worst, and that took some time for them to figure that out.  
  
But we've been through some crazy battles, and some of these guys have been
through some coaching changes, some players leaving. Last year Issac Vann
played with a bad leg all year and then got surgery. We had another guy get
surgery. We had some crazy things happen last year. We went through it, not
the results we want in the end, and they've all matured. Now there's another
thing that occurred in the A-10 Tournament last weekend. Figure it out, deal
with it, move on. You saw that during the game.  
  
Now, we didn't win the game and disappointed, but what more do we have? Now
we're here in the NCAA Tournament. What more do we have to give each other?  
  
Q. Probably more of a dilemma for your fans, but with a 9:40 tip
tomorrow night, you guys have only had two or three 9:00 tips this year. How
do you manage time, energy, and emotions tomorrow with the team?  
MIKE RHOADES: We'll sleep in a little bit. We'll have -- we'll do a little
stretching program that we usually do when we play a late game like that.
We'll go shoot around. We'll have our shootaround and walkthrough. Guys will
be watching games. What do you do? I know what some of you guys will do. We
can't do that.  
  
I think, as the day goes on, you watch games, they'll be fired up. 9:40 is a
late start, but these guys have played AAU basketball since probably third
grade, and there's some times you start games at 11:00. They'll be fine.
They'll be raring to go.  
  
Q. De'Riante mentioned the other day that it's kind of a style of play
game. How much has that been kind of the message throughout the week?
Obviously, you want to get the pace up in every game you play, but
particularly, when going up against a player like Tacko, make sure you get the
pace up to where you want it on Friday.  
MIKE RHOADES: It doesn't matter who we play and what the other team has, we
want to play that way because we're going to play a lot of guys. We want the
pace -- I want our guys to play fast. I want them to play aggressive because
that's the fun way to play. That's been successful for us. So we want to do
that. Playing a team for the first time late in the season and you can get the
style of play going, I think that's an advantage.  
  
Now, there's going to be times where we're going to run plays and settle down
here and there, but we definitely want to make sure we're being really
aggressive. If you get beat in the NCAA Tournament, you don't want to have any
we should have or could have. We don't want to say we were on our heels too
much. If we're going to go down, it's because somebody's going to beat us at
their best and us being close to our best, and I can live with that. We want
to make sure that we're playing and the game is going the way we want.  
  
Q. You guys are, I believe, seventh in the country in defensive
efficiency. It's a team effort, I'm sure, but is there one guy you would say
is the ring leader for you defensively?  
MIKE RHOADES: I couldn't pick out one guy, but I will say this: Marcus Evans'
pressure on the ball up the court starts our defense when we're not pressing
or it turns into a half-court. Issac Vann's been guarding perimeter offensive
players at a high level all year long. He should have been All Conference on
the defensive end. I think around the rim, our guys are really versatile and
they can really move, so that really helps our guards. Sometimes takes some
chances, sometimes deny, push the offense out. I think our big guys really
this year have done a great job of protecting the rim and scrambling because
they can really move.  
  
So it's a collective group, without a doubt, but I think certain guys are good
at certain things that have really helped us.  
  
Q. Mike, you said maybe sleep in a little tomorrow. I'm curious, going
back to the preseason, can you remember the last time you slept in?  
MIKE RHOADES: I got three kids, and I take them to school every morning. I
don't sleep in at all. The players will. I mean, these guys would sleep till
2:00 if they could. We're not going to let them. But, no, the problem I have
is I don't go to sleep, and then I go to sleep, and then you hear people
waking up in the morning. So it's over for me. So sleep in May.

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Duke University. We will
introduce the players. Zion Williamson, Javin DeLaurier, and R.J. Barrett.
Open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Zion, you played AAU ball with Devontae Shuler. You've known him for
a while. What was he like as a player then, what was your impressions of him,
and how far along has he come, do you think?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: He has come a long way, obviously. But for me, when I played
with Shuler, I was a ninth grader, he was a tenth grader, and I was like,
yeah, he's the best player in the state. He would impress me with so much,
like he'd get steals but act like he got faked out by a spin move and just
turn right back. He would be a very explosive scorer, like score 15 points
straight. I used to just watch in awe of him. So, yeah, he has come a long
way.  
  
Q. This is for all of you. Notwithstanding the Number 1 seed, this team
has gone through a lot this season, injuries and a tough schedule. How has
this team evolved? We keep hearing brotherhood. How has this brotherhood
evolved for all of you?  
R.J. BARRETT: Yeah, it's been a challenging year, going through adversity,
going through injuries, different stuff like that. Like you said, brotherhood,
we remained together, and that's what's really helped us along.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: I would agree with that, and I'd say the adversity that we've
gone through has in a way made us closer, just because, when one guy goes
down, we feel like we owe it to him to continue to produce on the court. And
then when they finally get back and join us, we're just happy to have our
brother back playing with us again.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: To add on to what they said, like, when players get hurt, it
forces you to respond in a different way, and it just makes us closer as a
team because we've been through so much, and the fact that we're here now, I
mean, it's a brotherhood. We bonded through it all, and it just makes us
close.  
  
Q. Zion, does the location of these first two games have any extra
significance to you beyond just the NCAA Tournament because it's in your home
state?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yes and no. Yes, because I didn't think I would ever like
have a chance, once I committed to Duke, to play in the state of South
Carolina in a college basketball game. So that's obviously a blessing, so I'm
very excited about that. And no, because I can't like put my personal
excitement ahead of my teammates because, at the end of the day, I'm on a
team, and I want to win with my teammates, and we have to focus on just
winning.  
  
Q. Zion, did you have an opportunity to watch any of the North Dakota
State game last night? If so, what were your impressions of the Bison?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, I got to watch some of it. My impressions were very
good. They play as a unit. They can really shoot, and they remained calm, like
they got the lead, and then Central cut it down. But even with that momentum
swing, they didn't like fold. They held their composure, and they got the win.  
  
Q. Zion, you've been like the biggest story in college basketball all
year. How have you maintained your composure through that? And how excited are
you for this chapter of playing in the NCAA Tournament?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I'm going to thank my parents for that because, when I told
them I wanted to be a basketball player when I got older, they told me
everything that would come with that, like all the on court and off court
stuff and the media. So I was prepared for it. I'm very excited to be here
because I watched March Madness as a little kid, and to actually be here
playing for Coach K, playing for Duke, I couldn't ask for a better situation.  
  
Q. Zion, coming back to your home state, has there been any buzz amongst
your family and friends the last couple days? How many people do you expect to
be here to be able to watch you?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: There's going to be a lot of people here because, at the end
of the day, this is Duke University, so people will be here just because we're
Duke. Yeah, I had like a lot of friends and family telling me like good luck
and they're happy for me that I'm able to play in my home state.  
  
Q. R.J., this is your own journey, but your godfather has played in the
tournament. Your dad had a long career playing in college basketball. What
advice did they give you at a time like this? Not necessarily that you need it
or not, but do you listen, and what might they be saying?  
R.J. BARRETT: Just it's been a great year so far, and not to stop, but just to
keep doing what I'm doing, stay even keeled. We have six more games to win, so
just stay together as a unit really.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
R.J. BARRETT: We've been texting back and forth, and he told me just to remain
calm and don't really change what I've been doing all year.  
  
Q. This question is for Zion. What is your most favorite memory about
South Carolina and maybe of this town when you were growing up playing
basketball?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: My favorite memory from playing at Columbia would probably be
my junior year, the Chick-Fil-A Classic. Playing against one of my best
friends, Jalek Felton. Playing against Keenan High School, those three games
we played, those were a very exciting three games. Each game, the gym was
packed, sold out, and the energy that the fans brought was incredible. So
that's my favorite memory from playing at Columbia.  
  
Q. Javin, how has your role either grown or changed because of the
injury to Marques Bolden? And what do you do, anything differently, to prepare
for the games now?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: I wouldn't say my role has changed that much. The
expectations that my teammates and the coaches have for me remain the same.
The only difference is I just have to be a little bit more careful, especially
with fouls and whatnot, just because our rotation has changed because Ques,
obviously, isn't here. But that being said, whenever I'm on the court, I
always just try to do the same thing, play as hard as I can and do whatever I
can to help us win.  
  
Q. R.J., a little off topic, but you played at Montverde when Jermaine
Couisnard was there, who plays here at South Carolina. I think you guys
crossed paths a few times in those scrimmages, post grad versus the undergrad
team. What do you recall about him and his game, and what do you think about
his future playing here at USC?  
R.J. BARRETT: He can shoot. Anywhere over half-court is his range. I remember
guarding him, and he would pull in my face at half-court. I think he'll be
good here.  
  
Q. Kind of fun question for all of the gentlemen. Is there a particular
song on repeat on your playlist right now that's kind of getting you pumped up
and in the game?  
THE MODERATOR: For this, we'll start with Zion and move down the table.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: You're asking for just --  
  
Q. The song that you have on repeat that's kind of getting pumped up for
tomorrow's game.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Mine would be A Dream by Jay-Z and it features Faith Evans
and Notorious B.I.G.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: I've been listening to a lot of Roddy Ricch recently. I would
go with Every Season.  
  
R.J. BARRETT: Anything Drake.  
  
Q. Zion, you mentioned that your parents prepared you to handle the
pressures and all the attention you would get. Have any players or coaches
reached out to you to kind of help you also maintain that kind of composure
that you've showed throughout the season?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like former players or former teammates?  
  
Q. I mean, like with last year, with Trey Young, the way he went
through, not particularly him, but have any players reached out to you helping
guide you through that? Just any advice they might have given you.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Oh, yes, sir. A few players have reached out to me. I don't
want to say their name because I don't know if they want me to share that
private information, but, yeah, a few players have reached out. They just all
told me what to expect, like it's college. You're going to have some good
things are going to happen, and there's going to be a time where it's not so
good.  
  
So I was kind of prepared for this. I had like a cheat sheet on what to
expect, basically.  
  
Q. Zion, when you look back to last year, between the signing, being
able to win another SC State Championship -- I know that brings a smile to
your face. Obviously, everything's been going on crazy. You have to get ready
to go to Duke. Everyone is talking about what's going to be next for him,
making millions, NBA, all that kind of stuff. When you had your injury a
couple of weeks back and everyone is speculating, did you have the time to
maybe reflect a bit and kind of, you know what, this is my last go, this is
why I want to play, because some people were saying he should just sit this
next one out?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I did think about that. I always knew I'd be coming back
because I love playing the game of basketball, and I love my teammates. I made
a commitment to them when I committed to Duke. I feel like I would have been a
bad person if I didn't come back. So coming back was not an issue.  
  
But one thing I did think about when I was out was a year has gone by fast.
Just last year I was a senior in high school. My high school season was over
at this point. You know, you just think about life and how you just have to
enjoy every moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Duke head coach, Mike Krzyzewski. Opening statement and open
the floor for questions.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're very excited to be here. Tournament is already going
on. I know our guys are anxious to play. We're coming off of a great
performance in the ACC Championship in the tournament. You'll see, if you
watch our workout for 40 minutes today, that Marques will be ready to play. I
don't know how many minutes, but he'll be ready to play. He won't start. Jack
White; there's a good chance he will not play. He hurt his hamstring a little
bit against Florida State. He's close, but I don't anticipate him playing in
the first game, maybe in the second. If we win, maybe in the second. If we can
continue to win, then hopefully going forward. But Marques will play. So any
questions that you all might have?  
  
Q. Bill Foster preceded you at Duke and then came here to South
Carolina. What do you remember about Coach Foster? And did you ever run into
him after he left and was here?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. Coach Foster really is one of the outstanding coaches
and guys in the game. Great promoter. Really helped move the needle for Duke
in those late '70s because, after Coach Bubas left in the '60s and the start
of the '70s was a rocky time. When Coach Bubas did such a great job and then
Bill put together a great team and almost won the National Championship and
left. We had a couple years of rebuilding and then were able to keep it going.  
  
Q. Coach, why do you think your four freshmen have been able to work so
well together here in an era of I've got to get mine, whether it's points,
playing time or whatever?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, they're great kids, and they're very secure about
who they are. They're really all about winning, and they've been terrific. And
our upper classmen have been good with them, and you would not know class on
our team -- who eats together, who's hanging with one another. But those four
kids are very special, and they've been parented extremely well and prepared
well for something bigger than them. They're always involved with something
bigger than them. It's a pretty cool thing.  
  
Q. Coach, to that point, in particular R.J. and Zion, with all the
challenges this season, how have you seen them evolve? Not only as players,
but people.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Great. I think they bring the best out of one another on and
off the court. The two of them have become brothers. I've had a chance to
coach a lot of really good teams and coached the U.S. Team for 12 years, and a
lot of times when talent plays with talent, talent on both sides gets better.
And also because personally, you can become good friends because you actually
know what the other guy is feeling because he's also really good. They've not
had a chance to do that, but we have other guys like that. But the two of
them, in particular, right away.  
  
I think a big part of that was our Canadian trip when we had a couple
injuries. Trey and Cameron could not play, so it was kind of all on those two
guys, and they forged a great friendship.  
  
Q. Coach, did you have an opportunity --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I figured you weren't from Mississippi.  
  
Q. The accent gives it away, right?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I thought the movie was coming on. Either that, or it's a
hell of an impersonation. Do you do like improv?  
  
Q. I do weddings and bar mitzvahs.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You've got me next bar mitzvah.  
  
Q. Did you have an opportunity to watch North Dakota State's game
against Central? What were your impressions of the Bison?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I've watched them a lot. I've watched both those teams before
they played. Actually, last night was a big time game. Both teams were
deserving of winning -- great pressure. I thought both teams responded very,
very well. It was a heck of a game. Coach Richmond, he's done a great job with
his squad. They're deep. They share the ball. Obviously, they shoot really
well.  
  
They play like one, and so I'm very impressed with them.  
  
Q. After last year's upset with Virginia, how and where are you that
anything is possible? And how has that influenced your preparation for
tomorrow?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I didn't need that upset. We've been upset in the first
round. I have personal experience. Anything can happen in the tournament
because there's so many champions. Like the team we play tomorrow, North
Dakota State, is a championship team. They won the Summit League. It's
different when you're playing a championship level team. So they know how to
win. They've been in pressure situations, and they've been in that moment, and
they'll have that moment again tomorrow. We respect that, and we'll be
prepared to play a championship team.  
  
Q. Mike, I know you and Johnny Dawkins talk during the season. How soon
after the bracket came out did you guys share anything?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I haven't really talked much to anybody. I've been
under the weather for about nine days, so my texting and Bitmojis and all that
have been tabled for a little bit. But Johnny and I talked quite a bit during
the season. He's done a marvelous job with his team. I'm proud of him and
really happy that he came to Duke about 37 years ago.  
  
Q. Follow up on that. Can you just talk about what Johnny meant to your
program in those early stages when you were building it?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Johnny meant everything. He was the first great player that
believed in us. He started it, along with that class, with Alarie, Bilas,
Henderson, and then Tommy Amaker joining them. That served as the foundation
for our program. We've tried to recruit youngsters just like them because we
found that those type of youngsters can win at Duke and win at a high level.  
  
But Johnny, Johnny's like -- they're family. So, so important to us, no
question.  
  
Q. When Marques was out last weekend, Javin got more minutes, and Tony
got a little bit. What have they showed you during that time that can help you
going forward, even with Marques coming back?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It does help. I thought Javin played his best basketball of
his career, and maybe his best game against Florida State. But that whole
tournament, he played well. And then for Antonio to come in against North
Carolina and do so well, it means that all these kids have been ready. They've
had great attitudes, and the more depth that we have, the better.  
  
Q. Forgive me for not knowing, but it has to have been a long time since
you were considered an underdog in a basketball game. Is there a level of envy
in what the Bison have coming into this, that free spirit, that nothing to
lose that they get to bring to a basketball game?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Why would you assume that the team, that we wouldn't have
that?  
  
Q. Because you're the Number 1 seed.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: But you only win if you have that. So if you need to lose to
have that, then you would never win. So we try to have that while we're
winning, and that's how you sustain excellence, and that's what we're going to
try to do. We will try to be as hungry and as into the moment as the team that
we're playing against. In fact, we'll try to be more.  
  
Q. Coach, as far as -- what was the tenor of the advice that you gave
Zion from the time he was out until the time he came back in the ACC
Tournament, and what ultimately led him, in your mind, to be ready to come
back and play?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, the very first thing is he always wanted to be back. He
loves Duke, loves his team, and he's playing great. His parents are terrific.
Not so much advice, I just told him, look, if you don't want to play, if
you're concerned, don't play. Don't ever feel like you have to play unless you
want to play. And so it started from there.  
  
We were very, very cautious in making sure that he was -- he's a different --
much different player than anybody, and so I wanted to make sure that he was
ready before -- where he could be instinctively reactive because that's what
he does. Once he was ready to go, he went. I was shocked, really, with his
endurance during the ACC Tournament, for him to play 35-plus minutes in three
consecutive games was absolutely remarkable.  
  
But, no, it's always been what's in the best interests of the player. Always,
and always should be.  
  
Q. NDSU likes to spread out the scoring a lot, a lot of different guys
who can lead the team in scoring. Is that a lot tougher when you can't just
key in on one guy to shut them down?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, it just depends on if it's a really good team, and
they're a really good team. So it's not just that they spread the scoring, but
they use the court. They use the three-point shot to create really good
spacing, and then it creates more scoring opportunities for more people. So
they'll be difficult to defend. I don't know if it's more difficult, but
they're difficult. We play a lot of teams where it's difficult to defend, and
hopefully we'll be successful tomorrow.  
  
Q. First of all, sorry you're not feeling well. Curious how you have
evolved or modified your coaching approach and messaging, if at all, when you
get into this tournament with a team that has so many young players.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think we've been -- this is our 35th time in the NCAA
Tournament. You have to adapt to the type of kids you have, the culture --
'80s, '90s -- and then to the age and the -- it's not just the age, but the
experience. You might have an older team that isn't experienced in the
tournament.  
  
For us, we try to approach every game the same, not just in the tournament,
but in season. Every game is huge for us, and so that, when we get here when
everyone else says it's huge, we already know what huge means, and we don't
have to let the ambience or the environment of the tournament determine that.
We've determined that. So if we played North Dakota State on November 23rd, it
would be a huge game for us, so it's not going to change. The more you keep
things similar, when you get into the habit of performance -- I think our guys
are ready to go.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes with us today from Oklahoma, from my side
across the dais, Jamal Bieniemy, Kristian Doolittle, Christian James, and
Brady Manek.  
  
Q. Jamal and Brady, I asked the Christians this the other day, but you
guys played so well in the nonconference and not as well in the conference.
What's the excitement level that you're playing somebody, not just the NCAA
Tournament, but you get fresh faces, fresh opponent, somebody you don't know
so well that's not in the Big 12.  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: It's good because it's a new season and just a new beginning
for everybody so for everybody to start on a clean slate just to work hard and
get out there it's going to be fun.  
  
BRADY MANEK: It's good for us because in the Big 12 you have teams you see all
the time. They're scouting you really well. You're scouting them really well.
You come here and have a few days to prepare. I feel like that will help us.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, the ups and downs of this season, you talked a
couple times about how, if you don't come out with the energy as a team, it
usually doesn't work out well for you guys. What do you think can make the
difference here in the NCAA Tournament with that?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Just realizing we have another opportunity to get better,
be able to play against somebody new, as Brady just mentioned. We put a lot of
work coming into this game, game planned really well for Ole Miss. And just
get a new mindset of this could be our last game. So just an added pressure is
going to bring out the best of us.  
  
Q. For Christian James, when you look back at your career, you go back a
long way. You played in an Elite 8, scored 10 points in an Elite 8 game. It's
been a long journey. Reflect back on your career, especially from an NCAA
Tournament standpoint, and how long ago that might seem.  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: It's very important, looking back, playing throughout four
years in the tournament, it's a blessing. It's a very serious thing. We want
to go out here, and we want to make a statement. We have to -- we know we have
to play together. We have to bring energy and effort. Every possession is key.
Every possession can be a game winner. All it takes is one play to turn a game
around. We know we have to be clicking on all cylinders. We just have to come
out here and prove a point. We don't want to take anything for granted. We're
just happy to get another opportunity to play.  
  
Q. Jamal, what are your impressions of Ole Miss, specifically their
backcourt?  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: They have really good guard play. Those three guards that
start for them are very talented, and they can all score. We're going to have
to take on the challenge as guards and just play good "D" on them and just do
what we do.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, from your perspective down low, what do you see
from Ole Miss' bigs, and what can you do to maybe exploit some of their size
disadvantages?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: They're very versatile. Two starting bigs are a little bit
different than their back-ups as well. Being able to shoot the 15-foot jump
shot, even stretching out to the three-point line. So the rotations on defense
will have to be precise, knowing our role and knowing the rotations as well as
that on our offensive side of the ball. Using our mobility to our advantage
across the board, getting them in switches that they probably wouldn't want to
get into. So ball movement would be key.  
  
Q. For Kristian Doolittle, millions of people throughout the country
today are going to be turning on, watching all these games. You guys have a
practice and things like that. Will you find yourselves staying up late,
watching games, seeing what's going on, or is the preparation for tomorrow all
encompassing for you guys?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I'm going to go to sleep tonight. We play at 12:30. Can't
be up too late. We're going to have an early breakfast tomorrow. As far as a
lot of people watching these games, some people go the whole year without
watching basketball and then tune in for March Madness. It's an honor to be
here, to be able to be under this spotlight that this tournament creates. So
we're all going to want to go play our best.  
  
Q. For Christian James, they got a veteran backcourt. You guys have
experience in the backcourt. Talk about the challenge of that as a senior, and
then as you look back, when you're a freshman in the Final Four, what that was
like being inexperienced in big NCAA Tournament games?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: They have a great backcourt. We know they can score the ball
well, they move the ball well. Just looking back, experience on how Buddy
Hield and all those guys made plays in the backcourt, it's just a thing of
moving balls and making shots. Making shots is key to this tournament. So
that's the thing. We have to play together on offense, get stops on defense,
move the ball, and make shots.  
  
Q. Brady, sort of an off-the-wall question, you got your haircut there
midway through the season. Since you've done that, does it just feel better?
Is it a superstition? Were you just trying to change up the vibe? How's it
going for you, going back to your look from last year?  
BRADY MANEK: I really don't know what I was doing. I just decided to grow my
hair out last year. I've never done it. Everybody made a big deal out of it,
so I kept it. And then it got to the point where I couldn't stand it anymore,
so I just buzzed it off. I love it. Buzz cut is where I'm at.  
  
Q. Back to Brady, did you get tired of hearing about all the Larry Bird
comparisons? Since you shaved it, have those kind of gone away?  
BRADY MANEK: I think they're pretty much done. It was cool. I got a lot of
attention from it. A lot of guys got a lot of attention from it. Me and
Christian made one of the best commercials ever. It was fun, and I'm glad I
got the buzz cut back. I feel more like myself.  
  
Q. Brady, for those of us not aware of that commercial, tell us about
it, please.  
BRADY MANEK: It was a remake of the Michael Jordan-Larry Bird McDonald's
commercial. Me and Christian basically remade it, and it was pretty good. I
mean, we're up in the rafters at the football stadium. I mean, just some funny
stuff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thank you guys.  
  
Now with us is Oklahoma head coach, Lon Kruger.  
  
LON KRUGER: It's a great time of year. Super excited for these guys to be here
and have the opportunity to play in the tournament. Every team has a goal when
they start the season, and these guys really had a lot of ups and downs during
the year, a little bit of a roller coaster ride. Finished probably the last
month playing a lot better than we did middle third of the conference season.
Very good nonconference slate.  
  
Again, a lot of respect for Ole Miss and how tough that will be tomorrow, but
looking forward to seeing the guys play.  
  
Q. Coach, curious if you could go back to Matt Freeman's recruitment.
What stood out about him that attracted you? He told me that he got an offer
after a tournament in Las Vegas where he didn't think he played particularly
well. What do you recall about that?  
LON KRUGER: Actually, one of those rare cases where you get video on a lot of
players. We got Matt's video, as he sent, I'm sure, to a lot of people. Just
liked his actions, liked his mobility, liked his ability to shoot the
basketball. Again, that's on video. And then we watched him in Vegas,
reaffirmed a lot of things, and he's done a good job. Been a little bit
streaky shooting the basketball, but always works extremely hard, great
attitude, good teammate -- all those things that you're looking for.  
  
Q. Coach, is it refreshing to face a team that's not in the Big 12? You
did so well in nonconference. Do you get the feeling the players are excited
about playing somebody that doesn't know as much about them?  
LON KRUGER: The players are definitely excited about playing, I don't know for
that reason necessarily. Big 12 is tough. It's a grind, like a lot of leagues
in the country. The top few in the Big 12 are hard to beat, and we struggled
with that at times. Playing against someone we don't know quite as well and
they don't know us quite as well, it's part of the NCAA Tournament experience.  
  
Have a lot of respect for Ole Miss and how well they score the ball. Coach
Davis' team is very sound defensively, and we know how tough that will be. I
know our guys are looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk specifically just about what you have learned
about Ole Miss, backcourt, frontcourt this week?  
LON KRUGER: Obviously, their three leading scorers are their perimeter guys.
All three can really score the ball in a lot of different ways. All can make
plays off the dribble for each other. They all shoot it well, get to the
paint. Their big guys can score. Looked like they're a little more comfortable
pick-and-pop, can score inside.  
  
Again, they play about eight people. Guys off the bench bring great energy and
a little bit more versatility. So they're good. Again, like I say, very sound
defensively. Push the ball offensively, create opportunities for each other.  
  
Q. Lon, I'm just curious, how familiar are you with Kermit Davis and the
style of basketball he plays? Also, what's the challenge with the way they
switch defenses presents?  
LON KRUGER: Anytime a team switches, you've got to be a little bit concerned
about rhythm, getting into the flow of things. They do a good job of that.
I've known Kermit for a long time and followed his teams for a long time, and
I have a lot of respect for how they play. They play the game right. They
space the floor well. They move the ball well. They're always very sound
defensively. He always does a great job.  
  
Q. Haven't talked to you in 46 hours. Can you give us an update on
McNeace and just how he's looked since you got here?  
LON KRUGER: He's looked good, actually. Didn't practice on Monday, practiced
full speed yesterday for the first time. He'll be out there today, so we'll
see how he feels coming off of that full speed day yesterday. But it's been a
long time. He was playing so well in November, prior to the ankle and foot
problem. Every time he's tried to get back, he just hasn't been able to quite
get back into the flow before he injured it again.  
  
He's a guy that needs athleticism, running the floor, mobility is a big part
of his game, and he just hasn't had that. So he hasn't been able to be as
productive. Even though he has played some, he hasn't been as comfortable as
he was in November.  
  
Q. We equated your slide, sort of, to the start of conference play. How
much was it related just McNeace? Because when he got hurt is sort of when you
started playing not as well. How much are those two things related?  
LON KRUGER: For sure to some degree. No question, we'd love to have Jamuni at
full speed. Coming out of the Bahamas in that early game, after we got back
home, he was dominating the boards. He was blocking shots, changing shots,
even becoming more of a significant factor offensively. Every team goes
through that to some degree. We certainly miss Jamuni. More importantly, I
think, at this point, is just for Jamuni, because senior year, fifth year
redshirt, great attitude, getting better every year, and now he can't do what
he potentially could do because of that injury.  
  
So disappointed for him. But he wants to go, and we'll certainly throw him in
there and see how he feels tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you have kind of an interesting blend of guys. You have guys
who played in the Final Four. You have grad transfers in their first NCAA
Tournament, guys who played last year, lost in the first round. Talk about
what their motivation is and that blend of guys who want to do well in this
tournament, some in their last chance and some in their one and only chance.  
LON KRUGER: That's exactly what we have. It kind of sums it up right there.
You've got the full extreme, two extremes with the guys returning, those on
the Final Four three years ago to one and out last year. Grad transfers, one
of the things they talked about is playing in the tournament when they made
the decision to come to Oklahoma, so we're pleased they have that opportunity
and know they'll be bouncing off walls tomorrow to get out there and play.  
  
It's great. Everyone -- 68 teams are playing, 290 aren't. It's a great
experience for the guys never to be taken for granted. I know these guys
aren't taking it for granted, and they're excited to be out there.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from the University of Central
Florida. Introducing the players, Tacko Fall, BJ Taylor, and Aubrey Dawkins.
Open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Aubrey Dawkins, good to see you again. First time UCF gets an at
large bid to the NCAA Tournament after 15 years of being away, what does this
mean to you guys to be on this stage this season?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: It means everything. We worked hard for this. Put in the
hours, put in the practice time. It's a blessing. I'm appreciative to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: My apologies on the name.  
  
AUBREY DAWKINS: It's okay.  
  
Q. Aubrey, as a player on this team who's been to the tournament, what
kind of knowledge have you tried to impart on your teammates about what it's
like to play in the tournament and how it's different?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: We don't want to make the game any bigger than it is. It's
still basketball. Just want to stay composed out there and take it possession
by possession because every game is going to be grind it out. Not going to be
any blowouts really. We're going to have to earn it, and that's what it's all
about.  
  
Q. When you went to the tournament with Michigan, was there something
that, after it was all done, did you feel like something that surprised you,
something you weren't prepared for that caught you off guard while you were in
the tournament, anything like that?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Not really. Guys are going to play hard. This is biggest stage
in college basketball. You know guys are going to bring it. You've just got to
expect that and be ready for it.  
  
Q. Tacko, what's it like to be here for you? I know you've been working
hard to get UCF to the tournament. Now as a senior, you get a chance to
play.  
TACKO FALL: For me, for us, I would say it means everything. After all the
hard work that we put in, everything that we've been through, all the
injuries, after all this year finally being able to pull it off, especially in
our senior year, we have to make it happen. We just put our heads down and say
we have to make it and we made it happen but now we just can't get too happy.
Like Aubrey said, we have to go out there and compete every night because
every team is going to bring it.  
  
Q. BJ, all three of you guys were injured at points last year. Now near
the end of the year, you guys have all been banged up but not suffering any
debilitating injuries. How big is that? How like just relieving has it been to
just really kind of be able to play the entire season?  
BJ TAYLOR: It's been great. Having the three of us out there the entire
season, just being able to play together. We've kind of been together for
three seasons now. To finally be out there and play together and stay healthy,
it's been a blessing, and it's been a real joy playing with both these guys
next to me. Like Tacko said, try not to get too satisfied and see how far we
can take this thing.  
  
Q. BJ, VCU, like you guys, are a team known for defense. What is your
expectation of the way that game could go tomorrow?  
BJ TAYLOR: I think the biggest thing, talking about VCU, is they're
aggressive, and they want to press, try to get after you and speed the game
up. For us, we know we have to stay composed, we have to play our game, and we
have to dictate the tempo.  
  
So that's my biggest thing, playing our game the same way we've been playing
it the entire season. Usually when we've done that throughout the season,
we've been successful. They're a really good basketball team. They've had a
great season, and we know it's going to be a very competitive game.  
  
Q. BJ, you mentioned yesterday about how the football team has sort of
done their part to put UCF on the national map. How have you guys -- have you
noticed that, since they got good, more people notice you? And what do you
guys have to do to build up on that?  
BJ TAYLOR: Yeah, they kind of got this thing started. With the way they've
been playing the last two seasons going undefeated and only losing one game
this year, they've done so much for the university and keep bringing
recognition to the school. We're just trying to do our part now by reaching
that level and continuing to grow the athletics program at UCF because they
put us on the national stage. That's what we're trying to do here in March
Madness, not just by showing up, but by winning and having a good effort out
here.  
  
Q. Tacko and BJ, can you think about what your emotions are going to be
like tomorrow night? You guys have talked about this for four years, BJ for
you, five. Getting to this point and now you're here, can you even imagine
what you're going to both be feeling like tomorrow?  
TACKO FALL: Like we said, we're very happy to have made it after all the hard
work that we put in, but at the same time, we just don't want to get too
happy. At the end of the day, it's a basketball game. You've got to stay
locked in.  
  
Obviously, it's a big deal. We're not going to downgrade it, but at the same
time, it's still a basketball game. We've got to go out there and compete and
not let our emotions take over. Just stay locked in, make sure we lead the
guys, and just do our part.  
  
BJ TAYLOR: Yeah, basically what Tacko said. We don't want to get satisfied. In
the locker room, in our talks, we haven't been satisfied. We came here, not
just to show up, but we want to win games. Starts with VCU tomorrow. That's
our main focus right now. We're blessed to be here and honored to be here. Our
goal isn't just to get here. We want to win it and make a statement.  
  
Q. Tacko, I apologize for a little bit of a non- basketball question,
but I know you talked in the past about the Muslim travel ban and how you felt
about that, and then last week, of course, the horrific incident in New
Zealand. I'm curious what your emotions were after hearing about that. Do you
kind of embrace an opportunity to be part of a conversation about how people
within the Muslim world are viewed here and elsewhere?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, yeah. For me, I love the game of basketball, but it's
always bigger than that. Being able to represent what we are about means a
great deal to me. I was very sad when I saw what happened down in New Zealand.
I thought about it a lot. But we've just got to learn how to get along. I
mean, everybody -- we all pretty much are people, regardless of the religion.  
  
Me, I grew up in Senegal. We have a lot of Muslims. We have a lot of
Christians. We all get along, and that's a culture where I grew in. So I
really don't see that. But at the same time, we've got to learn to love each
other, and that's how I see things.  
  
Q. Aubrey, even though you're not listed as a senior, it feels like
you're a senior. When will you start thinking about what your future is?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Hopefully, in a few weeks, if we're enough fortunate to go
that far. I haven't thought about it too much, not really paying attention to
it. Just taking these days as they come. Trying to focus on the game in front
of us, the practice in front of us, not too far in the future. I'll cross that
bridge when it gets here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Central Florida head coach Johnny Dawkins.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's exciting to be here. Always have loved this environment.
The chance to compete in the NCAA Tournament is special, and I'm just happy
our players have the opportunity to experience it.  
  
Q. Johnny, was it any different getting this group to an NCAA Tournament
than maybe Stanford or during your time with Duke?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I think they all are different. I think every time you take a
team, because they all have different personnel, they all have unique
challenges. This year was no different with the group that we had. Probably
the biggest difference with this group is that we only had one player on the
team that had any NCAA experience. So that's always tough. I thought we did a
good job of kind of imparting our knowledge from our playing days, whether
it's our coaching staff, who have all played, as well as myself, trying to let
them know what the experience is going to be like, how we have to get there.
So I think everyone did a really good job of lending that type of support to
our players as we've gone through the process.  
  
Q. Coach, we've talked about injuries in the past, and now as we get to
the end of this season, guys are banged up, but you haven't suffered any
debilitating injuries to star players, unlike last year. Talk about how
satisfying that's been for you to coach really a full team this year.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I wish I could explain to you how exciting that's been for us
because we've battled that a lot. This season we've remained relatively
healthy, and that's, I think, put us in that position. All of our guys have
been able to compete most every night. When we've been healthy, we've been
very competitive. I'm just really happy for our guys. Again, I look at our
strength and conditioning, I look at our trainers. Those guys did an amazing
job making sure we're healthy and fresh. So I think they play a major role in
that, and they did a great job.  
  
Q. Johnny, we're treated here to the biggest personality in college
basketball in Zion Williamson and the biggest player in Tacko Fall. What does
that do for the setting here as far as turning this into a show as much as a
championship?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I think the NCAA is always going to have some amazing story
lines, and that's no different with Zion and Tacko. They both are uniquely
different players, but their personalities are amazing. Zion, I haven't seen
him play much, but what I have seen, he's one of the most talented basketball
players I've ever seen play on the collegiate level. With Tacko, as big as he
is, with his mobility, he also is a unique player at this level. He's both
ends of the floor. He's dynamic. He protects the rim, shot blocking, altering
shots offensively. He's really improved his skill set. He scores around the
basket, doesn't need to dunk everything to score.  
  
Both of those players, I think, in an environment like this is great because
they get a chance to showcase kind of who they are during this time of their
careers.  
  
Q. We asked Aubrey about being in the tournament and what he's told his
teammates about what it's like to be in the tournament. I wonder if you have
told your guys about what to expect and how it's different. How do you handle
yourself in a tournament, things like that.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, definitely. As I said earlier, we definitely talked about
this experience and what to expect, and basically what we try to tell our
players is just stay in the moment and enjoy this experience. This is
something that you should cherish. These are hard to come by. When you have
this opportunity, make the most out of it. So we kind of talked to them that
way. Along the process, we talked about how to get there and how consistent we
need to be in order to give ourselves a chance to be in this position.  
  
I think all the things coming from, not just myself, but my staff. Coach
Norris played in the tournament. Coach Taylor played in the tournament. We
have guys who have been there before. We didn't want them to keep that
knowledge a secret, to share that throughout the season, to make up for the
lack of having a number of guys in the locker room that did not have that
experience.  
  
Q. Johnny, it seems like Tacko's a very interesting young man. When you
guys came to Charleston a couple years ago to play in that tournament, he was
very interesting to talk to. Up here, the same thing. Can you discuss his
development as both a person and a player, and what do you think his future is
in this game beyond college?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, as a person and a player, he's one of the best human
beings you're going to meet. Hands down. And I've coached a lot of terrific
people, and none any better than Tacko. He's a beautiful human being.
Engaging, intelligent, just -- he's funny. He has the whole gamut. He's a
great young man. In basketball, I think he has a bright future. I hear the
game has changed and his style of play no longer exists, but when you have a
player like Tacko Fall with his personality, with who he is, in any community,
he'll be one of the best people you'll ever have in the community. You want
guys like that around. I know I would as a teammate or in that locker room.  
  
I see him playing on the highest level. I don't know how and what path he's
going to take, but a 7'6", 300, still has a huge upside in this game because
he does. He's gotten even better this year. Throughout the season, I've seen
improvement. I see him playing at the next level, and I think that's something
he can accomplish because of his ability on and off the court.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of high school talent comes from the Central Florida
area. I'm just wondering, have you used BJ's story, or will you use BJ's story
when recruiting to say this is what can happen when you stay home?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Definitely. I think that's very important. We have a talented,
talented community in Florida and the Orlando area, and we want to keep those
young men home and give them a viable option to play for us as opposed to
going out of state and playing for other teams. BJ's a perfect example. He
could have gone anywhere. He chose to stay at UCF because his dream was to do
something special for his hometown team, and that's what he's been able to do.
I think he's made us all proud at that university and in that community
because he sacrificed and made a choice. I wouldn't even call it a sacrifice.
He made a choice to be part of something special in Orlando and not elsewhere.  
  
Q. Is there a standard within the locker room of what would make this
trip to the tournament a successful trip to the tournament?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We haven't really talked about that. The thing we want to do
is we just want to stay in the moment. We have a big game coming up tomorrow
versus VCU, and that's the most important thing that's on our mind right now.
After that, we figure out where we are. I think getting here, there's a
certain level of success just getting in this tournament and being involved in
it. And then from there, we see what can happen. We see what's possible, and
we'll find that out when we throw it up tomorrow.  
  
Q. Johnny, just to follow up on the Duke angle a little bit, how
appropriate is it for you to see your old team take the floor before you do
and your old coach see you take the floor with your new team in a breakthrough
season?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Probably a little awkward, actually. Who could imagine that
would happen? I'll be excited for them, of course. I'll be rooting for them.
It's my alma mater. Of course, Coach K and I are really good friends, as well
as my mentor and coach. So I'll be rooting for those guys to have a successful
outcome, and then we'll be preparing for our game.  
  
It is awkward because, like I said, I've never been in this situation before,
but we'll block all those things out. Like I tell our players all the time,
stay in the moment. We don't get distracted very easily. I think that's a big
part of why we've been able to have consistency this year is the fact that
we've always stayed in the moment. That's what we'll do. I'll practice what I
preach to our players every day.

### [Terence Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32970)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Ole Miss. We'll introduce the
players -- Terence Davis, Devontae Shuler, and Breein Tyree.  
  
Q. Devontae, when you saw the draw and you saw Columbia pop up next to
your team's name, just what was your first thought?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: It was just an opportunity for me to come back home and play
in front of my family and friends and also for me to have a better chance to
play better in my home state.  
  
Q. Devontae, what's it been like to talk to your sister earlier this
week, ticket requests and everything. How many people do you expect to have
here, and just, last time you guys were here last month, didn't go so well.
What needs to happen to have a better performance?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I have plenty of family and friends coming, of course. This
is like right in the middle of where I'm from. For the most part, for me just
to come back and stay focused and just for me to come back and get the win,
that's the main part of me coming back home and playing in this. That's really
it.  
  
Q. I'll continue the line of questions for Devontae. I believe you were
teammates in high school with Braxton Key from Virginia. What do you remember
about him, and have you guys maintained a friendship?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Definitely. I won a National Championship with him, so we
always stay in contact. Braxton is not just a friend of mine on the court. Off
the court, he's a great person. We always say in contact. He's always in
contact with my sister, so it's a long relationship.  
  
Q. Breein and Terence and Devontae, if you'd like, you can chip in on
this, too. Experience is always considered a big thing in the NCAA Tournament.
Are you guys concerned that you don't have any? Breein, why don't you start?  
BREEIN TYREE: I do feel like experience is a big thing in anything you do.
We're experienced guards, and we played a lot of college basketball, but this
is our first time in the tournament. This will be a new experience for us, but
on the other side of it, we'll be just as excited as any other person would be
for this major opportunity.  
  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Definitely for me, too. We definitely got to have a great
experience. Of course, I've never been here, but us going against a D-I
college basketball team, we're going to treat it as if it's an SEC regular
season game.  
  
TERENCE DAVIS: And just to go along with them, we three guys who have been
playing with each other for quite some time. We have no experience in the NCAA
Tournament, but we do have experience together with this team. So we'll be
okay along the road.  
  
Q. T.D., this is what you came back for to play in this. Now that you're
here, what's the feeling for you?  
TERENCE DAVIS: It's unbelievable. To get to share this moment with some of the
guys you've been around forever, and just to be here, man, is just special.
But we're not satisfied.  
  
Q. Terence, the last couple of games, you've had a hard time scoring,
getting buckets. Have you kind of flushed that, or do you feel like you need
to see a couple go in to get some confidence going tomorrow?  
TERENCE DAVIS: Once it's the game, that's flushed. The great thing about it,
we have another opportunity to play tomorrow, and that's the good thing about
it.  
  
Q. Breein, from your scout of Oklahoma so far, what stands out about
what they do well and what kind of challenges might there be in this game?  
BREEIN TYREE: They shoot the ball really well. They also exploit mismatches
very well. All their players from one to five can bring down the ball and
dribble the ball. They do a lot of isolation. We just need to guard the ball,
stay in front of our men, stay second in the air, be physical with them and
rebound the ball, and I think we should be fine.  
  
Q. Breein, a big reason why you all were able to do the turnaround was
because Devontae got moved to point guard and you got to be moved off the
ball. What kind of growth have you seen in Devontae, what he's been able to do
at that position specifically?  
BREEIN TYREE: Tremendous growth. Even from his freshman year, when I was
playing point and he was playing the two guard, he grew tremendously in that
year. But just from freshman year into his sophomore year, just leadership
qualities has grown tremendously, to handling the ball, making better
decisions, getting the team in the right sets. I don't want to say taking a
backseat to me and T.D., but not taking as many shots and maybe not even
getting the spotlight at all times, but he just keeps it going, and he's a
major part of our team. Without him, this train doesn't go. His growth has
been tremendous, and he's still not done yet. We've got a long way to go as a
team.  
  
Q. Breein, along those lines, what specifically has that freed you up to
do on the wing as opposed to you having to play point last year?  
BREEIN TYREE: It's freed me up to just be a lot more aggressive offensively.
That's what Coach wants me to do, assert myself on the offensive end and take
better shots than I did last year, and Devontae's helped me do that a lot this
year. Just getting me open because he's such an aggressive guard. A lot of
help will come and kick outs to me and T.D. on the wings, and then it's time
for us to make a play and try and get the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Devontae, as a younger -- as a young person, how many times did you
come to this gym as a fan, and did you play here?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I didn't really come to many games, but my sister was a big
fan of the basketball team and my brother. So they'd always tell me, like,
come into USC and get a good feel for how Coach Frank Martin is, just me being
around and the environment of me getting a feel for a college basketball
stadium has been great.  
  
Q. T.D., Devontae is a guy that you took under your wing really, really
early in his career. It was important in getting him here actually. What have
you seen from him, and how far he's come as a player and just all around in
terms of his game?  
TERENCE DAVIS: Like Breein touched on, Devontae, just a tremendous player. To
be a freshman and play key roles last year and then to play a whole 'nother
role, point guard, never played the position ever, it just tells you how good
of a player you are. Just to play a whole different position and be good at
it, get his team to March Madness just tells you everything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student-athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll go ahead and get started with Ole Miss head coach Kermit Davis and SID
Adam Kuffner.  
  
KERMIT DAVIS: First of all, probably been one of the most rewarding years of
my 37 years of coaching to come to Ole Miss, which is back home for me and my
state and to be involved and connect with the Ole Miss spirit. You take a team
that finished last, picked last, and for the improvement that they've made, I
have so much respect for our players.  
  
And then to see the connection with our fan base that we probably grew nearly
25 percent increase in attendance in SEC games, which was the most of any
league team. So that part has been great.  
  
Then to play a really good Oklahoma team in the NCAA Tournament, known Lon for
a long time. He's had so much success in this tournament. He's got another
really, really good team, and I think it will be another really, really good
8-9 matchups.  
  
Q. Kermit, Devontae Shuler's move to point guard was so big as far as
the turnaround was concerned. How far has he come at that position
specifically, and what have you seen as far as what he's been able to do, ball
handling and all that stuff?  
KERMIT DAVIS: He's probably been the key to our team. He got nicked up for
five or six games after the Mississippi State game, and he's now back healthy.
He didn't even play point guard at Oak Hill for Steve Smith. He kind of played
off the ball all the time and played off the ball as a freshman. We really met
in the spring, and I really think he understood.  
  
The biggest thing he's done, he's valued the ball. He's a tough, competitive
guard on the ball defending. He really has -- Breein and T.D. have had these
great All-SEC years, but Devontae Shuler has been maybe our most valuable
player on the floor.  
  
Q. You mentioned this team finished last, picked last. What point did
you realize they had the potential to be an NCAA Tournament team and exceed
all these expectations?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We took a trip to Canada that really helped us. As I said
before, we left a lot of bad basketball in Canada. It gave us time to really
get extra practices. An NCAA Tournament team, probably when we beat Auburn at
home and they were ranked. Then three days later, we go to Mississippi State
and beat another ranked team. Probably at that particular time that we got
ranked ourselves that we started kind of thinking that maybe you have a
chance. Didn't talk about it to our team -- but to play in the NCAA Tournament
and be a postseason team.  
  
Q. Kermit, you and Lon Kruger are two of the most experienced coaches in
the field. Do you have any familiarity with him or crossed paths with him at
any stops?  
KERMIT DAVIS: You know, I've just known Lon forever. This is the first time
I've ever coached against Lon's team in any game, but I guess I've just always
admired Lon and followed him when he was at Florida and Illinois and obviously
at Oklahoma. We both had the same assistant, a guy named Greg Grensing that I
hired when Lon was at Vegas fixing to go to Oklahoma and Greg was a great
assistant of mine at Middle Tennessee. Just as a coach and one of his peers,
I've admired him for what he's done. The main thing is how he's gone about his
business for so long in his career.  
  
Q. Kermit, it seems like Bruce has really put it together in the last
month. How much of what you've gotten from him has kind of changed the dynamic
of y'all's team?  
KERMIT DAVIS: He's a critical matchup tomorrow, he and Don both. Obviously,
number one, Doolittle is an undersized -- he's really a four man, but he plays
the five and so he gets good matchups. Can you guard Doolittle, and Bruce and
Don, especially Bruce? Can you guard him at 17-feet isolations that Lon puts
him in? So that's a big critical key. Then can we throw the ball to Bruce,
pick up fouls, and make guys guard him around the goal? We know he can pick-
and-pop and shoot goals. If us going forward, if we're going to have some
success in this tournament, he's going to have to be a big part of it.  
  
Q. Kermit, you've had so many close games just go down right to the
wire. Is that something you think you've talked to your team a lot about, you
know, finishing at the end of it? But do you think that's kind of fueling them
as you head into a game with such pomp and circumstance?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We have. We played a hard late year schedule. We were up one,
and Grant Williams makes a shot with four seconds to go to beat us at home,
one-possession game with Kentucky. We go to Arkansas and have the ball at one,
they hit a last second shot to beat us. Obviously, Alabama, we were up 16 and
get beat at the end. So it's a concern.  
  
But I think some of those games we've been really, really competitive and
played good in parts of those games, and that's something to draw on. But
you're right, we've got to do a better job of closing games out and just
making basketball plays at the end of those clocks.  
  
Q. Kermit, coming off that Alabama game, how has been the focus and the
recovery in practice after a loss like that?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We got after them pretty good just after we got back. The next
day, on Friday, we watched the tape before we left from Nashville to go back
to Oxford, and then on Saturday and Sunday we had two really physical
practices, not very long, an hour and 20 minutes, but got back to trying to
rebound and defend. And then as the week -- you know, we got selected to come
to the regional, we've kind of backed off. It's been really good. I wanted to
get that out of our system and back playing. We needed to go up and down some.  
  
So I think our attitude and energy level has been really good this week.  
  
Q. Kermit, this seems to be like a pretty good guard-oriented matchup,
especially with your group. But what do you see on the other side,
specifically with Jamal Bieniemy, the freshman point guard?  
KERMIT DAVIS: I just told Lon, I saw him in the hall. I said, God, Lon, I
watched him probably ten games ago and watched him until now, and he's got to
be one of the most improved players in the Big 12. You can tell he's just kind
of grown up as a freshman, great size, great pace. The biggest thing, he just
takes care of the ball. And obviously, James is a real physical kind of a
celebrated guy that's played in the Final Four. I like them. And the other
guys are real physical, driving guards. So you're right, our three guards are
going to have to play really well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kermit, a lot is made of experience in this tournament. You have
some, but your players don't. How do you think that factors in?  
KERMIT DAVIS: I think because you've got Oklahoma, you've got some guys that
have played in the Final Four. You've got a team that played in it last year
in the tournament. I just think that, when you play in leagues like ours, when
you've played in those kinds of games every night. I told our team yesterday,
I said, guys, you've been tested in every way possible a college team can get
tested by what you went through in an 18-game schedule in this league. So
they've been in these big environments and big arenas. Do you have a little
nerves, probably a little jitters first when the ball's tipped and you get it
going? Sure.  
  
But the biggest thing is just stay true to yourself, do what you do, don't try
to go out of character, and just be who we are, the best version of our team,
and hopefully they'll do that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Transition defense has been something that your guys normally do very
well. How important is transition "D" just going to be in a team against
Oklahoma?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Any time you play Oklahoma or Lon's team, transition defense is
always big because Doolittle can get the ball off the defensive boards and
bring it up as a center, a so-called center. So it makes your adjusting,
getting back defensively some different matchups. And obviously, the way that
they shoot the ball on the perimeter, the stretch four is so good. He's as
good a stretch four shooter as there is in college basketball.  
  
So you're right, that's something that's been kind of a staple of ours for
many, many years, wherever we've coached, and we're just going to have to be
true to form tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kermit, how helpful has it been to have the -- I guess as of
tomorrow, the eight days off? Did your team kind of need that rest after
pretty much of a grind?  
KERMIT DAVIS: You know, I think mentally, nobody wants to get beat in their
conference tournament by any means. Obviously, we were disappointed, but
probably in the end, I think mentally, it's been really good for our team, a
team that, like I said, went to Canada, had extra days of practice. So we have
really stuck to about an hour, hour and ten minutes this week at most. So I do
think -- I saw it with Breein and even T.D. the last couple days, a little
fresher legs and fresh minds. Hope it does help.  
  
Q. Kermit, Lon said he had an awareness of you. Have you guys coached
against one another?  
KERMIT DAVIS: No, we haven't. We've just known each other for a long time.
Just through recruiting and different basketball, as you cross paths, and like
I said, it's just been a great respect on my part for Lon.  
  
Q. What would you say is kind of a staple, I guess, of his teams and how
you have seen them through the years, I guess?  
KERMIT DAVIS: They've guarded at a high level, and just the way the ball moves
offensively, I think he's just always had great spacing. He was one of really
the first guys. I mean, I know the dribble drive, the spacing and driving
balls, and I just think their best players shoot it. He puts them in spots to
catch and score, and he's done that his whole career.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you.

### [Tim Craft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36946)

### [David Efianayi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36947)

### [Eric Jamison, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36948)

### [Jose Perez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36950)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Gardner Webb University. Head
coach Tim Craft. SID Marc Rabb. I'll introduce the players. We have David
Efianayi, Eric Jamison, Jr., D.J. Laster, and Jose Perez.  
  
Q. D.J., what is it that has been clicking for you here over the last
five games or the end of the season? And how much confidence do you bring into
this tournament?  
D.J. LASTER: I have a lot of confidence. I think what's clicking is just being
more efficient on the court and with my shot selection and getting the right
shots and having my teammates find me in the right places. So I'm pretty
confident in my workouts and everything that I'm doing. I'm pretty confident
coming into this tournament.  
  
Q. David, what has this past week-and-a-half been like and what has
today been like, I guess starting yesterday, coming here for the first time
and experiencing this for the first time, not only for you as players but as a
program?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: It's very exciting. The past few years we've been very close,
losing the semifinals and quarterfinals. This is a great experience to be
here, and we're just going to try to continue going on.  
  
Q. For all of you four guys, I know this last two weeks has been quite a
blur. What was your emotions pulling out yesterday morning at 8:30 knowing you
were coming to Columbia, knowing you were coming to the NCAA Tournament,
knowing you had meaningful practices left ahead of you for each one of you
guys?  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: For me, it was a very exciting feeling, just a dream come
true to play in an NCAA Tournament. A lot of guys don't get a chance to play,
and it's just really everybody is excited and happy, and we're just ready to
play.  
  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, like he said, it's just being a part of March Madness is
very big. As a college player, that's what you want to do. It's just very
exciting.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Just great to have this opportunity to be here. Like Dave said,
we've been in the semifinals, we've been to the quarterfinals, but we never
got here in school history. Just an exciting experience and just an
opportunity to play and compete at the highest level.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: For me, this has been a dream come true being here as a freshman
and being here with these guys. They're like my role models, and they're
older. They always tell me what I'm doing wrong and right. Just being here is
like a dream come true, like they said.  
  
Q. For D.J. and Jose, what do you see when you look at De'Andre Hunter,
and what do you anticipate in terms of who might match up there?  
JOSE PEREZ: He's a great player. He won Defensive Player of the Year in the
ACC. To me, he's going to be a tough matchup all night and just be physical
with him as much as possible as we can and see what the refs let go and what
they don't let go.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Yeah, he's a great player, but we just want to compete at the
highest level and just give him all we've got. I know he's going to come at
us. We just want to compete.  
  
Q. Anybody can answer this, but what does it mean playing so close to
campus knowing there's going to be tons of fans wearing the red and black
tomorrow?  
JOSE PEREZ: It's going to be great here. I'm still getting a couple of phone
calls on tickets and stuff. It's going to be a great atmosphere. They're
probably going to travel with a lot of people. It's most likely going to be
like a home game here. So let's see. Just ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. David, Mike was asking D.J. earlier about his confidence, but what
kind of confidence did the entire team derive from going on the road in the
semifinals and the final of the conference tournament at Campbell and Radford
and being able to win those games in those conditions?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: It starts off with the coaches. The coaches do a great job
preparing us for each game. We had a great game plan going into the games, and
as players, we just go in there with just confidence. We just go in there
playing together, playing freely, and we just knew that, if we played hard
enough, that we can be able to come out with those Ws.  
  
Q. You guys obviously know what happened to UVA in this game last year.
How do you think that will affect them for this game? Do you think they'll be
more focused? Do you think they'll be tight or anything?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, they're a high level team. I feel like they'll come out
with a vengeance. They'll come out ready to compete just as well as us. I
think we're going to come out ready to compete. Last year's team for UVA is
different from this year's team, so I don't think they'll play any
differently, but they'll play well. They'll be more focused coming into this
game.  
  
Q. To follow up on that question, your coach talked about how the fact
that they lost last year had no bearing this year, but it gives you a belief
that it can happen. A No. 16 had never beaten a Number 1 last year. Have you
all reflected on that, or do you even care about the seeding number?  
JOSE PEREZ: We're just going to come ready to play, to be honest. Anything can
happen. When we're both on the court, they tie their shoes the same way we do,
to be honest. We're just ready to play.  
  
Q. Some of my question has been answered, but just talk about what you
saw the night the pairings came out. Did you expect to see Virginia, or was
that a surprise at all?  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: It wasn't really a surprise. We were prepared to play
anybody. It doesn't really matter who we play. We're just excited to be here.
This is a great opportunity to play whoever.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other student-athletes like to answer?  
  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, it wasn't much of a surprise. Like Eric said, we're just
ready to compete. We're going to give it our best shot, and we're going to go
out there and play our best.  
  
Q. For any of the players that want to answer this, this is the
program's first time in the Division I NCAA Tournament, but it's got a pretty
rich basketball history, NAIA, D-II. What do you guys kind of learn about the
program's basketball history when you get there, and how important is that for
you to show it off on the big stage?  
D.J. LASTER: It's very important for us to show it off because this is our
first time in history doing this. We just want to leave our legacy and leave
it all out on the court. I trust all my teammates. We're not the biggest team,
but we've got a lot of fight, we've got a lot of heart. I know my teammates
are going to go out there and fight and give it all they have. That's all I
can ask of all my teammates.  
  
My coaches are going to prepare us the right way, and I'm just glad we have a
chance to compete and have the opportunity to play at the highest level,
playing the Number 1 seed, also.  
  
Q. This question is for any of you all who might have watched last
year's game with Virginia and UMBC? You all had to be college basketball fans
your entire life. It had to be like a pretty amazing thing to watch. Did you
picture yourself potentially if you could pull this off this year getting into
this position, and if so, is it something you could imagine, going to a
smaller school, that you would get this opportunity to knock off a Number 1
seed?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, playing a mid-major school, you want to have those
opportunities to play those higher level teams. All of us is being recruited
at a mid-major level truly believe that we can play at the highest level. So I
don't think that matters to us. We're just going to go out there and compete.  
  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: It's just a humbling experience to be here. So us playing
Virginia is just going to make us better, to be on the court with them. We go
into every game thinking we're going to win the game, no matter who the
opponent is, but we respect the program that they have. We know they're a high
level program, and we're still going to put our plan together, and we're going
to go out there and fight and play.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Like he said, they are a high level program. I believe that we
have high level players on our team. So I think, if we just go out there and
compete and just play with them and control the game and control the
atmosphere of the game and how it's running, like we have a good chance.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: First, let's start off they have a great coach and a great program
there, but just seeing UMBC beat them last year, it's just like it happens,
like you have to come ready to play every night here in March Madness, like
anything can happen, like everybody said before. We have a great coaching
staff, Coach Craft usually prepares us very hard when we're about to play a
big name school or a low name school. He's just very detailed on what we've
got to do, and I feel like tomorrow we're going to be very highly prepared for
them.  
  
Q. Just curious, playing off that last question, you see a 16 seed upset
a 1 seed in Virginia, the team you guys are playing, that's the epitome of the
underdog story. I'm curious, for each of you guys, when you think about what
an underdog is, whether it's David versus Goliath or Rocky Balboa, what comes
to mind for you when you think underdog?  
JOSE PEREZ: Underdog to me is basically somebody like basically everybody is
against them, but the underdog knows they can go out there and basically come
out with the win. That's in my opinion, and that's what I think.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Underdog to me, it just means that not everybody expects for you
or for your team to win. I believe that the underdog has like the faith and
the belief that they can win. So just having faith in being able to know that
you can conquer even like the David and Goliath, like just knowing that, just
having faith is more like what I think of an underdog.  
  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: Perfect example of an underdog is, like you said, the David
and Goliath story. You just can't go in with any fear. You've just got to go
in with as much fight as possible and go out there and just execute the plan
and see where everything goes.  
  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Underdog is just what other people view us on the team. I
guess you just go out there and just compete.  
  
Q. I know you guys talked about, David with you back to the Big South
media day, you felt this could be a special year as your senior year.  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. At what point in the season did you think this was possible? Was it
beating Wake and Georgia Tech or something else?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, beating Wake and Georgia Tech let us know we're capable
of doing big things. And then just the beginning of the season. Everybody was
just locked in. Started with like our preseason workouts. We're relentless in
our ball skills. I just feel like everybody was ready to compete. Everybody
was going at each other. We were playing together. It was just special.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Yeah, like David said, we've been locked in all year, and beating
Wake Forest and Georgia Tech really helped us with our confidence and stuff,
but as we got in the conference, we kind of knew that we were one of those
teams that people knew that they're going to have to fight and it's going to
be a dogfight all night.  
  
So I knew that with all my teammates, like everybody is going to go out with
heart. Like we're not going to bend or fold, we're just going to keep on
going, keep on going, no matter the adversity. When adversity hits, we're
going to take care of it the right way. So I knew that, in crunch time, we'll
be able to make the right decisions, and our coaches will make the right
decisions. So I have trust in all my teammates and my coaches. Just confidence
in myself and confidence in all my other teammates to make plays down the
stretch. I think we have done that, and I'm glad we have the opportunity to
play in the tournament to continue to play at that level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tim Craft, head coach Gardner-Webb University.  
  
TIM CRAFT: It's great for our program to be here and represent Gardner-Webb
University in the NCAA Tournament. As I was telling the guys from Westwood One
back there, there's no one in our entire program, staff, our players,
administrators that have been to the NCAA Tournament. So this is an exciting
thing for every one of us. We're thrilled to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Tim, if you would share what you will about kind of your plans for
De'Andre Hunter, wanting Laster, Perez, where you see that matchup best for
you?  
TIM CRAFT: He's a monster to defend. He's so good inside and out, really
versatile. Both of those guys will see him at times. We'll have other guys
that will see him. We'll try to limit his ability to catch it close to the
basket and then like give whoever's on him a lot of help, but he's a terrific
player. We can't just guard him with one guy.  
  
Q. Tim, what kind of confidence do you and your players derive from
having already beaten two ACC squads this season?  
TIM CRAFT: I think it helped us in our league certainly be confident in who we
are as a team. I think it certainly helps our guys to know that we can beat a
team that's from a power conference, which we had done in previous years, as
well. In Georgia Tech and Wake Forest, no disrespect to those programs, but
Virginia is a different animal for sure. They're the ACC champs. It's not a
negative thing, it's certainly a positive thing that we won those games and
can draw some confidence from those.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think -- and I know you can't be in Tony Bennett's head
or the UVA players' heads, but do you think they will be more focused or more
inspired based on what happened to them last year in this round?  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, I would think potentially they would be, but I think they've
done a great job kind of handling that whole thing throughout the year from
the start of the year or when it was -- as soon as they lost a game, they did
a great job of kind of putting that behind them and moving forward, and
they've had a tremendous season.  
  
I'm not sure whether they'll be more focused or less focused, but we know
they're a great team, and it will be a challenge.  
  
Q. Coach Craft, there have been so many firsts this year. A lot of
people talk about coming in as a team the first time, jitters, nervousness.
Being in this big moment, how would you deal with that? Obviously, you had the
first ACC road win, first Big South Tournament finals, and then the Big South
Tournament championship.  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, we have. We've done a lot of first things this year. First
team to win 20 games at Gardner-Webb in the regular season, first team to be
undefeated at home at Gardner-Webb. We've had a great year. We've been able to
accomplish a lot of those first time things.  
  
I think for us, the biggest thing is just our guys got to just play loose.
They've just got to go out and play loose and free, and I'm going to try to
really get them to just feel like, hey, let's go out and just have some fun.
Let's go have some fun. We've got to be detailed in our plan, but offensively,
I mean, we're going to be playing against one of the best defenses in the
nation on a huge stage. Let's just go out and let it fly. I think that's got
to be our guys' mindset in order to have success.  
  
Q. Tim, I believe you're friendly with Coach Aldrich at Longwood. He was
on the staff at UMBC. Did you hit him up for any advice on how to pull the
upset?  
TIM CRAFT: I did talk to them, not just about their plan for Virginia, but
kind of their plan for the week and just how they helped their guys have the
type of mindset they had coming into the game and what they did in practice
and just kind of how they attacked shootaround. Just logistical things as
well. But I did talk to Griff.  
  
Q. What was the best advice he gave you?  
TIM CRAFT: He said this, but a lot of people said this. It's just enjoy the
moment, enjoy the experience. I just alluded to trying to -- just trying to
play with confidence. Be attack minded and try to be loose and free. That's
the approach we're going to try to take.  
  
Q. Tim, a lot of people talk about Virginia's defense, but what concerns
you about their offense, and how do you defend that?  
TIM CRAFT: They've been so good defensively for so many years, and their
defense is suffocating, but this year's team offensively, I think going into
the tournament, they're like the No. 2 rated offense in KenPom efficiency.
They really grind the clock down. They make you play for long periods of time.
They're really sharp with their execution, whether they're running their mover
blocker, pin downs and flares and constant motion and cutting and screening,
and then they do it with really good players.  
  
So they present a lot of challenges for you. I think Ty Jerome is the guy that
kind of is the head of the snake in terms of can score, can facilitate, has
got size, can make shots, can score it in the paint, and then obviously, you
know, Hunter's had an amazing year and can do so many things for you, and then
Guy that can make shots at such a high level. And the other thing that
concerns me about them is their ability to offensive rebound. Their two big
guys, whoever they have in -- and they rotate those post players, and they're
all big, and they're all strong, and they crash the glass. That's been a
little bit of a challenge for our team this year is defensive rebounding.  
  
So trying to make them miss and be able to continue your stance to play late
in the clock, get a great contest and make them miss and then limit them to
one shot. All of it's a challenge.  
  
Q. A lot of teams in your position just try to break it down into four-
minute segments between the media time-out, and then you go and adjust from
there. Is that kind of your approach tomorrow?  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, we kind of do that. I think a lot of teams do that, but we
break the game up into what we call four-minute wars. We're trying to take
each four minutes and trying to win that four minutes, try to focus on that
four minutes when you're in that media time-out. But, yes, we do.  
  
Q. So how much of your job tomorrow is psychological, and how much of it
is Xs and Os?  
TIM CRAFT: I think it's both. I think it's 100 percent both. I think it always
is. It always is 100 percent both in every game. There's a different challenge
you're facing from a psychological standpoint every time you go out there, and
certainly with this one, I think it's to just enjoy it, seize the moment. I
know we're going to play hard, but I want us to play really loose and attack
minded offensively because I think that's -- you know, if we come out and play
tight, we've got no shot.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked your players what it meant to be an underdog and got
some pretty good answers. I'm just curious, how has your team embraced the
role of being an underdog while also rationalizing the fact that a Number 1
seed, as we saw last year, is not unbeatable?  
TIM CRAFT: Sure, I think that's a familiar place that we've been in. Really, I
think, since -- in my six years, we've been the underdog a lot. A lot of times
we're not -- this year we were picked sixth in our league, came in as the 4
seed, won the tournament. Every year we play four to five road games against
Power Five opponents. So we're certainly used to that role, and I think our
guys enjoy embracing that role. We kind of took that mindset this season when
we were picked sixth in the league that, hey, man, nobody's expecting us to do
this. We've got a great team in this locker room, and every time-out kind of
coming out with a chip on your shoulder and playing with an edge.  
  
So sometimes that underdog role helps you play with that edge that you need to
play well.  
  
Q. You talked about talking to Coach Aldrich. How much have you
mentioned the UMBC game to your team, and have you drawn anything from that?  
TIM CRAFT: We haven't mentioned it much. They all know about the game, but we
haven't talked about it a whole lot. Our conference tournament happens earlier
than the rest. We won our league championship on the Sunday prior to Selection
Sunday. We gave them two days off, and the first thing we did on Wednesday in
our meeting was try to lock our guys in to, hey, we've achieved something
great. Now let's focus on playing a game and getting ready to play well.  
  
So we showed a lot of upset video clips, but really from the last 20 years,
and we haven't really spent a lot of time on that specific one, but just, hey,
anything can happen in this tournament. That's why this tournament is great.
Let's get focused on preparing to play the best that we can play when the
bracket comes out.  
  
Q. Tim, you mentioned Ty Jerome is, quote, the head of the snake. Can
you expound on that a little bit, especially what he does on the offensive end
and creating angles and getting to places and his court vision?  
TIM CRAFT: Sure, sure. He's just such a multi-dimensional player. He can play
in pick-and-roll, or he's coming off those pin downs, down screens, where,
like you said, just gets a little bit of an angle on a closeout. Now gets into
the paint, can make jumpers in those midrange areas, can make floaters, can
draw defense and dump it off to their post players for layups or spray it out
to shooters for threes. Again, he does it in a lot of different ways. He can
just do it on a pick-and-roll and a ball screen situation or coming off a
screen off the ball or just beat you one-on-one sometimes from the top.  
  
Then he's able to do that as well because his change of pace is so good and
he's such a good shooter. So you've got to be tight to him, or he can shoot it
from about 22, 23 feet at a high level. So he creates some problems for you
defensively just from a one-on-one standpoint, but then in their actions with
the pick-and-rolls and the down screens.  
  
Q. You've talked about earlier that 6 seed in preseason pick. I sensed a
quiet confidence out of you guys even back at Big South Media Day. How have
you navigated that? And how special is it that you're finally here and we're
not talking about it, you're actually doing it?  
TIM CRAFT: It is really special. But, yeah, I do think our team has had a
confidence just going into the season. We've got a really good mix of
experience on our team and some really talented young players. Some of the
guys that were up here -- D.J. Laster as a senior, David Efianayi, fifth year
senior. Christian Turner is a junior point guard. Jaheam Cornwall is a
sophomore point guard with a lot of experience that's been good for us. Eric
Jamison is a fourth year redshirt junior, Justin Jenkins, a redshirt junior.
So from the guys that are out front that have been real productive for us to
our kind of role players that have just been great leaders in our locker room,
all of that has really helped our team.  
  
And then we've got a great freshman class, and Jose Perez has been the guy as
a freshman that's been super productive for our team. So I think from the
preseason, our guys really felt like that we had the makings of a team that
could compete to win a championship in our league. But it's really special
having a team that can do it and being able to accomplish it are two different
things. We've had other teams that were talented enough to get here and lost
in the semifinals three years. So it's hard to make it through that conference
tournament. For this team to be able to play as well as they did, those three
games in those four days, and be sitting here right now is certainly really
special.  
  
Q. I believe you're scoring 78 points per game. They're leading the
nation in defense at 56 or whatever they've given up. Talk about tempo and
will it make a big difference?  
TIM CRAFT: They certainly want to play at a slower tempo. They're going to be
really hard to get anything in transition on. They do such a good job in
transition "D."  
  
We certainly want to try to score in transition when we can. And then
offensively, they're going to do a great job of controlling the tempo by a lot
of times playing late in the clock.  
  
So it's not a huge thing for our team. We're not a team that's emphasizing to
playing really fast or, hey, we're playing really slow. Our tempo is pretty
average. It's not a huge emphasis for us. I think the emphasis for us is, hey,
we've got to be down in a stance sometimes for 28, 29, 30 seconds at a time
defensively to get a stop because they're going to make you play two, three,
four sides of the floor sometimes before they shoot the ball. We've just got
to have great mental toughness in order to defend late in the clock.  
  
But in terms of the amount of possessions and that, it's not a huge thing for
us.  
  
Q. Sticking with the 100 percent that's Xs and Os, you guys did not take
the most threes in the league, but you had the best three-point percentage.
The way they pack in the lane, how important will your three-point shooting be
in this one?  
TIM CRAFT: It's going to be really important, and you said it from our
numbers. Offensively, we want to try to attack the paint on every possession,
and we're trying to get paint touches every possession before we shoot. They
make it real hard to do that with their defense. They make it really hard.
Just their one-on-one "D" is so good, I think, on the ball, and they get in
the gap so well and they're positioning so good. It's going to be hard to get
into the paint.  
  
So I think we've got to move the ball, we've got to cut, we've got to be
patient, and we've just got to make simple plays so that, when we drive it and
that help comes, we've just got to make the easy play and spray it and be
ready to shoot for sure or be ready to attack the next closeout.  
  
I do think making jump shots is important for our team to beat a team like
Virginia, because they're really good, but also because the way they defend
and how they pack their defense into the paint.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Virginia, head coach Tony
Bennett, SID Erich Bacher. Student-athletes with us are Kyle Guy, De'Andre
Hunter, Ty Jerome, and Jack Salt. We'll now open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Ty, you committed to Virginia early in your junior year of high
school. Kyle committed like six weeks later. When did you meet Kyle for the
first time? When did you first play together? This is for you too, Kyle. How
quickly did you realize that your games complemented each other?  
TY JEROME: I remember I committed, and then Kyle started following me on every
social media. I was like who is this kid? I think we started talking over
social media. He told me he was going to commit, and then I think I met him --
was it Mary Kline? The first time we played in the All-Star Game together
called Mary Kline Classic in New Jersey. He stayed at my house for the
weekend. We played for the first time there together. We were on the same
team, and it was just fun.  
  
We also went to Top 100 Camp together, too, at Virginia.  
  
KYLE GUY: I mean, he pretty much nailed it. I definitely bombarded him with a
lot of questions and follows in all forms of social media, and then I invited
myself to his house for the tournament and for the All-Star Game. We've been
friends ever since.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, having played in this arena already this year,
how much of an advantage is it for you knowing kind of a shooting background?
It's a unique background with the wide sight lines here. How do you guys feel
about playing here having played here already this season?  
JACK SALT: Yeah, I mean, it was good to play here during the season. Kind of
got a feel for the environment. It's good to have that game in our back
pocket.  
  
TY JEROME: Like he said, any time you can get familiar with an arena, there's
always a little bit of a benefit. But when the ball's tipped, nothing really
matters.  
  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, like they said, having experience in this gym
definitely helps us a lot.  
  
KYLE GUY: They pretty much nailed it. I don't need to say anything (laughter).  
  
Q. Ty, we know De'Andre's probably not going to talk about himself too
much, but he's been on the team two years and hasn't had a chance to play in
this event. Can you describe what it's like to have him on your side heading
into what you hope will be a long run here?  
TY JEROME: Yeah, just a guy that might be the most versatile guy in the
tournament, can guard one through five almost, can get a bucket when you need
one, isolation, offensive rebound, knock down catch-and-shoot shots. Does
everything, a guy you want on your team. Pretty cool guy off the court too.  
  
Q. For Ty and Kyle, the Gardner-Webb coach was saying that he's telling
his players have fun, play loose, attack, be confident, enjoy the moment,
enjoy the experience. Don't be tight. If you're tight, we have no chance. Are
you guys hearing the same thing from Coach Bennett? Is that the attitude you
guys are taking into the game?  
KYLE GUY: I'd say most teams are probably saying that you want to play free,
you want to have a sense of joy and fun when you're playing the game, but it's
also -- when you step on the court, it's business time. So there's a level of
focus that we have to have in preparation today that we're looking forward to.  
  
TY JEROME: For us, it's about doing what we've done to get to this point all
year. We've had a pretty successful year so far, and just about when we step
on the court, playing with that edge that we've had all year.  
  
Q. Kyle, the Gardner-Webb coach referred to Ty as the head of the snake.
Are you okay with that?  
KYLE GUY: 100 percent. I've been saying that all year. He runs the show, and
we just sit back and wait for his passes and knock them down.  
  
Q. Is he a snake?  
TY JEROME: Do you try to make him mad or --  
  
KYLE GUY: It is a compliment? I don't know. It is.  
  
Q. You mentioned the edge with which you guys play. What is the source
of that edge? Where does it come from?  
TY JEROME: I think it comes from knowing what we want to accomplish, how hard
it is to accomplish what we -- how hard it is to do that. Last year's defeat
and just the desire to be great and all those different things and try to
instill that in every single person on the team. So when we get into a tight
game or when we get into a tournament game like tomorrow, it's not just one or
two guys or three guys with that edge. You're playing ten different guys that
have that same edge.  
  
Q. For Kyle, you can speak for your teammates, as well. After what
happened a year ago, for those of us who haven't been around you, how have you
guys kind of dealt with that history moment, and how anxious are you to kind
of get that off your back and get a roll going this year?  
KYLE GUY: Coach Bennett and the coaching staff did a great job of making sure
we talked about it after when the next preseason started and stuff. So we've
become closer as a team. That loss doesn't define us. We watched a TED Talk,
and he said something along the lines of, if you use it right, it can buy you
a ticket to a place you couldn't have gone any other way. So that's been the
motto.  
  
Losses happen. We knew it was going to happen eventually. Just ready for this
year.  
  
Q. Last week in Charlotte at the ACC Tournament, I think you said to the
media, you guys don't have to apologize for asking about last year. I don't
know if you meant that or not. But do people kind of toe the line with you
guys when they see you around campus or in the media when they approach you
about last year? Or how badly do you guys want them to know that is behind
you?  
KYLE GUY: I'm not going to speak for anyone else, but like I said, you don't
have to apologize to me. I'm very transparent. No one around campus or grounds
really mentions it to us or anything. Some people don't let it go on social
media. I get Venmos all the time saying we've got to pay them $5 because we
lost. I don't pay them, by the way. But it definitely is behind us, and we're
ready to put on a show this year so we can talk about something else.  
  
Q. For Ty as well as Kyle, how much does it help having a lot of that
same group around that knows that hurt and that can fuel that going forward
into this tournament?  
TY JEROME: It's definitely helpful, but you've got to be careful because you
don't want to play with anger. You don't -- you've got to be careful playing
with anger, I should say. Last year, like Kyle said earlier, we watched a TED
Talk about it. We discussed it a lot. We used it as motivation. And like we
said, it can take you to a place you've never been if you use it the right
way. So it's more about doing what we do, playing with our same edge every
single game we've played so far this year rather than just knowing we've got
to make up for last year and playing with anxiousness and anger.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I would say in practice, whenever somebody's tired or you're
trying to fight through a rep or take a play off or something, I always think
back to that. And then when I'm on the court, I don't even think about it. I'm
focused on what's in front of me because, if you're too focused on the past,
you're not going to be able to move forward.  
  
So, yeah, it's a chip on our shoulder, but it doesn't define us. We're just
trying to move past it and let the inspiration and motivation behind it take
us somewhere we haven't been.  
  
Q. Real quick, Kyle, screen saver on your phone, is it still the
picture?  
KYLE GUY: Yes, ma'am.  
  
Q. De'Andre, for you, as you hear these guys talk about last year and
knowing you couldn't be on the court for that, just kind of curious your
mentality and what emotions it stirs up as you hear them reflecting on last
year and look forward to this year?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: I'm just excited for myself and more for the team just to get
back to this stage and have the same opportunity as last year to play against
the 16 seed and possibly erase what happened last year. People are going to
still remember, but we have another opportunity to do something really special
in this tournament.  
  
Q. Kyle, Ty has talked about how much he learned from London
(Perrantes), the one year they played together. Was there anybody that first
year, the older guys, who was a mentor to you?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I would say London, also. He was my roommate on the road, so I
learned a lot from him. But to be honest, I learn so much from all these guys
every day. Even freshman year, I was learning a lot from Ty and his mindset
and the way he plays the game, so yeah.  
  
Q. Ty and Kyle, this TED Talk you're referring to, was this specifically
about your situation, or was it about handling adversity and using it to your
advantage in the future? And who made the TED Talk?  
THE MODERATOR: Whoever has that answer.  
  
TY JEROME: No, they didn't make a TED Talk just for us. It was --  
  
KYLE GUY: His name was The Storyteller.  
  
TY JEROME: Yeah, it was The Storyteller, and it actually had nothing to do
with basketball, the TED Talk. It was a story he told about his life
experiences, which weren't basketball related, but most of the times, you can
relate almost anything to your passion.  
  
Q. This is for Kyle again. Could you talk about Braxton Key's
contributions this year.  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I would go as far to say he's one of the better rebounders on
the team. I think he leads the team in rebounding, unlimited minutes, and he's
gained a lot of trust from the players and the coaching staff. In these last
few games, he's coming around at the right time as we move forward in March.
His versatility has been great, and he's improved every day.  
  
TY JEROME: This one's got to be for Jack.  
  
Q. De'Andre, I'm curious, as you're watching the TED Talk and even going
back to just watching the game itself, what was that experience like for you,
and how many times have you run over what you could have contributed had you
been there?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: I feel like in the moment I wasn't really thinking about it
because I wasn't playing, but a few days after, I just thought about how I
wouldn't be able to play with those guys again, play with that team again. I
mean, it kind of hurt, but I don't really think about what I could have
contributed to the game because it doesn't matter. I didn't play, so just try
to move on.  
  
Q. This one's for Ty. Sorry, Jack. Specifically for you, Ty, Jose Perez
on Gardner-Webb says he knows you a little bit from some AAU experience. Can
you talk about him a little bit and how you know him and just what Gardner-
Webb, what jumps out on film about them?  
TY JEROME: So we actually played in the same AAU program, PSA Cardinals in New
York. I played against him, our high schools twice, I think. I heard he's
having a great year. I think he leads them in rebounds. He posts a lot from
the four position. He's been a versatile four for them, passed the ball well
from out of the post. So I heard he's having a great year.  
  
I think that versatility jumps out on film. One through five shoot the three.
They're a little smaller, but they all attack. They're balanced. They have
some really good athletes. They defend. They share the ball. They don't turn
it over much. So they're a real good team. It's going to be a battle.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jack, do you want to elaborate on anything that jumps out about
Gardner-Webb?  
  
JACK SALT: Sure. Like Ty was saying, they're very versatile. They have five
men that can shoot the three, face up and relentless. It's going to be a good
matchup. We're excited to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. This can go to any of you guys really, but I guess, as it relates to
a year ago, you have new pieces that you didn't have then -- De'Andre being
one, Braxton being another, Kihei being another. How much more equipped do you
guys feel to play small ball defensively than you were maybe a year ago?  
THE MODERATOR: This will be the final question. So we'll start with Kyle and
anyone else answer.  
  
KYLE GUY: I would say that on the ball Kihei brings something to the game that
I've never played with or experienced. I'm not sure that full court-wise,
Coach Bennett's ever seen anything like this in his program. He will be a key
piece moving forward. Like I said, Braxton being able to rebound is huge.
Obviously, we know what Dre brings to the table is just a little bit of
everything. So whenever you're not playing with someone like that, your team's
going to struggle a little bit. We've got him healthy and back and ready to
go.  
  
With Braxton and Kihei, I'm just excited for them to play with this team in
the tournament for the first time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thank you guys.  
  
Virginia head coach, Tony Bennett.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Obviously, excited to be back here and getting ready to play. I
heard the tail end of our guys' responses, and I'm sure you guys got a lot of
questions for me. So I'll look forward to answering them. Again, thankful to
be in this spot, and we know how good, I'm sure you'll ask me, Gardner-Webb
is, and we'll try to prepare as well as we can and look forward to playing
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tony, you don't always get a chance to see your incoming recruits
play together before they get to college. Were you confident that Ty and Kyle
would complement each other as well on the court as they have?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, they're smart, skilled players, and they got to play in
the NBA Top 100 Camp. They might have been on the same team, but they played
in that. Just watching them in AAU, guys that have a feel for the game and are
skilled and smart usually gel or mesh together, and they've done that. I think
they've come in, and they've added to their physical. Coach Curtis has done a
great job. They've gotten stronger and more athletic. But, again, the way they
play the ball and the way they are, it was can we get them ready defensively?
They've even taken steps in that area. So no question they have that.  
  
Q. Some of your players describe Gardner-Webb's style as relentless and
balanced. What jumps out to you?  
TONY BENNETT: I'm impressed, well-coached. Tim does a great job. Teams that
have fours and fives that can -- well, all the players that can shoot the
three, multiple actions, great spacing of the floor, very good numbers
offensively and defensively. Just, they're good. They beat two ACC opponents
on the road, and one of the ACC assistants just called me and said they're
very good. You've got to be ready. They can play.  
  
Of course we're going to be ready. We understand that. When you get into this
tournament, everybody can play. So just their balance, their ability to
stretch the floor, the actions that they run, and, again, what D.J. did in the
championship game was amazing, but they have multiple players to attack and
score and play that way.  
  
Q. Tony, I wanted to ask you about Ritchie McKay, your former assistant,
obviously at Liberty, in the tournament for the first time since 2013. What
stood out to you about your time with him as an assistant and how impressed
are you with how he's been able to turn around the program to get to the NCAA
Tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: He did a great job when he was there the first time. Ritchie was
such a blessing for me to come in. He was a friend from way back, head
coaching experience, and have -- you know, I think he had been in the Virginia
area for I don't know how many years exactly when I took the job. But
excellent recruiter, understands the game at a high level offensively, great
mind. Just who he is.  
  
You have to, when you go through these rebuilding programs or the rigors of
just seasons, you want people that you always say are with you irregardless,
and you trust them. That was built in because of our relationship before,
because of who he is.  
  
Hopefully, he helped our program. Hopefully, he gained some things. But he's
taken that job, and he's got very good players. They play a sound system.
They're defending well. He's got them doing good stuff offensively. So really
happy to see the success that he had and Coach Soucie's there, who was with us
as well.  
  
Q. Over the course of the season, how do you make sure the guys are sort
of mentally where they need to be at this point of the year. During the
regular season, can it kind of feel long at times, and if so, how do you make
sure this time of year they're at their best going into tournament play?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, you're always trying -- the teams that can advance are the
teams that are healthy, that are playing their best basketball and are fresh.
The season is challenging and it's long. You know you always look at the
season and say how can we try to peak at the right time and play our best
basketball? When you're in a league like the ACC, we always use the term, it
will check you for leaks. If you've got leaks, it will show up. You just have
to be ready any time out. You're hopeful at that competition, if there's
something that's off, it will show and then we'll address it to work at it.
Just prepare the right way. That's all you can do.  
  
I told our guys they're going to get so many questions, I'm sure, about last
year, and I said, here's the deal. I said, you respect your opponent, which is
easy to do because they're very good. You respect the game. You prepare well
and then get yourself in the moment and go out and play. That's what you can
control. Again, you try to get your team playing the best basketball. But
that's the reality of it. Hopefully, we're in a good spot and ready to play.  
  
Q. Tony, dovetailing off of that, your players talked about channeling
last year's disappointment properly. What constitutes during that, and how do
you prepare them just having dealt with that for this stage now?  
TONY BENNETT: Everybody processes things or internalizes things differently,
but in all of your experiences when you go through a relatively hard thing,
those are the things that can really shape you, as you guys talk about, if you
learn to use them right. That was something we've talked about as a team and
certainly have dealt with it, and we've said we've owned that, and I think
that's just use it in the right way. You don't stay in it forever, but you
grow from all those things, but especially that, and then attack this year.  
  
We talked about running to the starting line. That was kind of a theme we
talked about through this year, and playing in the best way. Certainly,
there's motivation from all the experiences that have happened in the past,
but I think it's the ability, as I said, to prepare well and be in the moment
now and be as good as you can and know you're going to be -- it's a new year
and kind of that idea of pressing on, pressing on.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett, the players were talking about a TED Talk that they
watched. Was that your idea? Do you remember who gave the talk and what the
point of the whole exercise was?  
TONY BENNETT: It was -- if you've ever watched TED Talks, they're very -- I
think they're inspirational. Actually, it was done in Charlottesville, a guy
named Joe the Storyteller. He had gone through or witnessed something, a hard
thing. At the start of the year, we showed it. It was powerful. It was a
unique, I thought, TED Talk that really spoke to the situation at hand, and
it's really just there's so many things guys take from it, but the ability to
learn to use things that happen in your life in the right way because there's
just a quote -- and I think I shared it at ACC Media Day -- that if you learn
to use it right, it can buy you a ticket to a place that you couldn't have
gone any other way, talking about a hard experience. That was kind of the idea
about that.  
  
You know, that's the reality of the talk and the guys, and we've used that and
shared that and said, in anything, what can we learn from this? Are we
thankful for what we learned? Whether it's a tough loss, a great win, or a
situation like last year, the ability to grow from that and respond in the
right way.  
  
Q. Coach, you can show guys, and you can talk to them about certain
things, but what most impressed you, the message that you gave them last year
after that loss and the things you told them in the off-season? What's most
impressed your -- what's most caught your attention and impressed you during
the regular season about the growth and maturity of this team?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, you just, as I said, the league is good. You've got to
step in the moment and play. And with the guys' consistency -- a conference
season or a season is about the consistency of your team on the road, at home,
over 2 1/2 months or 18 games in the ACC. That's a different kind of challenge
than the NCAA Tournament. The NCAA Tournament or the ACC is the one-and-done,
but I've marvelled that how they found ways, they rallied, and they were at a
very consistent level for the most part. That doesn't always happen when
you're in a league -- any league, really -- because usually there's some drop-
offs or dips, and certainly that's possible.  
  
But how they did that -- what was our record in conference? What were we,
16-2, right? Yes, I had to go back. To be able to do that over that consistent
time, that impressed me. And they really played together. I think their
versatility was important, and they all improved in the off-season. So that
always stands out to me that, over that course of time, I think that's kind of
what you're asking, where I step back and say, hard to do, and they did it and
well done.  
  
Q. Curious if you could just speak to the impact of having De'Andre this
year in the tournament and his versatility and what he brings and the
difference it will be having him.  
TONY BENNETT: De'Andre's had a heck of a year. He's improved. You said it, his
versatility. Defensively, we've used him at times to guard ones, twos, threes,
and fours. That can be helpful. The way the game is going with fours and fives
now that are playing just like guards and separating, you need mobilitity and
quickness to be able to hopefully guard guys like that well. Offensively,
we've used De'Andre some on the perimeter and some as kind of a stretch four,
and he's been able, at times, to certainly manufacture some shots, shot-making
ability. Those things, I think, are really important, and you have to account
for him on the offensive end. He's scoring the post some. He's just versatile
really in both ways.  
  
So at 6'7" or 6'8" with the long wingspan, just his dimensions are good. So
just a high quality player, obviously, and I think that any time you can have
a versatile player that can play some four for you or three, I think that's
what helped us last year and has helped us again this year, among other
things.  
  
Q. Coach, Jack talked about Laster as a guy who can score on the
outside, on the inside. Whether it's Jack defending him or someone else,
what's the key to defending a versatile big like that?  
TONY BENNETT: What was the first part?  
  
Q. Jack mentioned Laster as a guy that can score --  
TONY BENNETT: I thought you said last year. Oh, Laster. You have to be really
good individually on him, and then collectively as a team, it can't be one man
just stopping him because what he did in the tournament and all, he's playing
his best basketball now, but it's not just him. You can say, well, we can just
lock into him. They have so many other quality players that can score and are
efficient, but they do a lot of good stuff with ball screens. You've got to be
able to stop the ball and quick to him as a shooter and then be able to spread
out because he drives well and, again, inside, outside. I think he's shooting
over 40 from three. Their team is shooting almost 40 percent. So it puts
pressure and the challenge on you, but very alert and very ready and quick to
him because of his ability to play outside and inside as their five a lot of
times.  
  
Q. Tony, I've seen you after some tough losses. You seem to have this
incredible calm about you in those tough -- in the toughest moments probably
of your career. Is that a conscious choice for you to act that way, to comport
yourself that way, or is that just something that comes naturally to you? When
you're ever in private, do you ever go somewhere and scream?  
TONY BENNETT: Punch the pillow. I used to do that when I played for my dad.
When he'd yell at me, I'd go to the dorm and say this is a pillow and pretend
as he's chewed us out. Of course you do.  
  
I'm thankful for the things -- you certainly feel things, and things bother
you, but where does peace and perspective come from? I always tell our guys
it's got to be something that is unconditional, and I know I have that in the
love of my family. Unconditional, acceptance and love. That's huge. And I know
I have that in my faith in Christ. That's, for me, where I draw my strength
from, my peace, my steadiness in the midst of things. But, of course you feel
things. Of course you desperately want things to go well, and it's frustrating
when you're not. You step back and look at it.  
  
I always challenge our guys, what's your secret of contentment? What's your
secret of contentment? There's going to be times, it talks about you're going
to be well fed and living in plenty, and there's going to be times when you're
going to be starving and living in want. What's your secret of handling that?
That I know, without a doubt, those of us who have parents or kids, that love
you give them unconditionally or if your faith is there, that has to buoy you,
and that has to be your center, and you dwell on what is good because there is
a bigger picture in all of this, and I believe I understand that. So going
through those refining moments, they're tough, but you look back at them, and
in a way, they're sometimes painful gifts that draw you near to what truly
matters. I think that's the best way I could respond to that.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 81, Washington - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina head coach Roy Williams and Luke
Maye and Cameron Johnson. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think, needless to say, anybody that advances past this
point you feel good about a win in the second round. Last year, we had a
really, really nice year. In the second round we stumbled. We talked about it
quite a bit this summer, and I think the kids were really good at times today.  
  
Ten turnovers in the first half was very discouraging, but other than that I
thought we did some really good things in the first half. Second half, we got
it down to only five turnovers and still shot 50 percent. I think that was
good.  
  
Our work on the backboards was something. Luke, 14 rebounds to go along with
his 20 points. I think Nassir gave us a big lift. And I think two kids really
showed a lot of toughness today. Garrison, he'll have to go see the dentist
before we leave town to get two teeth straightened out. And he had some
stitches put in, and he came back and played almost the entire second half.  
  
And Kenny strained his hamstring and came back and tried to guard like crazy
when he got in there. And love our toughness, love the edge that our bench
gave us today. And just love the way we kept competing. And happy as we can be
that we're still; really happy with these two guys up here beside me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cameron, and Luke you can answer too, what makes you so effective
attacking the zone? This is not the first time you've played so well against
that?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: The key today was getting the ball to the middle. The middle
was a soft spot. They were covering the wings and the perimeter pretty well.
And once we got it inside, it was basically a two on one for an easy jump shot
or a dump down. And I think we exploited that a lot more in the second half
than we did the first half.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I would agree. I think the biggest thing for us was trying to score
in a different variety of ways. And I think we scored inside. We were able to
score out of transition. Coby did an unbelievable job pushing the ball and
that really allowed us to get out and run.  
  
And then offensive glass was really big for us. Coach emphasized it a lot
coming into the game. And I thought we did a good job. Garrison had a few big
rebounds. Naz did a great job off the bench. Naz was great. When you throw it
to Naz in the middle and he just elevates over everybody, it allows it to be a
pretty effective zone offense.  
  
Q. Second game in a row you were much better defensively, seemed like,
in the second half. Is that a matter of kind of feeling out the opponent in
the first half? Is it a matter of the urgency that you guys talked about
Friday night? What would you attribute that to?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I would say a lot has to do with the urgency. I feel like
when we're defending the way we're capable of, we do a pretty good job. When
we lose focus, when we lose urgency, we don't do as well. I think we did a
better job in the second half today.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I don't want to give Coach too much credit, but I think when Coach
gets on us at halftime it fires us up a little bit, and I think it makes us
want to guard better for him. And it just shows how much our coaching staff
cares about us and cares about how much they want us to win.  
  
And we've got to bring that from the jump. And that's coming from the senior
leaders. And I take that upon myself, and Cam and Kenny. But I think the
second half we did a lot better job and it was big for us.  
  
Q. Cam, at the risk of embarrassing him, could you just talk, explain
what Luke's development has been like since you've been in this program?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I saw it when I first stepped on the campus for my visit.
When he was playing pickup, he was playing with a lot of confidence. And that
confidence, as you keep playing, you keep getting experience, you keep
getting, better and better and better.  
  
And so the Luke I saw when I was playing at Pitt versus the Luke I saw in
pickup that day, versus the Luke we see today, we just see a lot of growth.
And the kid works. He's in the gym all the time getting up extra shots. And he
plays harder than just about anybody. He works harder than just about anybody.
And that's a testament to his character.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: When you're as old as Cam is you can call Luke Maye a kid.
Gotcha. (Laughter.)  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Luke, maybe you can speak for yourself, what's it meant to you, your
career, your growth and to be in this position now?  
LUKE MAYE: It's been huge. I give a lot of it to my teammates just because of
how much they've believed in me and getting me into my spots. And the coaches
have believed in me since the very beginning.  
  
And it's really been great to have such a great coaching staff to really give
me the opportunities I had earlier in my career. Coach always said that he
believed in me from the beginning, and he gave me opportunities when I didn't
even think I wanted the opportunities.  
  
And it was big for me to continue to grow and develop as a player. And I
thought today it was a great win for us, and moving on to the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. After the loss last year to Texas A &M in the second round, how does
it feel to be in the Sweet 16?  
LUKE MAYE: We talked about it all summer. To lose that way and to have Joe and
Theo go out like that was really hard, especially for the guys who felt like
it was on us. And, I mean, I feel like it's just a testament to how hard we
worked and get back to the spot.  
  
And I think it's been great to see how many guys have grown this season and
really stepped up. And B-Rob gave us great minutes when Kenny went down. And
Garrison came -- like, Coach talked about him. He was just huge for us. And it
really shows how much character we have in the locker room.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Agreed.  
  
Q. Luke, you guys are ranked No. 1 in the country rebounding margin. I
believe they came in at 289. Did you feel you could exploit them on the
boards? And what did you do to take full advantage of that today?  
LUKE MAYE: Yes, it was in our scouting reports to take advantage of them on
the offensive glass, and defensively we just gotta box out. I had a couple
missed box-outs. I'll take the blame for that later.  
  
I think it's big Coach emphasize rebounding first time in practice. And I try
to pride myself in working hard and trying to get as many offensive rebounds
as I can. And I think Garrison's done a good job, and so has Cam and Naz. It's
been great to see how much they've grown offensively and defensively,
rebounding-wise.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Two games in a row that Nassir has seemed to embrace kind of getting
the ball in the middle and really attacking the rim. Is that a matter of
maturation for him? Is that a conversation you guys have had, maybe?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, it's a little bit of it is maturing. But he was
really coming along really, really well. And then he got his ankle hurt, and
then he got hit in the face -- in the eye, excuse me. And those kind of things
set him back quite a bit.  
  
But he's such a gifted guy around that basket, so quick, jumps so high that I
think he himself is realizing it more now than he did early in the practices
and early in the games. I was very happy when he went out to shoot that 3
right in front of our bench because it was a shot that everybody wanted him to
take. And we've seen him take those and he works extremely hard on the shot.  
  
But he has an ability to get around that basket and with the jumping ability
and the quickness he has and the power that he has, he can hurt a lot of
people inside. So it's a little bit of maturing, but it's also him getting
healthy again, because I really thought during that time period that he was
going to really take off. And he had about a four, five-game stretch, maybe
more or less, I don't know, that he wasn't as effective. But the last two
games he's been something else for us.  
  
Q. Coach, seems like with the popularity of the 3-pointer gaining each
year, that some teams lose a mid-range game. They either dunk or hit a 3. Is
Luke leading the revival of that in the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: All our guys, I tell them all the time I want great balance. I
want to shoot the 3-point shot by guys who can make them. I want to get the
ball inside because you get the other team in foul trouble.  
  
We wanted to get Dickerson in foul trouble today and we weren't able to do it.
We were able to get Iona's big guy in trouble yesterday.  
  
I like balance and 3-point shots and -- shots inside to get the other team in
foul trouble. And Luke Maye can make it from 12 feet and 14 feet, and he
shoots a high percentage there than he does from the 3-point line. I like
those, I like makers.  
  
But our team was very unselfish today and after, as I said, the turnovers in
the first half I really liked what we did with the basketball, too.  
  
Q. I know it's early but could you assess where you guys fit in, some of
the challenges you anticipate you may face?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I could, but I really haven't thought about that. I
swear, guys, nobody in the history of basketball has ever just played one game
and then started thinking about the other one after that is over with as much
as I do.  
  
I know who we play next and I know who -- no, I don't. I know who we play next
and I know where that is. And that's about it. Because I really do try to live
in the moment and coach that game. And I'm very pleased with what we've done
to get to this stage.  
  
I told the guys Marty Schottenheimer, coach at Kansas City, always talked
about enjoying the wins until midnight. In the locker room I asked them, do we
play Thursday/Saturday or do we play Friday/Sunday? They said Friday/Sunday. I
said maybe we'll enjoy this one a little past midnight. But that's all it's
going to be.  
  
But for us we're extremely happy to be where we are, but at the same time we
just want to enjoy this one and we'll start focusing on Auburn, I guess, who
is the next team that we play.  
  
Q. Maybe you can speak to as far as what kind of growth you've seen over
the past two games. What in particular has gotten better? What needs to get
better?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we've got our tails beat at -- is Cason (phonetic) back
there? That's my boss back there. She's been my boss for 46 years. And my
grandson is waiting for me, so we'll get this done quickly.  
  
Throughout the course of the second half of the season I think we got better
and better and better. And our teams, a lot of our teams have done that
because they really focus and our staff really pushes. We don't just get too
high over a big win or way down over a loss; we try to get better every single
day.  
  
And I think if you talk to our team they'd tell you that's the focus. And
we've gotten better. But so has Auburn and some of these other teams that are
going to be playing. But I do like how our kids have focused down the stretch
and gotten better every game.  
  
Q. Luke had 20 and seemed to be thriving in the middle of that zone.
Could you talk about what he was able to do so well against this defense?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Same thing he said. We played against Syracuse's zone, we've
had some good success. But they've beaten our tail sometimes too.  
  
But I don't mind the other team playing zone. But I don't mind -- I don't care
what they play because we're so much freelance, we don't run a ton of set
plays. So we really don't care what offense -- excuse me, what defense they
run.  
  
When you move yourself and move the ball intelligently and try to find the
holes -- and we've had some success, but we know we've gotta do it again next
week.  
  
Q. What Luke was saying before, you believed in him from the beginning.
What was about him that made you believe in him?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I knew his father was a great individual, when he was in
school and a quarterback for us, and he comes to camp I'll miss the years,
sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth grade, I kept telling his dad: don't be in a
hurry because I think he's going to be good enough.  
  
The thing with me, he had great hands and he could shoot the ball and a brain
that he used, and a work ethic. So I'll take all those qualities all the time.
But I did have confidence and faith in him and still do. And I hope to do it
for a long time.  
  
Q. How did Coby's 3-pointers there, one, two, three, four in the first
half, kind of spark that offense? One from the corner was a very deep fade-
away there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was a bad shot. It went in. All of a sudden it's a
great shot. But Coby has an ability to score. They were trying to cover him.
They were trying to have somebody in front of him the whole game. And he
picked his spots. And I thought he really did a nice job for us. He didn't
have many opportunities the second half because they tried to cover him more,
but he was good.  
  
Q. Two years ago Luke was really important to you guys making the title
run. What he did tonight, and even the impact he had in the second half,
Friday night, how good does that make you feel and how important is that going
to be going forward?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I agree with you, couple of years ago he's the MVP of the
regional and he does score a field goal at the Final Four. But he was
important to us. And last year maybe as good a year as I've ever had a kid
from sophomore to junior, the biggest jump he's had. He's an intelligent young
man. He finds the holes in the zone really well. Knows how important
rebounding is and adjusts his game to be a great rebounder, because you look
at him you don't think he's going to be a guy that's going to get 14, 16
rebounds against really good competition.  
  
So I say it's his intelligence and his desire more than anything. But he's
just a remarkable young man. And I'm very lucky to coach him.  
  
And I will tell you, you and I are okay for another year. If you want to try
to jinx me next year -- I know you didn't try to, that's not what I'm saying,
but I showed -- my wife even laughed because she did say I was smiling when I
did say that. Thank you. I'm going to go see my little grandson.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 83, Iowa - 77 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll bypass the opening statement from Coach and start with
your questions for the Iowa players -- Joe Wieskamp, Isaiah Moss and Luka
Garza all with us. Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Isaiah, what got into you at halftime? What sparked the comeback in
the second half?  
ISAIAH MOSS: That just shows our resilience. Like the game against Cincinnati,
we don't give up. We know if we continue to fight we give ourselves a chance
to win.  
  
JOE WIESKAMP: At halftime -- obviously it wasn't the start we wanted -- we had
a decision to make. We could either fold and hand it to them. Or we could
fight back. I think we showed that in the second half. And we were able to
take it to them in overtime.  
  
LUKA GARZA: Just kind of like in the Cincinnati game, when we had that timeout
when we were down 18-5, in that timeout in the locker room at halftime you
could tell something was about to happen. All the guys were communicating with
each other, believing in each other. Our leaders were stepping up and talking
to each other to make sure we weren't going to go down without a fight. And we
were going to leave everything out on the floor.  
  
Q. Luka, the reverse of that, what happened in the overtime? How were
they able to take hold of it so quickly?  
LUKA GARZA: Grant Williams hit some big shots. He's a big-time player. And we
defended him well. He had a couple turnarounds and different stuff like that.  
  
And I think we executed well down the stretch when we needed to toward the end
and got a couple of layups to keep us in it. But I think if we could have
stopped him, it was hard. Those were really well-defended shots. Tyler did a
great job in those moments on him. Just credit to him for that.  
  
ISAIAH MOSS: What Luka said, he's made tough shots down the stretch. Tyler did
a good job on him the whole game, I thought. But made great shots.  
  
JOE WIESKAMP: Credit to Tennessee. They hit some tough shots. Grant Williams,
obviously, the SEC Player of the Year. But like he said, we executed down the
stretch, too.  
  
Q. Joe, seemed like a very disruptive defense from Tennessee that had
you guys out of your rhythm in the first half. Is that something that you were
able to get back on track in the second?  
JOE WIESKAMP: Yeah, I think so. Not the first half that we had hoped for. But
you could tell the resiliency and the fight of us in the second half. I think
we kind of got into their space a little bit in the second half. We were able
to turn them over quite a bit and execute on offense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It took a lot of courage to come back, to get to the overtime; they
decide to put Schofield on the bench and go big. Did that surprise you?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Yeah, I figured he'd be out there. He played well in the
game. He's one of their better players. But again, I've got enough trouble
coaching my own team. So whatever Rick decides to do, I have great respect for
him, respect for that team.  
  
They were No. 1 for a very long time this year for a reason. It's not often
that you get down 25, come back and tie it. So very pleased with the effort
and concentration and execution of our guys to a man.  
  
Q. There's a lot of talk from your players about what happened at
halftime. Was it more technical changes, emotional? Where did you try and
strike?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the critical thing in a situation like that, a lot of
things that we thought we were going to be able to do we weren't able to do in
the first half. I give credit to our opponent. They were up in our space. They
picked us up full court. They were literally sideways going east/west.  
  
Didn't get great looks at it. Down 44-19, and it just didn't look good. I
challenged Tyler Cook to be who he is. And I'm really proud of him. Not in a
negative way. That's not how I am. He's a special young man with great
character. I knew he was better than that. The same with Luka.  
  
So you talk about a few things from a technical perspective. You stay
positive. You challenge a few guys to be better than they were. And you're
trying at that point to build confidence, because we didn't play like a
confident group in the first half. I think that was obvious. So what do we
have to do as coaches to get them to play to their capabilities? That's all
you can ask from them. You can't ask more than that.  
  
It starts with effort. And I think it really started with we got some stops
early. We got some run-outs. We got a few buckets. Cook got going. Then Garza
got going. Then Moss got going. Then Bohannon got going. And we just fed off
of that energy. And the impressive thing for me, and what I'm most proud of as
a coach, is how we stayed connected and we stayed together, because anything
short of that and you're not going to be able to come back like we did.  
  
Q. Obviously you're disappointed; you wanted to win this game. But to
come back from 25 against a team of that caliber, does it make it more
palatable to know that you exited the way that, hey, we left it all out there,
was everything we could do?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Absolutely. It's the only thing that we can ever really ask
of our guys. We put a game plan together. We know it's not going to be
perfection. It never is.  
  
But what you hope to get is a perfect effort. And that's what we got. And I
think anytime that happens, you just want to hug your guys and tell them how
much you love them because you appreciate how hard it was to do what they did.  
  
Q. Quick thumbnail sketch, if you had to describe what makes Tennessee
maybe the best team in the country, what would you say?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: They've got a lot of weapons. They play both ends. They play
defense. They share the ball. They have go-to guys. They shoot it well enough
so you can't really just say, okay, we're just going to back it up. They shoot
the ball well. They have low-post options. And they have tremendous speed and
quickness.  
  
I think it's a confident, veteran group, which I think always helps especially
this time of year, but it helps you throughout the course of the year. It's
the reason why they have the record they have. So they're going to be a tough
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 81, Washington - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington head coach Mike Hopkins and student-
athletes Matisse Thybulle and Jaylen Nowell. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, you get a chance to play Carolina, it's a pretty
incredible opportunity. And I felt in the first half, you know, we got down.
We kept fighting back. Showed a lot of resiliency. Cut the lead to eight.
Missed a couple of foul shots at the end.  
  
And Coby White hit 4-for-5 from the 3-point line in the first half. We felt
like in the second half if we could find him, do a better job on the glass we
could be there.  
  
And they're just a really big team, really good shooting team. It seemed like
when they missed they got the rebound. And you're not going to win too many
games getting outrebounded by 24. Our kids kept fighting. They battled like
champions like they are. Unfortunately we ran into a tough Carolina team
tonight.  
  
Q. Matisse, how would you summarize your final season at Washington?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I mean, like everyone's going to come into college saying
you want to play on this stage and be able to win your league and be able to
say you're a champion, all those things. I was able to accomplish all that
this year with three seniors, three of my senior teammates who we've been
through it all together.  
  
And even with these new guys, like Jaylen and the young guys, to be able to
bond together and achieve so much in my last year, I couldn't have imagined it
coming through, and I'm glad that I was able to do it with these guys.  
  
Q. Jaylen, you've played some good teams, other tournament teams this
season, including No. 1 Gonzaga. Could you compare and contrast North Carolina
with what you've seen from other top teams?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, they're all really good teams. They all play very hard.
One thing I can say about North Carolina is that they're really resilient.
When we were up on them -- I gotta give them credit -- they kept playing and
they kept going at us. And they're a really good team.  
  
Q. Matisse, did you feel like there was a lot going on behind you for an
inordinate amount of time on defense?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: We flew around for the most part on defense, had some pretty
good energy. But like Coach said, the rebounding killed us. And they're a big
team, a strong team, a physical team. And we weren't able to get back and grab
a lot of those rebounds from the missed shots that we forced.  
  
Q. Jaylen, you had everyone on the team seemed like, especially in the
second half, some very good looks and then things just didn't go for a roll.  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Yeah, you know that's just how the game goes sometimes. So we
just try to make sure that even though those shots were falling we were able
to pick it up at least from the defensive end. That was really our main focus
when our shots weren't falling.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You obviously accomplished a lot in two years. I realize this is a
disappointing conclusion. But how do you assess now what was done and what
you've got to do?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think at the end of the day you see what the best looks like,
feels like, and Carolina's got a lot. They've got great guard play, great size
and great shooting. They're physical. They're big. And you saw what it felt
like.  
  
Sometimes our best offense is a smaller team. And you see the size that you've
got to have to get to be a top-level program. And that's our goal. That's our
standard. That's what we're going to try to do.  
  
And I learned a lot tonight. I think it was great for everybody. We always say
it doesn't matter, get better, DMGB. At the end of the day we're frustrated we
lost but really proud of the guys winning 29 games, winning the Pac-12
outright by three games, and played some really tough competition. Got into
the tournament, which was a major goal for this program. And to win a game.  
  
Unfortunately we didn't play our best tonight but that had a lot to do with
North Carolina. And the younger guys got some minutes and they got a chance to
feel what this is all about. And that's, I think, the greatest thing that
could happen for our program as we build forward, is to feel it, see it and
experience it, because that's a feeling playing in this tournament like no
other in this sport. And it's what you want every year. So to be able to
experience it with the young guys as well as what the seniors have
accomplished, I'm really, really proud.  
  
Q. What's the biggest positive you can take out of this experience with
the whole tournament and everything?  
COACH HOPKINS: The positive is for -- we're trying to build a program, and
when you're building a program, you've got to -- you get a lot through
experience. And to be able to win a game and to feel it, sometimes, you know,
you walk out on that court, on that stage, it's pretty big. I've seen it a
lot. But our guys haven't.  
  
And it's a pretty cool thing. And I've learned so many things. But the most
important was for our guys to understand that what it takes to get to this
level. And then what it's going to take to win a national championship. And
there's nothing like experience. And this experience is definitely going to
elevate and push us forward.  
  
Q. Noah was particularly impressed by how Carolina handled your guys'
zone. What did you see out there in terms of their execution. And how much do
you think them seeing it against Syracuse --  
COACH HOPKINS: I think the biggest thing is our zone is active; it's been
great all year. And I think the biggest thing is, when you're talking about
like size, you talk about Syracuse at 6'6", 6'6" at the guards and 7'1", and
guys holding hands from sideline to sideline.  
  
And that's why I give our guys a lot of credit when we have Dickerson in the
game, Noah, he's 6'6", 6'7". And you've got Jaylen at 6'3" in the back line.
It can be disruptive.  
  
We still had 12 takeaways, which was really good. But the rebounding aspect of
it was just a little bit too overwhelming. And you've got to pick your poison.
You can't defend everything.  
  
And so when they started making those 3s with Coby White, and then they kind
of spaced, pushed us out a little bit. And then when they got inside, you
know, those guys are pretty darned good.  
  
It's just one of those nights. Listen, they're one of the best teams in the
country. We got to experience it. We didn't have our best game. I thought at
the beginning of the second half we hit the 3 to cut it to five, and we didn't
get back. And that's what they're known for, is their transition; they hit a
3.  
  
So every time we kind of swung and hit them a little bit, they came back with
a haymaker, but a great learning experience for our guys.  
  
Q. You mentioned when they got it inside, just talk a little bit about
Little and Maye, 20 points each, and most of it was just getting it right
there in the lane and being able to do something with it.  
COACH HOPKINS: You know what, they remind me of Gonzaga a lot. They have
really good big guys that are great interior passers and guys that can operate
in that high post area. And it's a hard cover for us. It's a hard matchup.  
  
And I thought they got us everywhere. They got us in the high post. They got
us on the 3. They got to the foul line. And, unfortunately, I thought we got
some good looks. We just had one of those shooting nights: when you play
against a team like this, almost everything has to go right; you don't have a
large margin for error. And we just didn't have enough.  
  
Q. Their transition after made baskets was, I guess, borderline
astonishing. I'm sure you talked all about it yesterday. Why is that so hard
to coach against?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, like I said before, the great thing about experience,
we played Kansas last year who runs pretty good, not like this. Played
Gonzaga, who I think really pushes the ball. It's just one of those things.  
  
We had Noah playing the forward. So it was a little bit different. So we were
going inside to him and Hameir is playing the center. One was a defensive
breakdown, the first play of the second half, or the second play, he ran down
the middle and Noah had (indiscernible) foul, they just sprinted down and we
didn't recognize and helped the guy who had fell.  
  
But it was something that we emphasized going in, when you play Carolina, it's
very simple: transition defense and defensive rebound. And we did a decent --
the fastbreak points are off here, because it was four at halftime and they
hit the 3. And then Coby went all the way for a layup. So there was more
opportunities. But that's what they do. And we just didn't do a great job in
those two areas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 83, Iowa - 77 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee student-athletes Grant Williams and
Admiral Schofield as well as head coach Rick Barnes. Questions for the
student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Admiral, can you explain how you guys can look so dominant for long
stretches and then have what happened --  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Honestly, one of the things we always say is that it
doesn't have to be perfect, never has to be perfect because basketball is
never perfect. Most times that's how a game goes sometimes.  
  
You have a big run, you have stretches. The way we started the game, that's
the team we win. The way we finished the game, we can't have that. That's what
got us beat throughout the season.  
  
The team you saw in the first half is what won 31 games. We have to be
consistent in that aspect. But this time of year it's about winning, about
surviving and advancing. All I can say is, go, Vols.  
  
Q. What can you say about overtime and what you guys were able to kind
of reverse the momentum and execute the final five minutes?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We knew we had to make plays. We knew that defensively we had
to step up because we came out halftime and we were trying to slow the pace of
the game down and that's how they like to play. And we should have just kept
going how we were going and kept the pace up, kept trying to being aggressive
and dominant.  
  
That's a learning moment. We got it done. And going into overtime, we just
said, we've done this before a lot. We kind of fought through those games. We
just knew we had to get stops and we knew what plays were we were going to go
and attack and we got it done.  
  
Q. Grant, seemed like you wanted the ball in overtime. Is that true?
What was going through your head as you walked out after the final buzzer of
regulation?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: No doubt. I definitely wanted the gall, definitely. I knew I
had to be aggressive. But I also knew my teammates were going to hit shots. At
the end of the half, I knew Lamonté was feeling it and also he was going to
get us a good shot.  
  
So I knew that putting the ball in his hands we were going to get a great
opportunity. And we did. We had multiple possessions where Monté had big shots
and he also was defending his butt off tonight commend and respect.  
  
Gotta give credit to all the guys. Kyle Alexander was phenomenal tonight, and
if anyone doesn't believe that or anything like that he was incredible. He was
on the glass, he was a presence, he was defensively there. He was doing his
job and it's all love. Hey, Coach, how is your suit? A little wet?  
  
COACH BARNES: My suit got soaked. I got soaked and when my hair gets wet it
don't look that good. (Laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Would you like to make a statement, Coach.  
  
COACH BARNES: You've got to give Iowa and Coach McCaffery and his staff --
they just got back in it. We turned it over -- when you have a lead like that
you can't turn it over the way we did. But they took advantage of it.  
  
Once it got to overtime I thought we really responded the way we needed to.
But it shouldn't have gotten to that point. But I think because it did you've
got to give all the credit to Iowa, and the fact that they took advantage of
some of our silly turnovers.  
  
But Lamonté Turner I thought was key in setting the tone of the game early. I
thought we were aggressive. Came out played the way, the first half, like we
do when we're playing our best basketball. But second half, we talked about
the first four minutes, and we didn't do what we said we wanted to do in terms
of, again, coming out setting the tone.  
  
And Grant continued to pick up some silly fouls, and Admiral and that changed
the flow of the game and his foul in the last minute and a half of the first
half was a dumb foul and that changes the game a little bit. Then he picked up
another one trying to take a charge. We just weren't a real smart team when we
had the lead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Grant or Admiral.  
  
Q. Grant, can you describe the pass that you made at the start of
overtime that might have changed the flow of the extra period?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I just knew they were coming with the double team. I spun
baseline and they came and the dude sunk down on JB, so I knew I had to get
the pass. And Bone was wide open. I don't know how I got it there, I don't
know how I did it. But it got there and I had made the shot.  
  
Q. One year ago, a year and a week ago, you were on the other side of
this emotion, would you describe the difference how you felt now from how you
felt a year and a week ago?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I would say the biggest thing is we're more appreciative
for the fact that we had another opportunity to play in a game like this. And
for it to almost go similar to what it was last year, it's almost nerve-
racking for a lot of guys on our bench because it was a lot of pain for us we
worked very hard last year to get to this point.  
  
And this year we worked even harder and put ourselves in a great position to
be here. We knew we were going to get here. It didn't matter what city. We
knew we were going to be in the tournament. So to be back here and be on the
other side of it, it feels great. And we won't take that for granted but the
biggest thing we learned we can dominate. We can dominate a game and we need
to do that for 40 minutes. We didn't do it tonight and we have to be
consistent.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I feel like a fifth grader who just ate Skittles. Just want to
say that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Can you play better than you did in the first half?  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We definitely can. We had a lot of breakdowns in the first
half. That shouldn't have happened. We had some offensive possessions where we
turned the ball over. Those are possessions we can't have. But we definitely
have the talent to play better in the first half than that first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Go celebrate. Welcome to the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. The final play of regulation, is that what you wanted with Jordan
Bone in the corner for three?  
COACH BARNES: No, we wanted the ball to Lamonté. They jumped into a zone. We
were going to go with a high-ball screen with Grant, and they jumped in a
zone. We, again, we were waiting for it to get down.  
  
But we had success just getting the ball to the middle of the zone. But now,
in that situation, players have to react as quickly as they can. But we were
really putting the ball in Lamonté's hand and see what he could create. But
they went 3-2 zone. And we should have, again, on that roll I still think
Grant was there but it was hard for three guys out there see it.  
  
I thought Kyle was terrific today. It was really interesting throughout the
game and our bench where we were wanting to sub, and at the end of the game
Admiral kept saying, you have to leave Kyle in; don't put me in; leave Kyle in
because they felt like he could do what he needed to do.  
  
And he did some -- he and Lamonté -- Lamonté's defense was huge. He set the
tone for us early. But I tell these guys all the time, you know, your defense
gets you the lead and your offense keeps it. And you can't turn the ball the
way we did to come out in the second half. It's just sloppy.  
  
But you know what? You sit back there longer than you normally do this time of
year, but couple of calls that were tough calls. But Fran did a great job. We
knew that once foul trouble -- they were trying to put fouls on Grant and
Admiral, and we were trying to do the same thing on the other end.  
  
And Lamonté was really dialed in and his conversation throughout the game with
his teammates was fabulous. It really was. And when we came out the start of
the overtime, we just said, hey, we're starting over. We're going to go get
aggressive.  
  
And we got back on our heels where we just -- when you turn it over like that
and you give teams those opportunities, you know, it's going to put you back
on your heels. Some of the ways we turned that ball over, it just baffles you
sometimes.  
  
But, again, you've got to give -- Fran's a terrific coach and his staff. They
do a great job. But I thought the biggest key was what Lamonté did with
Bohannon. I thought that was the biggest key in the game. He was hounding him,
harassing him the whole time.  
  
Q. Schofield took a 3 near the end of regulation that looked like a two
for one tactic?  
COACH BARNES: No, it was supposed to go inside. He was so wide open it was
hard to turn down. We knew they were starting to double Grant Williams and
when we have the small lineup, we run that little set; it's an offset where
they can't double with the post. If it comes into the post that means one of
the wings or guards have to come in and double because they can't get down
there. But he was so wide open.  
  
Q. A lot of us interpreted that as two-for-one like an NBA two-for-one.
Was that true or not?  
COACH BARNES: First half we were trying to do it for certain. But I don't
remember how much time was on the clock.  
  
Q. About 45 seconds.  
COACH BARNES: Again, we ran it right away to score. We weren't coming out to
try to hold it, but again the ball was supposed to go inside.  
  
Q. You took him out right after that and he didn't play in the overtime.
Why?  
COACH BARNES: He didn't want to play. He kept saying leave Kyle in the game.
Kyle is important. With four fouls, he knew they would come right at him. He
said, Coach, I can't guard the way I can guard. I'm going to foul. So you have
to leave Kyle in. That was his decision. He said, leave Kyle in the game.  
  
Q. What went through your head at that point? Did you not question his
own judgment?  
COACH BARNES: No, because again Kyle was effective. Kyle wanted to play. And
Kyle did a lot of great things today. But the other shot was a tough shot, the
one he had on the baseline where I think he shot an air ball, that was a bad
shot. There was no reason to shoot that.  
  
But the fact is, we knew they were going to keep trying to punch it inside.
And they ran a little, what we call lollypop action where they were getting us
deep in there. But after that Kyle tried to do a little bit better job
fronting when he was that deep.  
  
But, again, that's where I thought the guys were really locked in. They've
been together a lot. They were talking during the timeout. And we actually at
one time put Admiral back in the game in regulation. But he said, "Coach,
leave Kyle in the game. We have to have him to rebound the ball for us."  
  
And I think you realize that the players, they have a feel better than
probably anybody in the building. And he felt like that was the best thing.  
  
And Lamonté Turner kept saying the same thing, too, we've got to have Kyle in
the game. Normally in those situations we go with a small lineup because it's
a pretty efficient lineup. But I trust my players. I do. And for the fact that
they felt he needed to be in the game, you know, we went with it.  
  
Q. I saw that Admiral was standing up next to you, looked like he was
almost taking coaching stance, even with being in foul trouble. How does that
affect your team knowing that he's still helping and doing well, doing things
for the team even though he can't be on the floor?  
COACH BARNES: Well, it helps. He's into the game. He's a competitor. He's been
here longer than anyone. He and Kyle. It was great to see it happen today. I
thought it was great no selfishness on his part. He's been with this guy
forever, Kyle Alexander, he's watched him grow up from a little baby giraffe
to where he is today, where he used to wobble down the floor. And it's amazing
when you think how far he's come.  
  
But the fact that he felt -- again, he and Lamonté, those guys were adamant:
Kyle's gotta be in this game; he's got to be in this game.  
  
And so, again, I think it's their team and I know how hard they've worked. And
if they felt that strongly about it, we could go up a possession or two and
see what happens. And at that point in time we had made up our mind we were
going to really play through Lamonté and Grant. We were going to let those
guys, we were going to play through those two guys.  
  
Q. Was anything special said before overtime, any special thing? And
Jordan Bone, who missed the last shot against Loyola last year, missed the
shot at the end of regulation, but he made the one at the start of overtime.
How big a shot was that? And did you want to get him involved in overtime?  
COACH BARNES: He can shoot the ball. There's no doubt about it. And Grant, I
don't know how he got that pass to him, because I saw where he swung baseline.
But those are the kind of 3s we want to take once we go inside/out with it.
The ones I don't like, and we actually did that a couple times in the first
half, where the emotion of the game, the way we were shooting it, but we took
three 3s in the first half we shouldn't have taken where emotion got the best
of us.  
  
But when -- Bone's over there, he and Lamonté and Bowden, we expect them to
shoot -- actually Bowden turned down one in the first half when we came out of
a timeout, said we've got to play inside/out, and Lamonté drove it really well
from the right side and Bowden shot faked and drove it. And I can't remember
what happened. But I know he should have shot that one.  
  
Q. Talk about how far your players have come, how far has this program
come since you've been here?  
COACH BARNES: Well, you think about it, Admiral Schofield, Lamonté Turner --
well Lamonté wasn't on that team; he was redshirting -- but Admiral and Kyle
and our two walk-ons who have been a big part of our team, Lucas Campbell and
Brad Woodson -- and those guys lost 19 games, I think, four years ago -- and I
think the year after that, 15.  
  
And we came back after that, what was Grant's freshman year and their
sophomore year, and had the hardest spring we've ever had in probably my last
20-some years as a coach. We put them on the track, because I told them, you
guys have no idea what it's like to play, because we had not made the NCAA
Tournament -- we didn't make any tournament.  
  
And I said we're going to be a team that plays into March, there's three more
weeks of basketball. So I said for the next three weeks we're going to get on
the track and let you know this is how long the season should be.  
  
And they didn't like it. But they embraced it. And then last year when we got
where we were, they actually said they thought that was the turning point in
our program. So the end of last year, when we lost, a tough loss to Loyola, I
went back and reminded those guys, you guys said that that was the best thing
we did, so do we need to do it again.  
  
They said, let us take care of it. They really did. For the next two weeks,
last year, you would have thought they were still preparing to play three
weeks. They're a close group of guys. And they have worked hard. And I'm happy
for them.  
  
And you could tell the other day against Colgate, the first meeting we had
with them, after last year, we said to them, we don't get to pick up where we
left off a year ago. We're going to have to earn our way back there. But you
ask them to a man, they would tell you that -- and we talked about it after
the game against Colgate -- and that's what they wanted to do was to get back
there see if they could go further.  
  
So that's been on their mind. And they wanted to do that. And I thought that
they carried a little extra stress because of that. And then we came up here
and all I talked to them about was we've got to win a tournament, between us,
Colgate and Purdue and Cincinnati. And I wasn't real happy that Cincinnati
(indiscernible), we'd be playing in their backyard and we're right here in the
middle of Big Ten country.  
  
But we've been a good road team. And these guys found a way to get it done.
And the credit really does go to them. They worked really hard. And it hasn't
been easy because as a program we work but they've embraced that. And I'm
happy for them and mad that they just soaked me when I walked into the locker
room. They got me good. They got me really good. But if it makes them happy, I
can deal with it, you know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Luke Maye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33294)

### [Garrison Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37064)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina student-athletes Luke Maye and
Garrison Brooks as well as head coach Roy Williams. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Luke, just talk about how the game's becoming more inside as you go
further into the tournament. And also, Noah was here earlier and said you guys
have a little bit of history, that maybe you can share a little background
with that as well.  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, we're going to try to play the same way we've played all
year. But it starts inside first. And myself and Garrison need to do our job
on the glass and also making the shots inside that we can make.  
  
And I think the biggest thing for us is to continue to play our game and play
how Coach wants us to play, and that's just doing our jobs and making it
easier on the guards.  
  
And with Noah, we played against each other at a lot of camps and he played on
a similar AAU circuit as I did. So we've played against each other a good
amount. And he's always been a good friend. And I've enjoyed playing against
him and I'm going to enjoy playing against him tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys are a No. 1 seed, considered one of the favorites in the
tournament. But most of the year, nationally, you've been overshadowed by Duke
and Zion and all that stuff. How do you think that's affected you? Has it
bothered you? Has it helped you in a way?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I feel like it's helped us a little bit. Gave us a little bit
of motivation. It's fine that people overlook us and, like, the national
scene, it's fine. But we just continue to work and get better every day.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I'd second that. I think the biggest thing for us is focusing on
ourselves and making sure that we do what we can do on the court to put us in
the right position to where we are now and get a No. 1 seed.  
  
And at the end of the day everybody's going to play and everybody's going to
have their opinions on games and on players. And I think we're just trying to
do our best to get the right image in people's minds.  
  
Q. Luke, that would logically make sense, would it not, that you have to
have a certain pride in the ACC to have the three No. 1 seeds. It's good for
everybody.  
LUKE MAYE: Yes it's the best basketball conference and I would take that up
with anybody.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustment do you see, Garrison, when you do play a team
that obviously you're not familiar with? Is it going to be advantageous that
you've played Syracuse a couple times during the course of the year and know
that Mike Hopkins has taken a lot of those basketball practices out to
Washington?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I think it helps. It benefits us. We've seen it before. I
think we've seen pretty much everything we need to see this season. I think we
just do what we normally do, just play our game.  
  
Q. Is there always the adjustment of seeing a team on tape that you're
not familiar with, thinking you've got it? And then you went through it a
little bit yesterday in the first half, and then you see them in person and
the reality hits?  
GARRISON BROOKS: Yeah, it's different. Film doesn't do some people justice.  
  
Q. Luke, it's been established, you have a history with Noah a little
bit. He was an all-conference player two years ago and didn't make it this
year because I think everyone figured out they have to double him or they're
going to be in trouble. Just as a one-on-one matchup, what's it like dealing
with him in the post?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, he's a great player. He's always been able to use his body
really well, be able to finish over people. And for somebody who plays the 5
spot at right around 6'8", some people list him at 6'9", but I think he's
pretty similar size as me, maybe a little taller.  
  
And I think he does a good job finding his areas and finding his angles, and
he's a great scorer in the post. And we're going to do our best to slow him
down and make sure that we have a body in front of him and the basket every
single play.  
  
But everybody at this stage is going to be really good in respect to their
leagues. Everybody has a lot of accolades, and we're just trying to win a team
game, and that's what we're going to try to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Garrison, is there a comfort level with the officiating during the
regular season because you generally get three guys that you know, and then
you come into the tournament and you're really not sure of these three guys,
maybe one, and how they're going to call a particular game?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I'm pretty sure every referee is different. So you have to
really adjust to the style that they're going to blow the whistle for pretty
much every call.  
  
Q. Do you know five minutes in what it's going to be like or does it
change?  
GARRISON BROOKS: You can pretty much tell from the jump, you can tell by the
first foul, tell basically by the first rebound, basically, that's how I feel.  
  
Q. What is the most annoying aspect of playing against a Syracuse
zone?  
LUKE MAYE: I'll go first. I think the biggest thing is how active the top two
defenders are. I think one of their players is leading the country in steals
and does a great job. I think it's Thybulle does a great job of getting in the
passing lanes. We have to make sure that we make good fakes and get it into
the middle of the zone and try our best to attack.  
  
And I think playing against Syracuse has helped us. And it will help us moving
forward. But then again every team's different. Every team has their strengths
and we've got to find our strengths against a good team like Washington.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: I'll agree with Luke, like the top two guys they're really
active. It makes it tough on, like, the whole team.  
  
Q. Luke, is there additional pressure on you guys as a team because
you've got Carolina on your jersey?  
LUKE MAYE: I think it's definitely -- playing against any team they're going
to bring their best shot, especially in the NCAA Tournament. And I think going
off of what happened last year, I think we're going to come out with a little
bit extra motivation and making sure that we play our best basketball.  
  
And we struggled a little bit the first half yesterday. And we can't have that
let-down tomorrow. And we've just gotta do our best to make sure we come out
the right way and gotta punch them in the mouth early.  
  
Q. Was the adjustment at halftime yesterday more technical or
emotional?  
LUKE MAYE: I think it would be more emotional. Coach got on us about playing a
little bit harder, playing with more passion. He felt like we missed some
shots we usually make. And they made some shots. And I think just playing
harder and playing with more aggression would benefit us the second half. And
we made some more shots. And kind of affected them, which was big for us.  
  
Q. I'm only asking this because the Washington players said their coach
was crazy. Is there any part of Coach Williams that you find to be crazy?  
LUKE MAYE: I think I could probably speak on it a little more than Garrison
just because I've been around four years and I've had a lot of experiences
with different attitude changes, different mood swings. And I think the
biggest thing for us is that Coach gets on us, and Coach really wants to push
us in different ways, whether it be yelling or kind of aggression.  
  
But I think he knows it that -- he knows that we know that he cares about us.
And he wants us to realize how much he wants us to succeed. And that's the
biggest thing that Coach tries to imply every single day. And no matter how
hard he's on you or how mad he gets, you understand that because he shows you
every single day. And that's been big for my growth and development.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach Williams joins us and we're ready for your
questions.  
  
Q. You guys have had some really good success over the years against
Syracuse and that zone, and Mike's going to play pretty much the same kind of
defense. What has made you guys so successful at attacking that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'll give you a better answer after the game if we're
successful against Mike's. It's a little different, but the basis the same.
They're long, athletic, quick to the ball. They're aggressive. They'll
probably double team in the corner maybe more than Jimmy's teams have done in
the last couple of years.  
  
But for us we try to get the shot that we want, not just the shot that they
want us to take. And so for us it's got to be a balance. We want to get the
ball inside and attack the basket area and shoot open 3s, but not just be
content to just pass the ball around the perimeter and do what they want us to
do.  
  
But the good news is that we have played Syracuse, because it would be hard to
get ready for this type of defense with just half a practice, which is what
we're going to have today. But at the same time, some other teams have played
the zone, and guys played some zone against us yesterday and we didn't handle
it very well in the first half, particularly.  
  
But it is, with their length, they take away your open shots, because they can
-- football terminology, they can close on you, like they talk about defensive
backs, you think you're open and they can close. I can go all the way back to
2003, the national championship game, my last game at Kansas. We have what we
think is a wide-open 3 to tie the game, and Hakim Warrick came out of nowhere
and blocked the shot.  
  
You have to understand that, that they have athleticism and can really cover
ground and they want to get there. They want to bother your shot. But we've
got to try to get the shot we want.  
  
Q. I can remember back to your Kansas team in '93 and when you talk
about length, it seems like every team now has seven or eight of those guys
you describe with length. And when you go back to earlier in your head
coaching career, if a team had one, it was a story, wasn't it?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, but these guys, they're 6'7" up to 6'11", and they do
have the length and athleticism to cover to a lot of ground.  
  
Q. You've been asked this many times this year, but you're a No. 1 seed,
no one's overlooking you. But you've been overshadowed to some degree by Duke
and Zion Williamson. How does that affect you negatively or positively this
year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Me, it hasn't affected me at all. I'm serious, not one iota.
This doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't make me happy or
anything. I just don't think about it.  
  
But I think Zion, the attention that he's gotten, he's deserved. He's stood up
to all the accolades that he got before. And we tried to recruit him as hard
as I've ever recruited anybody. I thought he was a unique young man. There
wasn't anybody like him.  
  
I've been married 46 years, my wife's been to a lot of high school games over
the years. I took her to a game when we saw Zion one night. We left, we were
in the car and she didn't say anything, didn't say anything. I said, what do
you think? She said, I don't think I've ever seen anything like that.  
  
That's pretty perceptive. And you watch the games, and that's what you say,
man, I haven't seen anything like that. I think he's that blend of power,
explosiveness, athleticism and competitiveness that I haven't seen maybe ever.
So that part doesn't bother me. He deserves what he gets.  
  
When we win, we get good publicity. If somebody else beats us, we don't. And
gotta get ready for the next game. But I haven't really cared about it.  
  
Q. It's been a while since you encountered Washington in the finals and
lots of things have changed. But I wondered what you remember about that 2011
game in Charlotte, where I guess you woke up sick that morning and got a
little sicker as the game was going on?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I remember they were very, very good. We were lucky to win the
game. We have a 3-point lead and John Henson, standing under the basket jumped
up and sort of caught the ball -- it was definitely going to be short; so it
should not have been called goaltending.  
  
But I about had a heart attack because we had a three-point lead. I said,
John, why would you do that? He said, Coach, he was inside. It was just going
to be two.  
  
I said, how do you know that? That kind of thing. That's what I remember the
most about at the end of the game. We got a great deflection, they had the
ball out of bounds. I think with just for us, a one- or two-point lead, and
John was able to get his hand on the ball in front of the ball and deflect it.
We came up with it and scored again on the other end.  
  
But Lorenzo was coaching, I believe, at that time. Isaiah, I think, was there.
They had some good players. And I remember getting in the locker room thinking
that we just beat a very, very, very good team, and we were lucky to win.  
  
Q. I'm not sure how well you know Mike Hopkins, so there might not be a
lot in there, but I'll give it a shot. He's a different guy. Yesterday he was
trying to decide which candy he wanted on the scorer's table and played "eeny,
meeny, miny, moe." He tackles players in the middle of practice, starts doing
push-ups, all that kind of stuff. I'm just wondering if there's anything that
you've come across where, that's a different guy. He's not like the other
coaches.  
COACH WILLIAMS: What the crap do you think people say about me? I spit in
rivers. Mike and I are twins. That's what the hell it is. (Laughter).  
  
I've never gone "eeny, meeny, miny, moe" with the candy on the side of the
table, but I've got two different kinds in the locker room.  
  
I really think he's a good guy, a really good coach. I'm old enough to
remember when he played. I think he was so loyal to Jimmy and great to Jimmy
Boeheim for a long time and Jimmy was loyal to him. The teams they had at
Syracuse, they beat one of my teams in the 2003 National Championship game.  
  
So I've known Mike for a long time. Two or three years ago, whenever it was,
that Jimmy sat out those nine games and Mike was in charge of the team, and it
didn't go as well. I don't know what it was -- it was 4-5, 5-4, 6-3, whatever
it was, but it wasn't very pleasant.  
  
And the first game that they played when Jimmy came back was against us at
their place. And I remember grabbing Mike before the game and saying, hey, I
know that hadn't been the most pleasant experience but you did a great job.
It's a hard job. It's unusual circumstances. Just put it behind you and one of
these days it will be a very small blip on what you're doing. And I don't know
if he remembers that, but it was very comfortable for me to say that to him.  
  
And I think he's one of the good guys. Now, I've not -- in the old days I
would do crazy stuff but I've stepped down and done pushups on the floor. So
what you're describing isn't unique, that sounds normal to me. That's all I've
got. (Laughter).  
  
Q. We've got to find some storylines here, so we've got to nitpick a
little bit. 3-3 in the second round last six years. Anything to that? Has it
just been matchups that have been stumbling blocks, or what do you read into
it?  
COACH WILLIAMS: 99 percent of the coaches in the world would take that.
Seriously. 3-3 in the second round. Hell, a lot of guys are sitting at home
getting ready for their golf game.  
  
But probably -- let's see, Texas A&M last year was really a bad matchup for
us. Year before that we were okay. We were 6-0. There wasn't nobody else 6-0.
And so I'll take 3-3 all the time if you'll make two of those three years go
to play for the national championship game. So that would be the one I'd have
the best answer for you.  
  
Frankly, my dear... (laughter).  
  
I didn't mean to shut the crowd up. I was being nice. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Sterling Manley, talked to him yesterday. And have you had it in your
career where, a situation like that where a player has been playing enough and
then gets hurt and you have to sit him down because the rotation that you have
has been so good? How has he kind of been receptive to that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. But I've been a head coach for 31 years. So I'm
sure I've had some things like it. But it depends. Before he got hurt, he was
playing 11 or 12 minutes. But Garrison was in front of him. And Sterling was
doing some things that were good for us or he wouldn't have been playing 11,
12 minutes a game. But he got hurt for a long time.  
  
And now coming back, my job -- to be honest, if we don't win, I get fired. So
my job is to win. And the group that we have, got a pretty good rotation set.
We won 15 out of 16 or 16 out of 18, something like that.  
  
So if it ain't broke, don't fix it kind of thing. But I'm sure that I've had
some guys that I was able to get back into the rotation. But it's where they
started. If a guy starts and beat everybody else out, then you've got to try
to give him a chance to do that, too. But I'm trying to think Jacque Vaughn,
at Kansas, he broke his wrist, missed the first nine games.  
  
When he started playing, you know what he did, he started because that's what
he deserved over time. So I don't think there's been an exact situation like
that.  
  
But Leaky was playing a certain number of minutes, too, and not playing as
many now as he was at that time. But none of those kids want to get hurt. And
I understand that. And they want to play more. But every kid wants to play 60
minutes in a 40-minute game and take 60 shots. And I understand that. But
Sterling's handled it well, and he's practiced better now than he was before
he got hurt. And so I like that. But his life in basketball is not going to be
over tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa student-athletes Joe Wieskamp, Jordan
Bohannon and Luka Garza as well as head coach Fran McCaffery. Questions for
the student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Jordan, just in the second half there, we talked yesterday about the
shooting. To have that out of the gate, how important is that against a team
like Tennessee?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: It's going to be really important, especially how they play.
They're a team, unique style that they play, really run the court. So we're
going to be ready for that.  
  
But for us to get going, we're going to need to make our shots and start the
game. I think that was big for Cincinnati to start their game last night
against us. We weren't hitting shots. They got up on a big run, and it really
took everything within us to get back into that game.  
  
So it will make the game a lot easier if we're able to get out there right
from the start and hit some shots, for sure.  
  
Q. Jordan, you said Tennessee plays a unique style. What about it is
unique? What makes them different?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: They definitely have a lot of NBA players potentially on
their team. That's definitely unique within its own right. And playing an SEC
team, I don't think we've played an SEC team yet since we've been here. So
we've just got to -- they know it's a tough conference to play in just as well
as the Big Ten.  
  
They've been battling all year around as well as we have. We know it's going
to be a physical game. They play a physical kind of basketball like we do. So
it's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow. We're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Joe, is it harder or easier in your mind to prepare for a team when
you don't have as much time to prepare as you did for Game 1?  
JOE WIESKAMP: I think it's a little bit harder, obviously, but I think our
coaching staff has done a great job getting us prepared for this. In the Big
Ten season, towards the end of the year, each team has each other figured out.
They have each other locked in, the personnel. So it's a little harder at the
end of the Big Ten season. It will be nice to play another team from a
different conference.  
  
Q. Luka, that kind of struck me what Jordan said about not playing an
SEC team. Does it make a difference for something you're familiar with, or do
you like the challenge of seeing totally new systems?  
LUKA GARZA: I don't know. I think both teams in both leagues have very hard
schedules. And each game in the SEC is a battle as well as the Big Ten. So I
think both teams are really well prepared for this in terms of all the battles
we've been through throughout the course of the season.  
  
And like Joe says, it's nice to play teams from other conferences because at
this point the Big Ten knows each other so well; they know what your
tendencies are even more so than a new team could pick up so quickly.  
  
Q. Joe, you just talked about the battles. You've had some -- a couple
weekends now in tournament play. They have as well. What do you expect the
battle to be like tomorrow with the Sweet 16 on the line?  
JOE WIESKAMP: They're obviously a very strong team, were ranked No. 1 in the
country at one point. This is what you sign up for when you sign up to play
Division I basketball. This is the type of team you want to play. We're
excited for the test.  
  
Q. Luka, you're going against another physical opponent, the inside-out
game. How in the past, when you go against physical teams, how does that open
up things for you guys?  
LUKA GARZA: I think I'm a player who just kind of sees what the defense is
giving me. When they're really aggressive on my post-ups, I tend to go a
little bit more outside, try to open it up.  
  
I'm going to do my best to try to create some space on the floor for other
guys to drive and different stuff like that. So I'm just going to take what
the defense gives me, and I think that's what our whole offense does,
everybody, they just take what the defense gives us.  
  
Q. Luka, your impressions of Kyle Alexander, from what you've been able
to see. And I guess how important it would be, he's a guy who has had foul
trouble at times, to try to get him some early fouls?  
LUKA GARZA: Yeah, they're a different team when he's not on the court. You can
see that when you watch some of their games. He's really athletic, long, can
really affect shots around the rim.  
  
And when we go into games, we have a goal to get their bigs in foul trouble. I
think that remains the same with him and Williams this game.  
  
Q. Jordan, have you been taken by the Big Ten's success, or is that
something you expect as you headed into the tournament?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I think we all expected it, every single player in the Big
Ten. We went through the battle on a night-to-night basis these past few
months. For us to go a 20-game schedule, it made it even more difficult.  
  
So we're not surprised at all that Big Ten started 7-1. I thought we've had
really good matchups with teams, and quite honestly I wasn't surprised that
any team won, obviously. But, I think, looking forward, I see more teams
advancing in this tournament. I wouldn't be surprised if we get the same
amount into the Sweet 16 as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned matchups I always think that's interesting as you
approach a game. Are there teams that you think specifically you match up
better because of what they do or don't do?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I mean, obviously it's difficult in the NCAA Tournament
because you only have a couple days to prepare. But you look at it, it all
comes down to matchups in most games. And that's the beauty of the NCAA
Tournament; you don't have time to prepare for it, but you've got to take
what's there during the game, and you've got to realize what matchups happen.
And that's something you have to definitely take advantage of.  
  
Q. Jordan, Tennessee has given up 15 3s to each of their last two
opponents. As a guy that can kind of get it going, does that excite you? And
how do you avoid falling into the trap of getting trigger happy against
them?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: Yeah, obviously I love shooting 3s. Every time I step on the
floor, I'm trying to shoot as much as I can. So, I'm looking forward to
tomorrow. Hopefully I can get a lot of 3s off. And Joe is looking forward to
it as well, and Luka is, too. That's the beauty of our team.  
  
We have a lot of shooters on this team. A lot of times we have five shooters
out there. So it's really difficult for teams to play us. Luka can go
inside/out. And Tyler is one of the most dominant inside players in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
We have a really tough team to guard. But we also know what we're capable of
on defense as well. So it's going to come down to getting stops in important
times tomorrow.  
  
Q. Joe, is there something you've seen from Tennessee as to why they've
given up so many seemingly good looks from the perimeter lately?  
JOE WIESKAMP: Not necessarily. Obviously we haven't had a whole lot of time to
prepare for them. We'll probably be watching a lot of film of them today and
kind of figure those things out, see where we can attack them offensively. And
our coaches will give us a game plan of how to attack that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach McCaffery is joining us.  
  
Q. Coach, how difficult is it to get enough sleep during a time like
this with a short turnaround?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You're not going to get a lot of sleep, but you've got to get
some because you've got to be fresh. You just jump from one game to the next.
Obviously the assistant coach responsible for that team has been studying them
for quite some time.  
  
So we just, we were up late last night, but got a little bit of sleep, back up
this morning, had a meeting, breakfast. And then came over here and had a live
practice which is good, get up and down, get a little sweat going. Have a few
more meetings and then get ready to play.  
  
Q. As you look at Tennessee, how much of a difference do you think Kyle
Alexander makes for them when he's able to be on the floor and able to stay
out of foul trouble?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: They have great versatility. And obviously he provides
something different with his length and his size. But they can also downshift
and go small, and put some big-time weapons out there offensively.  
  
We look at matchups, in particular. I think that's maybe what you're also
thinking about when you look at our big guys versus their big guys. Here's a
6'11" guy with length and the ability to defend our scoring post players.  
  
But, you know, it will be a constant situation where we're both pushing
different buttons with different lineups and looking for different things.  
  
Q. When you come off a half shooting 65 percent like you did in the
second, having another game two days later on that short rest, does it make it
easier to kind of ride the confidence for your shooters?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I hope so. We've had an interesting season in that respect.
There's times when our offense has really been clicking. And there's times
when we've been off. Last game we played before yesterday, we shot 1-for-16
from 3. And then yesterday we make 11.  
  
I look at our team and say, we've got good 3-point shooters. But I think you
have to be able to establish that you can throw it inside and score; drive and
kick; drive and finish; drive, get to the free throw line; throw it inside,
get to the free throw line. Over the course of your entire body of work, you
have to do all those things.  
  
To beat a team that's won 30 games, you better be able to do all those things
or attempt to do all those things to beat them.  
  
Q. Tennessee has allowed 15 3s each of the last two games. As a coach
how do you balance taking advantage of that while also trying to avoid guys
settling for too many shots?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think that's something you probably deal with every game.
Especially when you have multiple 3-point shooters like we do. At what point
do you settle? At what point do you work the ball?  
  
And you're hoping every game that your guys truly understand the difference as
it relates to time and score. What defense are they?  
  
I think Colgate's a team that probably shoots a lot of 3s anyway. So are we.
But we also have won a number of games where we just hammer that thing inside.
So we just hope that our guys make the proper decisions, and you want them to
be confident.  
  
Q. Jordan said that he feels like Tennessee is different stylistically
than any team you've faced this year. Do you agree with that? And how have all
the teams you've faced this year prepared you to face them?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, I think in the Big Ten every team has a great coach.
Every team has really talented players, three or four of whom expect to play
in the NBA. I would say the same for the SEC.  
  
So the difference, I think, when you look at Tennessee, they've got tremendous
team speed. They're quick. But they also can throw the ball inside. They also
have 3-point shooting. That's why they have the record that they have.  
  
But we feel like, when you look at Michigan State versus Maryland, versus Penn
State, versus Nebraska, when you go right on through our league, what it does
is prepare you for different styles. Some teams play man. Some teams mix it a
little bit more. Some teams are a little more deliberate. Some teams play
faster.  
  
The one thing about Tennessee is they can go either way. They can go fast --
you look at the Auburn game and, the championship game. And that was as up and
down and athletic a game as I've seen in a long time. But they can also play
half court. They've got a great coach. And they've got intelligent players
that share the ball.  
  
I think it's one of the things that's impressed me the most about them, they
have really good players with big reputations, but everybody seems to put
winning above everything else and move the ball. And that's why they're still
playing.  
  
Q. I know this is an old story for people that follow you every day but
for those of us who are new to Iowa, how do you deal with a player who is
playing another varsity sport at the same time?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It's a little bit different because it's my son. And
obviously you're hoping that he can maximize his opportunity. You would want
the same for anybody else. Coach Heller and I have an agreement that we're
going to work together and do what makes sense.  
  
So we had a window of time after the Big Ten Tournament ended where he could
play in some games, which he did and did really well. And then we had it set
up -- had we lost yesterday he'd be playing today in a doubleheader at
Indiana.  
  
Is it too much? I don't think so. It's what he's always done. He's always gone
from one sport to the other. He's thrilled to have the opportunity to play for
our baseball team. Has tremendous respect for Coach Heller and his teammates.
He grew up playing baseball with a good number of those guys; either played
with them or against them.  
  
And I think as long as we can manage it, while at the same time managing the
academic side of it, he's Academic All-Big Ten, so he's tailing that part of
it, we'll keep doing it that way.  
  
Q. Brings up one of the quandaries that parents have as their kids grow
up. And so many times you'll have even high school coaches that want them to
specialize. I think I know what your belief is on this after that answer. But
what do you think non-son would do as he grows up and whether he can play two,
three, four sports?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It's interesting, because you're so right. When you look at a
lot -- a lot of high school coaches just won't allow it anymore. And when we
came to Iowa we met with the folks at Iowa City West High School to make sure
the coaches were willing to work together because we felt that this was
something that he would want to do. And it's a place where they welcome that.
And we appreciated that.  
  
And I honestly think it helps you tremendously to continuously be competing
from one sport to the other. There's nothing like having to get in that
batter's box and have to hit something coming 95 miles an hour. And I think by
the same token, Connor's got to hit a big 3 yesterday and make an inbounds
play to Luka Garza at the exact time for him to hit a 3; you're competing
under pressure. I think it develops you in so many different ways.  
  
So I encourage it. I like two-sport athletes because you know what you're
getting is a competitor.  
  
Q. Big stage is a big stage.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Exactly right.  
  
Q. You've kind of mentioned it a little bit, but between Tennessee and
yourself, two of the best teams in terms of offensive efficiency in the
nation, how comfortable are you getting into a shootout, so to speak, with the
Vols tomorrow?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We're typically very comfortable getting into a shootout.
Obviously, as any game goes on, adjustments are required. If you feel like
you're losing a shootout at some point, I think you might have to slow it
down. I think you have to be smart enough to recognize, all right, let's work
the ball a little bit more. Let's maybe try to shoot a few less 3s and go
inside a little bit more. Let's put it on the deck and see if we can get to
the free-throw line a little bit more.  
  
Because we want to press. If you can get to the free-throw line, you can get
into your press a little bit easier.  
  
So normally I would say if the game can be in the 90s we'd be happy about
that. But sometimes you gotta be careful, especially when you're playing a
team of this caliber.  
  
Q. It's been 20 years since Iowa got to the Sweet 16. What would it mean
for the program to get past this hurdle tomorrow?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It would be tremendous. We've come close. We all know how
hard it is. I don't care where you are. It's very difficult to put it all
together and get into the tournament, and then advance once you get here. So I
think our players all recognize the situation we're in. And we would really
love to have this experience for each other, but also for our fan base.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington student-athletes David Crisp and
Noah Dickerson as well as head coach Mike Hopkins. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. As the tournament goes on, post play is often overlooked but becomes
more and more important. Can you talk about that, both as a guy in the post
and as a point guard looking for baskets, easy baskets -- although they're
actually tough -- but tough baskets, something that you can really kind of
goes at attacking the opposition?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Well, as a post player, we do get overlooked a little bit,
especially in a long tournament. But the longer the tournament goes on, the
more guys get tired. Some -- maybe jump shots are a little bit short and
things like that.  
  
But when you're a post player, being around the basket it's hard to be short.
You're right there at the basket. And so just going and attacking the basket,
shooting great field percentages. And then, look, I get double-teamed a lot,
so it's a lot easier to make open jump shots when they're out there playing
H-O-R-S-E, when they're stepping into jump shots rather than shooting
contesting ones.  
  
DAVID CRISP: For sure, to back up what he was saying, when you've got a great
post player like Noah, teams like to double-team them a lot. And he's a great
passer out of the post. Whenever teams set a double-team, he's great at
finding the open man and finding cutters.  
  
When they don't double, he puts guys in a tough position because he can score.
He's got a lot of moves down there, can finish with either hand. He's
definitely -- works to our advantage.  
  
Q. Is it really playing H-O-R-S-E, like you said?  
NOAH DICKERSON: You saw us shoot yesterday.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Definitely.  
  
Q. Noah, staying with that theme, I'm not sure how much you know about
North Carolina yet, but they are a team that leads the country in rebounding.
They get a lot of points in the paint. How do you go about trying to slow them
down and kind of stuff it in there to prevent some of those close baskets?  
NOAH DICKERSON: We play zone. And so we just play with our strength, do what
we do. Our zone is meant to stop that. We don't give up layups. We don't give
up 3s. So basically our game plan is the same thing we did every year, or I
mean all year.  
  
Q. David, this is obviously a unique time of the season. And you're
seeing teams that you haven't necessarily prepared for and you don't
necessarily know their style because you're not that familiar with them.
Familiarity with the officiating is also something that changes very much. And
obviously yesterday you had to make a big adjustment to that.  
DAVID CRISP: Yes, for sure. They called a lot of fouls that could have been
just overlooked in the season. That's just something you've got to adjust to
and just be smarter, make better decisions and just adjust to the game, but
still be aggressive, not play timid.  
  
Q. Do you try as a team to make that adjustment early to find out how
the game is going to be called and then go from there?  
DAVID CRISP: We just come out and try to play as hard as we can, stick to our
game plan, leave it all out there, give it extreme effort. And we feel -- get
a feel for how the refs are calling it. And we adjust to that.  
  
But we always go in with the same approach -- play aggressive and give a lot
of effort.  
  
Q. David and then Noah, I'm sure you guys have seen Carolina a lot on
TV. But being on the opposite side of the country, what do you know about them
outside of what may have already been done with the scouting report here in
the last couple of hours?  
DAVID CRISP: Obviously everybody knows a historically great program. Very
well-coached, they've got a great coach over there. And they've got some guys
over there with some experience, and guys who have been in this position
before and got a lot of experience.  
  
So we knew that coming in. And we know that for us to come out and have a
great shot tomorrow, we're going to have to play really together, play really
hard. A lot of effort, trust the game plan that our Coach has given us, and
just go out there and leave everything out on the line.  
  
Q. David or Noah, Noah talked about the zone defense which we've seen.
We know where Coach Hop got that from. UNC sees Syracuse's zone twice a year.
What makes your defense stand out a little bit more and makes it a little more
dangerous?  
NOAH DICKERSON: We tend to try to take away the 3 completely. We extend our
zone out so we don't give up 3s and no layups. So the way basketball's going
nowadays, people can shoot the ball from all over the place, all over the
court, very deep. And so our zone really takes into account how people are
shooting and try to take them out of the game.  
  
DAVID CRISP: I completely agree with Noah. Try to take that 3 ball away for
sure and try to limit the high post touches as best we can.  
  
Q. We've seen North Carolina in this situation year after year. What
does it mean to your program to get to this point and be in this spotlight?
David?  
DAVID CRISP: It means a lot to our program, especially how everything has been
going down over the course of our four years here. Two years ago we were 9-22,
won two games in conference, didn't make any postseason tournaments, anything.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: Terrible.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Two years ago nobody would have expected us to be where we are
now. Just making it as far as we have has been -- it's been great.  
  
But we're still working. We still have more that we want to achieve. So we're
still hungry.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: For sure.  
  
Q. Noah, a little bit along those lines, you've been clearly the best
team in your conference, but your conference has taken a decent amount of
criticism this year. North Carolina is North Carolina from the ACC. Is there
any element that you're playing more than just for your team but for your
conference as well?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Yeah, you know, Oregon beat us at the Pac-12 Tournament. We
were shaking hands and all (indiscernible), now we've got to go win some
games. It's for the conference.  
  
Our conference got a hit this year. People are talking bad about us. It is
what it is. And so I do think we are playing for our conference, just to show
some more respect for us. You know what I mean? I understand it's an East
Coast by as. I'm from the East Coast. It's understandable, but we do have some
hoopers over here.  
  
Q. How does a kid from the East Coast end up in the Pacific Northwest?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Man, I came out and visited during the summer. So it was
really nice out. It was really nice out. I thought it was like that year-
round. I didn't think the rain was how like they said it was. For sure. For
sure.  
  
Q. Noah, I was going to ask you about being from back East, being from
the Atlanta area. Have you had any run-ins with any of the current Carolina
players, maybe Brandon Robinson?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Yeah, Brandon Robinson played for the Georgia Stars. He wasn't
on my team. He was on one a couple years younger than me. Luke Maye, when I
was a junior, when we were in our last year of AAU, I played his team, like,
seven, eight times that whole summer, about seven or eight times.  
  
Our parents talked a lot, got pretty close. Throughout the years, I've always
been glad he's been doing his thing at North Carolina. It's been fun to watch.  
  
Q. How did you do against Luke?  
NOAH DICKERSON: I guess we'll have to see tomorrow. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What's it like when you have, again, post players that are allowed to
play in the post as hopefully you two guys are? You're not a lot of bunch of
3-point shooters, I think Luke may take a couple more than you. But basically
you guys are 10 feet and in. What is it like to have 30, 40 minutes of that
kind of basketball?  
NOAH DICKERSON: It's always fun, especially another guy who plays kind of just
like me. We've had these battles for three years now. It's tough; it's hard on
your body. But it's how I love to play the game of basketball. It's how I grew
up playing it. And that's how I'll always play it. It's fun to me. And I like
to do the dirty work.  
  
Q. What was it about Coach that made you believe that he was going to be
the right guy for the job?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Oh, he's crazy. (Laughter). He's crazy. And I've had success
at the high school level. I won two national championships. And my coach in
high school was crazy. So I realized -- (indiscernible) and he just -- he's
just a man with a plan. And he was able to show that plan and this is where we
sit now, two years later.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Same thing Noah's saying, he's crazy. And the same with Noah. My
coaches in the past, they've been crazy. First phone call I had with him, he
just told me pretty much his life story, how he grew up. Told me when he was a
kid always overlooked, always had a chip on his shoulder.  
  
And that clicked with me because that was the same way I felt growing up. Once
he told me that, we connected off of that. And he just told me his vision. And
he wasn't just telling me anything I wanted to hear; he was telling me the
truth, telling me everything he thought we could accomplish as long as the
guys bought in.  
  
So right from day one, I told him you've got me, and I believed in his plan.
Like Noah said, we're sitting here today.  
  
Q. How is he crazy? Can you explain and why he's crazy and why that is a
good thing and not a bad thing?  
NOAH DICKERSON: You all haven't seen my man drop down and give you 10 push-ups
in a press conference? Who does that? I'm not. But his energy is contagious.
He's contagious. And we feed off of it on the court.  
  
And one second he could be going crazy and next second he's the calmest person
in the room. With him you never know. You've got to be ready for anything. And
that's one of our mottos for the team.  
  
Q. Does he ever run the old game film of himself at Syracuse?  
NOAH DICKERSON: No, I saw it on Twitter one time. He looked a lot different
with hair, though. He looked a lot different with hair.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Lot different.  
  
I will give you two stories from the first-time experience with him. First
time I seen him in person, I was just -- it was springtime -- I came in, he
just got in town, about to do his press conference. They're going to
introducing him as the head coach.  
  
He sees me from the top of arena, he's in full suit. He said, is that DC? He
sprints down the stairs, runs across the court and picks me up, gives me a big
hug.  
  
And then the second one, our first workouts we have, he breaks his nose
because he's in there battling with us, like, body, trying to be scrappy with
us. He breaks his nose. But he took it like a champ.  
  
He got up, I think I broke my nose. And the next day you see him, he has
purple all over his eyes. He's crazy, but definitely contagious, though.  
  
Q. And it's a good crazy?  
DAVID CRISP: Good crazy.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: Good crazy.  
  
Q. I guess after hearing this, what do you guys, when you see around the
country, like, all the brouhaha or whatever, outside looking in, with Coach
Izzo and what you just said with Coach Hopkins, do you get the sense that
people don't understand coach/player relationships?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Oh, yeah. Are you talking about that tweet that came out on
Twitter about Tom Izzo yelling at his player? Yeah, for a fact, because I've
seen it -- you've seen it?  
  
It's crazy to me because coaches yell at you, you know what I mean? Like he
said in his press conference, if you weren't doing your job you would be
criticized about it, too. It is what it is. And people get yelled at. You're
men. You're 18, 19, 20. Like, get over it. It is what it is.  
  
DAVID CRISP: And on top of that, a lot of people, you don't see a lot of
things that goes on behind closed doors. You don't see the team meetings at
Coach's house. You don't see the long conversations you have in the coach's
offices. You don't see how much Coach is there for you. They don't see that
love that's always there.  
  
And when somebody loves you, you're willing to let them push you to your
limits. And that's what brings the greatness out of people.  
  
So people don't understand that a lot of times with these coaches, it's more
than just, oh, that's my coach; it's real love -- it's family.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: Yeah, families fight. I fight with my twin brother all the
time, to this day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We're joined by coach Mike Hopkins. Coach,
we have to start out by saying we had two particular witnesses previously who
referred to you as crazy.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: That's not true, (laughter) not true, not true at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We did surmise it was a good crazy. Any questions?  
  
Q. Along those lines, it's not often players call their coach crazy --
affectionately. (Laughter) is it true that you did hug David Crisp the first
time at your introductory press conference and you broke your nose in the
first practice?  
COACH HOPKINS: That is true. I'm just pretty passionate. And I just love life
and love being around my kids. And when David Crisp told me he was going to
stay I probably could have suffocated him I squeezed him so hard.  
  
I like to interact. I like to be involved. I don't like to be the guy sitting
on the ceiling saying, run faster. I like to be involved. It's my assistant
coach in me that I love. That's why I love it. I love the interaction with the
kids and being out there sweating with them.  
  
Q. Is that something that's easily overlooked, is when you come into a
new situation as you did at Washington, and you have to say, I've got to get
this guy, this guy and this guy to stay? Is it more than we in the public
realize?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, it is. Because you're going to have one hour to meet
with these kids, for them to make a decision for the rest of their life. And I
said it was a form of speed dating. You had to be on. You had to be sitting
there, and you're going from table -- guys were coming in, you're meeting with
the families and sharing your vision.  
  
And it was an incredible time, and a lot of those guys stayed with us, which
was really, really special. And here we are. And we've grinded together. We've
worked hard together. We've sweated together -- staff, players, administrative
staff. It's been a heck of a run.  
  
Q. I asked the players, so I'll ask you regarding the game, the
importance of post players. This tournament continues to go on and on and on.
It seems like that becomes imperative. And come to find out, Noah said he and
Luke have a history together. Can you, one, as far as post play going forward;
and, two, that matchup in particular?  
COACH HOPKINS: We have a program, we go inside/out. We play inside/out. And
believe in offensive balance, having a great post player is like having a
great penetrator. And then you have a guy who can score in a man-to-man
situation but he can pass out of double teams. And he can make foul shots.
It's a heck of a weapon.  
  
And this year, Noah sacrificed a lot. Last year he was All-Pac-12. And this
year they double-teamed him and triple-teamed him and game planned around him.
And it's opened up opportunities for guys to step up and make plays. That's
where we've become better. We've become better with our balance.  
  
I know this is kind of the corny coaching cliché, but we honestly have nine
guys that could start for us. Naz Carter came up big, Dom Green's been like
that the whole year. Jamal Bey is coming on, came in and in gave us a great
eight minutes. Sam Timmins has had great minutes. And they've stayed together,
positive. And it can be a different guy any night. And it's a luxury for a
coach to have that.  
  
Q. And Luke (indiscernible)?  
COACH HOPKINS: I don't know what their past is or what their history is. But
you're talking about two incredible post players. Luke is a guy I saw when I
was at Syracuse, and he just kept getting better and better, and he's turned
into one of the best big guys in the country.  
  
He shoots it. He's great in the mid post. He can pass. He's an aggressive
rebounder. I mean, you talk about Carolina, you talk about their big guys.
They've had great guards, but their big guys -- they're inside/out. They try
to crush you on the glass. That's what they do. And he's been a great player
for them.  
  
Q. It wasn't that long ago that this Washington program was well below
.500, but the past two years, back-to-back tournaments. You get a win
yesterday. How have you gotten these guys to kind of buy in? And has this all
kind of come together quicker than you might have thought?  
COACH HOPKINS: That's a great question. All we were trying to do was put in
our offensive system, put in our defensive system, put in our culture system
and work hard every day. People say you never know. Some people, the
learnability, I've worked with kids. You show them a move, move, move, and it
takes them a year to even get it.  
  
Some guys just get it faster. And our guys kept believing. They've worked hard
every day and we have a saying, DMGB -- doesn't matter, get better. So you
lose by 30? Doesn't matter, get better. Win by one? Doesn't matter, get
better.  
  
That's what these guys have done. They've believed in what we're selling with
our defense and they've gotten better at it. It's been fun to watch them grow.
And if I told you I knew the timeline or when we would get it, I would be
lying to you. You just never know.  
  
All you can do is work hard every day. That's kind of the culture that we have
at University of Washington, and we just try to get better every day.  
  
Q. Is the zone that you run pretty much the same thing you and Jimmy did
in Syracuse, or are there a few wrinkles you've thrown in now that it's your
system? And then as familiar as Roy is with what you do, you're pretty much as
familiar with what he does. How much does that kind of play into the
preparations for this?  
COACH HOPKINS: Like anything, when you're playing against the zone, you can't
really mimic it in practice. When you're playing against Carolina, you can't
mimic how fast they push the ball up because that's what they do better than
anybody in the country.  
  
And we run a very similar zone. We have different types of personnel, so we
have to utilize it a little bit differently based on our personnel. But it's
all -- the foundation is definitely what we did at Syracuse.  
  
And very familiar with North Carolina. I was very familiar with Coach Williams
at Kansas. We had played them multiple times. One of the great coaches to ever
do it and one of the great program, college basketball programs of all times.  
  
It's an honor to even have the opportunity to play them. For a coach and for a
program that's trying to build it's like a dream come true. You get a chance
to play against the best of the best. What's better than that in March Madness
time?  
  
Q. The guys talked about relishing that look on an opponent's face when
you guys have frustrated them defensively and said they saw it last night. How
do you build that and instill that in guys, maybe even more so than getting
excited by offense?  
COACH HOPKINS: It goes back to what your culture is and our culture is defense
travels. You can bring it anywhere. It's what you can control. You can't
control make them miss shots, but you can control how hard you play and how
smart you play and how together you play.  
  
And for us on the defensive end, it's something that we hang our hat on. And
it is like a Rubik's Cube. We can make adjustments and it can frustrate teams.
But that goes back to when we are locked in and focused on our game plan and
moving around and flying around. We've also proven in certain times when we
haven't been locked in and haven't been focused where teams can hurt it. So
hopefully we'll be that locked in and focused for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Some people in the Northwest are starting to compare you to Pete
Carroll because of your high energy, your positive approach on the floor. Is
this something you've always had as a coach or was there another coach that
passed that philosophy to you?  
COACH HOPKINS: The one lesson that I learned is be who you are. And I'm 49
going on 14 sometimes. I like to have fun. I like to interact. I've been
fortunate in my career to learn from some of the greatest coaches and be
around some of the greatest coaches in the game.  
  
And my high school coach, Gary McKnight -- Bob Johnson was my sixth-grade
Little League baseball coach, the super quarterback coach, high school coach
at Michigan High School, played for Jim Boeheim. I was with the Olympic team
with Coach K.  
  
I've been really lucky. And whenever you're around great coaches that have
changed your life, you learn a little bit from everybody. So the one thing
that they all have in common is they're all real simple, they're all great
people, they all care about kids and developing kids. And most importantly
they are who they are.  
  
And if I have to roll up my sleeves and take off your coat and people are, why
are you taking off your coat? I don't know, that's just what I do. I'm
nervous. I don't know what happens. I feel like I'm on a sand trap on the golf
course. I've just got to roll it up -- it's going to be difficult -- and I
start rolling it up and that's what it is. Just been very fortunate and
learned from a lot of people.  
  
Q. Noah mentioned that his visit to the campus happened in the summer
and he recommended for your recruiting going forward that that was probably a
good idea. Is that a plan?  
COACH HOPKINS: That's the plan. That's the plan.  
  
Q. History and tradition don't mean anything once the ball goes up and
the game goes on. But you've come from a program that's had a lot of history
and tradition itself. Where does that pay off in terms of prestige and that
sort of thing?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think we're trying to -- like the Carolinas and the Dukes and
the Syracuses and the great programs, that's what you strive to be. That's
what your goal is. You want to play against the best. Gonzaga. That's what you
strive to be. And you try to do it your way. And standard of excellence. What
they represent, playing for something bigger than yourself. The Carolina way.
The Husky way. That's what you're trying to be.  
  
And so to be able to have the opportunity to play against the best of the best
is -- you see what it's like. You see what it feels like. You see what it
smells like. You see what it looks like. That's how you learn, through
experience, and it would be an unbelievable opportunity for us to learn, to
play. Hopefully we can play well. And it's going to be a great, like I said, a
great opportunity.  
  
Q. Is there a point where you know you need to shut it off personally
before a game? You could prepare and not sleep for 24 hours if you -- someone
with your energy, I know.  
COACH HOPKINS: This is the best -- the best fatigue is after winning. I don't
care, we'll be up all night. The staff was up all night. They look like they
haven't slept in five days and all excited in practice. So, listen, we're in
March Madness playing against North Carolina. I mean, is there anything
better? And I told these guys, like, March Madness is an opportunity for
Cinderella and have a chance to play for a national championship. We didn't
come here just to get here. That's not our standard. That's not what we're
trying to do. We have got to have a game plan, go out play against the best
and see where we stand and hopefully we can execute a game plan and come out
with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee student-athletes Jordan Bone, Admiral
Schofield, Lamonté Turner, Grant Williams and Kyle Alexander as well as head
coach Rick Barnes. Questions for the student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Lamonté, I know you guys have said -- you guys have allowed 15 3s in
the last two games, and you guys have said guys are just hitting tough shots.
But do you think part of that is you guys allowing teams to get in a rhythm
early and kind of getting things going?  
LAMONTÉ TURNER: I think in those games our offense has taken tough shots, not
getting the shot we want and not making them work, kind of leading out to them
opening the floor and kind of driving a kicking, and them getting the
momentum. So I think it's our offense that kind of leads to stuff like that.  
  
Q. Grant, what are your thoughts on Tyler Cook, Iowa's power forward?
And what have you seen from him if you've watched him this year?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Very talented. I've known him for a couple of years. Tyler is
very athletic. He's dominant in the post. He's developed his game a lot.
Tremendous respect for him. He's done a lot through EYBL and everything. He's
always been a talented player. It's exciting to play him.  
  
Q. Jordan, that was a good question about knowing other guys. Generally
with teams you match up against, how much do you know them because of AAU days
or playing with them somewhere, maybe in the same area as you did in high
school? Any team in particular that you play, how many times do you run into
guys that you know other than matching up with them during the course of the
year?  
JORDAN BONE: I ran into a couple of guys. I have a lot of guys that played on
the circuit with me in AAU days. I've seen a lot of familiar faces. I'm not
really sure how to put names with them. But I've definitely seen a lot of
familiar faces.  
  
So I just think it's really exciting to show how important AAU is and just
playing the circuit, getting that exposure. Now, just seeing everybody all
together on this large playing field of NCAA basketball, it just means a lot.  
  
Q. Jordan, now that you're back at this stage, have you at all thought
about or maybe it's distant memory, that last shot last year against Loyola?  
JORDAN BONE: I've gotten a lot of questions about that Loyola game. I mean, I
feel like moving forward from that. You know, it's definitely something that
you remember. I kind of use it as motivation during my offseason.  
  
And I feel like this team kind of uses moments like that, not just Loyola
specifically, but just tough losses and just kind of being in the trenches, we
kind of use that as motivation in order for us to be the team that we are
today. And I feel like it's very important to use moments like that as
motivation to make it better.  
  
Q. Grant, along those lines, unfinished business, I think, is a key
motivator for a lot of teams at this stage. How much do you feel that this
group takes that personally?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I know for us, the type of competitor that we are, that we're
going to come in with the mindset that we're going to play every game to the
best of our ability. But there's always that extra motivation because we've
never been counted on, we've never been boosted up. Every time we have gotten
up, everybody wants to see us fall down.  
  
It's just a matter of being who we are and embracing that. We understand that
we're doing this for each other and not for anybody else. So that's the
motivation that we have.  
  
Q. Admiral, you've had a lot of -- obviously had the big shots last
night. You've had so many games this season where you've come up big down the
stretch. Is there one moment you can point back to in your collegiate career
that's helped springboard you into the leader you've become today?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I think the biggest moment that helped me as far as
leadership would be the Georgia game two years ago, missing a game-winning
opportunity for my team, and just seeing the disappointment on our faces when
we knew our backs were against the wall.  
  
And I just thought that from that point on, I was going to do everything I
could to help lead and be an example of what winning looks like. And I just
think from there on, not just me, I think everyone sitting at this table did a
great job of just instilling in everybody in our program that we won't be
denied anymore from what we've been working hard for because we've been
putting a lot of hard work in I'd say from that moment and also Coach Barnes
running us a lot. But I think that was a big motivator for us, too, to stop
losing so we didn't have to run as much.  
  
Q. Kyle, how much fun are you guys having up here together, just as a
group, getting to experience the tournament and everything that kind of goes
into it? For some it's kind of the last go-around here. Just love to know your
answer on that?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I'm having a great time, personally. I love these guys,
probably the funniest group of guys I've ever been around in my life. It's
always a trip. But, no, we're having a great time enjoying this. Some guys
it's their first time. It's great to have worked so hard that we got a chance
to be back here together. So I'm loving it, enjoying it. And I just hope we
make it last.  
  
Q. Jordan, how much more do you think you're prepared because of last
year and just for this moment --  
(Cell phone ringing).  
  
JORDAN BONE: (Laughter) That was my home boy. Sorry about that.  
  
To answer your question, I think we're very prepared. I feel like moments in
the past kind of helped us get to this point. Even yesterday, yesterday was
tough playing against Colgate. But I felt like they prepared as well for a
team like Iowa.  
  
They're very similar. Even though Iowa is bigger, much more physical, it kind
of gave us a taste of playing against Garza, that can hit the open shot,
playing against random motion offense, just being on edge. I felt like they
got us prepared for tomorrow.  
  
I feel like, all in all, we're just ready to attack tomorrow. We're ready for
this situation. We prepared. The preparation has been very important getting
up to this point. So at this point we just have to execute and do our game
plan.  
  
Q. Admiral, a guy like Luka Garza who can pop out and hit those shots,
how do you defend people like that? And maybe have you gone against guys like
that earlier this year that you can kind of compare it to?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: We've gone against a lot of teams that have what we call a
prototypical stretch 4, a guy that can step out and space the floor
offensively. But it's March. Like I said yesterday, seems like everybody's
percentage goes up at least 10 percent in March.  
  
So all you can do is really make the shots as tough as possible. And, you
know, the game is never perfect. And they're a talented team. Luka Garza, he
hit three yesterday, but his percentage doesn't say that he's a big-time
3-point shooter. But it's March, and guys are competing and players make plays
around this time of year. So you've got to respect everybody's ability to
shoot the ball, especially a team like Iowa.  
  
And their pure motion offense is great because they give a lot of, get into a
lot of different actions and space the floor and get their guys good shots and
good looks and move the ball well. Basically you just gotta communicate at a
high level. Nothing is going to be perfect, but you can't beat yourselves by
giving them extra possessions or giving them offensive rebounds and things
like that.  
  
So they're going to hit their shots. We're going to hit ours. And we're both
going to compete, and it's going to be a good game.  
  
Q. Lamonté, this time of year the officials are also officials that you
don't necessarily know from the SEC. Do you find that it is a different game
depending on the officials that you have?  
LAMONTÉ TURNER: Yeah, definitely for a guy like me that likes to get up and
pressure the ball, gotta get a feel of what these officials call, like, the
different type of calls they call, like hand checks and stuff like that.  
  
So at the beginning of the game, Coach always tells us to get a feel for
everything. That way you're not getting silly fouls and stuff like that. So I
think that's definitely big around this time of the year.  
  
And being older guys, you understand that different officials have different
type of calls and stuff like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH BARNES: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've given up 15 3s over the last two games. How much of that is a
concern for you going forward?  
COACH BARNES: Some of those have been unbelievable shots. I don't think we
could defend it any other way than we did. They're going to make some of them,
but some of the shots that all you can do is just get as close as you can, try
to contest a shot without fouling. And some of those are really deep 3s. And
we've played two teams that have shot it great.  
  
But when you can win a game in the NCAA Tournament when a team makes 15 3s
like that and the crowd is pulling for them, I thought we showed the maturity
we needed to show. But us -- it's not that we're not trying to defend the
3-point line, it's not. You've got to give them credit. They're making the
shots.  
  
It's not like they're layups either; they're making shots from very deep range
and that's part of the game. And that 3-point line is a great equalizer in
some ways.  
  
Q. You guys are pretty much in the exact same spot you were this time a
year ago. How much more prepared do you think your kids are to handle what's
going to happen tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: I think they realize, this time of year, how it's a matter of
executing, doing what you have to do and having a lot of respect for your
opponent, which I know they do. And it's about, again, this time of year teams
know each other. You know your own team. Every player should know his role,
what he has to do. And you want to see your players do what you've asked them
to do all year and do it at a high level. And know that it's going to be hard
because teams right now should be playing their best basketball.  
  
Q. You said you're not guarding the 3-point line, but maybe you're
guarding personnel more. Does it make it more challenging when you have four
shooters on the floor at a time like Iowa?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, we played Auburn, they had five. So it's always a
challenge when you have to guard the 3-point line. And then you throw in the
fact that Iowa has an inside game, too, where they very much will play
inside/out. But if they get good looks at it, they're going to take it.  
  
I don't think they force a lot of 3s. And the last two opponents, they were
going to live on that 3-point line. I don't feel that Iowa feels they have to
live back there. But certainly our last two opponents that's what they were
willing to do, shoot 30, 40 3s if necessary. And that line is there, and
you've got to deal with it.  
  
Q. It's been there 32 years. Can you have imagined the evolution that we
are here today and talking about taking 35 or 40 of those?  
COACH BARNES: Again, I looked at last night when I was watching the tape and
they're experimenting right now in the NIT with moving that line back. And I
bet they made 10 of them yesterday behind that line. And so maybe we should
think about moving it back even further. But the fact is it's been good for
the game and it's helped our game. Teams go in it sometimes knowing they're
going to shoot 30, 40 3s.  
  
Q. Is there a mid-range game anymore?  
COACH BARNES: We believe in that. We do. We believe in that. And a lot of
people want to either shoot a layup or shoot the 3. But we still believe
there's a place for the mid-range game.  
  
Q. How important is Kyle in this particular matchup, keeping him on the
floor, of course, with Garza and then Kriener also, big athletic bigs?  
COACH BARNES: I think it's important. But I think all our front-line guys,
Kyle, Grant, I think Derrick Walker will have to be ready to play and John
Fulkerson. And Kyle actually played -- did a good job yesterday. He really
did. And we got what we felt like we needed to go with some offense and we
went with the small lineup that that's really one of our most efficient
lineups.  
  
But we need Kyle. We're going to need him tomorrow. And we're expecting him to
give us a great effort and do his job.  
  
Q. Looked like Iowa changed its defense a lot, plays, will work a lot of
zone. Just how important is it that you play inside/out, not get lured into
settling, like you say?  
COACH BARNES: I think it's important that we flow, that we play. Yesterday
they were back in there as far back as you can go. And I think that we've got
to work hard at taking the slack out of it, get the ball moving and do the
things that we do.  
  
And we've been good against zones all year, really. And we just gotta continue
to do what we've practiced all year and the way that we've played. But we've
got to get our post guys working better than they did yesterday.  
  
Q. Admiral had said that the springboard to him being a clutch shot-
maker and leader was the Georgia game in the SEC Tournament. Do you agree with
that?  
COACH BARNES: What did he say?  
  
Q. He said the springboard for him to be able to make big shots now and
lead the team the way he does was that Georgia game when he missed the 3. Do
you agree with that or what do you think about his growth as a big shot-maker
and leader?  
COACH BARNES: What I think of him is the time he puts in the gym. He's in
there working and working and working. He's worked as hard as any player I've
seen from the time that he started to where he was a very erratic 3-point
shooter and he wanted to shoot it, but he didn't know when he should shoot it.  
  
But he's put so much time in working on his shot. And he's one of those guys,
when it leaves his hand and he has his feet set, you think it's going in.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said you think the team was anxious. Do you think that
was just a matter of it being the first game of the tournament and do you
expect it to continue tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: No, I think the hard thing in this tournament is just getting
started, obviously. And I think when you play the way we started out playing
and -- but we weren't really aggressive as we were making some shots early.
And then, I can tell you, they made some tough shots. I mean, it's not like --
we gave them some, where we broke down in transition.  
  
But the fact is you've got to give them credit. They made 15 3s. I'm telling
you they were pretty tough 3s to make. But I do think that we were a little
bit anxious, and maybe wanting to get back to where we have a chance to play
again today, whatever it may be.  
  
But I expect us now to come out and realize this is like playing a conference
game against anybody in your league where you know you have to be ready to
play and hope that we can play well.  
  
Q. Is it about finding your rhythm, you think, after a little lay-off?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, we played on Sunday. We had three games in three days. And
we played three games -- I don't know how many hours -- we knew coming into
this we had to get our legs back and get, more than anything, get our bodies
back.  
  
And so we didn't do a lot coming into it. And I think some of it is getting
your rhythm back and getting back to playing. So, but now we know what we've
got to do, we've got to go out and execute.  
  
Q. I know that you're busy, always preparing for the next game, but this
time of year do you watch a lot of basketball? Do you watch a lot of other
games?  
COACH BARNES: I don't. Personally I don't because I don't want to get
sidetracked on anything. I want to stay really locked in. But I don't watch a
lot during the season, normally. I just don't do that because I'm just going
to -- because I tell our guys that we've got to stay locked into what we're
doing.  
  
I watch a lot of film of us. We film practice, and I do a lot of that all the
time. But I've got a great coaching staff that we're always -- they're doing
their jobs with scouting and they know what they need to do. But I just don't
watch a lot of it this time of year, maybe because I feel like I'm in this
hotel for a long time, I flip back and forth and all that and watch some here
or there.  
  
But I don't like watching a lot because I don't want to get my mind going in
directions and thinking about things other than what I should be thinking
about.  
  
Q. Do you think your players, are they basketball fans, do they watch a
lot?  
COACH BARNES: Oh, I think they watch everything. I think they're involved with
it. But yet that's part of it, too. It's a great time. It really is. And like
prior to coming here we were back there watching the LSU/Maryland game, like
that. But I don't have the patience right now to just sit down and watch a
game from start to finish unless it's got something to do directly with us.  
  
Q. I know you started your career back here with Gary Williams and Fran
Fraschilla and those guys, I think you were on that staff?  
COACH BARNES: Fran took my place.  
  
Q. That's right. I wondered if you saw this locale and took stock of
your career. You had a hell of a career and where you were when you were a
very young coach in George Mason and those places. How are you different now
in dealing with this circus than you would have been back then?  
COACH BARNES: Well, first of all, after our game yesterday, I thought back
immediately to 19 -- I think it was 1979 -- where Fran McCaffery and Sherman
Dillard and I were working the University of Maryland basketball camp
together. And so we've known each other for a long time. And one of the very
first players we signed at George Mason was Sherman Dillard's brother, Ricky.
And we've known each other for a long time.  
  
And coming through here, the year I was here, I've told people maybe the
greatest coaching job I've ever been a part of was watching Gary Williams,
what he did my time one year with him here. But you learn a lot. I think as a
young head coach you try to -- you sometimes can put a little more pressure on
your team than you probably need to.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH BARNES: Because you want to win. And you realize, one, that it's not
something you ever take for granted. I mean, there's a lot of teams now that
-- the thing is to get to this tournament every year. That's got to be your
goal.  
  
And the way our business has turned into, it seems if you don't get there,
good things don't happen to you. Or happen for you. But I think you learn and
you learn -- I think as I've gotten older the biggest thing I've learned is to
trust my players more as much as anything and know that their hard work they
put into it, and you've got to let them play the game and you can't joystick
it all the time and think you're going to try to control every possession. And
as a young coach I was probably guilty of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 88, Iona - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina head coach Roy Williams and
student-athletes Nassir Little and Cameron Johnson.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Needless to say the second half was a lot different from the
first half. I thought the first half we were very tentative on the offensive
end and didn't do what we planted to do on the defensive end.  
  
They changed their game plan a little bit, and needless to say it worked.
They've been playing at a fast pace, but they controlled the clock and shot 3s
and made 10 3s in the first half. And our offense was not very good. The only
offense we had in the first half was Nassir taking the ball to the basket.  
  
Second half, Cam makes a big 3 the first possession and all of a sudden we
have a little more energy and passion about what we were doing defensively.
And we defended, got some turnovers and got some points off that. And they
missed some open shots as well. But I think we shot, like, 63, 64 percent in
the second half because we took better shots as well.  
  
But Nassir gave us a great lift off the bench and Cam did, like I said, the
first shot of the second half was really big, and he had a couple assists and
baskets later than that as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cam, what did he say to you guys at halftime? And did he need to say
anything?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: He just said that's not the way we play; we need to pick it
up. And we received that message pretty loud and clear. We knew that the way
we played in the first half was unacceptable. We knew that wasn't us, and
that's what he emphasized to us, that we have to come out and play better.  
  
He had faith in us. That was important to us. And we just had to go out there
and execute and use our advantages.  
  
Q. Cameron, what did Iona do in the first half? They shot well, but what
did they do that made it difficult in the first half?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Making shots. It was -- really took them a long way. It took
us out of getting any transition opportunities. Made us play offense in the
half court. They slowed down the tempo, used a lot of the clock and hit a lot
of 3s.  
  
They kind of controlled that tempo. And we were swinging the ball around the
outside too much, not really getting it on the inside. And they did a pretty
good job of keeping us off the glass for the most part in that first half.  
  
Q. Naz, do you look at yourself as an energy guy? And even if you don't
do you feel like you've inserted some of that into the team in the first half
when you came in?  
NASSIR LITTLE: Yeah, for sure. I just look at what the team needs. I felt like
early on we was taking too many outside shots. And before the game Coach and
all the coaching staff was telling me to be aggressive and get easy buckets on
the inside and play inside-out. I think by doing that, opened up a lot of
things in the second half.  
  
Q. Nassir, just looked like in the second half you decided to push the
ball up the court and go to the basket, either a pass for a drive. Was just
what you wanted to do to try to change the flow of the game?  
NASSIR LITTLE: For sure. We did a scout and we knew they weren't the strongest
team in transition. I felt early on we weren't getting enough stops to take
advantage of that. So once we picked it up defensively we got easy buckets in
transition. Guys were being more aggressive taking it to the basket, putting
pressure on their guys, getting people in foul trouble, and that's how we were
able to get away.  
  
Q. Cam, coaches love to say the first four or five minutes of a second
half is the most important part of the game. Is that cliché because it's
true?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It is true. It is true. We came out and we tied it up pretty
quick and it gave us some momentum and we rolled that way for the majority of
the half. So we came out, we called the play, we ran it. My guys hit a good
screen. The first one fell.  
  
Then Luke came down, got an easy basket and the stops started to come. You
just hope a team that hits 10 of their first 21 3s kind of cools off. And they
did that a little bit and we took advantage.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just speak to the ball movement by your team in the second
half after only three first-half assists there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: For North Carolina to play a half and only have three assists,
that tells you right there that we're not moving very well. And we talked
about that. We had zero points off turnovers. We had three assists. Everything
was just an outside shot except for Nassir basically, and Luke had a lot of
things inside, but for some reason he was worried about getting his shots
blocked or something because at half he and Cam together were 3-for-16. And
you go back look at what they did in the second half, it was much more
aggressive and poised and confident in what they were doing.  
  
Q. What do you have to say about Iona guard Rickey McGill's performance?
He had 26 points and was really impressive from deep?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's a four-year guy, four championships, four NCAA
Tournaments, and I congratulated him on that in the line as we were shaking
hands at the end. We knew that he's a good 3-point shooter, but the other guys
shoot more. But today he made his first one, made his second one and I think
he made six in a row before he missed.  
  
But I think he's a heck of a player. And scouting report said, you've got to
watch No. 0. He plays in the passing lanes and still gets two steals like
that. I think he had a heck of a game.  
  
But Tim changed a little bit and gave them the best chance to win by using
clock and spreading, and he was counting on his guys making shots and in the
first half they did. And fortunately for us we made more in the second half
and they didn't shoot it as well.  
  
Q. I know you prefer not to have gone through that first half. But now
that it's done, do you feel like maybe you can use that to your advantage, as
maybe let these guys know that they're not invincible and they need to come
out and play well?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think that they felt like they were invincible.
Probably the thing I despise more than anything in basketball or in life is
somebody trying to be cool. And I thought in the first half we didn't have the
passion.  
  
And I don't think that they thought it was going to be easy. I just don't
think we had the passion to play. And especially in the defensive end when
they're spreading you, it's not easy. You've got to get there and you can't
let a guy stare down at your feet and pull up shoot a 3. You can't let them
drive to the basket and lay it up.  
  
It was a total breakdown on the defensive end and then they're making the 3s,
and we started looking at the score and I think perhaps got a little tight.  
  
But no, I told them in the locker room, every tournament's different. You
build your momentum once you get in the tournament. And some of you guys have
heard this before, but I was on the staff of a pretty good team -- 1982. And
the first game we played James Madison in Charlotte. And we blew them out, 52
to 50.  
  
And so it happens. And we had a guy named Worthy, a guy name Jordan and a guy
named Perkins on that team. We ended up winning the national championship. So
it's one game, but learn from this one game. We've got to have more passion.  
  
Q. Can you coach or uncoach tight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I think what you've gotta do is kids have to have
confidence. I've always said, don't worry about anything; just lose yourself
in the game. And that's what we tried to get the guys to focus on and be
positive and lose themselves in the game, yes.  
  
Q. Obviously when they were coming out shooting a bunch of 3s early, you
knew they were going to make them. I guess the question is --  
COACH WILLIAMS: I did not know they were going to make them.  
  
Q. I didn't say that right. Once they started hitting a few and you see
that, what was the adjustment you made at halftime knowing that you could kind
of sense that they were going to shoot a bunch of 3s?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We knew they were going to shoot a bunch of 3s period, because
that's what they do. They try to open the court and try to drive and penetrate
and pitch for 3s. That's what his teams have done for ten straight games in
the winning streak, and they've done a good job of it.  
  
But they did a better job of it today because I think they shot like 40 -- 47
or something like that in the first half and that's pretty impressive. But in
the second half, you know, we just talked about playing with passion. We did
start switching the screens on the ball 1 through 4. 5 was the only one making
a hard edge. But they didn't really set that many screens, so that didn't
change it much. It's just that we had more passion and got to the shooters
more. But more importantly we didn't stand around on the offensive end. We
started moving and we got some stops and that got our breaks so we were better
offensively.  
  
Q. You're a No. 1 seed which is obviously an achievement, something you
want to be. Does that come with a little pressure that affected you a little
bit early on?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think so. And I think UMBC last year made it a little more
pressure. And it's part of the game. And I understand that and told them that.
But if you're a tough competitor and you invest yourself into the game, you're
not just worried about the score; you want to be concerned about how you're
playing.  
  
And I think for a couple moments there we were concerned about the score more
so than how we were playing. So I just tried to get us to focus on playing
better, playing better and doing what we've done all year long.  
  
Q. Second half, it looked like you really tightened up the defense in
the paint. Whenever Crawford went down the lane he always was being met by two
players. Was that the key adjustment on defense?  
COACH WILLIAMS: When you say it was a key adjustment, it sounds like it's
coaching. We did the same thing; we just did it better in the second half. The
only thing we changed was playing the screen on the ball differently in the
second half.  
  
And, like I say, they didn't set nearly as many in the second half as they did
in the first half. But we were trying to be in there to make it difficult for
somebody to drive off because if you're in the gaps and they drive and
penetrate, you just have to go one way.  
  
If you're out denying like we used to do, we were denying, you gotta get back
and then you go two ways. The game plan was to be -- to have them in there,
stopping people driving to the basket. We just didn't look like it was a game
plan in the first half.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

### [Craig Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13780)

### [Sam Merrill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34901)

### [Brock Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37045)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Washington - 78, Utah State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Craig Smith and student-
athletes Sam Merrill and Brock Miller. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH SMITH: I want to congratulate Washington. I thought they played
fantastic. Really disrupted us. I thought we were really tentative in the
first half. And that was a lot to do with them. They really disrupted us on
top.  
  
We struggled completing passing. We had too many turnovers. Obviously we ended
up with 21 turnovers on the game, which is very uncharacteristic of us. I can
only think of one other game in which that's happened even remotely close to
that in the last two months during -- since we've won, what, 17 out of 18, or
whatever it was.  
  
But you've got to give them credit. I thought our guys really competed hard,
really fought back. They hurt us on the offensive glass the first half. It was
really a tale of two halves, but we came roaring all the way back. Our press
is really, really good. Caused them to get tentative and forced a bunch of
turnovers.  
  
Sam made a big 3 in the corner right in front of our bench that cut the lead
to one. And then we just almost got maybe a little overzealous with our press
and took some chances we really didn't need to. And give them credit, they
make back-to-back 3s on the next two possessions. And then I think we came
back and turned it over a couple times.  
  
But an amazing season. We're so proud to represent certainly Utah State, the
state of Utah and of course the Mountain West Conference. The Mountain West
Conference is a great conference. It's really a conference on the rise. And
we're really, really proud to represent them. And obviously we wish we could
have done it with a W.  
  
But this team, picked ninth in the preseason poll and getting an 8 seed, and
then just the way we did things, it was a historic season really from start to
finish. It was a program -- we didn't lose back-to-back games one time. To win
the regular season title and then validate it with the postseason tournament,
it was fantastic. First-ever in Utah State history in terms of winning the
Mountain West championship.  
  
So it's just the start of where we want to go and we'll talk about that more
later. But congrats to Washington.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, this was obviously just a really frustrating game. What did they
do to really take you out of rhythm? You just didn't have looks, especially
the first half?  
SAM MERRILL: Like Coach said, we've got to give them all the credit. Their
zone was really good tonight. And they made it really tough on us. We had
practiced against it all week, but like I said pregame, you can't replicate
the length they have and the athleticism they have.  
  
And they did a very good job not just taking away my looks but making things
tough for us as a team as well. So just gotta give them all the credit in the
world, for sure.  
  
Q. Brock, at the very beginning, from the beginning it seemed like you
were coming out with a lot of energy. But going into the half, that was
probably one of the ugliest points as far as things were going against you
guys. What did Coach say at the half? What was your guys' conversation like,
and what were you thinking would be the outcome of the game?  
BROCK MILLER: You know, us as a team, we've been in this position before where
we've been down going into halftime. And us guys, you know, we all came
together at halftime. And we just decided it's time to come out and really
just not be tentative like we were in the first half. And Coach made a big
emphasis on that.  
  
And obviously as a team we always believe we're going to win. We're always
going to find a way. And unfortunately it didn't happen for us tonight. And
credit to Washington. They came out ready to play and they really disrupted us
on our offense with their defense. And it happens sometimes where you lose
some and you win some.  
  
But I'm really proud of all of our guys and what we did this year was
incredible. And we're only going uphill from here.  
  
Q. That was a team with great length obviously and you can see that on
the video as you prepare for the game. But does reality set in the first
couple of minutes of the game and you realize it's going to be a little more
difficult for your shots to fall?  
BROCK MILLER: Oh, definitely. I mean, all those guys up on the perimeter are
very long, very athletic, and you don't realize until you're in the moment.
Again, they're jumping in passing lanes. So it definitely took us a quick
minute.  
  
But I think that second half we really fought hard and we gave it our all. And
we're going to be back next year.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys fought pretty hard back in the second half. What was it
like when Washington, they go 6-of-7 from the 3 in the second half. How much
did that hurt you guys in terms of make a push and then they hit a 3-pointer
kind of cut it back?  
SAM MERRILL: We cut it to one and then they hit two straight 3s and it was --
No. 11, I forgot his name -- but No. 11, who is a good player but hasn't made
a ton of 3s on the year. So give credit to him. He hit some big shots, three
big shots in the second half and got to the free-throw line a couple times,
too.  
  
So like Coach said, we had a couple of -- once we cut it to one they hit a 3,
and then we had a couple of turnovers, and they hit a transition 3. That was a
tough moment for us, for sure.  
  
Q. Brock, but both of you can answer, it's been eight years since you
got to the NCAA Tournament. You mentioned you wanted to get the tradition
going again. What have you taken from the experience here? I know it's shorter
than what you wanted it to be, but what do you take from this experience going
forward to next year?  
BROCK MILLER: This experience was awesome for us, and it can only go uphill
from here. We've got a lot of guys coming back next year. Sam and I both,
we're from the state of Utah, and we both grew up watching the Aggies. And
it's something special to be here in the NCAA Tournament and to have won the
Mountain West Conference tournament championship.  
  
And from here on out we're just going to keep competing and doing our best to
get back to the top again, get back to this tournament and hopefully a better
outcome next time. But definitely it's on our minds and this experience will
definitely benefit us.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, it's been a good year for us, definitely, getting Utah
State back to where Utah State basketball needs to be. But obviously this is
still very disappointing. We felt like this was a real opportunity to make
that next step for this program and couldn't get it done tonight.  
  
So our goals next year will be to do what we did this year, win the league,
win the Mountain West Tournament, and then get here again and win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Were you surprised to see them shoot the 3 as well as they did? They
have not done that anywhere close to what they did tonight all season.  
COACH SMITH: Yes and no. I mean, watched a ton of games on them. There were
certainly some games where they were on fire -- I forget the specific ones --
leading up to this game. At halftime they were 4-for-10, but they were
drilling us in the paint. They were 11-for-20 in the paint in the first half
and just had six offensive boards. They only had one in the second half.  
  
So we were really having a difficult time staying in front of them in the
first half, in particular, especially No. 5, who is obviously a very good
player, the Pac-12 Player of the Year, Nowell. We just were having a difficult
time, he was getting downhill, downhill , downhill. And they were just living
at the rim which opens up offensive rebounding lanes.  
  
And second half, obviously we got off to a great start, had to call a couple
of timeouts early. The press was very effective. You try to make the game a
little more Helter Skelter, and to their credit they made some 3s on us and
some of those were tough 3s. Some were wide open. But good teams make plays,
good players make plays. We've done it all year. And to their credit they just
made a few more plays than us.  
  
Q. Normally Sam and Neemias are huge weapons for you. They both kind of
had an off night. What's that like as a coach? What goes on in your mind to
kind of change that or was there panic?  
COACH SMITH: I don't think there was panic. Certainly they got us out of a
rhythm. They sped us up, without a question. I thought we looked a lot more
like ourselves the first 10 -- whatever, the first 14 -- 12 minutes of the
second half.  
  
Then we did a few uncharacteristic things, just taking some shots offensively
that we normally don't take. We tried to throw, I guess it would be an alley-
oop pass that was never there. And sometimes, that happens sometimes in these
moments.  
  
And certainly the first half I didn't have our guys set up in a position for
consistent success on the offensive end, I thought especially. I thought we
were way better the second half. We got downhill. We were in attack mode. We
shoot 16 free throws. We only shot four in the first half. We were way more
aggressive.  
  
And what people forget -- and I know our local guy, you've heard how young we
are, it's very rare we showed our youth throughout. And we had some glimpse of
that tonight. But I've coached for -- you walk in the locker room after the
game and some teams when they're done with their season they're hop-skipping
and jumping out of that locker room.  
  
And this isn't like an emotional -- it's a very emotional time, but this isn't
an emotional statement. I've coached for 23 years on really, really good
teams. I had a team that played in a national championship game. I loved
coaching those guys. I've been part of a lot of rebuilding, so to speak, where
you're doing some things for the first time.  
  
And I have never seen a team come together like this team has. Literally, if
you look back to where we were last April, May, this summer where we couldn't
throw a shot in the ocean, we're throwing the ball in the third stands of the
Spectrum on a routine basis. I'm not kidding. That's factual.  
  
And how far this team has come and just -- I wish, like, I just wish every
coach could coach a team like this. It's just -- it's just an amazing, amazing
group to be around. Not to get sidetracked, but that's what I do.  
  
I was 32 years old, I spent a full day with John Wooden. And just by -- the
late Don Meyer, who's one of the biggest influences in my life -- and he's
obviously passed away -- invited me to a coaching clinic in L.A. He does
coaching clinics all the time. And the plane ticket was like 600 bucks. I
didn't have any money. I was making, like, 25 grand. And my wife's, like, you
need to go, you need to go.  
  
We go, we land, we drive. Next thing you know we're in a residential area, and
Coach Meyer rings the doorbell and out comes John Wooden. I didn't know we
were going to see him. Spent the whole day with him. I'm 32 years old, just
got done being head coach for my first year. We had a great year. The year
before I got to Mayville, they were 1-27. We got to the national tournament,
lost.  
  
Any way, long story short -- I could tell John Wooden stories all day from
this day -- but I was, like, you always want to find your purpose as a person,
as a coach, what you value, what you believe in. If it's just about winning,
then I'm just not sure -- then it's kind of hollow.  
  
You better win or you're going to get fired. But it's kind of shallow. And I'm
32 years old. I had a full head of hair, and he was getting all these calls --
he had a phone, like, this big, like that. And you hear every voicemail --
Bill Walton would call, the late Pat Summitt called, Swen Nater called. It's
like a Who's Who.  
  
And at the end of every call, these former players would say, I love you,
Coach. And it was just like, that's what it's about. And so you go through
everything and this group, I mean, it's a band of brothers. They will be
forever connected, just their selflessness, the way they play, there's no ego.
There's no, "I need to get mine." There's just none of that.  
  
And it's just such -- even tonight when we were dead in the water, we just
kept fighting and chipping away and chipping away and gave ourselves a chance.
And we just couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. During halftime, what was it that you said to them? How did you
channel that brotherhood?  
COACH SMITH: Just rely on your training. The experiences that we went through,
that's why we play tough non-conference schedules. You go through, you learn a
lot about yourself. And you get in the league and playing and it's just
rigorous and rugged. And I mean every night out.  
  
So you've got to -- and then what's got us to this point all year and that's
-- certainly you have to have talent. But what's put us over the top is we
worked really, really hard. We have a gator mentality. We don't take
possessions off. We compete no matter what. But what really separates us is
our chemistry and just trusting each other. And we usually -- we played very,
very connected. Obviously they disrupted our connectivity just because their
active hands, their athleticism, all that, creating turnovers.  
  
And we're typically a team that really eliminates losing. And from the day we
got hired almost, I think it's one week short of a year ago now, our number
one thing is we have to eliminate losing to win.  
  
And I'm not going to talk about last year, but like we had to end possessions.
We're a top 5 rebounding team in the country. We've got to be able to protect
the paint. We're at the top 5 in two-point field goal defense in the country.
And to not turn it over and make your free throws.  
  
We go 16-for-20 from the line. We knew how to get fouled this year. And our
style of play lends to that. But certainly the one thing we didn't do to
eliminate losing was the number one key going into the game is we cannot allow
our offense to be their best offense.  
  
And with the football analogy, if you're throwing four pick-6s odds are it's
probably going to be a long night. And we threw a few pick-6s tonight.  
  
Q. I've seen a lot of Syracuse over the years, and John Chaney at
Temple. Can you put into words to a layman what it's like to -- you guys were
on a roll. I watched your Mountain West Tournament. You guys were really on a
roll. And all of a sudden this just unplugs you. Can you explain how a defense
like that can do that?  
COACH SMITH: First of all -- and Sam nailed it -- it's very difficult for us
to replicate that in practice because obviously just on our roster -- like we
know conceptually what they're doing, of course, but just our roster doesn't
lend to that.  
  
I said it tongue in cheek on one of the interviews the other day, like to
replicate Thybulle and some of those guys, like we should have had those
swimming pool noodles, like just to tip and deflect, because obviously in
practice those windows that we see are very, they're wide windows. And you
play against these guys and those windows are shrunk and just tipping and
deflecting.  
  
That's one of our goals, we want to tip and deflect like crazy. We did a good
job of that this year. It's just very, very difficult to replicate. Their
front line defense is incredibly -- it's good. They're quick to the ball.
Super active hands. Thybulle, obviously, is a game-changer on the defensive
end.  
  
And then once we got it to the back line defense, I thought we'd be able to
score and make some things happen. I felt like we had some really good looks.
Now part of it they speed you up, but I thought we just missed some --
literally just point-blank, point-blank, point-blank. And so some of that's
us. But a lot of that is them just getting us really sped up. We knew we were
going to be put in situations where we get to play two-on-one, three-on-two,
once we get past that initial line.  
  
But it's not very often that Neemias Queta goes 4-for-12. I'm not singling him
out, I'm just saying that guy's incredibly good. He's very talented. Just had
one of those nights.  
  
First or second play of the game we get it right in the heart of the defense,
two times, back-to-back plays, where Quinn Taylor gets it. We have a two-on-
one. And we could have thrown it up to Neemi for a dunk or even bounce passed
it, or he could have shot a floater. We turn it over. They tip it out and it's
going the other way.  
  
The next play, we ran that play about two plays later, same thing, Quinn kind
of -- he was trying to make the right read to Neemi. And he literally could
have walked to the rim. And it gets blocked. And so it is what it is. But it's
very difficult to prepare for. They do a great job with it. And you live and
you learn.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Luka Garza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34689)

### [Jordan Bohannon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32904)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Iowa - 79, Cincinnati - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery and student-
athletes Jordan Bohannon and Luka Garza. Questions.  
  
Q. When you were down 11 fairly early in the first half I think it was,
what did you think was the feeling of your team and was there anything you
wanted to accomplish personally to get your guys in a different mindset,
because you ended up in a different mindset?  
LUKA GARZA: I think the timeouts in that stretch when it was 18-5, those were
key. And everyone was communicating. It was a great feeling in the timeout. We
knew a couple of shots we missed. We missed a couple of chippies around the
rim, and we needed to get back and get some stops and rebound. They started to
get too many offensive rebounds.  
  
As a group individually I wanted to get inside and post up more and post
deeper. I thought in the beginning some of those guys were pushing me out of
the spots I wanted to get to. I think I did a better job of that through the
course of the game to get deeper because it's easy for them to come double or
poke me when I'm posting up 17 feet away.  
  
I tried to do a better job of that I thought as a collective group we all
tried to focus and string together some shots.  
  
Q. Would you both care to discuss the impact your zone had on them?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I think we did a good job of just kind of getting them a
little hesitant. They're a really well-coached team and run a deliberate
offense. We knew that coming in. We started out man to start out the game and
they got a couple of easy baskets. We changed it up a little bit.  
  
I thought our press was really great tonight. They didn't know when to go or
not to go. So we did a really good job changing the pace of the game
controlling the tempo especially in the second half.  
  
LUKA GARZA: I thought we were communicating. They have terrific shooters in
Jenifer and Cumberland. And they were trying to run Jenifer to the corners and
try to get him some open looks. He hit a couple early when he was wide open.
We tried to key in on that, and we did a great job just moving around, just
making those shots tough for them.  
  
Q. What did you do to regroup after the tough stretch to end the regular
season?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: We worked really hard. It wasn't a lot of fun during that
stretch. We played really well in the beginning of the season, middle of the
season. That's life in the Big Ten. That's why we got eight teams in the NCAA
Tournament. I don't think we've lost a game in the NCAA Tournament as well.
That shows how powerful and strong this conference was.  
  
So a lot of it was just playing really good teams. And we knew that. And it
prepared us to get ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
LUKA GARZA: We just needed to stay confident with each other. We know what
we're capable of. We keep saying that but it's true. We know what we can do
when we play at our best. And it was great to see tonight even when they got
up we stayed composed and were able to get to play better.  
  
Q. Jordan, I'd like to ask you, what is it like for you guys to lean on
Luka in those tough situations?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: It's really easy to. He's come up big in a lot of games this
year. He was dominant down low tonight, or this morning, I guess. And we know
if we fed him the ball down low he was either going to get an easy basket,
draw a foul or kick it out.  
  
I thought he did a really good job of doing all those three things when he did
end up getting the ball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You point for the tournament, you look up and it's 18-5. What do you
say to them at that point?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the most simple approach is -- the most logical one
is it was 35 minutes to go. So no time to panic. It could have easily been we
were up and we have to keep playing well.  
  
So we made some adjustments. We changed the defense. We changed some personnel
a little bit. You start pushing some different buttons. But I think the
critical thing is that the players maintained confidence. You don't start
screaming and yelling at them, blaming them because they didn't rotate and
block out. We talked about blockout; they had nine offensive rebounds in the
first half for 11 points.  
  
If I'm spazzing and yelling at everybody for that they're not going to lock in
on what we need to do with offense, what defense are we in, who is on the
floor for them, where is Cumberland, who do we need to get the ball to.  
  
So you just try to stay very business-like. Plenty of time, we're going to
continue to do what we do. Maybe call a different offensive set or alignment,
give them a little bit of a different look, because when you're matching up
this is what they do so well. They're pretty good at it. So if you stand and
you kind of run similar action, they're going to lock you up.  
  
So you've got to have more ball movement, more people movement, more movement
with a purpose to get better shots. And then we just needed to see it go in a
little bit there. Thankfully Isaiah made two early because we were really
struggling. It was the five that you're talking about, but eventually Luka got
going. I put TC back in after he had two fouls. He made a couple of buckets.
And Joe got a big one. We just sort of settled down. Then you felt like, okay,
we can attack this thing successfully.  
  
Q. Did you play a lot of zone this year?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We did.  
  
Q. Why in your mind did it work so well today?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, sometimes you play zone because you think a zone will
work against a particular team. Sometimes you play zone to change up what
wasn't working. A man wasn't working.  
  
We felt like we could mix our pressure three-quarter court. We played a couple
different ways and then our half-court zones which we play a couple different
ways. So that would, at the very minimum, keep them in front of us so we could
see where they are. You're not guarding as much action. You can sort of
surround a painted area on a missed shot, helps you rebound.  
  
Some coaches would argue that it doesn't help you rebound. I think it does.
Keeps everybody there. And it put more pressure on them to shoot 3s. They're a
team that's pretty good at it. But tonight they were 6-for-27.  
  
Q. How much time do you spend this week coming into today that it might
feel more like a true road game being so close to Cincinnati?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Truthfully, not very much. The thing about NCAA Tournament
play, there's other teams represented here today that don't care who wins this
game. So the Tennessee people, the Colgate people, they don't care.  
  
I knew the Hawk fans would be doing the "Let's go, Hawks" cheer. I knew there
would be more Cincinnati people. But it's an NCAA game. I didn't feel like in
any way shape or form it was a road game to me.  
  
I coached in '09; we played Ohio State in Dayton. I remember like it was
yesterday and everybody from Louisville was rooting for Siena. So it's a
different kind of deal.  
  
Our guys were locked in. Every game in our league is a big stage. It's
national TV. It's an NBA arena. And we're used to being on the road. We just
played at the United Center.  
  
So the critical thing is to know and understand what do we have to do to beat
Cincinnati; what do they do well? What can we take away? What can we do to
exploit them? And not worry about who's in the 15th row yelling for one team
or another.  
  
Q. You never know how a freshman is going to respond. What is it about
Wieskamp that made him be able to be so poised?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the thing that was impressive about him today was it
didn't start real well for him. A lot of times when that happens guys struggle
for 40 minutes. He has always done a really good job of figuring out what are
they doing to me? What are they doing to us? What can I do that's different
than what I've been doing? He's a very cerebral guy in that sense.  
  
And I think as the game progressed, you saw him become more confident in what
he was doing at both ends. He gets 19 points. Hits a huge 3. But -- huge shot
block at a very critical situation. He's just a guy that does a lot of things
to help us win. And you can count on him to make those kinds of decisions in
his head and not be a mistake guy.  
  
Q. Not that the NCAA Tournament always correctly reflects a league
strength, but what does it say about the Big Ten that you're 6-0 so far in
this tournament?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We've been saying all year long that it's the most
competitive league in the country top to bottom. And you sort of expect Big
Ten coaches to make those kinds of statements. But the reality is we actually
believe that. And so I think it's proving it.  
  
Q. What you said before about keeping your poise on -- you're a hot-
blooded guy, a Philly guy?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: At times.  
  
Q. \-- was there a point in your career where you learned how valuable
it was to keep your poise under those kinds of circumstances, 18-5, that kind
of thing?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Very definitely. One of my mentors, John MacLeod, he was the
best at that. And he would always say, when it gets sticky, you can't yell at
them. That's what he would say.  
  
So when you see me get hot blooded, there are various reasons for that, and it
happens despite what some people might think, very rarely. It doesn't happen
very much in practice. It doesn't happen much in the locker room, at halftime.
Oh, that coach went in there and yelled at them. No.  
  
But at crunch time and in key moments of the game, you can't lose your mind
and start yelling at them. It's only going to lead to more mistakes. At that
point you need to build confidence.  
  
Q. Three big scores in the second half underneath out-of-bounds, two of
them from out of a timeout -- a Garza 3, a Baer 3, and then you get a Garza
layup. Those go-to sets for you guys out of bounds or did that come out of the
timeouts?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: They're go-to sets for us. But the difference is you can run
certain action. But then you can move people around in that action. So it
might look different. So we ran a typically action but we moved things around.
And that's how Luka got the 3 in particular. He's not usually in that spot,
usually a guard or a perimeter guard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 77, Colgate - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colgate head coach Matt Langel and student-
athletes Will Rayman and Jordan Burns. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, what was it like to have the kind of game that you had on
this kind of stage?  
JORDAN BURNS: It feels great. We came into this game knowing how good we were
as a team. And to be able to go out there and show people how good we really
are was great.  
  
Q. Will, what was the difference in the second half when you started to
make a little bit of a run, came from a deficit, got back in front? What were
the things that were working for Colgate at that point?  
WILL RAYMAN: It was pretty much just sticking to the game plan and forcing
them to take tough shots and getting rebounds. In the first half we let up way
too many offensive rebounds and that kind of messed up the first half.  
  
And the second half, we were getting those rebounds that we were missing the
first half and we were making shots. We were swinging the ball. We were
playing team basketball like we have for the past 11 games.  
  
Q. This is a big place. Nationwide Arena is huge. It's not Hamilton. But
the maroon you could visibly see. You could hear everybody. Were you aware
that you had so much support in the stands, and of course watching at home,
but right here in Ohio?  
JORDAN BURNS: Definitely, we knew we had so much support. We have the best
fans in the country. That's what we think. We pack out Cotterell Court as much
as we can, and we love these guys, all the people that come out and watch us
play. We definitely felt it tonight.  
  
WILL RAYMAN: It's great to see all those people coming out. I only knew that
the football team was going to be there, so to see that whole section full was
really unbelievable. And we're a small school, but we have a lot of people
that really care about the school. So it just shows.  
  
Q. Jordan, I just talked to your dad in the concourse. Everyone's kind
of looking toward next year already -- maybe a second back-to-back NCAA
Tournament appearance like the '90s. Your thoughts on that?  
JORDAN BURNS: Honestly, we're just going to get back to work after today.
We're just going to get back in the gym, work hard for next season and we'll
discuss goals and things at the end of the year.  
  
Q. It looked like you guys were just enjoying it so much. Can you just
talk about -- can you just explain the sheer joy factor of what that was like
being out there today?  
JORDAN BURNS: Yeah, of course. Our coaches at the time, playing with house
money, and he was just saying just go out there, have fun, we have nothing to
lose. It was great going out there with this big crowd and being able to stay
in the game and almost winning the game. It was amazing.  
  
We felt like coming into this game it was going to be a close one even though
most people in the country didn't. So we expected this. So that's why we were
really excited. And unfortunately we were unable to pull it off, but we had a
great showing.  
  
WILL RAYMAN: I mean, just personally I love playing basketball. I'm always
happy when I'm playing. And I know we all do. That's why we do this every day.
That's why we play at this level. Just like to be out there on the national
stage, this is it.  
  
Like this is what you dream about as a kid. This is what you watch on TV. This
is the best stage to do it in. And we were just all having a really good time
out there.  
  
Q. Jordan, it seemed like earlier in the game they were talking to you
while you were driving and moving around. What were they saying and what was
it like to see it as the game went on?  
JORDAN BURNS: The Tennessee players? I mean, that happens with a lot of
schools. It's just talking, getting into the game and things. We're
competitors out there. So guys on the other side, you want to try to get in
each other's head. And it was fun. It was all fun and games. It's during the
game, just during the flow.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
JORDAN BURNS: Just them. Nothing really drives me besides my team. They keep
me driving regardless what anybody says.  
  
Q. Jordan, growing up watching this thing and the "One Shining Moment"
and the montage and all that, and obviously you're probably going to be a part
of that, did you feel like you were going to have something special today? Did
you wake up out of bed and think this is going to be it?  
JORDAN BURNS: I felt like today was going to be a special day, definitely,
with my dad being able to see me play for the first time in a while. So it was
great having him here, having all my family here. So I definitely feel like
today was a special day. And it was, obviously.  
  
Q. Jordan, elaborate on the moment you had with your dad after the game.
You climbed over the press row area there to enjoy a moment with your dad.
Just tell us what that was like.  
JORDAN BURNS: I haven't seen my dad in a couple months. My parents -- my mom
and my brothers came up last week for the championship game. But he wasn't
able to make it because of work. Just being able to see his face and give him
a hug and tell him I love him was amazing.  
  
Q. You were without one of your best players, some kind of eye issue.
What kind of effect did that have on you guys?  
JORDAN BURNS: Honestly it didn't have much of an effect. Everyone on our team
is good enough to step up at any given time. We work for these moments, for
guys being out and stuff. So we were ready. If he wasn't ready to play,
another guy was going to step up and play tonight. And that's what happened
tonight.  
  
WILL RAYMAN: Exactly what he said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH LANGEL: Obviously a fantastic NCAA basketball game. I thought the venue
was terrific. The hospitality has been unbelievable. I thought the fans and
the energy in the building was everything you dreamed it could be.  
  
Specific to the game, it kind of went as planned other than obviously your
heart goes out to Rapolas. He woke up with a bout of pink eye this morning. It
just wasn't happening.  
  
You have a mix of emotions; you're proud of your team and happy that we fought
so hard to make such an exciting game, but you're disappointed for the result.
And your heart breaks for Rapolas, who without him we wouldn't be able to get
there.  
  
It speaks to the character and the makeup of the team I gets to coach and
that's who they are. Jordan Burns missed five games with a pretty significant
ankle injury and the guys just kept moving forward. And they kept getting
better over the course of the season, and as a coach you want nothing more
than that.  
  
I gotta give Tennessee credit. They had all the pressure. Jordan joked that I
said we were playing with house money. But we dealt with that pressure going
into the end of the regular season and into our conference tournament. We have
one chance to get here.  
  
So as the game got tight and close, I thought Tennessee managed it really
well. Obviously Schofield stepped up and made huge corner jump shots. It ends
up being the difference in the game. We turned it over a couple more times
than we would have liked and gave up a couple more offensive rebounds than we
would have liked.  
  
But for the most part we got to show who we are and what we can do and made
some good plays to get some open shots and stepped up and knocked them down.  
  
Q. Down 16 in the first half and then without the services of Rapolas
Ivanauskas in the second half. To battle back and take the lead in the second
half and battle all the way down the stretch, does anything surprise you about
this team?  
COACH LANGEL: No, you've been with us every step of the way. And I think
you've seen the myriad of ways that this group has found a way to battle and
compete and it's been different guys in different moments. And they do it
together and they believe in one another.  
  
Again, I've never coached a team that gives each other more high-5s than this
group. We can do any shooting drill or be down 15 or up two or whatever,
they're just constantly there for one another. So nothing surprises me.  
  
Obviously I'm immensely proud of their effort, and I think part -- Rap
couldn't see great and we stuck with him because he's a huge part of our team.
But part of getting down was him being out there, he couldn't catch the ball
clean, couldn't see great. And in some ways the group rallied behind him and
for one another.  
  
Q. For the first 36 minutes they took open 3s and for the most part
didn't make them. And Bone hit one and Schofield hit three. How much of the
kind of the result is just them bucking that trend?  
COACH LANGEL: I think a lot of it. The game plan wasn't just let them shoot
3s, but obviously they dominate in the paint in the SEC, and they're number
one in the country for a stint this season because of their ability to do what
they do.  
  
So we knew if we just kind of played them, didn't pack it in a little bit and
change defenses and help and show them a crowd and give up hopefully some
late-contested 3-point shots that our chances weren't great. So that was part
of the game plan was to hope that they would miss enough for it to be close
enough for us to steal, and give those guys credit.  
  
Bone is -- he's a really talented guy, but he also runs his team. And I think
he and Turner to combine nine assists, just two turnovers is a huge part of
the game. And Schofield stepped up and made those shots, and Bone made a huge
one, too.  
  
Q. Was there a time during the game when you thought we could really
pull this off? And secondly with Ivanauskas's eye issue, what did you do to
try to -- was there anything you could do about it -- just pink eye and you
have to hope his vision clears somehow?  
COACH LANGEL: Our medical staff, they didn't think anybody thought it was
going to be an issue. He had his glasses on all through the morning and he
went to put his contacts in and he was just really struggling, struggling to
get his contacts in to see.  
  
I think they tried a variety of different things, medications and ice and
cleaning the lenses and all those things. And just, in the second half he
tried to warm up at halftime and just said he couldn't go.  
  
I think the other question you asked was did I ever think we were going to get
-- yeah, the whole time. As a coach that's what you think. Our staff worked
like crazy since Sunday to try and prepare a plan that our guys could execute
to win the game.  
  
And so when you're down double figures, you're searching for things to do. And
without Rap out there, we had to make some changes on the fly. But it also
gave us some advantages because they had -- with forwards and centers on our
guards. So it allowed us to drive a little bit more and create some passing
lanes and some ball screens/switching opportunities that, to be honest, we
don't usually use.  
  
And our guys stepped up and played great. They played their hearts out and
they made some shots. And again you're just trying to continue to hang in
there, hang in there, hang in there, and hope that you can get enough stops
and make enough shots down the stretch to steal a game like that.  
  
Q. Eight years now at Colgate. You've taken these incremental steps:
conference championship last year; you win the conference championship; you
get here this year. Can you call it a program now and a new culture in
Hamilton and at Colgate based on what's been going on and are you ready to
make the next step now in another year?  
COACH LANGEL: Yeah, I mean, our goal every step of the way -- I've been
fortunate to have a staff with me most of that whole time. And we've got
another assistant coach who played for us. So he's been with us most of the
time, is we're just trying to constantly get better. And so that goes to every
aspect of what we do, whether it's helping our players get better, our
recruiting efforts, whatever it may be. I'm really proud of how Colgate and
Hamilton rallied around. They're two really small communities. You're talking
a couple thousand people.  
  
And for them to show up here in Columbus like they were able to, it means a
lot to me personally. I do feel good about the program we've built. And I told
the seniors in our locker room, as they were exiting, they don't get to put
the uniform on anymore, but they should be really proud and hopefully will be
for some time of the program that they've helped build.  
  
And I hope -- one of my goals when I got here was that Colgate basketball
would become generational; that guys who wore the uniform in the '70s and '80s
and '90s would want to know these guys, and these guys, as they move forward,
would want to come back and follow the team and be a part of our program,
because to me that's what makes it special.  
  
Q. I don't know if bittersweet is the right word, but the moment for
Jordan afterward, he fights to the end of the game, makes those two 3s, and if
immediately goes to his family there. What was your kind of perspective on
that moment and did you have a chance to kind of say anything to him?  
COACH LANGEL: No. I didn't get to -- obviously you've been around our team for
a few days here. Jordan's a talented individual. And he's driven in a lot of
ways. And one of those things that drives him is his love for his family and
their love for him.  
  
I feel really good that I get to coach, not just Jordan, but a lot of guys who
come from those backgrounds, who their families give them to us to be their
Colgate basketball family for a little bit. And as important as that is to the
guys on our team, their families are always number one. And I think that's the
way life should be. Not everybody gets to have that opportunity. And it's
special in Jordan. It's a big part of who he is.  
  
But the same goes for just about everybody else on our team. So I feel very
fortunate to coach guys like that who have those relationships and care so
deeply about their loved ones.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Washington - 78, Utah State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington head coach Mike Hopkins and student-
athletes Jaylen Nowell and Noah Dickerson. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: Proud of our guys. We came out in the first half and Utah State
hit us in the face early. And our guys showed a lot of poise. David got us on
the board with his first 3. And then we were able to settle down about the
six-minute mark.  
  
And I thought our defense was really, really good especially on Sam Merrill.
He's one of the best players in the country. We had to make sure we limited
him. And I think he was scoreless in the first half, which was a big part of
our halftime lead.  
  
And obviously, offensively, in the first half, Noah Dickerson. When he's on,
he's one of the best big guys if not the best back-to-the-basket big guy in
the country. We shared the ball.  
  
And then second half, guys, they came out like any championship team as Utah
State, great coach, great players, they came right back. In this thing,
there's so many different swings. And they cut the game all the way to one.
Defensively, you know, we hold them to 26 percent, 30 from 3 and 81 from the
foul line. But they went to the foul line 16 times.  
  
But it's our defense, guys. When we're playing defense, high level, sometimes
our defense is our best offense. And we took every swing that they got and we
stayed poised and we stayed together and we came out with a win. Very proud of
these guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Jaylen, all the players in here yesterday were talking with such
respect for their top scorer. What did you guys do to limit him?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, first off, Sam is a really good player. And we really
just made sure that wherever he was we had everyone know where he is. We were
talking. Every time he made a backdoor cut, every time he cut behind our
defense, we made sure we knew exactly where he was. That's kind of how we were
able to hold him to ten points.  
  
Q. Noah, were there any panic feelings when obviously your team was in
foul trouble there and your rhythm was broken up by that as well as your usual
rotation heading down the stretch?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Not at all. In practice we have so many different lineups, and
it's the next guy up, next-guy-up mentality. Jamal came in here, did what he
had to do. And Naz came in, gave us great minutes. And we are a great team and
we all do it together.  
  
Q. You just won a game in March Madness, not everybody gets to do. How
does it feel?  
NOAH DICKERSON: It feels really good actually. When I was a little kid I used
to watch this tournament all the time hoping one day I would have a chance to
play in it. And now I do. And it's just special, a special opportunity.  
  
Q. Jaylen, teams always look different. You can watch them on video all
you want. But once the game actually starts and the reality sets in as to what
they are, it becomes a different game. What did you see in the first five
minutes as you guys initially struggled that was much different than what you
suspected it would be when you were just watching on video?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, they played a lot more physical than we thought they did.
They came out, like Coach said, they really punched us in the mouth with their
physicality. We were stunned by that, but we made sure that -- we just made
sure that we were able to continue to keep playing as hard as we can. And when
they pushed us, we just have to push back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You obviously were looking at video of Utah State much more lengthy
than the players were, but what did you notice?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, at the end of the day, I've got to give our staff an
incredible amount of credit. These guys watched more film. They were so
prepared and ready for these guys. And these kids, it goes back to executing
your game plan. So when you see a guy like Sam Merrill, who -- he can shoot
it, he can pass it, he's intelligent. They're so well-coached. Their ball
movement is as good as anybody in the country. They've got shooters -- Brock
Miller, every time he got the ball I was a nervous wreck over there. He's just
an incredible shooter.  
  
And then Queta, what can you say about him? He's one of the best players in
the country that nobody knows about, and everybody knows about him tonight.  
  
And so we knew the challenge was going to be very, very difficult. And we were
able to just shut them down as much as possible. And Jaylen had said, and
Noah, we try to prepare them for anything, anything that they might come at us
with. And for us, we're a good team when everybody participates.  
  
And it's been a different guy every night. Today Naz Carter hit two big 3s
when the game was tight. And he's prepared. He works. And Jamal Bey had to
come in; we lost our point guard for the last eight minutes. They're pressing.
We haven't been the best team against pressure.  
  
And just so proud of the guys, because they were ready. They were together.
And they were poised.  
  
Q. Thybulle picked up his fourth foul. Was there hesitation as to what
to do there?  
COACH HOPKINS: Had to get him back in. He makes the game different for
anybody, and when you play against a team that has great ball movement, and
they get good offensive rhythm, you're going to be in trouble. And he disrupts
rhythm. He disrupts offensive rhythm. You gotta think about him everywhere
when he's on the court; he's blocking, he's stealing. I think he's the
national defensive player of the year. And when he's on the court there's a
different air of confidence with our defense. And just happy he was able to
stay out and not get his fifth foul.  
  
Q. And hit a big shot?  
COACH HOPKINS: And hit a huge shot.  
  
Q. How does your first tournament win at Washington compare to the first
one you had as an assistant at Syracuse?  
COACH SMITH: As a player or a coach at Syracuse?  
  
Q. As a coach.  
COACH HOPKINS: As a coach at Syracuse, my first year was '95-'96. We went to
the national championship game against Kentucky. And it was one of those
things as a coach your first time doing it. And getting that first feeling.
And when you're trying to build a program to where we were and where we want
to be, it's not only great for the seniors that stayed with it and have showed
the way for the underclassmen, but it's a way for the underclassmen, the next
one up, to feel the excitement and feel the crowd and to see what it's like to
play in the greatest sporting event on planet earth.  
  
And it's a feeling you never want to give away. And so this elevates where we
want to be. We didn't come here to get in the NCAA Tournament. The greatest
thing that makes this great tournament is you have a chance to win a national
championship. It doesn't matter if you're a 16. Doesn't matter if you're a 15.
Doesn't matter if you're a 14. You have a chance to win a national
championship.  
  
And I think -- I know our standard is going to be that's what we fight for.
That's what we do, when we're in the trenches, on the rowers, when we're
riding those hills and trying to build a team, that's who we are. And I'm just
excited to get that win and show those guys if we execute and we play together
we can accomplish anything.  
  
Q. You mentioned Noah being one of the better back-to-the-basket type
players when he's on. Early in the game he did get going. Was that by design
or was that something that kind of grew organically, I guess, within the game
plan?  
COACH HOPKINS: A week ago -- if you watched him last year when we played
Arizona with Deandre Ayton, he had 28 and whatever, the thing this year and
where he's sacrificed, where he's made us better is teams are double- and
triple-teaming him. He sacrificed a lot for the betterment of the team.  
  
And tonight they played him man-to-man. Early they doubled and we capitalized
on it because he's a great passer if he's willing to. And he did.  
  
And then when they played him man-to-man he's a problem. And having that
option, that weapon down there, he's hard to guard. And we're lucky to have
him on our team, I can tell you that. So, yes, by design. We play inside/out.  
  
Q. When Utah State cut it within a point, I thought Carter hit two
really big 3-pointers. Was that kind of by design, or he just had open
looks?  
COACH HOPKINS: At the end of the day, what was going to happen, we knew --
they do a great job of packing the paint. They're one of the best two-point-
field-goal percentage defensive teams in the country. They go in the boxes and
elbows.  
  
We knew they would double team. We knew we would get open shots if we were
patient and we moved the ball. And then it comes down to -- sometimes coaches,
in press conferences, we didn't make shots tonight. Well, we made them
tonight. Like you said, I thought that was a big part of the game, the two 3s,
and he stepped in, wide-open shots, and that's when we're at our best. Those
are the shots we make when we make 3s.  
  
So it was the unselfish passing and guys looking for each other. And Naz
Carter is probably one of the hardest workers on our team. And to see him have
those moments was pretty special.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't like to talk about yourself, but can you give us
one example how this experience is different than being an assistant coach in
a big game like this?  
COACH HOPKINS: Do you see my hairline? I lost a lot of real estate the last
two years and a lot of sleep. But you know what, listen, I've dreamt my whole
life of being in this position. When you dream it and you get an opportunity,
it's special, can't lie to you. But I've always believed and surrounded myself
with great people. My mom and dad stressed that my whole life. I did that with
Jen, Shaundell, the University of Washington, and coach kids I love to coach,
and just trying to give them everything I know and try to learn more to give
them more. And that's what it's all about. That's what makes college
basketball coaching so special. All these moments and then dreams do come
true.  
  
Q. They say the 18 inches you move over in a chair is the biggest 18
inches in sports, would you agree?  
COACH HOPKINS: I don't know. I've been a basketball coach my whole life. I
think that's the easy part. It's the organization, running a business, it's
doing all those things. Basketball, I get there, I'm a nervous wreck before I
go out there. When I go out there, I roll up my sleeves; I feel like I'm
playing. I've got four coaches and a staff that feel like they're playing,
too. We're aligned and we're together, and that's what makes it special. It's
just been an incredible run, and there's more to come.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Iowa - 79, Cincinnati - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Cincinnati head coach Mick Cronin and student-
athletes Trevon Scott and Justin Jenifer. Questions?  
  
Q. Justin, that moment walking off the floor, Coach Cronin grabbed you
and Cane and gave you a big hug, looked like. How tough of a moment, I guess
how thankful of a moment are you to share that with your head coach?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: I'm very appreciative. Everything that I've done throughout my
four years here is devoted to Coach. Like I said previously, he done stayed on
me all four years no matter what it was, if it was off the court or on the
court. Like I said, I'm very appreciative of what he has done for me.  
  
Q. Justin, you're up 18-5. At some point they switch to a zone. How much
did that affect you guys?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: We knew that coming into the game. We knew that we was going
to start off at man and they were going to go to zone. So we were prepared for
that. Some shots didn't go in and that's part of the game.  
  
Q. Tre, how much did foul trouble on Naz take you out of what you wanted
to do in the first half there and the second half as well?  
TREVON SCOTT: It affected us a lot. But in my opinion, it was plenty of games
where we had to go to different lineups like that and we came out successful.
So that's what's so frustrating about the loss. We didn't get it done today
like we usually do.  
  
But if Naz, if he would have fought through, played smarter, stayed in, I
don't know the outcome of the game would have been different. But he played
hard. He was trying. We just came up short.  
  
Q. Justin, once the three-quarter pressure, half-court pressure kind of
picked up, you guys were getting shots much later in the shot clock. Was that
a direct result of that pressure or was it something that you were trying to
do in the first half?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Well, we was told to attack. When somebody presses you you're
supposed to attack, not lay back. It was like a 50/50. Sometimes we attacked
and sometimes we just laid back. And when we laid back it involved turnovers
and led to layups. And that was a big piece to the game. And that was a big
turn to them getting the lead.  
  
Q. You had such a great year. In some ways an unexpected year from
outsiders. To have an early NCAA exit, can you describe what that feels like
right now?  
TREVON SCOTT: It's tough. A lot of people doubted us. A lot of people said we
probably wouldn't have got to where we are at today. But we stayed together.
We had a great head man right here, Coach Cronin, in front of us, listening.  
  
But it's tough going out. Every team has goals and this was not part of our
goals. But the toughest part of it is losing Justin and Cane. We owe
everything this whole season to these guys. I appreciate you for everything.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Love you, bro.  
  
TREVON SCOTT: Love you, too, bro. It's just frustrating.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: I'd say it's tough. I didn't picture that we were going to
lose this game today. I pictured my senior year still going on. But you know
at the end of the day, you know, it happened.  
  
And I couldn't be more proud of the guys even though that was with me through
the whole way. And as long as they believed in me I believed in them and
that's what makes us such a family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach. You can make a statement.  
  
COACH CRONIN: I would like to congratulate Iowa. I thought that -- you know,
they were a Top 25 team most of the year. Obviously Fran's a friend of mine.
Whatever happened, happened. He had to miss a few games. That threw them off.  
  
They got a great coach. And I have nothing but tremendous respect for them and
their program and the way they do things. So I think it's important to make
sure that I point that out.  
  
So as far as today's game, guys, we're not going to win when we give up 79
points. I don't remember the last time Cincinnati has won a game where we've
given up 79. Some of you guys might be able to research it. Now, they're a
great offensive team. Somebody referenced it earlier, in the plus/minus, we're
plus-12 in the 20 minutes Nysier Brooks played.  
  
We didn't have the depth on the front line, obviously, to deal with their guys
on the interior. I thought that was probably the biggest difference in the
game, if you're going to ask me what the difference in the game was.  
  
Second thing is I thought we took some questionable shots that are out of
character for us. We played and got into -- got the game going at a pace that
we couldn't set our defense enough. And we got a little too concerned with our
offense. And whether it was their zone, their pressure or whatever the case
may be, we got our mind off of defense.  
  
We gave up a 3 on an out-of-bounds play. We're first or second in the country
in out-of-bounds defense. We usually are every year. We have to be because
we're not running around with lottery picks.  
  
So last thing I would say is you heard these guys talk. So that's what I'm
most proud of. You listen to Justin, I knew who he was four years ago. I've
done my job -- sit here listen him talk like that.  
  
Tre is unbelievable as well. Great kids. We had an unbelievable season. Had a
tremendous season. Obviously tough situation to have to play a team that was
ranked in the Top 25 in the first round more weeks than we were. And we won
our conference championship.  
  
But again I'm just a believer that the tournament's about winning it anyway.
You've got to win six to win it. So I would have the same thoughts if we lose
game 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  
  
Q. Did you think your guys didn't attack that zone enough --  
COACH CRONIN: I do not think offense had anything to do with our demise. We
shot -- I thought we shot too many 3s five, six feet behind the line. We did
take some shots that I thought were questionable.  
  
I don't think it was their zone that caused it. I think it was decisions by
us. And, again, it's a get-it-done world. We talked a lot about not taking the
bait on those shots and making sure that we threw one more pass and got them
in the closeout and try to beat them off the dribble.  
  
We didn't do a good enough job on that. But, again, they shot 54 percent for
the game, almost 55 percent. So we had some egregious errors defensively. We
let some of our offensive -- we won games we shot 26 percent from the field at
SMU.  
  
So stuff happens on offense. But I thought we let it affect our defensive
energy. But we did take some questionable shots.  
  
Q. Other than Brooks being on the bench at the end of the first half,
was there anything you saw that helped them close that lead going into
halftime?  
COACH CRONIN: We weren't going to shut them out. I think you've got to give
credit to people. I thought they made a few shots where they drove the paint,
stopped, pivoted two or three times and made a tough play.  
  
Obviously you can't converge too much because they've got shooters running
around the line. Those are hard plays. They made a few of those -- I think,
Bohannon's shot at the end of the half was a great example. Made another one
in the second half where he pivoted two or three times. I thought he drug his
pivot foot. Of course I'm going to think that; I'm the opposing coach. The
film will tell me whether I'm right or not. They're a great offensive team for
a reason. They have been all year.  
  
Q. You win 28 games. You win the conference tournament championship. But
you will be judged, and you know this, by what happened today. Do you have any
comment on that?  
COACH CRONIN: I judge -- just so you know -- I'm judged by the guys who were
sitting up here, that's who -- that's my concern.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about not taking these tournament appearances
for granted, and your first appearance being here in Columbus. So as a coach,
a coaching staff, where do you go from here after, like you said, another
season where you win a conference but an early exit?  
COACH CRONIN: Back to work -- with a lot of pride, by the way. Back to work
with a lot of pride.  
  
Q. You obviously knew that Garza could shoot the ball. Were you
surprised they went to him as much as they did, especially when they were
down?  
COACH CRONIN: Not in the low post, I wasn't.  
  
Q. Outside?  
COACH CRONIN: A couple of the 3s that he made were pretty deep. I mean we
talked about he would shoot it -- I think he made 19 on the year. So, I mean,
we talked about he would shoot it if we didn't guard him out there.  
  
But his size, obviously, bothered us in the low post. He's a guy, if he
catches it deep -- I told our guys he's like the two big guys for Portland and
Denver in the pros; may not jump high, but he can really use his body and
hands around the basket and get it in.  
  
Q. Question about the crowd. Obviously playing so close to home, what
did you think of it --  
COACH CRONIN: We have great fans. Not a surprise at all. Appreciate all of
them. Hope everybody gets home safe. They've been great all year. I think we
were sold out season tickets this year. We have great support in our program.  
  
Q. You talked all week about wanting -- about you would love to take big
shots above anything else. And then yesterday you talked about watching Iowa
hit 3s on film. When they started hitting the second half, was that kind of
all those --  
COACH CRONIN: We had two minute breakdowns. Those are things you can control.
We didn't control that. So at the end of the day I take responsibility for
that.  
  
There were some things that we did -- I'm not going to mention names of guys
-- but we just had breakdowns. We fell asleep on some guys. The thing about
our defense is we're supposed to be in the passing lane. So if you help, the
guy has to go backdoor. We don't give up direct passes out for the 3. So that
was the breakdown.  
  
And we fell asleep on that out-of-bounds play, and we fell asleep just to let
Jordan Bohannon shoot one in our face. But they put 40 minutes of offensive
pressure on your defense. At the end of the day our defense wasn't good enough
today.  
  
Q. Anything you said to Justin and Cane there at the end that you're
willing to share?  
COACH CRONIN: I challenged those guys this summer when we started up. And
whenever our eight weeks started in the summer, I challenged them that there's
a difference between getting on the bus and getting on the bus to make sure
your team wins.  
  
And I don't think -- I learned this from my dad years ago as a high school
coach: you're never going to win with bad seniors. It's never going to happen.
Your seniors have got to be bought in, whether they're role players, scorers,
defenders, whatever, they've got to be the guys. And so I put the heat on them
and they met the challenge.  
  
I put the heat on them now in the summer because obviously they were just
getting on the bus. And their desire to win to make sure that this program did
not drop off, that we kept winning games, we did things the right way, all the
things I ask veteran guys to do on our team that Gary Clark and Kyle did the
year before; they did it all. They did everything I asked of them.  
  
So I just told them I loved them. Obviously they're not the most talented
players in the world. Okay? Cane got recruited by Sacred Heart. Justin is my
size. When I'm hugging guys that are almost my size, it tells you. For those
guys, they accomplished -- what their team accomplished would not have
happened if they weren't totally all in this year. That's been a trademark of
our program, from Justin Jackson and guys like Sean Kilpatrick, back further
and further.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 88, Iona - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iona head coach Tim Cluess and student-athletes
E.J. Crawford, Rickey McGill and Asante Gist. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH CLUESS: I want to congratulate North Carolina on the win. A hard-fought
game. Our guys were really excited to play in this game, and I'm really proud
of the effort that they put out and how hard they played for 40 minutes.  
  
I'm going to miss Rickey McGill a lot. We've gone through a lot over the last
four years, and I can't tell you how proud I am of him. And I'm also very,
very proud of the other two gentlemen up here, plus the rest of my team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Rickey, could you talk about that first half, the way you guys came
out?  
RICKEY MCGILL: We just came out ready to play. We knew they was going to come
out and try and get a win over us, try and beat us by a lot. So for us to come
out like the way we did, that was a big one. And then things changed.  
  
Q. Rickey, obviously last year a 16 beat a 1. How much was that on your
mind, especially after the first half, as well as you played?  
RICKEY MCGILL: We definitely had confidence with that. We all know UMBC beat
Virginia by 20. We came out, tried to prove the world the same thing, tried to
get the upset.  
  
Q. E.J., seemed like North Carolina tried to change their defense in the
second half to try to clog the middle, you were getting frustrated going down
the lane. And they put a lot more energy on their offense. What changed in the
second half?  
E.J. CRAWFORD: They just made an adjustment on me. And that's really what they
did, made an adjustment, yeah.  
  
Q. Rickey, Coach Williams was in here saying some nice things about you.
What did he and what did some of the North Carolina players say to you on the
handshake line?  
RICKEY MCGILL: They were just telling me, heck of a game. You're going to be
something special. Just keep going, don't ever quit.  
  
Q. Looked like a very emotional moment when you walked off the court for
Iona the last time. Your encounter with Coach Cluess, what was that like?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Like he said, me and him have been through so much, through
practice, through the arguments, through everything. I'm going to miss playing
for him. Just miss playing -- just miss playing for a great coach.  
  
Q. Rickey, just overall, the memories of four years, four NCAA
Tournaments, when you look at your legacy on this program, how do you feel you
were ultimately defined?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just one of the hardest workers to ever come out of Iona. Not
to sound cocky or nothing, but from where I came from as a freshman to now
just shows how much I care about this game.  
  
Q. Rickey, how much of the idea playing in your final NCAA Tournament
contribute to your performance tonight, and what has these last four years
meant to you being at Iona?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Tonight, I just knew I had to give my all, all or nothing for
40 minutes. I knew I couldn't give up on my guys. I had to come out, give it
my all, try and get a win. For the last four years it's just a blessing. It's
just a blessing, man.  
  
Q. Asante, as you prepared for this game and saw videotape, how
unrealistic is that once you actually see the length of a team like
Carolina?  
ASANTE GIST: It was an adjustment for us. Our confidence is not like that. To
go against a team, they were packing the lane on us. It was difficult to
drive. Coach told us to move the ball. And we were going to get attack lanes
after a couple of passes.  
  
And it worked for us in the first half. And second half it worked for us, too,
we just couldn't make some shots and we couldn't get back in transition. And
they killed us on the boards; that was a big thing as well.  
  
I'm still proud of my guys how we played and I'm proud of us for the season we
had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What do you say about the team's effort in the first half on both
ends of the court?  
COACH CLUESS: It was terrific. I wish we could have done it for two halves. I
think they gave it everything they could on both ends of the court. In the
first half, couldn't have asked for anything more.  
  
Q. Second half, looked like North Carolina changed their defense. They
clogged the middle when Crawford would go down the lane, and they were just
much more aggressive on offense. Was there anything you could do or was it
just something you see happening?  
COACH CLUESS: You need to make shots. We had a lot of open looks. And I
couldn't ask for better shots. They didn't fall tonight. Some of our better
shooters, especially in the second half, missed wide-open shots.  
  
But on the other end they started playing on all cylinders and they started
attacking the rim much harder, got down the court in hurry. Tajuan Agee being
in foul trouble most of the game obviously was a hindrance to us because we
don't have a luxury of having a lot of depth and that really hurt us as well.
And all credit to North Carolina. They're a great team.  
  
Q. What did you say to Rickey when you took him out? And if you can, how
much did he mean to this program over four years? What are you going to miss
about him?  
COACH CLUESS: I thanked him for the four years and through everything we've
been through, watch his development. And I told him I'm there for him the rest
of his life, no matter what he needs, on or off the court, to help him out.  
  
He's meant a tremendous amount to our program over these last four years. He's
going to be the model when we bring players in and recruit players that I want
to use, how somebody came in not highly recruited, really didn't do much as a
freshman, and built himself up to the level he did and was part of four
championship teams and four NCAA teams.  
  
So what better way to, like, talk about a program and a team except using
Rickey McGill as an example?  
  
Q. I know in the past you told your guys don't die wondering. And they
don't have to wonder for the rest of their lives how they would have done. How
do you feel they did that?  
COACH CLUESS: I think they gave us everything they have. No one's going to say
this, but E.J. Crawford's had the flu for the last two days. Just the fact he
was out there playing was tremendous by him to come out and try to give us
what he could. He wasn't able to practice yesterday and that hurt our team.
And I feel bad for him because he's worked so hard.  
  
But they have nothing at all to be ashamed about. They should have their heads
high. Like I told them, we're extremely proud of what they did this year.
Iona's extremely proud of it. And hopefully anyone who watched us play enjoyed
what they saw.  
  
THE MODERATORK: I know you didn't have the second half that you wish you had,
but as you will look back on that tape for years to come, you'll see how hard
they were still playing in the second half. It's been a great story for us to
follow. Thank you.

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Jordan Bone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34947)

### [Jordan Bowden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34991)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 77, Colgate - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee head coach Rick Barnes and student-
athletes Jordan Bone and Jordan Bowden. Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Jordan Bone, how were you able to keep your composure when they were
making a bunch of shots and everybody in the arena was rooting for Cinderella?
How were you able to not panic?  
JORDAN BONE: I want to say first this was a really good team. They fought
super hard. And we couldn't appreciate that honestly any more.  
  
I feel like this team was prepared to come into this game. I feel like we
understood going into the game that it was going to be tough, understanding
that especially this time of the year is very important, it's very critical --
and towards when we understood that it was going to be a tight game.  
  
We just wanted to put them in long possessions, make them guard a little
longer and just execute what we do. We know we've been in tougher positions
earlier this year. So the key thing is just never get rattled, understand how
hard we worked to get to this point, so there's no reason to get rattled, but
more importantly just executing our game plan.  
  
Q. What made Jordan Burns so difficult to guard today?  
JORDAN BOWDEN: He was hitting tough shots. We tried to limit his touches down
to the end. And we had good defense on him -- Lamonté Turner was playing good,
tight defense on him. He was just hitting tough shots. And that's what we
tried to do.  
  
Q. Do you think a game like this, instead of having just a blowout in
the first game, could serve you well as the tournament progresses?  
JORDAN BONE: Absolutely. Like I mentioned earlier, they put up a tough fight.
This wasn't an easy game. We knew that it was going to be like that going into
this game. I feel like they prepared us well for our upcoming game against
Iowa.  
  
So we just have to understand, going into the Iowa game, it's going to be
another tough matchup. It's going to be very similar. And we have to execute
our game plan.  
  
Q. Coming down the stretch, nine of your last 10 opponents were NCAA
Tournament teams. How much do you think that helped you guys prepare for the
kind of competition you were going to see this month? Nine of the last 10
teams you played were NCAA Tournament teams. Just playing that kind of
schedule at the end of the year, how do you think that's helped you guys?  
JORDAN BOWDEN: It helped us a lot. We've been in tough battles the whole year.
A team like Colgate, like Bone said, they prepared us for Iowa. And
(indiscernible) just about us executing the game plan and doing what we do.  
  
Q. Could you describe what the emotions are like when you're playing
against Cinderella and everybody is rooting for them and against you?  
JORDAN BONE: I feel like there wasn't much emotions. We were excited to play.
I feel like on our end there was a lot of anxiety towards the beginning of the
game. We were kind of just ready to play because we didn't like the way we
ended the season and the championship game against Auburn.  
  
So we were all just ready to go out there and compete. We were very anxious. I
feel like the emotions, we've learned to put that to the side. We've learned
in many tough games, exciting games, as you would say, it's more about if
intensity over the emotion, intensity being just doing your job at a very high
level. So I feel like there wasn't a lot of emotion, there was just a lot of
anxiety towards the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. What do you say, because those guys played their hearts out as you
did, what do you say to those guys at the end of the game? This is the biggest
game they'll ever play?  
JORDAN BONE: Absolutely, man. Like I mentioned earlier, we just appreciate
those guys for coming to fight. It wasn't an easy game. Just shaking their
hands, I was just like great game, man, keep your head up. Way to fight. Way
to fight.  
  
Just a wonderful lesson, just to compete day in, day out. That's what this
game is about, just competing and enjoying the game.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the 3 you hit, maybe four minutes left or
so from the right wing, obviously they had been playing off for a while. What
did that mean and what gives you the confidence to keep taking those?  
JORDAN BONE: Well, the entire coaching staff does an amazing job to give us
confidence to take those open shots. We've learned in tougher situations this
year that we have to work our game plan, we have to play towards our strengths
and when we do get the ball wide open we do have to shoot the ball with
confidence.  
  
So that's just a wonderful job by our coaches to give us the confidence to
take those shots. And I shot it with confidence and it worked in our favor.  
  
Q. Admiral had not been shooting well. He hits those 3s late. Grant, you
weren't able to get him involved a lot, has the big block. What about those
two guys and some of the plays they made late?  
JORDAN BONE: With Admiral, he's been in many games this year where he's
knocked down tough shots, big-time shots in a critical moment. And he did that
today.  
  
With Grant, I feel like it was kind of tough for him to get into the flow of
the game earlier. I'm not really sure what it is. But he kind of found his way
towards the second half, he started making the right plays, and we trust him
to do that. So we put the ball in his hand and he made those right passes,
made the right plays.  
  
More than that, it's just trusting those guys because at the end of the day
we're not the team that we are today without Admiral and Grant. So just
understanding that we have to give those guys the ball because we trust them
to make the plays, and they did that down the stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BARNES: I think a game like today is what makes the NCAA Tournament the
NCAA Tournament. You get a group of guys from a league where -- I'm looking
out at my good friend, John Feinstein, you did a book or writing a book about
the Patriot League -- and he told me, what's great about that league is you've
got a group of guys who just love to play basketball.  
  
That's what it looked like today. They earned the right here. And what can you
say about Jordan Burns? He was terrific. Looked like he had a magnet on that
ball.  
  
But I thought they played really hard. We were -- and what Jordan said, I said
to the guys at halftime -- I thought we were anxious. I thought we were
showing too much anxiety.  
  
I think some of it goes to a year ago, we came in here -- and we talked to the
team about it last night -- when we had that big lead against Wright State, I
told the coaches when we started out the way we did, I said, this is not good
because I thought our guys just thought it was going to be that way.  
  
When they came back and got back in the game, they were daring us to shoot it
early. I didn't think we worked hard enough in the game to put the ball
inside. I didn't think Grant really fought for his positioning.  
  
But I did think we were good defensively. And I don't want to take anything
away from Colgate because I thought those guys played their hearts out. But to
get through this tournament you're going to have games like this. And
mentioned the crowd; we've been in big arenas. I don't think the noise of the
crowd is going to bother us.  
  
I do think that at the end of the game, we tried to get some movement back
into where guys know where their shots are going to come from. Like the shot
-- the play that Grant ran today at the end for Admiral's last 3 was the exact
same play we ran at Florida to win the game down there.  
  
And I thought the guys knew where they were going to be able to step in and
shoot the ball and they did it with confidence. Again, you've got to love
Colgate and what they do. And it was kind of what I thought they would do.  
  
I told the guys last night, don't expect it to be easy. Even if we get up,
which we did. And they fought back. We were really, some uncharacteristic
things that we did with our body language and things that we haven't done all
year. And that's where I know that there was some anxiety with our guys.  
  
But we were able to get it done you never take a win in the NCAA for granted
ever. The fact we got it done is we had to do -- we had to do that a couple
different times this year -- and Jordan Bone said it, they stayed with it.
They knew what they had to do and they did it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You touched on it already. You sat there yesterday and predicted the
exact same thing, that they would pack it in dare you guys to settle. How
frustrating was it to see them continue to jack up the 3s and not work it
inside?  
COACH BARNES: It's frustrating because we know what it's done to us in all
five of our losses. But we don't mind taking them if it's in the flow of what
we're doing. It's just when we settle and we did that too much, too early.  
  
Q. Regarding Jordan Burns, what was most impressive about his
performance tonight? Is there a moment that's going to stick with you?  
COACH BARNES: He's better in person than on tape, I can tell you that. You
knew he was the kind of guard that controls the ball very well. He goes right
a lot, and as hard as you try to keep him from doing that, he still mixes it
up.  
  
He's got a quick release. We were switching on some ball screens and he took
advantage of driving guys down the lane. And he's a good basketball player. He
really is. But they have a good team.  
  
The second half, I thought, one of their bigger players didn't get to play
much because I think he had an eye infection or something somebody told me.
That probably helped them in the long run because they could really spread you
out then.  
  
But they're really well-coached, well-coached team. I thought they played with
great composure, great poise, and they fought. And, again, that's what makes
this tournament what it is. And we were fortunate to get it done. But our guys
got it done. And that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Any message to Jordan Burns after the game?  
COACH BARNES: I told him he was terrific. I'd like to have him on our team
tomorrow. I shouldn't say that -- that might be called -- I didn't say that,
scratch that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: He's the kind of player you'd like to have.  
  
COACH BARNES: The kind of player. You've got to love a guy like that. And
you've got to love, I think he's from Texas because one of his former coaches
actually texted me today and -- a guy that worked for me at Texas -- and told
me that you're getting ready to play against one of my favorite players and
one of my favorite people.  
  
I don't know him, but for a guy that sent me that, I think it speaks volumes
because he wouldn't say that if it wasn't true. He was a star today, he really
was. He's been good for them all year.  
  
Q. Do you mind me asking who that coach is?  
COACH BARNES: Chris -- I'm drawing a blank on the last name. I'll give it to
you off my phone.  
  
Q. Bryce Drew was fired today. Do you have any reaction to that?  
COACH BARNES: Boy, it's tough, because you get to know these guys and you
realize how hard a job it is. And I've said it all year long. He had put
together a great recruiting class. A guy that he built the program around got
hurt five games into the season. The other guy didn't get to play -- I think
he missed most of the preseason. So right at the start of the year he had to
rechange everything he probably spent all summer last summer doing.  
  
But you hate to see it for someone that I respect as much as I respect Bryce.
And after three years, it's tough. And there's a lot of things that happened
to them this year that I think was out of his control, and in Darius Garland
going down, because they were a different team. I think he was rookie of the
week or player of the week the first couple weeks of the SEC season. And it's
tough. This business, after three years, it's very tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina student-athletes Cameron Johnson
and Kenny Williams. Questions.  
  
Q. How important has Garrison been this season for you guys? And when
did you kind of see him start to grow into what he's become, as consistent as
he's become?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: He's been huge especially in ACC play. He's been the anchor of
our defense. And the way he's played the ball screen has kind of made our
defense a lot stronger because they can't attack off the ball screen the way
the teams have somewhat in the past.  
  
So his growth on defensive end has been huge for us. And I think it was around
after Christmas break is when he really started to turn the corner and his
defense really took off.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: He also provides a bit of an offensive presence down low.
He's been finishing around the basket well. He's been doing a good job on both
ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Cameron, how do you buy the sentiment that you have to be playing
your best this time of the year? And although you might not have won the
conference tournament, you guys -- do feel like you're playing your best at
this time?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah, I think we're getting there. I think we've been
improving all year. So I think this is going to be the best products we put
out all year. But you have to. You have to or you'll go home. So there's a lot
more at stake. There's a lot more to play for right now. And you just gotta
embrace it and do your best.  
  
Q. Cameron, how is your health? You sat out Monday and Tuesday at
practice. Any update on that?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's good. It's March, everybody is feeling something. I'm
all right. My shin is a little sore coming off the ACC Tournament. And I'm
feeling pretty good now.  
  
Q. Did you practice?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah, I practiced the last two days.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Cameron is just old.  
  
Q. How much does playing in the ACC help you guys for preparing for the
NCAA Tournament?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Well, three of the four 1 seeds are ACC teams. We've been
playing against the best of the best all year. It's a demanding schedule. You
play a lot of good teams night in night out, so you can't really take weeks
off. So that definitely prepares you for something like this.  
  
Q. Cameron, your thoughts on Iona, a team that struggled the early part
of the year but is coming to this tournament having won 10 straight games?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: They've won 10 straight, like you said. They shoot the ball
well. They like to get up and down. They have some guys that like to score the
ball. So we're just going to have to play our game. We'll have to do what we
do. From everything we've seen on film they've got some guys that can do some
things pretty good.  
  
They've got a good guard in McGill and a guy that can score down low in Agee.
We've got to go out there and play our game and rebound and defend and do
everything that Coach wants us to do.  
  
Q. Kenny, a lot of people say that you have to have great guards to win
in a tournament like this, experienced guards for that matter. In what ways
other than he's a freshman, but in what ways would you say that Coby is
experienced?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: He's a player. He hasn't played like a freshman all season.
Coby has played in big games. We've had a lot of big games this year. He's had
big-game experience. I know March is different.  
  
But knowing him, it's not -- the moment isn't too big. He'll just go out and
play his game. And that's what I'll tell him tomorrow; just go out and be you
and play your game and we'll come out fine.  
  
Q. Roy's never lost a game in the first round. How does he get you stay
focused or get you guys prepared for a game like this, especially when you're
a No. 1 seed playing a 16 in a theoretically very lopsided matchup?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Coach is all about respecting everyone but fearing no one.
That's exactly what he told us. You step between those lines, especially in
March, you're going to get everybody's best shot. Everybody's playing for
their life. Everybody's playing for their season.  
  
So we have to take the same mindset. We can't go out there and overlook
anybody and think it's just going to be easy just because we're stepping out
there and just because we're North Carolina.  
  
So tomorrow we're just going to step out there and we're going to respect
them, but we're also going to play our games.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I'm just adding on to that. He emphasizes it. He emphasizes
we need to play hard and well. Iona has been in the tournament four years in a
row now, is what he told us. These guys, they're seniors.  
  
They've played in a handful of them. He emphasized that to us. And we've got
to go out there and play.  
  
Q. I'm curious about that experience with Coach Williams when he has
been in this situation so many times. Is he the type of coach that goes back
and says we had this type of game, we had this type of opponent, when we had
this team in '96 or '93 or whatever? Or is he a coach that's very much, we're
looking at the next game?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I think it depends on the situation. There will be times
where he'll bring up something that might have happened in the past, or
reference it. But most of the time he's kind of in the moment, kind of focused
on what the other team does, how we are going to attack them.  
  
And we've been watching film on Iona now and we've been preparing for them,
scouting them out, running against what they like to run on offense, defending
that. So we're pretty locked into this one. We know we can't get it any
further if we don't win this one.  
  
Q. Cam, you spoke about how this tournament run means a little more to
you because you weren't on the national championship squad from two years ago.
How much more motivation do you have going into this weekend?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I have a lot. I can't sit here and tell you that Kenny and
Luke don't have motivation. It's also their senior years, and obviously they
want to be part of something, especially like another Final Four run.  
  
But for me, personally, I've never been there. So I'm really excited for this
opportunity, to shine, to embrace it the best I can and make the most of it.  
  
Q. Kenny and Cam, to build on what you were saying before about how
seriously you take this, what did you think last year when Virginia lost to a
No. 16 seed? Did you watch it and what was your reaction to it?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: We were actually all watching it in our meeting room at the
hotel together. And it's just something that you don't really expect it,
especially with a team like Virginia.  
  
But we told each other, let's not let that be us. And so we wanted to focus in
a little bit more going into our game. But we all were shocked.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I'd say shocked was what it was. We were watching it in the
meeting room, like he said, and everybody was just, like, woah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead and start with a statement.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Same thing everybody else would say we're happy to be here,
thrilled to still be playing while some others are not. We had a good practice
this morning. A shoot-around is all we'll do this afternoon.  
  
Kenny, Luke and Cam have done a great job of leading our team, and Garrison,
Nassir and Coby, those guys have really done a great job for us helping the
seniors get from game to game. And Coby has been a scoring machine for us
several times and we've needed it every time, and he's been great and
listening to Cam, Kenny and Luke, and also understanding he's been pretty
doggone good himself.  
  
Q. What are you seeing from film on Iona? What are your impressions of
the team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Every time I hear the word "Iona" it reminds me of Jim
Valvano, "Iona College." He said, "you own a college?" You have to be old
enough for me and Feinstein; we remember that.  
  
But when I watched them, I watched them play against Monmouth in the finals of
the conference tournament. Tim Cluess, good guy, he was Danny Green's high
school coach, so I've known him a long time. Not trying to act like we're
bosom buddies or anything, but I thought he was a really good coach then;
think it even more so now.  
  
We watched a part of that championship game, even watched part of the
championship game last year when they played. But playing them, for us, we've
got to understand they'll have five guys outside the 3-point line a lot, and
all five guys can shoot the 3-point shot.  
  
Earlier in the year it was 40-something percent of the shots they took were
3-pointers. The last four or five games it's been over 50 percent. So we
realize we've got to get out on the floor and cover out there, that means Luke
Maye, and Garrison, those guys have to get out and cover the 3-point line.  
  
They do like to play at a fast pace but so do we. We understand that part of
it. Trying to cover them on the offensive end with the 3-point shot and free
throw line are two huge parts of their offense. And it's the easiest way for
to you get beat if you give them free shots at the foul line or free shots
from the 3-point shots. That's the biggest emphasis for us.  
  
Q. Roy, did Cam, his shins was that a wear-and-tear kind of situation?
Or did something happen last week in Charlotte and was holding him out of
practice a couple days just a precaution, or are you concerned?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I'm not concerned -- well, I'm concerned, yeah, but it's
not something I've laid awake at night kind of thing. Doug and Cam and the
doctors have looked at it, taken X-rays or whatever it is they do.  
  
And I think it just flared up last week. I don't know if it was one specific
incident that made it happen. But we thought it was good. He's 23 years old. I
held him out of shooting practice. I told him when you get to be 23 you get to
hold out of shooting practices.  
  
And yesterday he did almost everything. Today he did everything and doesn't
seem to have any problems. But you're talking about a guy who has probably
handled pain for a longer period of his life than any basketball player I've
ever been around. So he does a great job of that. But I fully expect that
he'll play the way he's been playing.  
  
Q. For Coby, a lot of people say you need experienced guards to make
deep runs. What makes Coby different than other freshmen guards in this
tournament? And when he's not on the floor how does that kind of change?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know what is different from other freshmen guards in
the tournament. But we've played 30-something games. We're 26-6 or 27-7,
something like that. So he's played 30, 35 games. We held him out of one game
because, I think it was his foot. I'm not sure. Can't even remember that long
ago.  
  
But I like scoring point guards. And Coby is a scoring point guard. He's a guy
that scored more points in high school basketball in the state of North
Carolina than anybody in history. So I'm not going to get him and say, okay,
you can't shoot. That would be sort of silly. And I do some silly things but
that's not one of them.  
  
He has the ability to put the ball in the basket. He's a good shooter and I
think will eventually be a great shooter. He can attack the basket really,
really well. He has no fear attacking the basket. He's better defensively than
anybody ever even thinks about. He's won our defensive player of the game I
think the second most of anybody on the team. Garrison's won it the most;
Coby's won it second most. And he's a complete all around player.  
  
The kids nowadays aren't like freshmen were 20 years ago. Kids nowadays are
freshmen, they've been everywhere. I can remember when I started coaching we
tell a kid you come here, we're going to take you to Hawaii once every four
years. Every high school player goes to Hawaii now. It's no big deal.  
  
But he's extremely gifted, extremely competitive, extremely good. He's really
a good player. And really good players, even in their freshman year, even if
you go back to Pervis Ellison or Michael Jordan or what, some freshmen have
done some great things in this tournament, and usually they did it in the
regular season as well.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the week that the teams that have either won
titles or made really deep runs have always had really good weeks of practice
before the tournament starts. Wondering how your guys were earlier this week.
And you've never lost in the first round. How do you keep guys --  
COACH WILLIAMS: If we lose, don't let me know where you live. (Laughter) If
that's perceived as a threat, it's true, okay? (Laughter).  
  
Q. How do you keep guys focused and engaged in a game like this where
you're theoretically a pretty heavy favorite?  
COACH WILLIAMS: First part of the question. The team that came to mind quickly
when I started thinking about that and talking about it, because we've had a
lot of teams that really got better as the season went along and played their
best basketball at the end, but was the '09 team because I could never
convince them you have to guard somebody; they sort of thought we would
outscore them.  
  
But those last three to four weeks of the season that year they really
concentrated hard on the defensive end of the floor and really got a lot
better.  
  
This team, we just finished practicing an hour and a half ago or something
like that and we had a really good practice this morning. That doesn't mean
they don't screw it up and make a mistake, but that's the game of basketball.
But I think our practices have been good this year. I think a lot of it is
because we push so much. But I think a lot of it is because with Luke and Cam
and Kenny they sort drag everybody else along. It's an experienced group that
does that.  
  
And I think you have to play well -- excuse me, practice well. I've never had
a good team that practiced sorry every day and then played great. I've never
had that. But I think this team has gotten better as we've practiced all year
long, and particularly I'd say the last couple of weeks we've shortened
practice a little bit and perhaps they've realized that and focused even a
little bit more, or just that they've gone out and done their work.  
  
Trying to get focused on playing against everybody, regardless of who you're
playing in your seed is something I've thought ever since the first day I
became a coach. And my first couple of years as an assistant we had some bad
memories of those first-round games. I remember over in Raleigh, Black Sunday,
us and Duke both lost when everybody thought we were going to win, playing
close to home.  
  
So I've always tried to focus on now we're in the tournament, but if you're
looking down the road -- and this is corny -- I tell our guys all the time, if
you're looking down the road at what might happen, that's usually where you're
going: Down the road back home. And we try to focus on just playing this next
game.  
  
And I guess somebody could use it as ammunition, but somebody asked me
something a day or two ago about the tournament, I couldn't even remember who
our pairing was in the second round. And I was being truthful. I got one of
the two teams right. I didn't get the other one right. Somebody could probably
use that. But it really is, that we're trying to get ready to play Iona. And I
tell the guys come on now, if we play well, maybe they'll let us stay around
and play another one. But I think the kids are experienced enough to
understand that part of it as well, too.  
  
Q. Was there a light bulb moment for Garrison, especially on the
defensive end that kind of got him playing as consistently as he has been
recently?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He was okay last year defensively, but I think at the start of
the season, you look and you have Luke and you have Kenny and you have Cam,
and what can they do? They can all three score.  
  
Kenny is good defensively. The other a little bit of a liability sometimes.
You look and you have Coby as a freshmen who can score. But you think, well,
freshmen can't defend. And you look at Nassir and say, well, freshmen can't
defend.  
  
I think he saw that, because he's very bright. He says I have a better niche
with this team if I do a good job on defensive so coach can count on me.  
  
And I think the other thing is when you praise somebody, reward them, they
tend to do the same behavior over again and even try to do it even better.  
  
So when we talk about how well he's doing defensively and how dependable he is
and everybody should thank him for covering up for your mistake, I think he
likes those kind of things.  
  
And I even think something as simple as grading the tape and listing who is
defensive player of the game, he likes to see his name go up there, as
everybody does. But I think he has bought into it. I want him to score every
basket around the basket. If he goes out and shoots 3s, the next horn you'll
see it will be him coming out, because that's not who he is. But he
understands that. And I am really, really proud of what he's done for our
team.  
  
Q. Have you seen any extra motivation from Cam being that he's the
senior that wasn't on the national championship team from two years ago?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm sure Kenny and Luke talked to him about it enough that
he's probably got that motivation. They live together. So they talk about the
greatest time of their lives, best three-week stretch in 2017 that he didn't
experience.  
  
But I think Cameron is a youngster who has really wanted to be successful and
has worked extremely hard. As I said earlier, I don't know of anybody that's
had as much pain as he's had during his college career.  
  
He's very -- I almost call him an old man. But he's very mature about
everything he does and looking at everything, looking at the big picture. So I
think he's hungry. But I wouldn't be surprised if those guys say some things
to him away from me. But I know he's personally really hungry himself.  
  
Q. Tennessee, of course, is here. I wanted to get your thoughts on the
job Rick's done with that job as they make their move here in the NCAA
Tournament.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Rick's a good friend, a really good coach. A guy that I enjoy
being around. We were in Maui together last year, I guess, and they started
out poorly. And they got better and better.  
  
We played them in Knoxville. He's a guy from Western North Carolina that I do
really enjoy. And I've watched his teams. And Williams and Schofield, those
guys, they get after you, competing on every possession.  
  
And I gotta think Rick pushes them to do that all the time. So I think he's
done a fantastic job. And he's one of those guys that, when I see him, I start
grinning, so that's a pretty good legacy, too.  
  
Q. To follow up on what you were saying before about how much more
experienced players are before they ever get to you. How does that affect your
dynamic? Is it always a good thing? Is it sometimes a bad thing?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, I think it's good to have a little new enthusiasm.
Sometimes I call it youthful exuberance. I think it's good to have that on
your team and not just be, oh, we've done this before kind of thing. But I
also like the old guys to understand how lucky we are that you're still doing
it; that we're back.  
  
I loved -- I really did -- the only ones we have are in-house cameras, but at
my house, when we were watching the Selection Show, when they announced North
Carolina as the No. 1 seed, put our name up there, they jumped up. And it was
spontaneous. And I'm not of their generation. I tell them I'm glad I'm not.
I'm three or four generations away.  
  
But I watch some teams being announced -- it's not a cut to the way some kids
do it -- but I saw teams jumping up and everybody had their phone in their
hand taking a picture of their frickin' self.  
  
Come on now. Sometimes it's got to be being excited about your group. This
group, old guys like Cam, Luke and Kenny, or the young guys, Nassir and Leaky,
Coby, they were genuinely pleased, enthusiastic about what went on. I like
that. It's not a cut against anybody else. It's just I really appreciate the
way our guys handled it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State student-athletes Neemias Queta, Sam
Merrill, Abel Porter and Quinn Taylor. Questions?  
  
Q. Quinn, I counted six different states and three different countries
on your roster. Everybody always talks about the locker room and how important
that is. Can you guys kind of -- how did you bring that all together and is it
still a work in progress or who is in charge of the music and what have you?  
QUINN TAYLOR: The cool thing about -- just playing basketball brings people
together that you'd never meet kind of outside of basketball. And we're
fortunate enough to have people from all over the U.S. and all over the world.
And I think just our love for the game has really brought us together.  
  
And I think generally we just rotate through who has the music in the locker
room. But it's just a brotherhood and people that I'll consider brothers for
the rest of my life.  
  
ABEL PORTER: As far as that goes, I think it's been pretty natural. Sometimes
you can feel a team forcing being friends, but I feel like this year it's been
really big that we establish a culture, kind of reestablish the culture of
family and togetherness at Utah State. And I feel like we've done that really
well. I feel like it's natural as we come together.  
  
SAM MERRILL: I think it's been incredibly helpful as far as developing the
chemistry. I think because we all come from so many different backgrounds, it
keeps us away from developing any type of clique or anything like that. When
we're hanging around it's everybody together not groups of three or groups of
four.  
  
And fortunately we have multiple of our American-born players are bilingual.
That's helped. I assume it's helped with our Portuguese players and it's been
a fun experience getting to know each other.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: We're a group of guys that love to play basketball, and the
love is the same. We all love to play basketball and we all love to play with
each other. And I think we're just a group of guys that just -- we're not
worried about anything. We just love playing with each other and that helps a
lot. We don't have much egos. We just love each other and we love playing
basketball. That's it. It's simple.  
  
Q. Neemi, growing up in Portugal, did you follow the NCAA Tournament?
And if so, now that you're here, is this a dream of yours? What's it like for
you to be here?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I've never followed it growing up. But last year, when I was
being recruited, I heard of it. And I saw it was pretty nice. It's really nice
being here and being a part of it. So I can't wait for it, and I hope we will
have a good game and get a win.  
  
Q. Sam, this group really -- you guys haven't been to the tournament. So
this is new for everybody. But at the same time is that kind of helpful
because you guys don't have to -- I don't know, maybe the pressure is not
there. And what's the feeling of the team now that you've been here, being
picked to finish ninth? We've talked about that a lot but maybe the
expectations were that you weren't going to be here?  
SAM MERRILL: Like we've talked about before, expectations preseason from those
around us weren't very high. But as a team we felt that we could really do
some damage. And we've always grown and grown throughout the season, but this
is obviously, hopefully, not a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some of us,
but it's something that you have to enjoy.  
  
I think our coaching staff and us as a team have done a good job this week of
not trying to worry about the outside stuff as far as the media and all the
excitement around it, but trying to focus on Washington and our game coming up
and our scouting reports and prep. And practices have been the same that
they've been all year.  
  
As far as mentally, I don't assume -- I don't anticipate that we'll come out
really nervous or jittery. Fortunately we got to play in our championship game
on Saturday in the Mountain West Tournament, and that felt like it was a big
game, too. So we did a pretty good job there. So hopefully we'll do a good job
tomorrow as well.  
  
Q. Matisse Thybulle might be one of the best defensive players you've
seen all year -- blocked shots, steals, averaging three and a half steals a
game. Sam, what do you see from him when you look at him defensively? And how
do you try to get around a player that has that kind of a skill set?  
SAM MERRILL: He's a great athlete. And I mean the report says that he's about
6'4", 6'5", but his arms, you can tell, watching film you can see how long and
how athletic. He does a great job anticipating passing lanes and blocking
shots from behind.  
  
So they have a lot of good athletes and guys with length in their zone. So
we're just going to have to play the way that we've played all year, and we do
that by sharing the ball, by moving the ball, by trying to be smart, high IQ
basketball players.  
  
And he's going to make some plays. That's what this tournament is about. And
the best players make plays. But hopefully we can minimize what he does by
moving the ball and by not letting the ball stick and by doing things the way
we've done things all year.  
  
Q. This is a good introduction to the rest of the nation for your
school. Can you describe a little bit about your school and what brought you
there?  
QUINN TAYLOR: For me personally, coming to Utah State, Utah State had a rich
tradition in basketball. And something that each -- I feel like each one of
us, when we got recruited they showed us videos of the Spectrum, where we play
our home games, and it's just a crazy atmosphere. And it's something that you
want to play at a school like that where you have the community behind you.  
  
And then also, for me, being that I was going to go on a mission for my church
and Utah State deals with that. So just going into that situation with the
coaching staff that understood that, that I was going to go for two years and
come back also helped me choose to attend Utah State. And I definitely made
the right choice, and I've loved it ever since.  
  
ABEL PORTER: Utah State, we're in Logan, Utah. And it's an awesome school if
you ever look up pictures. It's a really beautiful just environment to live in
up against the mountains. But besides that it's a really great academic
school. And, like he said, really good at basketball.  
  
They had some really good years in the past where the fan base was really
behind it, selling out almost every single game. And I think we all saw that
and kind of wanted to be a part of bringing it back. And I think that's what
brought a lot of us to Utah State.  
  
SAM MERRILL: I grew up a Utah State fan. Both of my parents graduated from
Utah State. So for me it was an easy choice to go play at Utah State. I felt
like it was the best fit both academically, basketball-wise, of course, and
just being close to family.  
  
But for those that have been following college basketball for a long time,
Utah State used to be a regular in this tournament. And like Abel said, it's
been a few years, but we're excited to be back and we're excited to represent
our school and our university. And hopefully we represent them well starting
tomorrow.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Utah State is a school that would be perfect for me because
they have passionate fans, good conditions, a good coaching staff and
everybody at the school cares about you. And I really wanted to go there.  
  
And having players like this working for me and helping me out, it's really
nice and having a good growth throughout the year with them is really nice.
And the fact that we made it here, it's really nice, too.  
  
Q. Quinn, you get a new coach your senior year. That can be challenging
or difficult. What's allowed this team to kind of have that seamless
transition to a new staff and have this kind of success?  
QUINN TAYLOR: Coach Smith in general, going into a coaching change, there's
always the unknowns. But just Coach Smith was the perfect hire. And our first
meeting with him, he comes in and I think it's six in the morning or
something; he just wanted to meet us real quick. And he's coming in, bouncing
off the walls. His energy, it's just something that's contagious.  
  
I think that's something he's passed down from that first meeting on to now.
And just the energy and culture that he's brought and just the way he coaches
and instills confidence in each one of us and the other coaching staff lets
you play basketball, I mean, how you're supposed to play. We've all been
playing since we were little.  
  
And he makes it so that we're playing the game and not thinking. And
basketball becomes a lot easier when you're out of your own head and you know
your coach believes you and you know your teammates believe in you. And it's
been a great year. The whole coaching staff has that mentality, but it starts
with Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Abel, could you tell us a little bit about how far you've come?
You're a walk-on, weren't playing very much and you've become a starter,
started pretty much the last half of the season.  
ABEL PORTER: It's been an interesting journey. I had spotty minutes in the
start of the season. And it's kind of been like that. This is my third year at
Utah State. It's kind of been that roller coaster, not really knowing what to
expect.  
  
But Coach Smith did a great job of meeting with me knowing -- telling me that
he has confidence in me and what he expected of me. And so I kind of just
stuck with it, just the same as I always have.  
  
And I'd like to say that a lot changed but really I think I just took
advantage of the opportunities that were given to me. I prepared the same way
for every single game, prepared the same way in practice, and luckily I got a
couple of opportunities that kind of paved the way for me to start and for me
to kind of get solid playing time.  
  
And so it's been great. But I have to give credit to Coach Smith for just
believing in me and giving me this opportunity.  
  
Q. Neemi, could you talk a little bit about your basketball -- how you
got interested in the game and if you had followed an NBA team, if any of them
were a particular hero to you? Can you talk about your basketball heritage,
how much you may have followed the NBA, whether you were interested in a
particular player?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I grew up -- I never actually -- I grew playing basketball
since then. I've always watched the NBA since I was, like, 14. And since then
I watched it every year, every week, almost every day. I like a lot of
players, especially big men that can do a lot of things.  
  
I try to model my game like Anthony Davis, players like that. And it's hard,
but I'm working on it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach Craig Smith from Utah State.  
  
Q. I asked the players, and I'll ask you, you've got a locker room with
players from six different states and three different countries. So how much
of that is choice, how much of that is chance? You're the coach, obviously
first year. Some of it I'm sure you inherited. But just talk about that a
little bit. Everybody talks about locker room culture and how important that
is. So, have at it. Let us know what you've got.  
COACH SMITH: Well, that's a great question. And it's something you think a
decent amount about. But obviously it's my first year. I've been here for just
short of a year now.  
  
So at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where you're from, who you are; it
matters what you're about and what kind of character you have and how are you
going to represent. Recruiting is the lifeline of your program. And so you
better recruit people first. So whether that's a young man from Utah or
Oklahoma or Portugal -- we've got the Portuguese connection. We've got two of
the three players in Division I basketball, we calm them the Wonder Twins,
like the old "Wonder Twin powers, activate."  
  
But at the end of the day you've got to be able to identify young men that can
flourish in, for our case, in Cache Valley, in Logan, Utah, and that can
flourish in your style of play. So our style of play is different than Program
X. And so a guy like -- there's going to be guys that are going to be really
set up for success in our program that might struggle in a different program.  
  
That being said, there might be guys that flourish in a different program that
might struggle in our program. And so as a coach you've got to really identify
the types of players that are going to do well. It's easy to go spot a guy
that can run fast, jump high, but that doesn't mean he's going to be a player
for you.  
  
So you've got to dig deeper. It's like Nick Saban said, you've got to peel the
onion back seven layers. You go to the high school, you've got to ask the
administrative assistant, what do you know about this kid? You've got to go
ask the custodian, what do you know about this kid? Go ask the history
teacher, what do you know about this guy? And pretty soon things start lining
up.  
  
And my first day on the job at Utah State, got hired on a Sunday. On Monday I
met with the academic people. I met with the compliance people. I met with
strength and conditioning coach. I met with our athletic trainer. And you can
go right on down the line. Tell me about our team. Tell me about our program.
Tell me about this individual, this guy, this guy. And you do that and pretty
soon things start checking out.  
  
And day two, and part of day one, met with each individual student-athlete.
Tell me about the program. Tell me about academics. Tell me about strength and
conditioning. So you do your homework.  
  
And we've been so fortunate. I've been coaching -- I was just telling this
young man to my right about I've been coaching for 23 years. And I've been
very, very fortunate to be on very, very good teams. Coached a team that
played in the national championship game. Been on teams that have struggled.
Been on a couple of NCAA Tournament teams.  
  
And I feel like the luckiest man on earth to be able to coach this team
because going into the year we were one of the 50 youngest teams in the
country. We dressed 12 guys and six of them are freshmen, including the one
when we had the open walk-on tryouts, and he's one of the freshmen.  
  
So to be able to have this group come together and do what we've done, it's
been beyond magical to say the least. We were ranked number nine in the
preseason polls and we're a No. 8 seed in the NCAA Tournament. It's pretty
incredible.  
  
Q. When you took this job, what type of player did you think Sam was?
You've probably talked about it before, but for those who haven't seen him on
a national stage like this, why has he been so successful in your system?  
COACH SMITH: First of all, Sam is a young man of incredible character. And
he's like the all-American type of kid. The country's going to see one of the
best players in the country play tomorrow. Certainly getting ready -- when I
was contacted about possibly applying for the job, obviously I was doing my
research. And certainly Sam was a guy that really stood out.  
  
Sam was the one guy in our program that had some accolades coming into the
season. He was the third-team all-conference player last year. And certainly
watching the video -- even though our style of play is totally different than
the style of play last year, you could see, like, this kid, he's got great
feel for the game. He understands the game. Incredibly unselfish.  
  
And the common theme that everybody had said about Sam Merrill is all Sam
cares about is winning. Doesn't care if he's an all-league player or how many
shots he gets a night. Our first practice this summer, I said, Sam, if we're
going to get to where we need to go, winning the Mountain West, we need you to
be much more vocal.  
  
The rest of the year -- literally the rest of the year -- he's the most vocal.
He's so cerebral, so intelligent, we're very detailed with scouting reports.
Sam knows not only what the guy he's guarding is going to do; he can do what
the 5 man and the 4 man is going to do. He's yelling it out. He'll be guarding
this guy and yelling back at Neemi, "Neemi, watch the duck in." Whatever it
might be.  
  
You get into the season -- it's just so obviously, early on in the year,
because of our youth -- and we really struggled with the ball early, not
because we had bad shooters. I think it was -- like a guy like Brock Miller is
a freshman, so the speed of the game is going super fast for him. And once
Christmas past he got in a groove where he started playing like a sophomore.
The game slowed down.  
  
And Sam would come up to me -- because he had to carry so much of the load --
he'd say, Coach, I think we need to run this to get Brock going, or we need to
do this to get Diogo going. Or maybe a few more post touches for Neemi or
whatever it might be.  
  
He's so unselfish. And at the end of the day you think back to a game like New
Mexico, where we controlled at New Mexico. We started off the league 1-2. We
had won two in a row. So we were 3-2 in league play, and on the road to New
Mexico. They come roaring back. That's one of the toughest places in the
country to play.  
  
We were down one and we hold it for a last shot. We were either going to win
it or lose it. And we run a play for Sam and basically gets tripled team. And
one guy drops off and he gets double teamed. And a lot of times the best
scorer, no matter what, is just going to fire that shot up. And he makes the
right play, the right read and delivers it over his shoulder to Abel Porter,
who he had been playing with since fifth grade. And Abel makes a game-winning
3 with like .7 seconds to go.  
  
And he's done that continually all year. Guys love playing with him. We're No.
9 in the country in assists on the year. 62 percent of our baskets are
assisted, which is an incredibly high number. And it all starts when you have
a guy like that that's so unselfish.  
  
When your best player is your hardest worker, everybody falls in line. And I
could talk another ten minutes on Sam if you want. But that about sums it up.  
  
Q. I think I read where you guys, your roster has six or seven returned
LDS, returned from LDS missions. How much is that in terms of maturity and the
ability to trust that these guys know what they're doing?  
COACH SMITH: Certainly it's been fantastic because all those guys are just
incredible people, first and foremost. You know, obviously generally speaking,
they're a couple years older. There's certainly a sense of maturity.
Communication skills are tremendous.  
  
But like anything, we have training table on campus. And so you get done with
practice. Guys -- sometimes they don't want to go to training table. They want
to go home and eat with their wife if they're -- there are guys that are
married. So it's always different.  
  
But it's been, I could go right down the line. Quinn Taylor, he's one of our
two seniors. We always say he's like -- remember the old commercial, EF
Hutton? When EF Hutton talks, people listen. That's Quinn Taylor. We call him
the godfather or grandfather, either one suffices.  
  
But his leadership skills have been impeccable. I know he was just up here
earlier with Neemias Queta. So, Quinn, I don't know how many minutes he played
last year, right around 20 a game. It's hard to keep him off the floor. He's
so good that way.  
  
But what he's done certainly for our team, because he's a guy that every
single guy in our program has utmost respect for, no matter who you are, where
you come from. And then he's just been like such a big brother to Neemias,
just teaching him the in ands outs of the game, the ins and outs of the league
and it's been incredible that way. Certainly it's nice to have.  
  
Q. You mentioned you guys were picked to finish ninth in your league.
What was your first impression, summer workouts when you got a glimpse of your
team? What do you think your expectations were?  
COACH SMITH: From the get-go the goal was to get to the NCAA Tournament and
win when we get there. We wanted to get to the top of the -- Mountain West
Conference champions. We have a plethora of young men from Utah. A guy like
Sam, Brock, Abel Porter, grew up in the state of Utah where their dream was to
play basketball at Utah State.  
  
So inherently you have a ton of pride. Those guys grew up -- Sam talked about,
after we won the conference tournament championship, about being at the game
in 2011 when they cut down the nets. And he remembers it vividly. And so you
have -- I remember that Monday when I met with all these people, I met with
Sam's parents that night. And we were talking about the glory days.  
  
And so it's always impossible until you make it possible. And there's a quote
I remember: It's a funny thing about life, if you refuse to accept anything
but their best, you very often get it. So we had high expectations from day
one. And we talked about -- our guys started -- I suck with technology.
Although I'm good with Twitter -- or like Bill Belichick said, Snapface and
Instachat. I say that to the team all the time.  
  
But our guys started their own -- I don't think I've ever shared this before,
but our guys started their own, what do you call it, group text. That's what
you call it? So I just figured how to do a group text. I knew how to do it; I
didn't know how to name it. I did it with our staff in January. They're, like,
wow, Coach, staff. That's great.  
  
But on the top of it -- I think Sam started it -- and on the top, the name of
the group text, is that what you say, the name of it, the title, was Mountain
West champs. And so our guys, it was a very emotional win. We beat Boise State
in overtime. We were fighting a lot of sickness that night. That was our
fourth to last regular season game. Beat San Diego State at home.  
  
Then everybody was talking about Nevada the next game, but we had to beat San
Diego obviously to make that Nevada game mean something. Beat them, first time
in Mountain West Conference history that we had been a part of that, we had
beaten them.  
  
Obviously beat Nevada. First time we beat a ranked opponent since 2007. Now
everyone's talking about the hangover game. Are you going to have enough gas
in the tank. All that stuff, because we had a quick turnaround at Colorado
State. And Sam said something in the group text: Now it's here; let's give
everything we've got and stay locked in, so we can get what we said from day
one, in our group text, Mountain West Champ. So that was a pretty neat thing
that way.  
  
So our expectations, I've always believed as a person, as a coach, as a
father, in anything you do in life, why would you ever put limitations on
yourself? Like why would you ever limit yourself as a person in anything
you're doing? Why would you ever put limits on yourself in your program?  
  
And so our guys' buy-in from day one, I think what's helped us in a weird way
-- we are one of the 50 youngest teams in the country -- our local guys have
heard this over and over and over again, but we only had four guys in this
program that ever played or averaged more than seven minutes a game. And so in
some ways it hurts you because you lack some experience.  
  
But I think in some ways it's helped us because we just have this youthful
exuberance that we're going to conquer the world and nobody's going to tell us
any different. And so just the chemistry we've had, the camaraderie, and the
common goal has been incredible and that goes to these young men that were up
here and obviously all the other guys in our program.  
  
Q. Matisse Thybulle is one of the best defenders in the country and
really unique in what he does. What are your impressions of him now that
you've been looking at Washington?  
COACH SMITH: I've had to take a lot of Advil over the last four days because
he's a headache. I can't remember -- I think I heard this on a telecast -- but
we use a ton of football and boxing analogies in everything we do. And he's
almost like Deion Sanders in football. When Deion Sanders played, it was like
he eliminated whatever side of the field. He's so instinctive, so quick
twitch, so long, and his hands are just so fast, right?  
  
And for a guy to average playing zone over three steals a game with two
blocked shots a game is incredible. And he does it while staying disciplined.
He's not just running all over the place gambling and out of position. So he
dominates the game in such a different way that I'm not sure I've ever seen it
from that respect.  
  
So you gotta always account for where he's at. Their team forces 17.5
turnovers a game in the Pac-12. That's hard to do. And they're doing it mainly
just in the half court. So he's certainly a monster part of it. But their
whole team, Newell is player of the year for them. Dickerson was a first-team
All-League kid last year in the Pac-12. And David Crisp has had a phenomenal
season, senior year. I actually did a home visit with him and his parents when
I was an assistant at Nebraska. His mom can really cook. It was incredible
food. It was like wow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa student-athletes Tyler Cook, Nicholas Baer
and Jordan Bohannon.  
  
Q. Tyler, what's the excitement level back home?  
TYLER COOK: We're all super excited. It's a huge opportunity for us, something
that we've been working towards since we ended our season last year. And so
ever since we saw our name pop up on that screen, we've all just been excited
to get to work.  
  
And I feel like we've put forth a good effort in terms of preparing for this
game. It's a huge stage for us all. We're just super excited and blessed to be
in this position. And I think we'll take full advantage of it.  
  
Q. Nicholas, do you feel like you've been given the attention you
deserve with the season that you had, especially within the Big Ten?  
NICHOLAS BAER: Yeah, absolutely. We never get too concerned about attention or
anything like that. Obviously we have an opportunity to play in the NCAA
Tournament. That's something that we're grateful for and really looking
forward to this opportunity to play in Cincinnati and hope we'll be here for a
while.  
  
Q. It's Columbus, you knew that?  
NICHOLAS BAER: I did know that.  
  
Q. Jordan, your thoughts on what the team is doing right now, as far as
what level you've been playing compared with the rest of the season?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I feel like we're really prepared to play at this level,
knowing -- coming from the Big Ten Conference and the teams we've played
against all year. We've played one of the hardest schedules in the country.
For us to be able to get on this stage, I think our past will prepare us for
these moments.  
  
We've played at Madison Square Garden and big stages already. I know what
we're capable of doing and I think we all have that same mindset.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Big Ten schedule. It's particularly tough on the
road. You feel like that eases once you get into a tournament setting where
you have a neutral site like Columbus?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: Definitely. Big Ten, we have eight teams in the NCAA
Tournament this year. So that says a lot about what it's like day to day in
the Big Ten. It's tough to even get a win at home against any Big Ten team.  
  
So traveling and away games is going to prepare us for these neutral-site
games. And I think our team's always done pretty well at neutral sites. We're
really looking forward until tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordan, obviously besides this is a one-and-done situation, what is
this week like compared to say a big week in January or February in the Big
Ten? Can you feel a difference about what you guys are going about this
week?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I think it's just all a culmination of our entire work we've
put in since last April. It sucks, last year we had a season that no one
expected even us, the work we've put in. We had a let-down. And we got to work
last April.  
  
So for us to have our name called last Sunday, it was really special, because
we know how hard we worked to get to this point. And we're just trying to make
the most of it.  
  
Q. Tyler, how about for you, does this week feel different to you
opposed to a random week in the regular season, and in what way?  
TYLER COOK: Definitely. I think the energy has been different. We're in kind
of unchartered territory for myself and Jordan at least. We haven't been to
the tournament yet in our careers. And I speak for most of us when I say that,
with the exception of Nicholas.  
  
But it's just been very exciting for us. When Jordan said, when we saw or
heard our name called on Sunday, we were all ecstatic. Once we got to work, it
just really felt different than the regular season, which it is. So I think
like the new energy that comes along with the postseason will serve us well.  
  
Q. Tyler, from what you've seen from the UC defense, how does that
compare to anything else you've seen or played against this season?  
TYLER COOK: You know, they play a unique style of basketball. You don't see it
too often. But just like we do in the regular season, we've got to watch film
and scout and do the best that we can and trying to figure out what we can do
to try to, I guess, lessen the impact what they do defensively.  
  
So our coaches have done a great job kind of putting together a game plan for
us. We watch a ton of film. Like I said, they've scouted to the best of their
ability. So I feel like after today, heading into tomorrow morning we'll be
prepared for them.  
  
Q. Nick, I believe you're the only player on this roster that's been to
the NCAA Tournament with Iowa. Just what do you remember from that experience?
And also, do you buy into the fact that some people say to succeed in the
tournament you have to have tournament experience? Do you buy that at all?  
NICHOLAS BAER: I wouldn't say you necessarily have to have tournament
experience. I know a lot of guys on this team it's the first time going to the
NCAA Tournament. But I think there's certain things you need to be able to do
in March that are going to be keys to succeed and to advance. And being able
to execute, like, under pressure and being able to stick to your defensive
rules, I think those are more important things than having the experience.  
  
This is obviously a very unique atmosphere but at the same time a lot of these
guys are preparing for this moment their whole lives, and that's why you come
to Iowa and that's why you play at this level is to play on this platform.  
  
Q. Tyler, I think I saw on an interview you did in the last few days
sometime that you may have played with or against Jarron Cumberland in high
school. Could you elaborate and share those memories?  
TYLER COOK: We don't have like a super close relationship or anything like
that. I met him in Chicago at the Nike Global games. I believe it was my
junior year at high school. We played on the same team together. It was me,
him, Myles, (indiscernible) Cassius, Nick Ward. He played well.  
  
It was the first time I saw him play and first time I met him. And from then I
knew he would be a really good player, which he is today. That's the first
time I've seen him play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach McCaffery, comments?  
  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We're thrilled to have this opportunity. Proud of our team.
Tremendous respect for Cincinnati and the job that Mick Cronin has done there
and the success that that team had. We played a long, grueling, 20-game
schedule in the Big Ten and accomplished a lot of great things. Proud of my
guys and looking forward to playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach Cronin mentioned this week that you guys are friends off the
court. I'm curious how that relationship started and what it's like.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It started many years ago before he even got into this
business. I was at Notre Dame and he was a very young coach, and got to know
him then and over the years obviously we crossed paths. But we spent a lot of
time a few years ago at the Final Four when my son Patrick was sick. That was
in 2013 when he was diagnosed with cancer.  
  
We have a lot of mutual friends. We talk periodically and so we're on the
road. We spend time together, go out to dinner, that type of thing. Just a
coach that I have tremendous respect for -- how he does it. I think he is a
guy that has great respect for the game and has had an interesting path to the
success where he is. He grinded his way up. And that's kind of who he is.  
  
So I would say he's a dear friend in this business and somebody that I have
tremendous respect for.  
  
Q. Is it easier or more difficult to prepare for a coach that you know
that well?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think it's about the same simply because we don't see a lot
of teams in that league. We don't watch them as much. I kind of follow him
because of my friendship with him and hope he does well. But it wasn't until
now that we really studied his program.  
  
I kind of know they defend, they rebound. They have a toughness about them
that's somewhat unique. But I've been really impressed with how they share the
basketball. Even with Cumberland shooting as many shots as he shoots, he gives
it up easy. He has 123 assists.  
  
So I think that's kind of the beauty of this tournament. You're playing teams
that sort of know you but don't know you as well because we're grinding so
hard with a 20-game Big Ten schedule.  
  
Q. Obviously the kids are excited and probably nervous and butterflies.
You've been doing this a long time. This isn't your first rodeo. Do you get
nervous, amped up and nervous for this weekend?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I don't get nervous coaching the game. I've done it so many
times. But I understand and appreciate that this is different. And it should
be. It's a tremendous accomplishment. Everybody wants to do well.  
  
Every coach, every player, every assistant coach who had that scout, you want
to do the best you can. You want to help your team advance. We're all trying
to do the same thing. So I'm understanding and respectful of that.  
  
We'll do everything we can to stay positive, because when you get out there,
the critical thing is going to be can you get to the next play, because
somebody's going to miss a shot, somebody is going to make a mistake, turn it
over, forget an assignment. You want that to be obviously limited and not be a
trend. Once it happens once, twice, three times, that can't happen when you
get here. So I think our guys are mature enough and intelligent enough to
understand that and after what we've been through, get ready for it.  
  
Q. Connor's had an interesting week. Just curious as his father and as
his coach in basketball you've seen him juggle the baseball, basketball thing,
and obviously it's got to be tough.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I was just incredibly impressed with him. We got up after we
lost to Michigan on Friday night, and I didn't really know that he was going
to jump in the car and head up and play on Saturday. We got back in time to
see him. He played Saturday. Then he played a doubleheader Sunday. Then he
played Tuesday.  
  
He was at practice. He didn't miss any practices for us. And then to go
4-for-8 with two walks and two stolen bases and a couple of doubles, I was
really impressed that he was able to do that. But probably more so that he was
Academic All-Big Ten while doing all of that. So just couldn't be more proud
of him.  
  
And I remember, seems like yesterday that he was thrilled to be out there in
the layup lines when we're warming up in Tampa, 2008, and now he's playing.
So, it's really a proud moment.  
  
Q. In your experience entering this tournament, is there any different
way you have to approach it when you win a lot of games coming into the
tournament or you're in a bit of a downspout coming in?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: No, I don't think so. We've kind of done it both ways. I
think you feel better if you came in riding a winning streak. A couple years
ago I know we were 6-6, ended up 12-6 in the league and won our last six games
in a row and felt really good.  
  
But I think you look at the body of work and you consistently analyze where do
we have to get better? If we didn't win, what could we have done differently?
And then you're now shifting to a completely different team, from a different
league. But your preparation is very similar, very business-like -- grind,
watching film, get on the court in practice. This time of year I think if
you're going two and a half hours in practice, you're crazy. So we scaled back
practice time, make sure we have fresh legs, but at the same time focus on the
interesting or specific things that we have to do for that game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colgate student-athletes Rapolas Ivanauskas,
Will Rayman and Jordan Burns.  
  
Q. Jordan, there was a story circulating that you took an Uber to get
here. Could you just go into detail about that whole experience?  
JORDAN BURNS: That wasn't true at all. Fake news.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously won a lot of games down the stretch. How
important do you think it is having confidence going up against an opponent
like Tennessee and just coming into this tournament in general?  
JORDAN BURNS: I think it's a big key for us. The confidence is what keeps us
going when we're on the court. In order to make shots and things like that,
you have to be confident. I think it's a very big deal for us going into this
game.  
  
Q. Rap, talk about dealing with Grant Williams and what kind of player
you think he is?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Grant Williams is a fantastic player. We scouted him all
week. Really strong guy, really great in the post, really good in the duck-in
situations. It's going to be a tough situation it's not going to be just me
and Dana or anyone else. It's going to be a team effort. He's an All-American
and we have a lot of respect for him. And we can't wait to play him.  
  
Q. Jordan, what's this week been like for you guys? And just how
different is it than, say, a tough regular season stretch?  
JORDAN BURNS: It's just been fun for us to be able to make the tournament.
It's just really a blessing for us. We're having as much fun as we can on this
trip while still trying to stay serious and really compete during the
tournament. So it's just been really fun for us.  
  
Q. How do you handle the nerves of this week and what's at stake?  
WILL RAYMAN: Honestly, like, we're really just trying to play free. We know
that we're a really good team and we're just trying to soak up the whole
experience and play with as much confidence as possible.  
  
Q. With what's at stake, how are you able to do the Jedi mind trick to
make yourself feel that way?  
WILL RAYMAN: I don't know. Just every day in practice we know the type of team
that we are. Like, there's really nothing to be nervous about. We're playing
in front of a bunch more people than we do at Cotterell Court, but for us it's
the same for the team.  
  
Q. Rap, I'm curious, what's it like to be here these last couple of days
in Columbus? What's the experience been like, the magnitude?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: It's a surreal feeling. I can say it for all my teammates.
Just being here, being somewhere close to home, too, so my family can come
out. Just being in the hotel, seeing the Colgate logo and the March Madness
logo, it's stuff you grew up with. You turn on CBS, see all the college games.  
  
And it's awesome to be a part of it. Awesome and a blessing to be part of it.
But now that we're here it's time to get down to business and we have work to
do.  
  
Q. I was on campus on Monday. And this is all everybody's talking about.
What do you say to all your friends and classmates and teachers, people that
will be watching from home?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Just thank you. Thank you for my professors for letting me
come here. But in all seriousness, thank you so much. We know we're going to
get a lot of good viewership back home around that area. We've been supported.
We've been understood.  
  
And guys have really been -- even coming out here, we have a lot of football
players coming out here to support us, just really, really thankful to them.  
  
Q. Have you looked at 15 seeds from the past -- Florida Gulf Coast,
Middle Tennessee -- have you looked at their storylines and kind of figured
out what their secret was?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Not necessarily looking in depth with it. But I know just
looking at Middle Tennessee beating Michigan State and just great upset
stories. And it all could happen.  
  
Like Will said, we're playing free. We're not playing with nerves. We're
really happy to be here, but we also know we earned our way here. It's not
just a fluke that we're here. We know we deserve to be here too.  
  
Q. Jordan, especially with Bone at the point, Tennessee likes to go fast
and can speed it up. What's the key against that in trying to maybe slow them
down?  
JORDAN BURNS: Our coaches, they devised a good game plan for us. So basically
we're going to go in there do what Coach says. There's nothing new for us.
We're just going to go out there and play hard. They're another team just like
us. So we're going to go out there and play hard and leave it all out on the
court.  
  
Q. Will, you're the elder statesman in this group as far as wearing a
Colgate uniform. What's the difference and journey for you for the past few
years to get to this point with this team?  
WILL RAYMAN: I think it just shows that every single day since I was a
freshmen, our whole team has been putting the work. We attracted players like
Jordan and Rap who are really good players. And during league play we all
started to come together and it's been fun to be part of that.  
  
Q. Rap, you're the newcomer this year, the transfer that came in. How
has it been fitting in with the team and how is it that you've helped them get
to this point?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: It's a testament to Coach and these two guys here my
teammates. I didn't know how I would fit in. People told me they needed me
here and that I could contribute. But they took me in. They put their egos
aside. They put their stats aside.  
  
They were just, like, we just need to win. We want to win. We want to make the
tournament. That's a testament to these two guys. They've been really humble
and really kind in taking me in. So I'm really appreciative for them.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know that as well as you all shoot the 3 ball as a team,
there's also the turnover numbers kind of are what they are and they're pretty
high. How paramount is it, how important is it to kind of keep the ball, to
not let Tennessee get out and run by a team with that much athleticism? How
important is it to kind of take care of the ball?  
JORDAN BURNS: We've stressed that a lot in practice, the turnover margin and
things like that. It's very important because they can get out and run and get
a lot of easy points in transition and things like that. So basically what
we're doing is just planning on running good offense, moving the ball, and
making sure that whenever we're rebounding, things like that, we can get
defensive rebounds and offensive rebounds at the same time so they can't get
out on easy run-outs.  
  
Q. Rap, you mentioned watching this tournament when you were a kid. Back
then did you fill out brackets looking for the 15 seed or the Cinderella
story? And what's it like being that team now?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Yeah, no, 100 percent, it's unimaginable. I remember
making all these brackets and always being around -- my little brother would
always beat me. Just picking out random teams, he would always get all the
upsets.  
  
No, just being here -- obviously I didn't make a bracket -- but just being
here, it's such a surreal experience, just being -- knowing that you've got
other kids watching our games on national TV and other kids that are like me.  
  
Q. Rap said he didn't make a bracket. Did either of you other guys make
a bracket and did you pick yourself if you did?  
WILL RAYMAN: No. I've just gotten a bunch of pictures, like, oh, Colgate,
Sweet 16, blah, blah, blah. It's just really fun to see all my friend picking
us.  
  
JORDAN BURNS: Same with me. Didn't make a bracket, but I got two brothers.
They both picked us to win the national championship. (Laughter). It's good.  
  
Q. Following up on that, I'm sure you were all March Madness fans when
you were kids. For each of you, what comes to mind? What's your favorite
moment from watching this tournament?  
WILL RAYMAN: My dad actually used to work for Newsday. I think the best part
is just seeing our name everywhere, like, seeing Colgate everywhere, and just
like trying to show as much exposure about Colgate because a lot of people
don't even know that. I feel like that's the best part.  
  
Q. When you were a kid?  
WILL RAYMAN: When I was a kid? Just filling out the brackets. Looking at the
newspaper, turning on SportsCenter. That's honestly the best thing.  
  
JORDAN BURNS: For me, honestly I don't even remember a time when I was
younger. I was really into football. So March Madness was just something I
turned on the TV and watched, got to see on ESPN. Filled out a couple of
brackets when I was younger, but that's about it for me.  
  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: For me, I have -- definitely pretty memorable. My cousin
played for Florida State when they won the ACC. So they went to the Big Dance
a couple times, went to the Sweet 16, got knocked out by a good VCU team.  
  
Watching him he was a big inspiration to me. Him playing, him playing well,
winning the ACC it's just inspiration for me because the ACC is run by those
two teams usually and they were the underdog that year.  
  
Actually today is his birthday, so I'll give him a shoutout. Happy birthday,
Deividas.  
  
Q. What's his name?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Deividas Dulkys.  
  
Q. Jordan, when basketball became serious in your life you envisioned
playing in the NCAA Tournament. Is it surreal a kid from San Antonio
representing a school from small Hamilton, New York?  
JORDAN BURNS: It's surreal still to this moment. Just growing up, when I
decided to stop playing football in ninth grade and just decided to focus on
basketball, thinking about making it to this moment was never really a thing.
I never really thought I was even going to be able to have this experience, be
able to be here with this wonderful group of guys with a great head coach and
great assistant coaches and things like that. This is something I could have
never envisioned. I'm blessed, really.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you go back, you were asked originally about this Uber,
can you elaborate on that. This was like a fake tweet? And what's the reaction
since then?  
JORDAN BURNS: I found out about it last night. My mother called me. And my
mother called me she was, like, wow, I know if you would have missed this
flight I know you would have picked up the phone and called me, right? I was,
like, yeah, mom, I'm in the hotel and things like that.  
  
I had a lot of little messages like, did you not make it? Like, wow, they left
you? Really? Like, that's crazy. After everything you've done.  
  
People are telling me all this stuff. It's funny. But it's just a fake tweet.
It's really hysterical.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know you all shoot the 3 ball at a pretty high clip and
have most of the season, especially the past couple of months. And Tennessee,
as good as it has been this season has sometimes been vulnerable from there.
Is that something you feel you can take advantage of if you play your game?  
JORDAN BURNS: Of course. I think everybody looking at this game says that if
we can shoot the 3 ball well we'll have a good chance winning this game.
That's our plan. We're planning on hitting shots. Planning on going and making
the right shots.  
  
So the 3 ball is going to be very important in this game and hopefully we can
knock down and come out with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll start off with a general statement from Coach
Langel about the status of his team and how he's feeling at this very exciting
moment and then we'll take your questions.  
  
COACH LANGEL: I think the last week-plus has been a really exciting time for
us as I think back to when I was a first-time head coach eight years ago. I
didn't necessarily think about winning championships, but what I wanted for
the student-athletes that we were going to coach is to have a chance to have
the experiences that I was able to have as a student-athlete.  
  
And I think that this group has embraced that. They've built on the work that
a lot of other guys have done over the last handful of years. And what they've
been able to achieve this year for our school and our program is really
significant. So I'm extremely proud of their efforts over the course of this
season and the offseason.  
  
And I know they're super excited to be here and for the opportunity that we
have tomorrow afternoon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously the players are going to be nervous and amped and
butterflies and all that. But how about you as a coach, how do you deal with
it and how do you keep your focus on the biggest game of your season?  
COACH LANGEL: For me, I don't really look at it like the biggest game of our
season. For me that -- the last eight regular season games, if we were going
to have a chance to do what the group set out to do, be regular season
champions, we were going to have to win them all.  
  
And obviously to get to this stage, to win three games in whatever it was
eight or nine or 10 days, I think those games are the ones that you really
concern yourself with as a coach. Are we doing everything we can to prepare?
Are you, in game, making the adjustments you need to?  
  
Here, for this game, I don't think there's many people out there who are
expecting us to win. So in so many ways the pressure is off. I think what
we're trying to do as a coaching staff is we have the good fortune of having
been in our players' sneakers before. So just trying to share with them.  
  
There's going to be some nervous. There's absolutely some excitement. When the
ball goes up, it's a game, it's just a basketball game. So all this stuff that
is new for them, hopefully, will settle down early in the game and play the
way we've played all season and give ourselves a chance to be really
competitive.  
  
Q. Coach, for a lot of fans and young players, tomorrow will be the
first time they see Colgate play on the national stage like this. What kind of
feel do you want them to take away from the game after watching Colgate play?
What do you want them to know about Colgate basketball after watching a game
like this?  
COACH LANGEL: I hope that we're able to play the way we've played all season.
For me that's a group that really helps one another all the time. Again, their
belief in themselves as individuals and the group as a whole is significant
for me.  
  
I think on the offensive end -- and that's been our better side of the ball
all year -- is that we really share the ball. That we've got a number of guys
who are threats to make individual plays, but that we're at our best when the
ball's moving and we're sharing the basketball inside and out. And so I think
that that's what I'm hopeful that our guys are able to do tomorrow afternoon
for everybody watching.  
  
Q. We're going to do an interview with Pat Moore in a little bit. A kid
from Utica, went to Colgate, an alum, now coaching. What do you have to say
about your assistant coach?  
COACH LANGEL: I'm thrilled to have him as part of our coaching staff. It was a
joy to coach him as a player, again. When you inherit a roster you didn't
recruit any of those guys, no matter where you are. And from day one Patrick
did everything possible to help build the program that we were trying to
build.  
  
So for me, a big part of building a program was to try and find some
continuity, some continuity through the years, because I was fortunate enough
to play and then coach at two programs, Penn and Temple, with great history
and tradition. And a huge part of that experience for me was generational --
that guys from the past were still a part of the program.  
  
So to have Pat now as part of our staff, I think it's evidence that that
exists for Colgate basketball and I'm really proud of that.  
  
Q. Have you looked at any other 15 seeds in tournament history --
Florida Gulf Coast, Middle Tennessee -- Cinderella stories in the past for
your own preparation or have you discussed it with your players?  
COACH LANGEL: No. To be honest, I mean, I did go back and watch the Loyola
Chicago game against Tennessee from last year as well as other games. We don't
resemble many SEC teams. So as you try and find some ways to be competitive
against a team like Tennessee, you do try and find some common games, some
teams that maybe you can identify with how they play, how they manage the
game, how they were able to stay competitive.  
  
But I haven't gone back into the history. I mean, I remember watching them as
a kid, but I haven't gone back to study them in our preparation.  
  
Q. And I guess my last question is I was on campus on Monday and I asked
this of your players. This is what everyone's talking about on campus. What do
you say to the campus community watching at home?  
COACH LANGEL: I'm really thankful. I'm thankful for everything they've done
for us, especially in that tournament run. Our students were all on spring
break, the community came out, the campus community, the local Hamilton
community.  
  
For me it's what's really special about March Madness is that you're able to,
when you're able to get here, so many people are excited for you and are able
to join in the process. So to everybody back home, certainly thankful for
everything they've done.  
  
Q. When you look at a team like Tennessee, obviously without divulging
your game plan, I'm sure you have no desire to do that, but how do you weigh
doing maybe what it is you all do that got you all here versus trying to maybe
control tempo or do something to get them out of their game, because you look
at the stats and you all seem to put the ball in the bucket, too. I'm guessing
you wouldn't want to get out of your element and doing what you don't do
normally?  
COACH LANGEL: Yeah, my son's nine years old, and he's a basketball junkie.
He's watching the ACC Tournament, the SEC Tournament, all the possible teams
that we could play. And after Tennessee lost, he said, dad, we might play
Tennessee here's what we should do. Don't let any of their three leading
scorers ever touch the ball and we'll be good. So for everybody out there,
that's our game plan. (Laughter).  
  
I think your point is dead accurate. We've been at our best in transition. But
if you try and go up and down and play transition basketball with a team of
their caliber, you're running a big risk. So I think we've got to manage the
game.  
  
When we haven't done well, it's kind of like when Tennessee hasn't done well,
they lost the championship game, they turned it over, needlessly you could
say, a number of times. Some of the bigger games we played -- not that Penn
State, Syracuse, some of those games, not that they're quite the caliber of
Tennessee -- but we've turned the ball over.  
  
So you've got to manage the game. You've got to play within yourself, but
while also doing what you've done all year long to have that success. So a
couple little wrinkles here and there on both ends to try and help the guys
with what Tennessee will be. But for the most part you've got to try and go be
who you are and play the best that you've played all year.  
  
Q. When you look at last year around this time, you all made a pretty
good run in the postseason. Ran into Bucknell at the end there. When did you
know this team this season could be different? When did you know this group of
guys here could kind of reach this moment?  
COACH LANGEL: I felt really good about the roster that we were going to
return. We were able to recruit Rapolas as a transfer in the spring. There was
some conversation that we didn't know which direction it would go as far as
him gaining immediate eligibility.  
  
Even without him I felt we could compete for a championship in our league. And
when we did find out early in the season, that first game day, that he would
be eligible after having him in practice and working with him, I thought we
had a team of really legitimate size, not just for the Patriot League but for
any league. And I liked our skill and I liked our pieces.  
  
But you never know. You never know how a season is going to go, how that group
is going to come together. Tucker Richardson is a freshman. We thought he'd
really be good, but how he's able to handle himself with the other guys and
handle the game and grow up as a player and within the team, you never know as
a coach how those things are going to go.  
  
But going back to last season I felt really good about the team we would have
coming back.  
  
Q. All three of your players said part of the joy for them growing up
watching this tournament was the Cinderella or finding the Colgate that could
shock the bracket or shock the world. You've been there as a player before. Is
there any lesson you take from kind of being that team and what it's like when
the crowd gets behind you that you share with them or try to help them out
tomorrow?  
COACH LANGEL: Amongst other things, I think it's what makes March Madness so
special is that literally everybody stops what they're doing and turns on the
TV or has it on the Internet to see who's doing well. And it can be a
contagious thing.  
  
So we certainly -- I wasn't able to be a part of a team that won as an
underdog. We certainly fought hard and that's something that we've talked to
our guys about, some of the things that we learned as student-athletes, the
guys on our staff who were able to do that. But I do think that's something
that's an exciting part of the year.  
  
So when you're in their spot, they're dreaming about being one of those teams,
and you certainly try and channel that energy to play the best you can.  
  
Q. All three of them also said they did not fill out a bracket, but a
lot of their friends had Colgate advancing. Did you or did you leave that to
your son?  
COACH LANGEL: Someone told me we're in the Southern region. I had no idea.
Once our name was announced, it was -- I knew who we were playing; I knew the
other teams that would be here. I couldn't even tell you all the teams that
are still playing and who they're playing against or any of those things.  
  
I'm sure my son, Luke, filled out his bracket and hopefully he has Colgate
winning at least a game or two. But it's a fun time of the year for a lot of
people. As a coach, you're just trying, again, to do the best you can to help
your guys perform at their optimal level.  
  
Q. You left no stone unturned in recruiting players to your program.
Obviously the recruiting footprint is bigger in Knoxville than Hamilton, but
in a lot of ways Tennessee is unheralded, under-recruited, three-star-or-below
guys. Do you share any commonality with Coach Barnes in that aspect trying to
sell players to your program?  
COACH LANGEL: As I've studied this Tennessee team and talked to people across
the country, if I could share any common traits with Coach Barnes as a
basketball coach, I would be really proud.  
  
I think that the coach that he is, the job that he's done, not just at
Tennessee but everywhere he's been, is absolutely a footprint that I would
like to follow in.  
  
This group of Tennessee guys, they're a throw-back group. In today's day and
age, with all the analytics and everybody's 3 and D, and, like, they just play
really good basketball. They don't turn it over. I think they have the top two
guys assist-to-turnover in the entire SEC on one team. Like that unheard of.  
  
They're so good at getting into the paint. And again they have such a good
record because they don't ever beat themselves hardly.  
  
So the recruiting part of it, yeah, we've had to recruit a lot of guys who
didn't have a lot of other opportunities, just like maybe Tennessee doesn't
have a roster full of McDonald's All-Americans but yet is beating teams with
them.  
  
So in that way, I do think you're right that we have to find other ways to
build our programs. And we're certainly really proud of that.  
  
Q. You mentioned drawing on your experience. I'm curious when you think
back to the starts of those games you played, what were you feeling like and
was there anything that helped you settle in?  
COACH LANGEL: Yeah, you're nervous; you're excited. There's a sense of energy.
Again, our guys don't experience these things, press conferences with their
names in front of them and this size of arena and all the things that go into
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So you're balancing enjoying the moment with getting yourself ready to play
the best you've ever played. Seeing the ball go through the hoop helped me
immeasurably. I remember we played Florida in Key Arena in Seattle and we were
able to make a couple shots early in the game. And I think there's nothing
more that helps a team better than seeing the ball go through the hoop.
Hopefully that can happen for us tomorrow afternoon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington student-athletes Matisse Thybulle
and Jaylen Nowell as well as head coach Mike Hopkins. Questions for the
student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Matisse and Jaylen, after taking a look at Sam Merrill on tape or
sort of as you guys get into Utah State a bit, what jumps out at you about,
first, Sam and then how they run their offense?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: First thing for me is firstly how talented he is as a scorer
and just how he does it so effortlessly. He's able to put up big numbers and
it's not by forcing things or taking bad shots. He's a great team player.  
  
And also to add on to that their team as a whole plays really well together.
And it's cool to see, but, yeah, they play well together and they have a great
leader in Sam and a great scorer with him as well.  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: He really moves the ball very well. He doesn't really force a
lot of shots. That's something you really need as a leader. He's been having a
great year and he's a really good player. He's been leading that team very
well this whole year.  
  
Q. Matisse, just how have you guys gone about shaking off the loss in
the conference tournament and then entering March where a lot of teams come in
really hot?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I mean, it's always the next game. Win or loss, you can't
dwell on it. For us we moved on the second we got off the bus and we're
excited to be here and have this opportunity to play in March Madness.  
  
Q. It's been since 2011, I believe, since Washington's been back to the
tournament. You guys were in late elementary school, middle school maybe then.
Do either of you guys have any memory of that? And then your thoughts about
being the ones to get Washington back here?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: I do not remember that. 2011, I was probably 10 years old.
Probably somewhere in my backyard maybe, shooting. I don't know what I was
doing. Do you remember?  
  
MATISSE THYBULLE: No. I think for me and I know for Jaylen as well, it's
really exciting to be able to bring U-Dub back to this stage because I know
that Husky basketball has been known as a great program. And they went through
a stretch they were able to get out, play in March Madness for a little while
and it's been too long. And we're just really happy to be able to bring us
back.  
  
Q. What's your campus experience been like since Sunday? Obviously
there's a high level of excitement among the other students who are on campus,
and you guys are heroes for at least a few days, and hopefully more.  
MATISSE THYBULLE: It's been cool just to see over the course of the year just
how people have just banned together and supporting us, whether it's been from
professors to students to staff members. And it's been really cool to see how
people are getting excited again about our basketball team.  
  
Q. Matisse, what's the biggest difference you've seen from Jaylen when
he was a freshman coming in this season? What's the biggest development you've
seen in his game?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: That's a tough one. We've talked about it a little bit. When
Jaylen got to U-Dub, he was just a killer. He knew how to score. So his
freshman year was a lot of that. You saw that with his first game. Who comes
out in their college debut and scores 30 points? That's insane.  
  
And I think his biggest development is just being -- he's become a greater,
like a well-rounded player. He thinks the game at a way higher level. He makes
everyone around him a lot better now. Just to be able to see how far he's come
from that first year in just one year really has been really impressive.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about Mike Hopkins. What have you seen him do in the
last two years to start -- maybe set his culture with the program? And he just
got signed to an extension. Where do you see that development potentially
going?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, first, I would love to say Coach Hopkins has been one of
the best coaches I could ever ask for. And when he comes in day in and day
out, he works very hard on everything. He loves all of us. We love him. And we
just love coming in and working hard for him.  
  
And the first year was exciting. For him to come in and especially this year
with just the energy he gives us, he brings us all as a team, brings us
together even more as a family. That's really one thing that he really harps
on is that we're all family and that's what we've all been.  
  
Q. What's been your experience like, Matisse, with Hopkins? Projecting
forward maybe a little bit, where do you see maybe that culture and the growth
continuing to go?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: It's been good. We were joking about walking in here, about
how he's a player's coach. I think that's a huge thing. I think going forward
his ability to build relationships with his guys -- we've only been with him
for two years. But the guys to start off with him to see how their
relationships grow, going into their third and fourth years. And just to be
able to use that as a recruiting point going forward because we all know we
love him. And it's becoming more and more known throughout the country he's a
great guy and a better coach. And the family he's created at U-Dub has been
great and we can't wait to see where it goes from here.  
  
Q. He's got a ton of NCAA Tournament experience. What has that messaging
been like from him? And you mentioned him being a player's coach. From the
experience perspective, like, how has he messaged to you guys in Columbus?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I think it's exciting to have a coach -- and I think more
importantly our coaching staff has a lot of experience in the tournament and
has had a lot of success. And being with people who have been here and done
that at the highest level, it's pretty special, because none of us players
have been able to play at this level.  
  
And to have that comforting force in our coach and our coaching staff, knowing
that they know what it's like, what to expect is pretty reassuring and, like I
said, comforting to have.  
  
Q. Matisse, Utah State's coach compared you to Deion Sanders and how you
cover the court. I'm wondering what is it about this defense that's allowed
certain things in your game or just natural things you have to blossom the way
it has?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: These guys. I mean, seriously, we play zone and these guys
load up the backside, so I'm able to go and make plays and try and chase the
ball around a little bit. And that's been, that's huge for me because just
trying to be disruptive, I have to be able to go and get out and gamble
sometimes and kind of put our team in some tough situations. And they do an
incredible job having my back.  
  
And honestly they make great plays out of that. So I think from my own
personal success a lot had to do with, one, Coach Hop, and, two, the four guys
I have on my back at all times.  
  
Q. When you were growing up, is that the style you had or is that
something you grew into when your body grew?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: Whenever my teams would press, they would throw me in the
middle of the zone and I would pick off as many passes as possible.  
  
Q. You really were Deion?  
COACH HOPKINS: Never played football.  
  
Q. What is the goofiest thing Hop as done hop, whether practice, on the
bus or team meal, whatever?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: That's a good question. There's so many highlights with this
man.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Feel free to protect your playing time at this point.
(Laughter).  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: I don't know. That's a tough question. I could think of plenty.  
  
MATISSE THYBULLE: He has -- sometimes he'll go on his little tangents, rants,
and he'll start reenacting what us players did on the court and just kind of
making fun of us. One time he was frustrated at one of our guys because he
grabbed on the rim and got an offensive interference.  
  
And he was re-enacting that play in our film room. And like he jumped up and
punched one of the little ceiling panels and like shifted it so there was like
a hole, and it didn't get fixed for weeks. That was pretty funny.  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: I've got one. We have this little bat that symbolizes our
"Tougher Together" saying. So like sometimes he'll get kind of angry and he'll
kind of pull it out, kind of point at us, like tell us everything we're doing
wrong.  
  
And one day he kind of pointed at us and held it up like this, so everybody's
kind of thinking, oh, he's about to hit somebody. But he kind of just put it
up and just walked out the room and didn't say nothing. And we're all like
looking around like, okay, what is he about to do? Is he about to go break
something in our locker room or is he about to come back and really start
swinging on us? So that's one. That was one that I could actually -- crazy.  
  
Q. Didn't swing on anybody?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: No, he didn't swing on nobody.  
  
MATISSE THYBULLE: One thing he does a lot -- we don't think about it anymore
-- he'll just drop and do push-ups for no reason. He'll just get really
excited and start doing push-ups.  
  
He's done it in press conferences. I think the first one in U-Dub, he dropped
down and did a couple. Push-ups are his thing.  
  
Q. Is there anyone on your team or their team, is there an X factor in
this game? Maybe somebody who isn't getting, who isn't on this podium who
isn't getting a lot of attention but could be a big difference in this game?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I don't know. For us it's kind of -- we're pretty special in
the way it could be any guy for any game. And we've shown that like throughout
the season it doesn't really matter. We have guys who step up coming off the
bench. We have starters who step up who usually don't score that much. I think
that makes us a pretty special team because it can come from anyone at any
night.  
  
And as for Utah State, they have a lot of guys who aren't very well known. And
if you look at the numbers, they have some really, really talented guys. And I
don't think that a lot of people across the country know much about them. But
I know they'll start hearing about their names coming up soon. And I think
that us respecting the scout and just being aware of our coverages will help
us a lot because they've got some firepower that just isn't talked about much.  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Like T said, we have a team that really has a lot of guys that
can be on any given night. So everybody's going to come out and play hard and
that's one thing that we really take pride in.  
  
And for the other team they have a lot of guys as well. They're not as known.
But they won the championship for a reason. And they're a really good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, your thoughts.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: Just so blessed and grateful to have the opportunity to be in
the NCAA Tournament. The last two years have been an incredible journey with
our seniors sticking with the program and really working hard and having a
really good year and getting an opportunity to play for a national
championship. It's really, really special.  
  
It's one of those feelings that not only now but for the future you want to
have for the rest of your life.  
  
Q. Matisse and Jaylen mentioned you've done push-ups at press
conferences, so we'll leave it up to you when we finish up with questions.
Just how important or maybe even awkward was it to get your contract done
during the season before the NCAA Tournament, maybe to get that out of the
way? Was the timing great or was this kind of --  
COACH HOPKINS: For me it's a simple -- I've always believed in surrounding
yourself with great people. And I have at the University of Washington. I'm
excited to be there for a long time. But this is all about the kids. This is
the experience for the kids to have an opportunity to hopefully finish out
what has been a successful season. It's not about me. It never has been. And
next question.  
  
Q. Do you think this sends some type of a message as to the school's
commitment to you and then your commitment to the school?  
COACH HOPKINS: Like I said, surround yourself with great people, and I'm with
an incredible university, and I love the kids that I coach. And just really
blessed and lucky to be there, to be the head coach.  
  
Q. It's been eight years, I believe, since Washington's been to the
tournament. Can you talk about what that means to you and your players to be
the ones to bring the team back here and how important that was when you were
back on campus and that sort of thing?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think I really believe in like the score takes care of
itself. And what does that mean? It means you surround yourself with great
people. I've got an incredible staff. And you just try to get better every
day.  
  
And you never know, people that ask me, is the speed of where you're at right
now, does that matter? Did you think it would be this fast? To be honest with
you, you just focus on how we're going to get better.  
  
And so to see these guys grow, especially the seniors, and our young guys, and
to keep getting better and to keep getting better, you never think about it
was eight years in the NCAA Tournament. Your goal is to get an opportunity to
play in the NCAA Tournament because your ultimate goal is a chance to win the
national championship. That's what March Madness is all about.  
  
So for me to have been a part of a whole group to get them to get that
opportunity and to feel that is really, really special.  
  
Q. You've been to 18 tournaments, I think, as an assistant coach. Is it
different as the head coach, finally, especially since you were going to be
the head coach-designate at Syracuse?  
COACH HOPKINS: I don't think it's different. The feeling -- Cam Dollar was a
national champion at UCLA. Dave Rice was a national champion at UNLV. So our
staff experienced it, and what you're trying to do is to lead these young men
to understanding what it takes to be successful and have a chance to be in
this tournament, and to see them walk in that locker room and seeing
"Washington" and seeing their name tag, and watching the tournament today,
which I think today and tomorrow are the greatest day in sport. And to be a
part of that, it's special.  
  
The one thing I've learned about being successful in the tournament is it's
special, it's great. But nothing changes. We talked about don't eat the
cheese. It's about focusing in and there's one truth: To win the game, you've
got to go out and execute your game plan. You've got to do it together. And
when we've done that we've been a successful team this season.  
  
Q. Curious, has there been any kind of messaging with people from
Syracuse, with Jim; and if so, what have those interactions been like? And any
thought you might have matched up with them going into this?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know what, obviously Syracuse raised me. It was a huge part
of my life. I know Coach Boeheim as well as I think anybody in the business.
And I know he's proud watching. But I also know he's preparing his team just
like we are. And I'm sure after the season we'll get together and review the
season and try to get better. But not a lot of communication other than I know
he's rooting for us and I know we're rooting for them.  
  
Q. Curious about how much you know about Utah State and maybe some of
the concerns you have facing Utah State.  
COACH HOPKINS: I think a lot of concerns, they're a heck of a team. Sam
Merrill is one of the best players that nobody knows about around the country.
We're talking about a guy who has got double the assists of anybody on their
team. He's the combo guard. And you're talking about a guy who averages over
20 points a game. He goes to the foul line. He's a great shooter.  
  
But not only that, if he's not open, he shares it. And there's not too many
players like that in the country. Neemias Queta, a guy almost averages close
to a double-double and averaging three shot blocks a game. I remember hearing
about him in the middle of the year. They were talking about this great center
at Utah State. Where did he come from? Who recruited him? Who did this?  
  
And obviously Craig Smith, he's done a tremendous job. That league is very,
very good. And to be able to win the way they did is a credit to them. And
it's going to be a heck of a challenge. And they pose a lot of challenges.  
  
Q. Is there an additional challenge for you being so west and coming
into the Midwest from just a time adjustment?  
COACH HOPKINS: No. I think these kids, they go to bed late. They've been
studying. We've had finals. These guys, just to have the opportunity to be
here and to play in such an incredible tournament and to play against the best
competition in the country, that's what you're trying to do and we have that
opportunity.  
  
Q. You've said a little bit about the contract situation. But aside from
surrounding yourself with good people and trying to get the players better,
what about this is gratifying to you from a standpoint of being a career-long
assistant at Syracuse and then making the statement with this team these last
two years; it's got to be a great degree of satisfaction for you personally?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think at the end of the day there's no question. It's all
about you're leading a bunch of young men and a staff to win. And to learn
what it takes to be successful in life. And they go hand in hand.  
  
And we've learned how to win. We've played together. We've played as a unit.
We've played for something greater than ourselves. Everybody sacrificed a
little of each other to have this successful season. And that's the type of
culture we're trying to create. So to see that and what you're selling every
day on a day-to-day basis and hammering and hammering it into these kids and
then seeing it work and them seeing it work and having success, that's what
it's all about. And just so proud of our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Cincinnati student-athletes Cane Broome, Justin
Jenifer and Trevon Scott.  
  
Q. Cane, how do you handle the excitement this week and the nerves? And
what's your secret to get through a week that's bigger than any other week
you're dealing with in the season to this point?  
CANE BROOME: I think it's just wanting to play, keep playing. That's what we
keep in mind. It's not just about this week. We're trying to further our
season. So that's what we keep in mind every day. We said today in practice,
we didn't just came here to play one game, so that's how we stay on track and
not get too excited, try to win a tournament.  
  
Q. How do you avoid the distractions that obviously come with a week
like this with all the chatter out there?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Just staying focused, not worrying about things we see on
social media and all the stuff we see every day and things that people talk
about, just making sure we stay focused and we stay as a team.  
  
Q. How hard is it to do that?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: It's very hard, but at the end of the day when you've got big
goals and big dreams to conquer and to get to, that's what it comes down to.  
  
Q. Trevon, a lot of people around this area maybe haven't seen you guys
play since that first game. In what areas do you think you guys have grown
most since the beginning of the season, that opener?  
TREVON SCOTT: We've grown in all areas, in all aspects from the first time we
played Ohio State. We made a lot of changes, individually and as a team. But
in every area you can think of in basketball as a team, we've grown in those
areas.  
  
Q. Trevon, having a tournament like you did in Memphis and making the
all-tournament team, what does it do for your confidence and what does it say
for your development this season?  
TREVON SCOTT: It's most definitely a confidence booster. I've got to keep my
head focussed, just keep the same focus I had while I was in Memphis, playing
hard and playing confident.  
  
A lot of the stuff I did in Memphis, it was from constant, like, reps I did
over the summer and throughout the season. And I mean I just gotta keep doing
what I was doing, just keep staying focused, focused on important things and
let the distractions go and just stay confident and I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Cane, you and Justin had a difficult senior day just as a team and
everything. Did you guys get together after that game, because obviously
things have gone pretty well since then? Did you get together after that game
and say let's keep our senior day going?  
CANE BROOME: Yes, it was a tough day, but everybody has tough days. I'm pretty
sure you guys have a tough day in the office. So we just had to come back to
the drawing board and we had better goals in mind. We didn't win that
championship but we knew we wanted to win another one.  
  
So Coach got on us about it and told us what we needed to do to fix ourselves
and told us that we would see them again in the championship. So we just
worked our way to that and tried to take it game by game. And once we got
there we just, as a team, stayed focused and mentally locked in. That was the
big change after that game, was just our mental focus.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: To piggyback on what he said, just after that game, it was a
rough day. We had that day. We can't just dwell on that game. We had other
games we had to prepare for and the conference tournament was coming up. So we
know that was a big stage for us, coming from our senior night not having,
like you said, a good game. So we had a bigger goal to get and we conquered
it.  
  
Q. Justin, coming into your senior campaign, March Madness, looking at
your first competitor here, Iowa, hopefully the first of many, looking at the
Iowa Hawkeyes, how do you match up against their back court?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Following the scouting report. We always go in and come
together as a team, and we follow the scouting report. We feel if we follow
the scouting report and have Bearcat toughness, we can get the win. That's
what we did when we played Houston. If we play just like we did against
Houston and we keep that going, we can't be stopped.  
  
Q. Trevon, seems like down the stretch you've really picked up your
game, attacking the forwards and all that. I don't know, anything particularly
clicked for you or a sense of urgency. You're a junior, it's not like you're
getting old?  
TREVON SCOTT: Honestly, I just want to win, for real. I just want to win. And
I know doing things like that will, especially rebounding will help us win and
elevate our team. Like, me scoring will open up the floor for these guys also.  
  
So I was just trying to stay aggressive offensively and showing what I can do.
And also I like playing with Justin and Cane. This is their last year. So,
like, whatever I have to do to keep our season alive, so I can continue to
play with these point guards I'm going to do.  
  
Q. Did Jarron express his disappointment about not coming out to the
table with you guys?  
TREVON SCOTT: Nah.  
  
Q. Cane, talked about how hard it is winning here, compared to playing
at Sacred Heart. Three years in a row that you guys got to the tournament;
these guys it's been four years. Has it gotten harder or easier, are you more
appreciative after all these years or does it become more routine?  
CANE BROOME: It's inward pressure we've been putting on ourselves. Obviously
the last nine years we've got here in a row. It's more pressure now that we
want to further our status here. The last few years has been rough, coming out
of the second round.  
  
So I think that's more so our pressure we've been putting on each other --
let's be that team that make it. Coach has been telling us why can't you guys
be those guys that further it, especially me and Justin. We talked about it
yesterday. And I think that's more so what it is than actual pressure than
being at the tournament.  
  
Q. Cane, there's a lot of talk, just in March Madness you need elite
players to go on deep runs. What makes a player like Jarron so invaluable this
time of year?  
CANE BROOME: I think personally the way he gets fouled. Obviously it's big-
time games, the refs will be on their whistles. He has a knack for getting
fouled. He's aggressive, whether he's making shots or not. That will be huge
in this tournament.  
  
And I think he's one of the best players in this country at getting fouled.
And that in itself is going to help us in these games.  
  
Q. Justin, just what type of atmosphere or crowd are you expecting being
kind of close to home?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: It's the same. Basically like a home game. We call it -- when
they say, we was in Columbus we called it backyard basketball. Just having all
the fans wanting to come and support us is going to be a great atmosphere,
great energy for the game.  
  
Q. A little bit of a national question here. How do you guys -- how did
you guys handle your freshman-sophomore years in particular when it came to
seeing what's going on around the country in terms of transferring? Am I going
to stick this out? Do I need to look around? Did you look around? What got you
to not do what so many other of your peers are doing and stay? And what did
you see that made you want to stay as opposed to go? Did you even think of
going?  
CANE BROOME: I'm one of those guys. I can't really answer that question.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Just trusting the process. Even though you come in as a
freshman, you come in thinking you can play all these minutes and stuff like
that. It don't happen that way. But, you know, sometimes you've got to look at
it and look in the mirror sometimes and know that it's you; that you've got to
work harder and go and step your game up, and looking at the older guys,
seeing what you need to do to go ahead and get better. So staying here I feel
as though was the best decision for me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about why you did it?  
CANE BROOME: Mine is different reasons. Like I had an interview with Justin
earlier this week. And as a kid I wanted to play tournaments like this. What
you see on TV. I was at a great institution, just a lower level. And I just
seen the opportunity to come be a part of something bigger than myself.  
  
And I just wanted to take that opportunity and do so. And I don't regret it
because I'm here with my brothers right now. And I think, to piggyback on what
Justin said, I haven't been here four years, but I had ups and downs here. But
I think more so as a brotherhood here, even with the coaches it's like a
brotherhood. We all stick together through tough times. And I think that's the
reason why Justin stayed, too. He made friendships here. And it's bonds you
don't want to break, whether you're playing or not. Like it's a bond you don't
want to break.  
  
TREVON SCOTT: I guess I'll say I didn't transfer. But did I have those
thoughts? I mean, at times I did. Especially coming in as a freshman expecting
to play, coming from high school, being the man on your team and coming here.
I redshirted. It was tough. But I didn't give up.  
  
I just thought about the players who did that before me and is successful --
especially from the UC program. Like Sean Kilpatrick, he was someone who I
kind of like -- I'm not going to say I looked up to -- but he was in the same
situation as me. And, I mean, he was successful. He redshirted. He was
successful. He went through hard times.  
  
And I'm like why can't I stick it out and go through hard times, make
something of it. And like they say, the friendships we made, the bonds we made
with each other and the program, like the history, it's like coming from where
I'm from -- UC is a historic program, a lot of great players come from there.
So I told myself I want to -- why can't I be another good player who gets
through this hard time and be successful.  
  
So I stuck it out. I wanted to stick it out with my brothers, and I wanted to
be successful. And it got me here to this point talking on the stage with
these guys and talking in front of you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH CRONIN: Well, it's been obviously a whirlwind week for us, winning our
conference title Sunday and trying to put that to bed, get the guys refocused
for this week. But we're obviously excited to be here. This is what it's all
about. It's why we play the regular seasons, why we play our conference
tournament, to get a chance to be on the big stage.  
  
Every kid growing up who plays basketball dreams of playing in this
tournament. So we don't take it for granted. Try to make sure our guys enjoy
it and embrace it and, most importantly, get ready to play tomorrow. So we're
extremely excited to be here.  
  
Q. How long was the bus ride? And how surprised were you to see or did
you think it was possible that you would be here in Columbus?  
COACH CRONIN: Bus ride was a little longer than usually takes me to drive it
in my car. My last trip was -- downtown's really nice. My daughter plays club
volleyball. So that's an all-day event. If anybody doesn't have a daughter
that plays club volleyball, it's an all-day event.  
  
I've walked around, beautiful day in May. It was at the convention center so I
got to see downtown. To be honest, my father is in charge of all that stuff. I
didn't even know Columbus was a site. Glad to be here.  
  
I also don't know what region we're in. I know we play Iowa and I know
Tennessee plays Colgate. And I mean that. We've been really busy the last
couple of weeks. And like I said, right now my daughter is in club volleyball
and we've got a lot going on. But Columbus is a great city. We're happy to be
here.  
  
Q. How do you control the distractions? Obviously there's a lot that
goes on in this week. And how do you keep things -- I'm sure you want to keep
things as normal as possible. But how do you go about doing that?  
COACH CRONIN: I think it's a great point. I think that you've got to realize
there's a game at 12:00 Friday and that's really what matters. And you've got
to have your mind on that.  
  
So Coach Knight said a long time ago, the mental is 4-to-1 to the physical. If
you don't have your mind in the right place, you're not going to be at your
best. And you're going to have to be at your best. Anybody can win games in
this tournament. Everybody -- obviously we play Iowa. Fran's a good coach, a
good friend of mine. They've got a great team.  
  
We talk about it a lot. You that hope your veteran guys understand that. We've
been through some distracting things this year with the opening of our arena.
The Crosstown Shootout is always a distractive situation with all the talk
that goes around it. So hopefully our guys will be able to be focused.  
  
Q. At this point do you still get nervous yourself? And how do you
temper that and handle that?  
COACH CRONIN: I don't know if -- I wouldn't say nervous; I would say excited.
If you're not excited to do what you do, I think no matter if you're a
basketball coach or you're reporting at USA Today, you probably need to try to
change your job. Because you only live one time. And I'm getting a little bit
older. I believe in that now.  
  
You've got to be excited about what you do and appreciate it. So, not nervous.
Extremely blessed and excited to be here. I don't take it lightly. Don't take
it for granted. Last time we played here -- when did this building open?  
  
Q. 2000.  
COACH CRONIN: We're pulling in, my dad said, you're playing in a building you
haven't played in. I said, you're wrong. First game in 2004 with Murray State
was here.  
  
I didn't even remember that until we were pulling in the tunnel today. I was
thinking back -- I was riding in here with my former president, Dr. King
Alexander, he's the president now at LSU, so I get a chance to say hi to him,
thank him for hiring me.  
  
So just really excited and appreciative. Always nervous. Then when I watch
Iowa make 3s on film I get a lot more nervous.  
  
Q. I think there's some people around Columbus who probably haven't
watched you since the opener against Ohio State. How much has this team grown
since that opener and how does that maybe compare to other years as well?  
COACH CRONIN: They don't watch Cincinnati up here? I'm teasing. I understand.
I understand. The answer is experience. We were very inexperienced in our
roles. Jarron Cumberland had played, but he hadn't played the star. Cane
Broome had played but, like, now he really understands that when Jarron's out
of the game or getting rest that he's got to be aggressive. Justin Jenifer
wasn't looking to shoot open shots whenever he could get them. And we weren't
running things to get him open shots until this year.  
  
Obviously the rest of our guys weren't really ever in the game. So last year
when we played in the NCAA Tournament, Keith Williams and Nysier Brooks did
not get in the game against Nevada, and they've been starters for us.  
  
The only way to grow is to get experience. I've tried to be sure I injected
that I believe in what they could become from the time we started spring
workouts last year. I think that's important. You have to make sure your guys
know you believe in them.  
  
I tell them all the time, the most important thing for young people, you've
got to believe in yourself. But you gain experience and that helps you get
better. And it's a hard thing for a guy, for a guy like Nysier Brooks, the
first time you're starting at this level. And to be as consistent as he and
Tre Scott have been for us. So the growth as players is the answer to your
question.  
  
Q. Is that different now entering into March where they haven't had
that, Jarron really came on at the end of last year at this stage, and maybe
does that give you an added element that's almost like invaluable because some
of those guys haven't had experience at this stage?  
COACH CRONIN: Tough to say. I would say of all the added elements and the
things that may go on Friday, I'll take made shots over all that stuff. You
can split atoms all you want, try to dissect what's going to happen. These
games -- it's why it's called March Madness, why it's the greatest event in
sports in the world because anything can happen whether it's UMBC or what
happened to us last year.  
  
Anything can happen at any time. So we've talked about since the end of the
regular season is playing in one-and-out environments, and that you have no
margin for error. And you have to know that when you're tying your shoes to
get ready for the tournament, that if you lose you're out.  
  
And that was our mentality going to the conference tournament. It worked well
for us. So I think that you've got to believe that you can win the tournament
or at some point in the game you may have to give up because you think, well,
we're not going to win it anyway.  
  
So I think the teams that have any advantage are the teams that think they can
win the whole tournament. And that if they don't win it that they're not going
to feel like they accomplished their goal. You might look at me and say you
guys at Cincinnati are a 7 seed, but I think that's the mentality.  
  
I don't want my guys ever walking around thinking that they can't win the
tournament. Whether we're playing Iowa or whoever is No. 1 in the country this
week, I don't know.  
  
Q. Ninth straight year for you here. Do you feel it's gotten easier or
harder?  
COACH CRONIN: I feel like I'm getting older. I think it's hard every year. You
should never underestimate how hard it is to win and never take winning for
granted. And I say that not -- fans are always going to want more. But I think
for the players, my thing is that what they accomplished this year, I want
them to know that they've done a great job.  
  
And although we expect it and we work extremely hard to sustain our success,
you can't take it for granted. And you've got to make sure that the people on
your staff, the guys that come off the bench, our managers, that everybody's a
part of it. Because everybody doesn't go to the tournament every year. We know
this.  
  
So you have to appreciate it and you have to make sure that everybody that's a
part of it knows that they're contributing. And probably getting better at
that as I get older. It's definitely not a one-man band, I can promise you
that.  
  
Q. How much of a dilemma is Iowa's grain-fed beef. They have some big
dudes?  
COACH CRONIN: Their strength?  
  
Q. They have big guys, 250 pounds-plus. You guys are strong, but you
don't have any 250-plus bodies?  
COACH CRONIN: I don't know what Noz (phonetic) weighs, but I don't know. We're
not in a sumo wrestling match, so I think how the game is called is big,
important. I think footwork is important. I think you've got to play smart. I
think the games are usually called a little tighter starting today. And the
games get real physical in conference play in February.  
  
So what we've talked about is making sure that we don't pick up cheap fouls
battling for offensive or defensive position in the low post, regardless of
who they're battling against, whether it's Garza or Cook, whomever because I
think it will be a little different. I don't think it will be quite the way
conference games tend to get real physical late in the year. I think it will
be back to more free-flowing. And I don't want them guys getting cheap fouls
in the low post early in the game.  
  
Q. Based on the numbers, looks like your rebounding is a priority for
you guys, right? How do you balance that with Iowa's transition game in terms
of crashing the offensive boards and your ability to do that?  
COACH CRONIN: That's a great question. We would never change that. I get asked
that a lot by younger coaches and people that talk about, what's your theory
on transition defense. It's called get back.  
  
And I have people -- there's a lot better coaches than me, and they rebound
two guys and they run to certain spots. I worked for -- Coach Huggins will be
in the hall of fame, and Rick Pitino. We rebound the ball, obviously your
point guard gets back.  
  
But with Iowa, I think the biggest key is you've got to find shooters early.
That's what you're alluding to. You've got to find shooters early with them.
But we will not not rebound because of that. But people do try to score on us
-- we're used to people trying to score on us in transition because of our
half-court defense can give people problems at times and it's tended to be
pretty good. So we're used to that.  
  
But it will definitely be a challenge but we will not rebound because of that.
Hopefully we won't have to. We'll make a few shots. It will be nice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iona student-athletes Asante Gist, Tajuan Agee
and Rickey McGill as well as coach Tim Cluess. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Tajuan, going back to the MAAC championship you said it was a dream
for you growing up to play in the NCAA Tournament. Now you're a day from that
dream becoming a reality taking on Chapel Hill. What are you feeling right
now?  
TAJUAN AGEE: I was excited to get the opportunity. But now it's time to buckle
down. It's time to lock in. Tomorrow's game day. We're going to treat it like
any other game.  
  
Q. Rickey, to you, what was your coach telling you when you guys were
7-15?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just keep your eye on the basketball. Keep sticking together.
Don't give up. Don't ever settle for plays. Don't ever take a play off. And
just play your best and give it your all.  
  
Q. Rickey, last year it was Duke. This year UNC, Chapel Hill. What does
that mean to you to take on two, not only a ACC powers but national
powerhouses?  
RICKEY MCGILL: It means a lot. It's a big stage. I'm going to come out and try
to get my team the win.  
  
Q. Your coach has sort of a larger than life personality. How does his
personality impact you guys and the way you play?  
RICKEY MCGILL: He comes every day prepared to work. He tells us to go hard
every day, keep getting better, keep getting in the gym.  
  
TAJUAN AGEE: He works hard, night in and night out, whether it's film or
studying a different team or just letting us know what spots are open on the
floor against different teams. So that work ethic rubs off on us. And we just
come in and try to work hard and as hard as he works every night.  
  
ASANTE GIST: Like my teammates said, it's a lot to do with work ethic. He
instills that in us to play hard in every possession. And we just try to come
in practice every single day and do what we have to do in order to come
together to be the best team we possibly can.  
  
Q. Rickey, as one of two players on this team that's been on this stage
before, what's the message been like in the locker room with these guys
getting them ready for what lies ahead on this stage?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just give it your all. All or nothing. We've got to play for 40
minutes just like they gotta to play 40 minutes. It's a big game for us,
bigger than any other game we've played this season. Just gotta come out and
try to get a win.  
  
Q. Going back to when you guys were 2-9, if I would have told you guys
you were about to play UNC, Chapel Hill in the NCAA Tournament, would you guys
still believe it during that tough stretch?  
ASANTE GIST: We always thought we were a good team. That never was the case.
We always knew it was just minor things we had to get together. And we always
had each other's back.  
  
This team has always been resilient and always had each other's back. We never
looked and said, oh, we can't do this. We always felt as though if we just got
on the same page that would be a scary sight. And now we're here. So we're
just trying to go out there -- we're not going out there just to be here;
we're not happy to be here. We want to get a win. That's what we all tell each
other on a consistent basis.  
  
Q. What have you seen from UNC on tape? What challenges do they pose?
And break down what you see on the court.  
TAJUAN AGEE: They're a fast team. They like to get up and down. But we like to
get up and down. So it's going to be a challenge that we want. It's a big
game. We know it's a big game. We are ready for the challenge, though.  
  
ASANTE GIST: Like Tajuan said, they play fast, they're kind of big. They're
bigger than us, but like he said, we want the challenge. So we just have to
come out and play our basketball.  
  
That's what got us here so we're not going to change how we play. But we're
going to go out there and do what we have to do and hopefully we come out with
a win tomorrow.  
  
RICKEY MCGILL: They just touched on everything that I was going to say. I
agree with them.  
  
Q. Rickey, what are your impressions of freshman guard Coby White, and
how much are you looking forward to that matchup?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just try and stop him. I know he's a good player. He's been a
good player all year for North Carolina. Now it's a big challenge for me just
to come out and try to get a stop.  
  
Q. Asante, just more specifically, what are you guys doing better now
than when you were struggling so much?  
ASANTE GIST: A lot of people don't know, this team didn't come together until
school started, so chemistry was our biggest problem in the beginning. It
hadn't had nothing to do with talent. We always worked hard. It was just our
the chemistry.  
  
Now I feel as though we're moving the ball a lot better. We're shooting the
ball way -- a lot better. So, and we're also playing defense very well, too.
So that's a big emphasis that Coach gives us on a daily basis. And that's
really what it is.  
  
Q. Rickey, he mentioned chemistry. How much of that is chemistry that is
being your team in the locker room together, learning about guys that just
came together and how much of it is actually on the court?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Chemistry definitely was a big problem for us at the beginning
of the year. As he said we didn't really have a team in the summertime to gel
together. As the year went on we just had to keep fighting, just keep getting
better as a team, and just keep gelling together, keep getting to know each
other. And that's what we did and now we're here.  
  
Q. As you started to win games, could you feel yourself getting better
as a team? How did the winning the game sort of improve your confidence as a
team?  
ASANTE GIST: We always, like I said, we always felt as though we were a good
team. As time goes on, we could see even games we were losing, we could see
that we were getting better. It was just certain things that came down the
stretch that might have made us lose the game or little things that we need to
get together.  
  
But, like I said, we always felt as though we were a good team. And once,
Coach always told us, once we started clicking it would be, like, a good one.
So that's what happened down the stretch.  
  
TAJUAN AGEE: I always felt like winning fixes a lot of problems. So as we
started to win, we started to gel, we started to become more of a brotherhood
than a team, and I think that helped.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Is that easier said than done?  
  
RICKEY MCGILL: Yeah, winning, it takes a lot to win, everybody playing against
a different team every day. So you just gotta come out and give it your all.  
  
Q. You find it difficult, there's so many questions here about
chemistry. And it's kind of tough, you throw guys in a room. You guys be
friends. It has to happen organically, right?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Right. That's really what happens. We all were new to each
other since this school year. So we just had to learn what each other could do
and just play as a team, play Iona basketball.  
  
Q. Tajuan, did you watch the game last year when UMBC beat Virginia? And
what did you think of it, a 16 seed beating a No. 1 seed?  
TAJUAN AGEE: Of course I watched it. I've always been a big fan of March
Madness. Of course I watched it.  
  
But I think a 16 beating a 1, it happened before, it can happen again. So
we're going to come out and we're going to play our hearts out and we're going
to give it our all. And hopefully we can get it done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. It's time for an opening statement from Coach
Cluess.  
  
COACH CLUESS: We're excited to be here and playing against North Carolina and
their storied program and coach and really excited for the challenge. My
players have worked really hard for this all year and I'm really happy for
them because hard work paid off for them.  
  
Q. One of the themes that we really got from your players was that
during that initial struggle with a losing record in the first half of the
season or so, that you really gave them the belief -- this could be a special
group. Coaches don't always do that.  
COACH CLUESS: I firmly believe that. I think we went through a lot -- two of
our first 11 games were on the road. We played at home on Nov. 6 and not again
until December 30th. So we had a lot of learning about each other, doing a lot
of growing up to do. But I liked the pieces we had.  
  
More importantly I liked how they came to practice every day even after tough
losses and injuries and all that. They worked their tail off every day. And as
a coach you're kind of looking around, is the shoe going to drop if we don't
win soon? And they never gave up. I really did believe at some point if we got
healthy we'd have a chance to turn it around.  
  
Q. What has been your message to your players ahead of this game,
especially for the guys who are playing in their first NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CLUESS: To enjoy the moment, to go out there play really hard, worry
about each possession and don't look at the big picture right now; look at one
possession when you're in the game. And play Iona basketball for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. When you look at UNC, what challenges they pose, obviously the speed
is what the players said. Anything else that stands out?  
COACH CLUESS: They have a lot of challenges obviously for the size of our
team. But their speed getting back, first of all, offensive rebounds that try
to limit them from getting too many of those. We can't turn the ball over.
We've again good as of late. If we can do that I think we can get good shots.  
  
We have five guys out there that can stretch and knock down 3s so we're
confident in the way we're playing offensively right now. And we have to play
a top-notch game, but I expect nothing less from our guys.  
  
Q. Many moons ago you coached Danny Green in high school. I was curious
if there were any good off-the-wall Roy Williams recruiting stories when you
first ran into each other that you could share?  
COACH CLUESS: In all fairness, the first time I met him we had just won the
Beach Ball Classic. I met Coach Williams and had my boys and my wife with me,
and he was a gracious, terrific man to meet. And when I just ran into him
today, it's the first time I've really talked to him since that day. And he's
the same exact way.  
  
I love how hard he works with players -- I thanked him for making Danny Green
a pro because we entrusted Danny with him. I knew it was the right spot for
Danny because Danny was the kind of young man who would work really hard and
just listen to his coach, and I didn't know any coaches better in the business
than him, in all fairness.  
  
So I don't have any of those other kinds of stories, but it was tremendous
Danny was there, and it's a tremendous honor and privilege. But, boy, am I
looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. A lot of players talked about a need to build chemistry. What kinds
of things did you do to help build chemistry?  
COACH CLUESS: That's a good one. Sometimes adversity builds chemistry. Sounds
a little crazy but it does. Sometimes you find out what their true beliefs are
individually and what they're looking for out of it when things are bad. So
not only can you get a read on players when things are going well, but I think
when things are going back you have to try to figure out what makes each other
player tick and then how to bring it together. The players themselves have to
want to bring it together.  
  
Early on, in fairness, they were fighting each other a lot. I think that
chemistry grew to where we want to win and we're going to do it the right way.
And our senior leadership in Rickey McGill and E.J. Crawford as a junior
started like telling guys you've got to do what we're asking you to do. You've
got to work harder and continue to develop and don't worry, it's going to be
okay.  
  
We've been through some tough times in our program before and found a way. I
think they helped start the belief and it got infectious within our team.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of UNC freshman Coby White and the matchup
problem he possesses?  
COACH CLUESS: He's terrific. He gets down the floor in three to four dribbles.
In about two to three seconds he's down in the other end makes place for them.
And our job is to get back on D and slow him down and build a wall in front of
him and not just let him have his way the whole game.  
  
I think Rickey McGill and Tajuan Agee and E.J. Crawford and Asante Gist and
Ben Perez and anyone else we play is up to that challenge. I think we know
what we have to do whether we're capable of it is whether or not we'll have a
chance of doing it in this game. And I think we're capable of doing it.  
  
Q. You have a lot of guys who maybe aren't going to get recruited by
North Carolina. What do they get out of playing at Iona and what do they get
from playing in this?  
COACH CLUESS: Iona gets a lot of things. First of all, people around the
country get to know who Iona is, not just our basketball program but our
school. It helps our enrollment. It helps our applications. For us,
recruiting-wise, it helps us recruit on a broader base because more people
know about who we are and the success we've had and our style of play. And if
you want to have a chance to play in the NCAA Tournament, Iona is a school you
should be looking at.  
  
If you want to do some special things get a great education, I don't know if
you saw the piece on the Final Four for that academic piece that came out,
Iona made it to the Final Four (indiscernible) if you take all the programs in
this tournament. And so I think we bring a lot to the table.  
  
Q. I have to get your thoughts on this, what did you think about the
year that your alma mater had this year in basketball?  
COACH CLUESS: Which one?  
  
Q. Hofstra.  
COACH CLUESS: I'm just kidding with you. I thought they did a terrific job.
Joe did a terrific job. They were terrific. I thought they were beating North
Carolina State the other night. I was rooting for them. They were close to
getting in the tournament. I wished they'd won that championship game. But
they've really turned the corner with this program over there.  
  
Q. You've been on this stage five times before. Is this one more
rewarding than the ones before it given what this group has gone through?  
COACH CLUESS: I think you can sit there when 2-9 and I said it to my players
-- and I meant it -- just imagine what the story would be if we go from 2-9 to
getting to play in the NCAA Tournament. And you are looking at yourself and
everyone's looking at me, like, are you crazy? And part of me is, I'm saying
to myself, am I crazy?  
  
But reality is when you do that and come back, and you can look back from
where we were to where we are now it feels like it's been several years, not a
few months. And I'm proud of these guys because I've never coached a team that
was seven games under .500 and won a championship. In fairness, in my
30-something years of coaching, it's never happened.  
  
To me, it was special because it was something brand new that the players
really worked hard for. My assistant coaches worked their tails off to give
these guys this opportunity. So I'm so proud of all of them and so happy for
all of them to get this moment.  
  
Q. We sensed from hearing from them that they didn't want to give up
because you didn't want to give up.  
COACH CLUESS: My father and mother did not raise me to ever give up. And that
goes for my whole family, brothers and sisters. We were born one way, to fight
a tough fight and fight through life's adversities. And I truly believe that's
what makes you strong and I think you find out what you're about at those
points. And you have to try to help people along the way and guide and lead
people. And that's what we're supposed to do as coaches.  
  
Q. Sounds like an old Iona coach?  
COACH CLUESS: Yes, I was fortunate enough to know him.  
  
Q. What's it been like to see where Rickey McGill develop from where he
was as a freshman to where is now -- four MAAC championships, (indiscernible)
tournaments? What has it been like to see him develop as a player and a
person?  
COACH CLUESS: Again, I'm going to go to work ethic on it. Being raised with
the work ethic I was, there's nothing better to me than to see somebody
working for everything they've gotten. He played sparingly as a freshman.  
  
You know the story about us saying he maybe should look at another school at
the end of freshman year because he wasn't working up to our standards. And
Rickey took the challenge of starting to work harder and got better and better
and better each year.  
  
And that's what we're about, our program is about guys who want to work hard
become special, guys who want to become college graduates and a chance to play
professionally and enjoy their college experience. And he really has done it
to the fullest and he really represents Iona basketball.  
  
Q. Scott just got picked up by the Lakers a couple hours ago. To have
Scott, MoMo, A.J. and now Rickey, how much of an accomplishment is it for this
program to turn out such a great lineage of point guards?  
COACH CLUESS: I think it's an accomplishment for them. I'm glad we're a part
of it. But they're the ones who put in the hard work. We may lead them but
they're the ones who had to get in the gym and put all those hours in, plus
the hours on their own and all the training that goes with Kelly Shaver, our
strength and conditioning coach.  
  
I'm really happy for Scott. Again someone who is kind of fighting, fighting,
fighting for that opportunity over years, had injuries, never gave up. And
here he is, he'll be playing with the Lakers for the next ten days and
hopefully more.  
  
Q. You made reference to the way you were brought up and the work ethic.
Can you describe that household, what that was like and --  
COACH CLUESS: Honestly, it was the best thing that anybody could ever dream
of. Youngest of five siblings. Two parents in the house that worked their tail
off. They were never able to go to college or anything like that. They worked
to put food on the table for their families. They were the first generation
here.  
  
Myself and my siblings were the first ones to go to college. Everything was
about working hard and doing your best. And really competitive. Everyone, not
just my dad and my brothers and my sister, my mom was ultra competitive.  
  
Everything we did, there was a winner and loser. Every time we were sitting
down at the table for dinner, there was some kind of game going on that was a
challenge and we were being challenged.  
  
And my father would have great stories. But he would make up facts that we
knew were made up and he would just tell you go to the library and prove it.
Now I could swear I thought my father worked in a library because I heard that
line so many times. But he just wanted us to be able to stand up for ourselves
and find our own beliefs and fight through things.  
  
And I remember going home to him, like in today's day and age, if things
weren't going well on teams or something like that, and I complained one time
to him about it. He goes, "Get better. I don't care. Get better." I'm, like,
"You're right."  
  
And I think I've taken that philosophy through my family. And I was fortunate
to have Coach Morris from St. Agnes High School have that same philosophy. I
was underneath him for four years as well. I think that built the person I am.  
  
And obviously I think you know a little bit more about my family history,
going through those things, I had people because of basketball I'm here today,
because some people in my life helped keep me on track through those hard
times. And this gave me an outlet. And I also do believe that I'm here for a
purpose. My purpose is to help young men have better lives.  
  
Q. What did they do, what did your folks do?  
COACH CLUESS: My dad was an engineer for Sperry Rand for about with 56 years
for the same company. And my mom took care of everyone in the family. We
always had a grandparent, aunt or uncle, someone who didn't have a place to
stay were living with us. We had nine or ten people in the house with one
bathroom. You had to learn a little bit -- little different skills there, a
little patience sometimes.  
  
Q. You mentioned how you want your players to enjoy the moment. How do
you get your players not only to enjoy the moment but also realize at the same
time that we have a job to do tomorrow?  
COACH CLUESS: I think we have not changed how we work at things. The same way
we're preparing for every other game. And everything we did this year was
about the game in front of us. It was never about down the road, what we could
be. It was about what's happening in the game in front of us, how we're going
to get ready for it, how we're going to warm up for it, what we need to do in
each four-minute segment and each play.  
  
Our whole thing to my players is that worry about the play you're involved
with, not the previous -- learn from the previous one, but don't dwell on it.
Don't get upset about it. Don't look at the referees. Don't complain about it.
Make the next play.  
  
If the ball is on the ground, dive on it. Sometimes something that simple,
taking a charge, diving on a loose ball, getting a 50/50 ball, takes away a
lot of the adrenaline that flowing in a pregame situation like this.  
  
Basketball is basketball. If you're focused, once that game starts, you really
don't see anything beyond the court. Like I wouldn't be able to tell you
tomorrow if there's one person in the gym or 20,000, because once the game
starts, it's all about what's right in front of you. And I think our players
have learned to focus much better in that way as well.  
  
Q. Because of all your preparation as a coach, can you enjoy the
moment?  
COACH CLUESS: I am enjoying it. We had a little more time, a few more days
than normal to prepare for this. And I think I'm just enjoying my family being
here again and all the coaches' families and seeing it through their eyes as
well. Some of my coaches have very young children. It's the first time they're
going through it. So to watch their expressions as they see different things,
it's great.  
  
And a lot of my players have never been here before. So I'm getting to live it
all again through their eyes and I just love it.  
  
Q. You've obviously given a lot of credit to your staff and the players,
but do you feel like this is your best coaching job of your career?  
COACH CLUESS: I'm not the one to judge that. All I know is again I don't ever
give up on what we're doing. And I'm going to tell you there's one point in
the season where I came home and I was kind of dejected with the work ethic in
practice. We had a game coming up in two days. I half jokingly, half maybe,
you know what, I don't know if I'm going to watch that film tonight on this
team because I'm so mad at these guys; they don't care.  
  
My son turns to me and says, "Dad, it doesn't matter what you think's going to
happen, you're going to do your job just like you always have." I loved that
response from him. Like, boy, he's been around me for a while.  
  
And of course I did that. But it was great to hear from another voice saying
you're going to do your job because that's what you always do and you are
going to give it everything you have. This way, they will too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee student-athletes Kyle Alexander,
Admiral Schofield, Jordan Bone, Grant Williams and Lamonte Turner. Questions?  
  
Q. Kyle, you weren't able to play against Loyola in the second round.
Does that give you more urgency this time around? Everybody is looking forward
to it, but do you think you in particular are ready to go?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: Yeah, it's unfortunate last year that I wasn't able to play in
the second round. I'm excited regardless. I'm a senior this year. I'm excited
regardless, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to play.  
  
Q. Grant, how much do you guys think as a team you benefit from being
through all this? This is not the first time any of you have sat up there on
this stage, not the first time you've practiced in an open arena? The whole
process, how much do you think you benefit from the experience?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We're definitely fortunate. We're blessed because not many
people have a chance to do this once but we're doing it twice. So we're ready
for the challenge. We're capable of anything that's thrown at us. And we're
just ready to get out there and play.  
  
Q. Admiral, how are you a better basketball player because of what
happened last March, how it happened?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I would just say I'm more motivated. But also it gave me an
opportunity to go through the NBA process. So I learned a lot about the game,
a lot of things outside of the game that helped me for this upcoming March.  
  
But the biggest thing it taught me how much I loved my teammates, I missed my
teammates. And it really gave me motivation towards doing something special in
returning. So I think it made me better as far as being a leader and
understanding what we want to get done as far as our goals.  
  
We've been in great positions this year to win championships. We haven't
finished, but at the same time we have a great opportunity to win another one
this year.  
  
Q. You mentioned after Sunday's loss that it was going to stick with you
and obviously it hurt. How quickly were you able to flush that? And what was
that process like to move forward quickly?  
JORDAN BONE: Like I mentioned, it's tough to get past a loss like that,
especially being in similar situations with the same team competing for a
championship, and we failed against the same team twice. That's a hard pill to
swallow.  
  
But I feel like, just being a mature team and understanding that we're in a
good position because we do have more basketball left, we do have another
opportunity to go out there and compete, I feel like that kind of made it a
little easier to get past those losses.  
  
Like I said, it was a hard pill to swallow, because of the situation we were
in. But we have another opportunity to go out there and do what we do. So I
think that, like I said, it just shows the maturity of this team and the
perspective that we have for this game.  
  
Q. Kyle, this group, this unit has been together for pretty much the
past three years, but for you and Admiral, this is going to be your last run.
So this is going to be the last time you all can go through this together. So,
I mean, where is the sense of urgency for you, Admiral, and for all of you to
make this last run your best part of your season?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: It's a good point you mentioned for me and Admiral. After all
this is done, we're done. We're seniors and it's the end of the road. So the
urgency is there because we're not trying to have this end anytime soon. We're
trying to be with this group as long as we can.  
  
So definitely there's a sense of urgency there. And I wouldn't want to be here
with any other group of guys, because I love this group of guys.  
  
Q. Admiral, as you take what you take from that loss to Auburn, but when
you come back to the tournament again, is there anything you change with your
routine, your approach, knowing that you've been here, done that in terms of
the first weekend and all the buzz it gets?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, you can't change what got you here. And, I mean, just
because you lose doesn't mean what you did was the wrong thing as far as
process-wise. It just means that you didn't execute in the moment.  
  
So, for us, it's just being able to adjust as far as it's really win or go
home at this point. And we want to have a lot more opportunities to be
together, play with each other. So for us it's just being locked in for 40
minutes and focusing on each game that's in front of us and not taking any
opponent lightly, but also respecting the game and playing with the passion we
know we all have and the love we all have and having fun out there.  
  
So for us it's just really being locked in 100 percent collectively on a
consistent basis every night, every film session. Really cherishing every
moment that we have in the hotel rooms and the free time that we have, but
also understanding that we're here on business as well. And we're here to
accomplish our main goal, and that's to win a national championship.  
  
But can't do that without winning the first game and the game after that. So
we have to take it step-by-step and understanding that this process is just
like any other process. There's levels to it, there's steps to it. And we've
just got to understand that consistency and consistent buy-in and lock-in to
the game plan and to each other is what's going to get it done this year.  
  
Q. Lamonte, how important was that SEC Tournament for you in terms of
getting all the confidence back, and was there a point where it wavered down
the stretch in the regular season?  
LAMONTE TURNER: I think whenever a shooter isn't making shots you're
confidence wavers a little bit. But my teammates did a great job of keeping me
up and making me realize that I do more than just score for us. So I just
tried to find another role, tried to do other things to keep me going. But as
far as confidence, yeah, I think making shots and getting going in the
tournament definitely helped me.  
  
Q. Jordan, what do you remember about last year, the way it ended in
what Dallas and how that felt? And I'm sure you guys thought you were going to
be around longer than that first weekend?  
JORDAN BONE: Yeah, just a lot of pain, a lot of regret from that last game. I
feel like this team still feels that, I mean, it's something that we can look
back on as motivation to not get that feeling again.  
  
But I feel like that was just the start of something special, honestly.
Everything happens for a reason. So just having the right mindset, the right
perspective of why things happen, I feel like that shows something about our
group. It shows something about certain individuals, how they bounced back
from that moment.  
  
But it's been tough, man, it's been tough. I'm just moving on from that. But
we have to use that to not get that feeling again. So we're just excited to
play, and hopefully we can take this thing further than we did last year.  
  
Q. Grant, has it been a long week since Sunday in the way that ended?
Have you guys been eager to get here and get going?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: As competitors, we're just ready to play. That's how the team
feels. We're ready to get going. But we're doing everything we can to prepare
and just understand that now it's a time where one-and-done, and you have to
come with the right mindset every single day, every single game.  
  
And we've done a good job of staying focused and we're locked in on our
opponent. We understand what they do. We just have to go out and execute what
the coaches have scheduled for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BARNES: Well, obviously we're excited for our program, we're excited for
the university and our players are excited to be back in this tournament
again. It's something that you begin every basketball season with hoping to be
a part of what is really, arguably, the best sporting event in our country.  
  
Again, our guys have worked hard just like Colgate and all the other teams in
this tournament. If you're here at this time of year it tells you that you've
had success start to finish, but certainly you've had success to get your way
into the tournament. And we're excited to be a part of it.  
  
Q. I know you've touched on it from time to time in this season. But do
you feel like this turnaround would have been possible without Kevin Punter
being a part of this program your first year here?  
COACH BARNES: I don't know how to answer that other than the fact that I know
he's a big part of what happened that first year, because when we went in, we
wanted to establish a culture of -- the fact that a group of guys that want to
have a great work ethic. And he was the first guy that really, once we talked
about how we saw that and what we thought that meant, he bought right into it.  
  
And I've said many times that I'll always be thankful and blessed that Kevin
was there when we got there, because he went above and beyond. And then by
what he was doing when Admiral came in and then Kyle came in and Lamonte, it
just -- he was the leader of those guys. And when he left, those are the guys,
along with our two walk-ons, Lucas and Brad, that have continued to build that
culture. And the next class with Grant and those guys were the ones that we've
just kept building.  
  
Q. How much of a benefit is it to have everybody back from last year?
It's not new for any of these guys, the attention, the hype, the pressure.  
COACH BARNES: Well, it's a benefit if they understand that you take nothing
for granted, that you understand that this time of year everybody can play.
And I think they do understand that. I really do. And we've been through a lot
this year as a team and a lot of good things have happened, obviously.  
  
But you can say that about every team in this league. But I'd like to see the
fact that we've been here, but it only works for you if you make it work for
you.  
  
Q. You've had this unit for pretty much the past two years, but after
this tournament, this team won't look the same. So have you started to sense
some urgency from the guys, maybe knowing it's their last ride? They actually
need to go out on top or at least as far as they can go?  
COACH BARNES: We start every year talking about that every year is a new team.
This team is not the same team that we had a year ago this time. And you're
right about it. This time, again, we'll graduate some key guys to our program,
not just guys that have had success on the basketball court, but guys that
have really put a lot into building this program.  
  
But they understand, I do think they understand it all. And I think they
realize how difficult it is. They know that everybody can play. But the fact
is, again, I think most coaches this time of year would be surprised if their
teams aren't excited, on edge, ready to play. And certainly hope that we're
there.  
  
Q. To prepare for Colgate, what concerns you? What jumps out at you
about them?  
COACH BARNES: One, they're a well-coached team. They rely on shooting the 3,
but they can do some other things. They have some size, they have length. They
look to really try to take advantage of your help defense, too. They can mix
some defenses up with you. And there's no doubt they're going to pretty much
pack it back in there, I'm sure, and hope that we settle early.  
  
And so they won 11 in a row, which tells you that they played their way in
starting way back before their tournament and the way they're playing good
basketball. And, again, their length and the fact that they can shoot the
ball. They're going to shoot it a lot from back there. So we're going to have
to be able to guard the 3-point line.  
  
Q. You've been through this tournament 23, 24 times. I mean, that's a
lot obviously. And you mentioned not taking it for granted. But as a coach
what do you maybe not take for granted or do you maybe change some things
about your routine about this first weekend, given all the buzz that it
creates?  
COACH BARNES: I think, one, you want to go with the formula that has gotten
you here. I think, is when you start doing things that maybe the players look
at you differently and think that -- I think, coaches can get players too
uptight. I do. I think coaches could also maybe let players get a little bit
too loose.  
  
I think the key is to be who you are and what's got your team here and players
be that. But I think we all want to come into this tournament with energy. You
want to have the legs that you need to compete, the way you'll have to compete
each possession.  
  
And there's no doubt early in my career, I think, I probably got my team a
little bit too uptight at times. But we've had teams that just fought to get
here, was a great achievement in itself. And when you're fighting -- because
it is something you don't take for granted, because you think about the 68
teams here, and then the teams in the NIT.  
  
If you're playing this time of year, one, you've got to feel good about it
because there's a lot of teams that took inventory early and aren't playing.
But what you want to do, you don't want to look back when it's all said and
done and not think that -- you gave it your best shot.  
  
Q. Lamonte, do you feel like he kind of found his swagger back in
Nashville with a big shot against Kentucky and had a nice game against
Auburn?  
COACH BARNES: He started making some shots, but what I hope he realizes, and I
think he does now, he can affect a game whether or not he's scoring or not.
And I will say this about this about him and other guys on our team, when
we're really locked in defensively our offense flows much better. We play that
way.  
  
What you don't want him to do is get back where he forgets about his defense
because he's affected games for us from the defensive end. But I do, again, he
obviously shoots the ball better than when he went through that period there
where he couldn't make a shot. So we're glad that happened. But yet I wanted
him to come into the game with the mindset that he's really had the last month
of the season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 64, Florida 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take an opening statement from Coach Mike White and the
Florida Gators.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Tough loss. I thought we did some good things, especially early
second half. Got away from us. We didn't make the best of decisions
offensively. I do think we played really hard in the second half. Left it out
there on the floor. No regrets in that regard. Just playing from behind for
the second 20 minutes I thought we expended a lot of energy, had some faulty
rotations as we tried to turn those guys over and to run and jump situations
they handled they the pressure really well.  
  
A big factor in playing from behind is that you're playing the top-ranked
defensive efficiency team in the country. We saw firsthand how tough,
physical, connected that defense is. They are terrific. I'm not going to sit
here and say we played poorly. We did some good things, just didn't do enough.
They guarded at a really high level as they do. We wish them the best. Tough
to finish coaching of these three seniors, of course these two to my left,
KeVaughn Allen is back in the locker room. He's done some big things in his
career, been a part of a lot of wins, three NCAA Tournament, a lot of big
shots.  
  
Jalen Hudson has scored a lot of points throughout his career, playing the
best basketball of his career late this year, really rededicated himself,
became more of a leader, played really, really hard in this past month, much
improved defender and rebounder, in my opinion. I'm biased, of course.  
  
Kevarrius Hayes here to my left plays as hard as anybody in the SEC. We
watched him progress to the tune of scoring at a much higher level than ever
before in his career. Should have been an all-league defensive player, in my
opinion, and these three guys have all had absolutely zero issues off the
floor. They have represented the University of Florida in a first-class
manner, and I hate to see their careers come to an end because they were
playing very well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Jalen and Andrew, can you speak to their defensive aggressiveness
especially during that 14-0 run between the two halves? Couple things they
made you do uncharacteristically, like Andrew, a couple of jump passes. Is
that what they make you all do?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: I think it was not that they made us go. I just made some bad
decisions making jump passes, but it was more my bad decision for me, I think.  
  
JALEN HUDSON: I just thought they were super disruptive on the defensive end
and they really played their principles and it was hard for us to get into the
lane and shake them at all. You have to credit them for their defense tonight.  
  
Q. Can you guys expand on the perimeter? Was it anything specifically
they did or cumulative for the whole game that was exhausting?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: I think it was just how disciplined they were on defense,
setting down driving angles and not letting us get our shots off easily, good
ball screen coverage, but just overall their defense throughout the game was
pretty consistent.  
  
JALEN HUDSON: I can see why they're No. 1 in college basketball for defense.
They were super solid. Everything we tried to run or the mistakes they made
they had to cover them so fast and they had the 7-footer and even when you did
get in the paint it was tough and he was blocking them. And on the perimeter
we had to take late shots that altered our shots, too.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Kind of what they said, defensively they were sound, didn't
let up in any categories and when we made a mistake, they took advantage of
that, 7-footer in the paint. Just hard to get around that especially when you
work so hard to break through to get into the paint in the first place.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, through 20 minutes you guys were close. Did you feel like
you were in a good place through the work you had done?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Yeah, I felt very confident with where we were. We were
making some mistakes, but, again, we were still hanging around. Feel like if
we fixed those mistakes and played a little harder on defense. We could
possibly put ourselves in a better position, but unfortunately it wasn't the
case. We were missing a lot of shots and then again, made some defensive
mistakes that they capitalized on and made us pay for.  
  
Q. I know it's only been a couple of minutes for the two seniors but can
you reflect on how you will remember this season and maybe the bigger picture
how you remember your time at Florida?  
JALEN HUDSON: Just that we never gave up. We fought. At one point in the
season there was a lot of uncertainty and we never laid done. We never sat
down. We just found a way to win and we all came together. We all banded
together. I will never forget the way we came together and how we were able to
fight and how we maxed out when we decided to and I will never forget that.
That was important to me.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: This season has had a lot of highs and lows and there was a
time where even being in the NCAA Tournament was not even in the question for
us. But we managed to find a way, banded together and made it here. I would
say my time at Florida as a whole, enjoyed about every moment, all the games,
experiences that I've had, all the relationships that I've nurtured with my
teammates and hope to continue that beyond this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, there was a sequence they went on that 14-0 run but then they
went on a stretch where they went almost seven minutes without a field goal
and the one that broke it although it wasn't a field goal was the late shot
clock foul and the three-point shots. Can you expand? I think it happened
three times?  
MIKE WHITE: That was our third one. You can't foul jump shooters. It's one of
our defensive no's in our program. I would say in most programs, written up on
the wall, talk about every day. It's stressed every day. We watched it on film
and we talked about it several times in this quick prep that they draw fouls
on jump shots, both Poole and Matthews. We got to be more disciplined in that.  
  
Q. Mike, at halftime how did you feel about what you had done through 20
minutes and what were the adjustments you wanted to make in the second half?  
MIKE WHITE: I told our guys going into the locker room at halftime if you were
to have told me this morning that we would be down four and here your defense
clips, I would have been thrilled. We watched our clips and watched some of
the mistakes we made in the first half. It was too many. It was faulty ball
screen coverage, faulty rotations, couple of missed block outs, lack of
tracing of the ball a couple times and then there were probably a few more
that I can't think of right now and we were down four against one of the best
teams in the country.  
  
So that was a challenge to our guys. Let's wake up defensively. We came out
early second half, gave up a basket immediately, gave up I don't know how many
early second half, but never seemed to find a defensive rhythm there until
three, four, five minutes into the second half and then we played them evenly
for a while. We got into a rhythm there defensively and we were hovering
around 6 or 7 from behind and had a couple of empty possessions and we freaked
out a little bit offensively and they'll do that to you.  
  
We talked in the pregame and said there are going to be some dry stretches in
this game and I'm just telling you that and I know you don't want to hear
that. They're terrific and just like you guys talking to my team, just like
you guys are terrific defensively, teams will go through dry spells. I don't
know outside of Kentucky that we've seen a team that's this sound. We've got
to maintain composure and continue plugging away, stay the course and we
didn't do a very good job of that.  
  
I would say, what, midway through the second half, maybe seven, eight minutes
left, where we had four possessions where we had a couple of shots blocked and
a couple of turnovers just trying to do a little bit too much. As good as they
are defensively, another thing that our guys can learn from Michigan, you
know, every game, win or lose, we like to think that we've got a lot to learn
from, and with these guys as good as they are defensively, offensively I
thought they were very, very sound. They do what they do. Their roles are very
well defined. I was incredibly impressed.  
  
It's hard to appreciate how good Zavier Simpson is on film. Incredibly
impressed with his toughness, accountability, leadership, the way he barks at
his teammates, the way they respond to him. The guy just doesn't make any
mistakes. He is out there plugging away, playing the game, offensively and
defensively, really, really good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jarvis Omersa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37080)

### [Amir Coffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32947)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 70, Minnesota 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined on the dais by the Minnesota Golden
Gophers. We will take an opening statement from Coach Richard Pitino.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Congratulations to Michigan State. They're a really, really
good team. To go on to the Sweet 16, obviously Coach Izzo with what he's
accomplished, it's a testament to that program, how consistent they are. They
have some really good players and obviously very well-coached. Obviously we
felt like we could give it a go with Murph early, when we shot around he
looked pretty good and I think he may be got off it a little bit and tried to
give it a go during that warm-up and he didn't look good at all.  
  
So being done Matz and Eric and Murph was not ideal. We talked about we are
going to have to play unconventional, play four guards, turn them over and
play fast and we cut it to 9 and Cassius took over and we ran out of gas. It
stings, but I'm really, really proud of what our guys did this year. It's the
second time we've won a tournament game in 29 years. A lot of these guys in
the locker room, Jordan Murphy and Dupree McBrayer, went to two NCAA
Tournaments in three years and proud of these guys. Excited about these guys
moving forward.  
  
Q. Richard, obviously with the Nate Mason injury and Akeem Springs, and
then you get here and no Jordan Murphy, Curry or Matz, do you feel snake
bit?  
RICHARD PITINO: A little bit, yeah, but you try to create your own luck. We've
had some injuries at the wrong times, but we're not going to complain about
it. I do believe that things will even out at some point. But, yeah, I think
two years ago we had the same thing happen with Akeem and Nate getting hurt
and to go into this the second leading scorer in school history, the second
leading rebounder in Big Ten and leading rebounder here a little bit. So
hopefully it evens out.  
  
Q. You went up to Jordan Murphy with 2 minutes left in the first half.
Was that to give him a check and he was going to be able to come and talk
about the curtain call at the end?  
RICHARD PITINO: I talked out and watched him warm up. He didn't look good
before the game. It's hard because you keep asking him, during the day, how do
you feel and he says I feel so much better than yesterday, because he's such a
tough kid. But they got off to a 11-2 start, not to blame Murph, but he
couldn't laterally move. But it got us a little bit and he's such a tough kid
and he's like I'll just stand. This is not ideal, Murph. It's almost fitting
with him that he hasn't missed a game his whole career, started every game but
11, still didn't miss because he played today. But it almost felt like a
heavyweight fighter continuing to fight through it even though he's bruised
and beat up. That was him until the end. I wanted to get him that moment, you
know. That was special for everybody. Very thankful to the fans who showed up.
They were awesome. We didn't have a lot left in the tank, but I am
appreciative of the love that they showed Jordan and those guys.  
  
Q. For both of you, talk about the emotions, what Jordan Murphy went
through, and what were you thinking after the game?  
AMIR COFFEY: Really just feeling for him. The way he's fought over these years
and everything he gave to the program, not being able to play in a game like
this, in the tournament from an injury is pretty tough. So, you know, just
feeling for him. It's just tough.  
  
JARVIS OMERSA: Murphy has been to hell and back and then back again and came
back. He's fought through it all and in the long run he will get what he
deserves. He's just a tough kid.  
  
Q. Amir, you emptied the clip in these last few games, left it all out
there. What do you think this year as a whole did for your development as a
player?  
AMIR COFFEY: Just kept working throughout the year, trying to get better at
everything. I mean, really just developing everything, shooting, dribbling,
and then just otherwise just mindset things, how I carried myself in the games
and just figuring out ways to affect the game and to do what I could for my
team.  
  
Q. Amir, talk about the run that you were able to go on to cut it to 9
and what happened after that with Cassius?  
AMIR COFFEY: Yeah, I think we had a smaller lineup in for our five. We tried
to push the tempo a little bit and get them scrambling and it was working. We
cut it to 8 or 9, and we had the momentum, crowd got into it and Cassius hit
some big shots. That really killed us. We had it going a little bit and
Cassius just came through for Michigan State and hit some clutch shots for him
that stopped the run.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you were talking to Tom over there. Can you
talk about that?  
RICHARD PITINO: He was asking about Jordan, tough blow, a guy that I respect
versus LSU. I think he has a team that can make some noise and continue to
advance.  
  
Q. How would you sum up this year and where you feel like the program is
and where it's going?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, I think we did a lot of things that people didn't believe
we could do. Like Coach was saying, for the last 10 games we weren't favored
to win one of them so just staying resilient and blocking out all the outside
noise and playing our game. What were we preseason for Big Ten?  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Toward the bottom.  
  
AMIR COFFEY: We were in the bottom. Nobody believed in us but our coaches and
our players. So I think we really changed people's minds and we just kept
fighting all year. We won a lot of big games, won two games at the Big Ten
tournament, came to the NCAA Tournament and got to round 32. So I think we
definitely took a step forward this season.  
  
Q. Coach, does it feel any different year-to-year when you have to say
goodbye to a senior class? Is this group unique in anyway way?  
RICHARD PITINO: With Matz and Brock they weren't here as long, but they gave a
lot to the program. Jarvis Johnson was one of the my early recruits. Didn't
play that much, but he was one of the first to believe in me. And these guys,
to continue to believe, bounce back, have a great season next year and then go
into their junior year with high, high expectations and all those things that
happened and then come back and bounce back again, go to the tournament, win a
game, you know. With what Dupree, even the injury he dealt with his junior
year, losing his mother. Jordan Murphy being 6'6" and being the second leading
rebounder in Big Ten history. It shows the heart of those guys. It's
difficult. That was emotional and you hate to see it send like that. Rarely
does it end well in sports, but I'm proud of those guys. When you are young
and building a program and you see guys go through a program, you know, four
years they get better. They get stronger. They get smarter, you know. You're
proud of them. They are really good representatives of this program.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about at the end of the Big Ten tournament and even
tonight running out of gas. Obviously injuries play into that, but is building
greater depth one of the next steps for this program?  
RICHARD PITINO: You lose three guys in the front court you only get so many
scholarships. You want to have depth, but, you know, you kind of all hit in
the wrong spots. So, yeah, you're going to continue to recruit, figure out
what the needs are, continue to build off it. Really excited about Tre who
we've got signed is going to be a terrific player, Marcus and Payton, two guys
sitting out, really good. We have really good young talent. So, yeah, we're
going to continue to build that depth, but, you know, hit at a hard time.  
  
Q. Coach, what did that moment mean for you when Jordan walked out on to
the court and embraced you?  
RICHARD PITINO: That was hard. That was hard. That was emotional. The hardest
thing was that he couldn't play in the game trying to go to the Sweet 16. He
has done so much. Never once has he ever embarrassed the program, never once
has he ever not been about the team, been a great representative for himself,
his family, and obviously for our basketball program. He's a special kid. I'm
going to miss him. He's somebody that I consider family. I appreciate
everything that he's given me because he's laid it all out there, every ounce
of sweat. He's put it on the line for this program.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look to the future, what do you feel like those needs
are?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, obviously Jordan Murphy, losing him, that's hard to
replace. As hard as tonight was, hopefully it helps build Jarvis' confidence.
He hasn't played a lot, but I do think he can take that performance. I think
he did a lot of great things. He played great defense. He played hard,
rebounded the ball well, obviously continued to build off that. Daniel and
Gabe, Daniel is going to be a really, really good player. He's put only a
little bit of weight and he'll get there. But all these young guys like I feel
like this program, you know, we've taken hits with injuries and I hate using
excuses, but we have. We can't let it derail us. We gotta bounce back and get
back in this thing again next year and I think these guys have the character
to do it.  
  
We'll continue to see what we can add in the spring. When you win like we did,
when you have guys who got better, you have local kids who have had a great
experience there is a lot to sell. I know these guys in the locker room,
regardless of our facilities and all the cool things we can sell these guys in
the locker room can sell a really good experience and that's the most
important thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Thank you, guys.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 70, Minnesota 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined by the Spartans of Michigan State.  
  
TOM IZZO: Thank you. I'm proud of these guys. We just played 5 games in 8 days
and it took a toll on some of us. There were stretches where we were good and
bad but couple things happened today that were bizarre. You know, we beat a
team by 20 when we had 22 turnovers. I thought Aaron Henry did a good job on
Amir Coffey. He had 25 points but he took 20-some shots. It was good to get
Nick back in the fold here a little bit. It's not easy to do what he did, and,
you know, Xavier was Xavier. Matt McQuaid was Matt McQuaid. Cassius was a
little rusty, a little sore.  
  
So and to play that many games in 8 days when you are already beat up is hard.
One of the timeouts I told him he's got to take over and like a true all-
American did. He took over and had about as good of a two-minute stretch there
as you could and a 9-point lead went to 16 and we starting cruising. Getting
back Nick is going to be big for us. He had 9 and 7. Xavier had 7 or 8
rebounds. Kenny had 6 or 7, and we outrebounded them bad. And yet I want to be
fair to Richard and his team. We all love Jordan Murphy. He's a tough kid,
best rebounder on the planet and it was sad not to see him play to himself. I
think we deserve credit for the start we had and we were sloppy, but man,
another championship weekend for us and we move on to the next one and I can't
tell you how excited I am.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Cassius, when Izzo told you it was time to take over how do you do
that while keeping within yourselves? You answered with a three-pointer and a
couple of floaters. When you have that green light how do you do it and stay
solid?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It's about your energy level and your approach, focusing on
the task at hand. You've got to make big plays. I've got to be who I am for
this team. That's my role for this team. That's what I've been doing all year.
I don't try to do too much. I don't try to put the world on my shoulders, but
I try to make plays to the best of my ability.  
  
Q. Xavier, Nick, when you see Cassius go on that run to push it back to
16, what's your reaction to that in the moment?  
NICK WARD: It was big, you know, because they went on a little run, but
Cassius went on a scoring spree, you know, and just put us up big.  
  
XAVIER TILLMAN: For me, that's just typical Cassius. That's just what he does.
Whenever we need him to score, whenever we need him to distribute, whenever we
need him to just lead vocally he does whatever we need him to do, and that was
just another day in the park.  
  
Q. Cassius and Nick, where are you healthwise and how bad do you need
rest? Few days off sound good for you guys?  
NICK WARD: I'm just getting back in the swing of things. I'm was out four
weeks, so I'm just excited to be on the court. I'm starting to feel like my
regular self again. So I'm good, personally.  
  
TOM IZZO: You're not.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: I'm just happy to be in the tournament grind and I knew it
was going to be a grinder weekend, but I was okay in the games. I made it
through the games and I feel like I did pretty decent. Now we got some time to
get back home, get some treatment and get a little rest and by next go-round I
will be fully ready.  
  
Q. Xavier, Sweet 16 for your team, your first one for a lot of your
guys. Your thoughts about getting that far?  
XAVIER TILLMAN: I'm just excited more so because my freshman year it didn't
end the way I was hoping to. So I'm just excited we were able to advance past
this pointed and more excited for our program because we haven't been able to
do that for three years, to break the curse feels pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. At this time we will take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tom, five games in eight days, right? Your energy and focus the way
you guys came out, were you surprised by that?  
TOM IZZO: I was surprised for the first ten minutes and then as all coaches
would be, you know, disappointed. We had 11 turnovers at halftime and talked
about it. So one thing about my team they listen well. We had 11 turnovers the
second half, too. That part was disappointing but the focus early, the
execution early, we got our fast break going. I'm a little concerned because
he's struggling.  
  
I mean, Nick is, if I am to be honest with you, that wasn't the best I've seen
Cassius play and if he can do that not playing his best that bodes well. But
we're going to have to get him some rest these next couple of days. They had
five games in nine days. We had five games in eight days. At this high level
when you're playing the teams you're playing, for what's at stake it's both
mentally and physically grinding, you know, and I don't know, it was tough.
Yet I was happy that Cassius answered the bell, you know. But we had some
other guys that played pretty well. Matt McQuaid and Aaron Henry were I
thought really good, probably should have had them up here. They probably
played as good as anybody.  
  
Q. You guys all but shut Gabe Kalscheur down. How were you able to keep
him from getting any good looks at all? Early he tried to force it and after
that it was almost nothing, how were you guys so effective?  
TOM IZZO: We put Aaron on Amir Coffey and if you think about putting a
freshman on their best because we thought Matt McQuaid could stay with him and
Gabe Kalscheur has been on fire, and them two, they were in the Big Ten
tournament and with the injury that Murphy. I don't want to take all the
credit because I told Richard before the game, you know, being one of the
elder coaches in this league, it's fun for me to see some of these teams, the
job he did, you know, and they almost pronounced him dead there in the middle
of January. When you can bring your team back from something like that and he
had a lot of injuries and I know what that's like, that speaks volumes of the
coach. I give him a lot of credit and I give us some credit.  
  
But we were really focused early and we lost some focus and some of it was
Cassius and he said he was worn down and I always tell him when the head goes
the body follows. He's our head. When he got back on the horse, the rest of
the guys did. It's pretty cool that he's got that much impact on our team.  
  
Q. Cassius obviously had those 7 points in a row, but he had a steal and
a deflection that led to another steal. How was he able to impact the game on
that end of the floor?  
TOM IZZO: That's what I said. If you watched him it's hard to self-evaluate
and hard to see yourself if you're playing and we were sitting on the bench
and it looked like he was hardly moving. You know, and I guess I will be
transparent which sometimes gets me in trouble but we'll do it anyway. He was
hurting, you know. He just was worn out. I said, well, here is the way it is,
my man, we got, you know, 20-some minutes left. If you're worn out you'll get
a lot of rest. If you're not worn out you got another week or so and you'll
get a lot of rest any way.  
  
So how about we get after it and try to prolong this because it's like I tell
people sleep is overrated you know you can do it for a million years later on.
And that's what I told Cassius. I just love the fact that he responded. He
wouldn't have responded like that two years ago if you ask me. He responded
and I know how he felt. Yet I also know what he did. It was pretty impressive.  
  
Q. Tom, I think it's 14 Sweet 16s for you in 22 years. Does it feel like
some of the other ones? How does it feel now?  
TOM IZZO: This one feels better. We were disappointed in '16. We had a real
good team and we had a loss to a team that played better, Middle Tennessee,
and the next year people said we didn't play well. We had injuries to our bigs
and I thought, last year, so many issues. But I look at these guys and these
guys have won 60 games now in two years. That's a hell of an accomplishment
and getting back to the Sweet 16, there's nothing like playing when it stays
daylight longer. You come out of those practices now and the sun is still
shining. It's the greatest feeling in the world.  
  
Q. It seems like Nick Ward has to learn to play again and the team has
to learn to play around him again. That's the next thing to work on, I
imagine?  
TOM IZZO: Think about it, since Nick has been back, we had two practices
before the Big Ten tournament and now we have 1 and a half practices since
then and now we go back Sunday, probably take the day off Monday and then
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday get practice and that's going to be good for him.
I think the guys were good and they wanted to get the ball into him. They know
he's been hurting. He's averaging 17, 18 points a game and it's taken away
from you and you want to get it all back in one possession.  
  
I thought he was really good early and then all of the sudden he started
forcing a few things and then he settled down late and that was a big step to
keep him in there late. So I'm happy for Nick. It's be not easy to do what
he's trying to do. It's not easy for our team. We reinvent the wheel 15 times
this year and now maybe we don't have to reinvent it. We just have to firm it
up a little bit and do a little bit better job of getting these guys to feel
comfortable with each other. Why we turned it over like we did, I mean, I've
never seen Cassius throw hook passes into guys' arms three times or Kenny sit
there and throw it into guys' arms. They either had hellaciously long arms or
my guys were in a fog there a little bit and maybe a combination of both. I
give them credit.  
  
But, you know, even when they bounce back and cut it to 9, not as easy as you
think then to get back off the carpet and do what we did either, you know? It
has been a brutal eight days and I'm just proud as hell of my team for doing
it and the way everybody is responding and now looking forward to going
Washington D.C. That will be a treat. I guess we got LSU. That's been
determined and another challenge.  
  
Thank you, and let me say this: They told me when I got here that this was a
heck of a place to hold one of these, not the biggest city and this and that.
But it was awesome and whoever was in charge of the weather, probably you,
hell of a job. Thank you.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 64, Florida 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the victorious Michigan Wolverines. They will
advance to Anaheim on Thursday. We are joined by student-athletes Jon Teske,
Jordan Poole and Charles Matthews. At this time, Coach, congratulations. We
will take an opening statement.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Florida has had such a great year. They really had us confused
in the first half because they kept changing defenses on us. Their 1-3-1 was
really good. We had what we thought were good looks. They were probably a
little bit from distance that we couldn't knock down. Fortunately we were able
to get stops so they couldn't set the defense in the second half or we found a
new plan that worked much better. We only scored 64 points, these guys holding
them to 49 points is incredible and that's how we won the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For all three of you, you guys have been playing great defense all
year, including the two games here. When it did that become a point of pride
for you guys to play defense that way?  
JORDAN POOLE: Me personally when I got on campus they made a major emphasis on
defense, Coach Ya came in and I think that's what turned everybody around,
everybody brought in and guys from last year on the team still and bringing it
to the team this year is something that we have bought into and something we
pride ourselves on.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: I think that the pride part of it started last summer when
guys were in here playing one-on-one from sunup to sundown. JP was playing
one-on-one, D-Bo, we was playing one-on-ones, and nobody wanted to be the guy
that was embarrassed and talked about the day after on that's what started us
locking up.  
  
JON TESKE: It starts beginning of practice and you don't want to get scored on
and it's the pride part. We don't want to let our brothers down and keeping
each other accountable and just D-ing up.  
  
Q. I don't know how many times Florida players had good looks to the
basket and they significantly altered their shot or passed it out. How nice is
that?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It's huge, and last year we had Mo and he wasn't blocking
those shots. He will tell you that, I'm not Blake Griffin, bro! Just having
him down that helps us to pressure the ball and we know if we make mistakes,
he's behind us and can cover it up.  
  
JORDAN POOLE: Being able to have Jon back there to save us, I got beat earlier
tonight on the backdoor and Jon was able to wall up and being able to have him
as our anchor is definitely huge.  
  
Q. They came out, hit six threes in the first half and then shot 3 of
14, 21% in the second half. What changed defensively? Did you smell blood in
the water? What happened?  
JON TESKE: They got a couple of easy looks. Couple of ball screens thrown over
the top. We were just trying to shut that water off. Six threes in the first
half is a lot for us. We only give up two or three a game and we don't let
that happen.  
  
JORDAN POOLE: Like Jon said, we felt like we needed to make a change and they
were getting shots because they were getting open looks and able to capitalize
on that and having them make tougher baskets and the 2 point percentage is
something that the stats showed they weren't well at and I think it was huge
to contest them and not let them get threes in the second half.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: We wanted to shut off their water. They were getting open
looks and our coaching staff did a great job of recognizing that and we just
followed the game plan.  
  
Q. Jordan, last year in the second round you had that game winner
against Houston, this year 19 points. What is it about the second round? Were
you thinking about that going into the game?  
JORDAN POOLE: I'm just excited to go to California. Being in the position
where we win this game we went to LA last year and now I think we go to
Anaheim, I think that was really about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, perhaps just your perspective on the difference in defense in
the second half, especially 5 and a half minutes without them scoring a point
at a point where it had gotten down to 7. Anything change? Intensity? What?  
JOHN BEILEIN: They have three guys on their team that we talk about they can
get their own jump shot. We have a guy in our league. Carsen Edwards at Purdue
is like that. They have three of them. They're so quick and what happened is
they were on running great ball screen action and we only had a single tag and
it was so high we kept missing it and gave them really good shots. That was a
big difference, gave them really good shots.  
  
Second half, the kids adjusted and did a great job with it. They didn't get as
open is the simple answer. They did not get as open and it was changing. We
did a couple of different things and tried to change up. Andrew Nembhard is so
talented we had to continue to give him different looks. He's just a freshman.
We had to give him looks that he had to discern.  
  
Q. Coach, they all three said "shut the water off" talk about that. Is
that something you guys talk about or did they make it up on the fly?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think we mentioned it, but it's not a catch phrase with us.
But it is something that we're really proud of, our defensive numbers and
there is all the analytics out there, but I think we're one of the very top 10
in the country if not 1 or 2 in DER, et cetera. Charles and Zavier, Jon
protects the rim, Charles and Zavier are "on" guys. Iggy and Jordan are
growing defensively. It's not just the coaches. Those two are on them all the
time to make sure they buy into this idea, you can win scoring 64 points,
right? If you hold them to 49.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
JOHN BEILEIN: There is no question. Charles came off and gave up a three. He
was so upset with himself. Andrew Nembhard hit the 3 behind that scene he
should have never gone behind that screen and he was upset with himself and he
was telling everybody we can't give them anymore threes and they didn't get
too many open ones.  
  
Q. John, playing defense the way you have not just in the tournament but
over the whole season obviously takes buy-in from the players. Did you have to
do a sales job to get them to play this way? Or was it easier than that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think our 33 wins last year was the sales job. They knew it,
right? We had a team with veteran players, Muhammad-Ali was a really good
defender and Duncan Robinson became a good defender. People used to pick on
early and he got so smart with his defense and they saw it firsthand that that
a team could beat really good teams last year, really good teams, with
defense.  
  
Q. Obviously you build the season to peak for these moments these couple
of weeks. Assess the performance of these first two rounds. The scoreboard and
everything would say that it may be went close to script. Would you agree with
that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: You guys are scripting it. I'm not. I thought Montana was a
terrible match-up for us. I think they had all those shooters. They were all
over the place. We continue to, but that's how I think all the time. I'm
always thinking what could happen in this game.  
  
This team with that jump-shooting team and the changing and in defense.
Really, how much can you prep? You walk through. You can't do it at game speed
and that 1-3-1 was very much like the one we played at West Virginia and
Richmond. It was very good, but we couldn't do it live yesterday and I'm
pleased with the way we did it. Was there a script? No, at this time of the
year everybody is good. Anybody can beat anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about that 1-3-1. It seemed in the first half you
got good looks, shots just didn't fall. Did you do something differently in
the second half?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I thought the looks were good, but they were a little deep. We
settled. Maybe we could have got, we have some guys that have the dog fences
on there. They get to the NBA line and they stop instead of shooting no
further than they needed top. But we changed just the geometry of our approach
and changed it several times just to keep giving them different looks and we
discovered during that time when we went to spot A or B they went man-to-man.
This helped us out. The first half had we saw it three possessions all year
and saw it 10 in the first half. It was really the secret to our success at
West Virginia in particular because nobody sees it that played that way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Keyontae Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36760)

### [Andrew Nembhard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36820)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Gators basketball team, Andrew Nembhard, Noah
Locke, Keyontae Johnson. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Keyontae, a lot more presence inside, you guys had a lot of points in
the paint. What do you attribute that to?  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: We just try to go inside first and then go out and hit
threes, but Kevarrius was getting offensive rebounds and getting put-backs and
fouls and I feel like he was a big part to the inside paint.  
  
Q. Andrew, you guys have a tough task against Michigan coming up. What's
the mindset of you guys heading into this match-up?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: The mindset is locking in. We know they're really good
offensively and defensively, so we have to lock in on our personnel, know
their sets, what they're trying to do. I know they have a lot of shooters, so
trying to make them bounce, score twos and limit turnovers for sure.  
  
Q. For you guys, what was it like your first NCAA Tournament experience?
Was it what you expected and have you gotten used to the glitz and the
glamour?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: Yeah, I think it was what we expected. SEC tournament I think
was a good preparation for us, quite similar to this tournament, a lot of
hype, a lot of media around. I think we handled it well.  
  
NOAH LOCKE: Just like what he said, I feel like the SEC was probably good
preparation for us. It's much more media than SEC, but I feel like we were
pretty much prepared for it.  
  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: I also feel the same about the SEC tournament. We play in a
lot of big games, so I try to treat every game like a regular game, not think
about we are in a tournament, just try to play as hard as I can.  
  
Q. There was a moment yesterday in which things could have really
crumbled as the lead got whittled down and down and down. Who was the most
important, whether that was Coach or someone in a huddle in a timeout, who was
there to keep things calm when there would be a chance for everybody to get
rattled?  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: I would say Andrew. He was keeping everybody in check and
trying to keep everybody good, so we weren't like, we had been in these
moments before when teams make a run at the last minute. So Andrew was telling
everybody, we good. Just next play and do our thing and we just took it and we
got the win.  
  
Q. Did you say anything in particular?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: He was just trying to say stay together, but a lot of guys on
the bench were preaching together, so it wasn't just me. Everybody on the team
came together.  
  
Q. Guys, Big Ten, SEC, both tough conferences. When you look at Michigan
on tape do they do anything different than some of the teams in the SEC or
just one of the better teams you played this year?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: I think they're probably the most, like, overall probably the
best overall team we've played all year with a high offensive end and defense
efficiency. I think they're a little different in that they play a slower pace
than the fast SEC teams and the size is a little bit different than some of
the SEC teams. I'm not sure that would change our approach or anything for us.  
  
NOAH LOCKE: I feel like they're probably one of the best shooting teams,
shooting three-point teams we're going to play. They run a lot of sets, too.
We just went through a few of their sets and it was a lot that we had to take
in. We can handle it. It's nothing we can't do.  
  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: I felt like they were a good three-point shooting team. I
would probably say they shoot really well. We looked at the scout and their
guards and bigs can shoot it. So I would say they are probably way better, not
way better, but better overall on the offensive and defensive side.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
Pleasure to have Florida head coach, Mike White. Coach, opening statement?  
  
MIKE WHITE: Thank you. Just excited to be here, excited to play against a team
as prestigious as the Wolverines. Huge opportunity and a challenge for us, and
a team that is good year in and year out throughout the country and the number
one defensive team in the nation as well. Extremely well-coached, prepared,
tough, disciplined. It's going to be a very tough challenge for us, but we're
excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Mike, where did you think you saw Jalen Hudson turn the corner from
what was obviously a pretty struggling first half to first two-thirds of the
season?  
MIKE WHITE: You could probably help me with this. I remember it was a press
conference next door to the office when we talked about the fact that he had
just come off his best two practices of the year. Right? And you could
probably put your thumb on it quicker than I could, but we had planned on
giving him more opportunity that next game and I'm not sure he played great
that next game, but he played. It might have been a road game, if I'm not
mistaken, could it have been at Alabama, maybe? I'm not sure.  
  
But it was midway through the conference season. He earned more minutes and in
that game he played really hard and he played with a renewed level of
intensity and urgency. Then it was either the following game, one of the next
couple of games where he broke through a little bit offensively. From that
point on he brought it in practice every day and started, you could hear his
voice more in practice and in film sessions. He took more ownership, started
trying to help Hayes lead a little bit. He's locked in, day in and day out and
leading where he was vocal on the court in the practice we just concluded. So
just a different side to him about halfway through the conference season. He's
been very good since. He's playing well.  
  
Q. Do you think some of that has -- you always talk about don't let
defense bleed into offense. Do you think when he started making shots that
kinda helped him turn that corner even more so?  
MIKE WHITE: I don't know whether it was him making shots or the fact that he
was really locked in and playing at an intensity level that allowed him to get
more minutes, which allowed him to get more shots and allowed him to score
more. It's like the chicken or the egg, which one comes first?  
  
I don't know which one is a bigger factor, but I think it all correlates. I
know he's in a much better offensive rhythm than he was earlier in the year
and I know he's playing harder as well. It's a really unique situation. It's a
story, you know, of perseverance, the adversity that Jalen Hudson had early in
this season is very unique. The guy was preseason National Player of the Year
candidate. So I can't imagine the things that were going through his head, the
things that he was struggling with. But he continued to remain positive and
continued fighting, and here he is, you know, with a chance potentially to
continue to advance, you know, in the NCAA Tournament. It was very important
to him late in the year. He became pretty vocal, communicated with myself and
our staff and our team that he really wanted to play in the NCAA Tournament.
That was very important to him. So I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. I believe I saw you seated in one of the media rows for the first
half of the Michigan game last night after the victory. I'm curious if there
is anything that your eyes as a coach tell you when you watch your next
opponent that tape might not?  
MIKE WHITE: First and foremost, the size of Jon Teske. His size. Their level
of communication on the court, especially defensively. Their attention to
detail. Their discipline. Their skill level. The fact that they all pass,
dribble and shoot it. I've seen these guys play so much on TV and we all like
watching Michigan play and they're a little closer to us than most programs
because of Darris Nichols and his background of having played for Coach
Beilein. We like to think we've learned a lot watching these guys, but in
person those would be the first things that stuck out.  
  
In addition, I would say the strength that some of these guys, especially
Teske and Livers, I was very familiar with Isaiah, having tried to recruit him
myself.  
  
Q. As the lead was dwindling, in the second half, what did you end up
being most impressed by amongst your team of finding whatever moment, whether
that was huddle or on floor or something to plug the hole in the dam, so to
speak? Who stepped up in the way they needed to?  
MIKE WHITE: Hayes tried to lead as he always has, especially in the last two
or three months. This has become his team. Andrew Nembhard has become a great
leader as a freshman and his voice was heard throughout the second half trying
to pull guys together, demanding effort and poise from his teammates at
timeouts. We never found a great defense rhythm really until the last couple
minutes of the game. So I would say overall the fact that despite having a
long scoring drought and having two or three shots, I think, if I'm not
mistaken, I've moved on to Michigan quickly, but just roll around the rim and
couldn't find a way in for us to settle us in, the free throws and the field
goals that we scored late in the game, you know, the poise to keep plugging
and convert those. I guess those were most important and those were what got
us the win so impressed that we just kept pluggin', didn't allow. We had a
stretch there where we didn't value the ball at a very high level, but then
late in the game we slowed down a little bit, even when we weren't getting
stops, we slowed down and gave ourselves a chance and obviously converted
enough very late.  
  
Q. Is it as simple as consistency then that will be the big difference
if you're able to win tomorrow? Because the starts to both halves last night
were very strong. But is it just maybe a more balanced 40-minute effort? I
hate to boil it down to something as simple as that, but that might be it?  
MIKE WHITE: I don't know that we were inconsistent. Obviously, we were. I
don't know that it was us losing edge and intensity and focus as much as it
was Nevada changing what they were doing and speeding us up. We tried to
control tempo and I think for the most part we did. We definitely did in the
first 20 and early in the second half but when they started running and
jumping at us and making us play faster, making us play downhill and making
basketball plays by having two on the basketball, it just changed the entire
outlook of the whole game. It changed the tempo. It changed our level of
confidence, their level of confidence.  
  
So I think that was pretty unique. I don't know that we'll see any of that in
tomorrow's game. But do we need to be consistent for forty minutes to beat
these guys? Absolutely. We're going to have to play our best game of the year
to beat Michigan. We're going to have to be consistent offensively and
defensively on the glass, going to have to play with great confidence and
great focus.  
  
Q. Simpson has been a guy whose passing has helped drive the motor for
that offense, especially in the Big Ten tournament, carving apart zones.
What's the strategy to neutralize his passing and play making ability?  
MIKE WHITE: He's had a great year. He's more than 3-1 turnover ratio, plays at
a great tempo. He's tough with the basketball. He's strong. Again, they really
space you out. They run great actions, and he's a guy with the ball in his
hands a bunch who is responsible for, you know, the pass leading to the
basket. We've got to have great focus of course on him and he demands that,
but the guys that are finishing those passes are equally as important. We've
got to be there on the catch with shooters, our ball screen defense has got to
be great. Our base principles will be tested in terms of just simply staying
in a stance and being alert and communicating. All of those factors that help
you succeed defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Michigan's size. Nevada came at you with a lot
of size, yet you guys seemed to handle it. There was a point of emphasis
heading into Nevada? Did you adjust for that and are you going to do the same
thing against Michigan or just play your game?  
MIKE WHITE: We're just going to be who we are. We have been undersized all
year. Keith Stone went out with an ACL, and we had another four-man transfer
for us at Christmas. Keyontae Johnson became our 4-man by necessity. He's not
a 4-man. He's a wing and we don't another 4 off the bench. So Keyontae's back-
ups are our guards as well. This group has become really, really scrappy and
they haven't made any excuses. They continue to battle. We'll do so tomorrow.  
  
We've consistently played really hard, defended with intensity, fought,
battled, haven't always made all the right plays, but defensively for the most
part and on the glass, our guys give it their all, led my Kevarrius Hayes.
That said, I do think Nevada did hurt us with their size at times especially
on the offensive glass. I believe they had 19 offensive rebounds if I'm not
mistaken. Size, again, will be key tomorrow. Hopefully we can neutralize it
with just making big plays, getting two-handed plays, getting loose balls,
playing physical, but playing clean as well. Especially on the interior.  
  
Q. He said last night that he still isn't 100% healthy, but Charles
Matthews looked the part. I think Coach is trying to build his physicality up
after being out. Do you try to tire him out? What are the perils of trying to
do something like that? How problematic is he no matter what his health is
at?  
MIKE WHITE: Really good player. We're not going to concern ourselves at all
with how healthy he is, how good he's feeling. He's a good offensive player,
good defense player, active, athletic. He's got a lot of experience. We're
going to run our stuff and try to defend him at the highest level possible,
but I can't imagine that's a big factor in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the dais our student-athletes from the University of
Minnesota, Dupree McBrayer and Amir Coffey. Questions for our student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Amir, when this team was sort of at its low point late in the season,
7-10 in conference, from that point on you seem to have taken your game to a
new level. Did you feel like at that point the team needed someone to lift it
to get where it needed to go?  
AMIR COFFEY: Not really. I just knew we had to stay the course and keep
playing and, you know, we didn't really change anything. For offensive schemes
or defense schemes, we just kept playing hard. Some of those games we were
losing they were like 1-2 point games and we were close, but we had to
overcome those losses and push through.  
  
Q. Amir, playing Michigan State, good thing or bad thing? What do you
remember about that first meeting?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, we're going to be ready for anybody that is put up
against us, so I would say it's a good thing. We're happy to play Michigan
State or Bradley. The first time at their place, our offense just wasn't
clicking. They had some good defense possessions on us and on the defense side
we weren't rebounding very well. They had a lot of second-chance points and we
were pretty bad in transition. So we're going to sharpen up on those three
categories and be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Guys, the Big Ten hasn't had a match-up like this in the history of
the NCAA Tournament, especially this early and since it's expanded to 64
teams. After the conference schedule, first of all how much of a grind was 20
games for you guys; and second of all, do you think it's fair that the Big Ten
should be matched up this early in the tournament?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, we don't really try to get into that. However, the NCAA
Tournament does the seeds and the match-up is how they do it. We have no
control over that. We just have to be ready for whoever we are matched up
against. We try not to get into that.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Same thing as Amir said, we're not worried about who we
playin', or like, how the seeding was. We're just ready to go out there and
play hard.  
  
Q. Dupree, Coach Pitino talks about how this team doesn't really have a
pulse. Is that something that this unit takes pride in, it doesn't get rattled
too easily, you're not too overly emotional?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: I would say he's the one who is usually getting on us about,
like, showing emotion and stuff like that. We don't get fazed and I think that
really helps us because even though he gets on us and we're sitting there calm
looking at him, like, with a blank face. I think that kinda helps us in the
games.  
  
Q. Amir, for you specifically in the first Michigan State match-up, was
there anything they did to slow you down or was that just an off-night and
what has to be different in the rematch?  
AMIR COFFEY: I thought they were connected on the defensive end. They did well
with the ball defense and guarding smash actions pretty well. So they were
doing things like jumping to the ball and helping the helper. They just played
solid that game. And I was off that night as well. So they just did a good job
the first time.  
  
Q. Amir, with a lot of ups and downs this season what have you learn
about the resiliency of this group as one of the leaders of the team?  
AMIR COFFEY: Just how resilient we are through the highs and lows. We have had
some good points through the season and we've also had some low points. We
went on a losing streak three or four games and everybody stayed confident and
stayed the course. Just that, having that factor with our team really helps
and I think it's one of the reasons why we got to this point.  
  
Q. Amir, I was wondering when you guys are playing a Big Ten team
obviously how is the prep different in this short turnaround? I know you only
played 'em once, but it's a program you guys are familiar with versus prep for
Louisville or other NCAA situations where it's a team that you don't have as
much familiarity with. Can you go deeper because you are familiar or could you
compare and contrast?  
AMIR COFFEY: I would say on the Louisville prep we focused a little more on
personnel and player tendencies because we've never played them before. With
the prep like Michigan State, you can focus on what they're doing in their
schemes because we already know all the players and what they like to do
already. So I would say that's the biggest difference. But it's really the
same, go over plays, watch film and get ready for the game.  
  
Q. Dupree, you guys played in Chicago three games. Where is the fatigue
factor coming out of a long stretch of games like that back-to-back-to-back
coming out and getting ready for a NCAA Tournament?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Coach gave us some time off, two days. We were able to
prepare. Got good reps in. Was able to take everything game like, so there is
not really any fatigue.  
  
Q. As a team yesterday, you guys really kind of had maybe your best
shooting performance of the season, particularly Gabe. Is that something that
you guys sort of think about for tomorrow? Is it just totally new game, new
slate?  
AMIR COFFEY: I would say it's a new slate. We gotta get past the last one, who
shot the ball well. But it might not be like that tomorrow, so go into the
game focusing on what we need to do and hopefully we shoot the ball like that
again. It would obviously help us, but if we're not we gotta find different
ways to score.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Same thing he said, new slate. Hopefully we shoot the ball
that well tomorrow and if we don't we have to find a way to impact the game
and make points.  
  
Q. What would you guys have in your mind about how you thought fans
would travel yesterday? When the crowd really got behind you, even for that
early game, what did that feel like? What are you hoping for tomorrow maybe
now that there is another chance for folks to make the 3 and a half hour drive
down?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, personally to me it kinda felt like a home game, just
because of the simple fact that we had so many fans there and they were loud
and active the whole game. So shout out to them for making that drive for us.
They gave us a lot of energy. It was a really good turnout. When we got our
seeding and found out we were playing here we were very hopeful that they
would come out for us and they did.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Yeah, definitely felt like a home game. The place mostly felt
like a lot of Gopher fans and we're really thankful for their support and
hopefully we get the same crowd tomorrow.  
  
Q. Amir, did you ever have a conversation with Coach Pitino about
increasing your minutes to the point where you were really going to be playing
full games here down the stretch? And do you embrace that as part of your
skill set to be able to play 40 a game?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, he didn't really mention it to me that I was going to
start playing the full game. I think it's something that he just tried out,
and I think it really just goes on a game-to-game basis. So if I come out or
not it's just whatever helps the team, but there was no conversation there.  
  
First time playing for him it was tough at first, just getting my fatigue
right. But after a while I kinda got used to it. After the second or third
game I kinda got used to it and just gave the team what I had.  
  
Q. Amir, being someone that grew up in Minnesota and having the chance
to win an NCAA Tournament game yesterday, what does that do for you and kind
of the pride of being from Minnesota?  
AMIR COFFEY: It was really cool. Especially for the other guys from Minnesota
on the team. You know, just being from Minnesota and having it across your
chest winning an NCAA Tournament game, especially in front of all of our fans
that made that drive for us. It was a special feeling.  
  
Q. Amir, obviously your dad played for the Gophers. What was his
reaction after the win and what did he say to you?  
AMIR COFFEY: He was excited, obviously. I looked over at him a couple times
during the game and he was yelling and on his feet. He definitely had high
energy. Just told me what I could do better, gave me tips on my shot and just
was excited for myself and my teammates and said to keep going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks very much. Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
Pleased to welcome Coach Richard Pitino.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Obviously excited for our program and our players to be able
to advance in this tournament. Being here two years ago was great, and, you
know, as a program you're always trying to move forward. So to be able to
improve on getting to the tournament and advancing is huge. I loved the way
that we played. Obviously we won, but I thought we played very, very well in
every phase yesterday versus Louisville. Our guys battled and now we gotta be
ready, obviously, because Michigan State, terrific, terrific team who is
playing as good as any team in the country. They've got Cassius Winston who is
probably one of the best point guards in the country and a lot of really good
pieces around them, and obviously Coach Izzo does a terrific job. So it's
going to be a tough job for us, but we're excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen differently from Michigan State in the
paint with Tillman obviously replacing Ward as far as their go-to guy
inside?  
RICHARD PITINO: Ward is still a factor. They've got a lot of depth.
Unfortunately, they've dealt with some injuries. But they're still going to be
who Michigan State is. The bigs are going to run court, duck you in early,
pound the glass. They're relentless, you know. They're physically relentless
and that's been the consistent theme with that team every single year that
we've played them. So there is not a whole lot of drop-off.  
  
Q. Obviously this is a unique situation having Michigan State in the
second round. Is it actually a benefit for you just having the short
turnaround time and being able to prep for the game because you know their
team so well already?  
RICHARD PITINO: I would rather place somebody else and not know them. I guess
from a prep standpoint it's easier, but just because we know who they are,
obviously we know they're very, very good. I'm not sure it's an advantage,
necessarily, but from a short prep time, these guys know what Michigan State
is all about. We got a lot of respect for how they do things. It's important
to get rest. When you play a physical game like we played yesterday it's
important to get rest. But watching the film and putting together a game plan
on the court as well as in the film room is important.  
  
Q. What's the difference in your team between now and the one we saw in
East Lansing in February.  
RICHARD PITINO: That was not a very good team at the time. We were struggling,
allowing them to get out on the break. Cassius was very good. McQuaid was very
good. Nick Ward really hurt us down low. Curry went down with calf issues.
Playing at Michigan State is very, very hard. But we've got some confidence
going now, beat Purdue twice in ten days. They're a terrific team, went in and
beat a surging Penn State team and beat a Louisville team yesterday. So
probably a confidence factor, feeling those wins, tasting them, offensively we
played well and defensively did a lot of good things.  
  
So I think more than anything playing in the middle of the Big Ten versus the
NCAA Tournament, probably mentally these guys are more locked in and feeling
great about where they are and also understanding the challenges that lie
ahead.  
  
Q. Richard this will be your 24th game against a Big Ten opponent, same
with Michigan State. I'm curious with the 20-game schedule and the way the
brackets fell out, do you think it was fair or just, I know you guys can only
do what the Committee gives you. But should the Big Ten have been matched up
this early and also with a chance to have a 25th game if Maryland gets through
for one of you guys?  
RICHARD PITINO: You're not going to hear me complain. I don't care who we
play. You're never going to hear me complain about that. We're going to play
who is in front of us. Michigan State is a terrific team. In order to go to a
Sweet 16 you're never going to play easy games. We take what we get. We're
excited to be in this tournament and obviously excited about an opportunity to
go play for the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Kenny Goins have been a player for Michigan State who has been a
pivotal role player all year. He's struggled as of late, but how do you game
plan for a guy who has been in so many different roles throughout the years?  
RICHARD PITINO: Testament to him that he's gotten so much better. Works his
butt off. Obviously his story is great, can shoot the ball, last night didn't
shoot as well. But he's a much better shooter than that. The things they will
put you in, run pick and pops, run ball screens, dive him, lift the 4 man up.
So you've got to be ready to guard him. And a three-point shot that's part of
their offense and they're going to rebound it. For him he's very versatile,
tough, and he has the ability to stretch the defense. So it's a tough match-up
for us.  
  
Q. Given the extended run in the Big Ten tournament this is looking at
the fifth game in a really short period of time. How comfortable are you
energy-wise with where your guys are at and what have you done to keep them
fresh with this unique situation?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I mean, obviously with Matz who is going through the
concussion protocol and Jordan Murphy who had back spasms yesterday and guys
playing major minutes. Amir Coffey didn't come out. Dupree played a lot. Rest
is important. As a coach, you've got to make sure that whatever you do with
your team benefits the team not necessarily you as a coach. Coaches sometimes
like to make themselves feel better on the practice court where it may not
always be beneficial for them. So with one day off, you gotta get rest. It's
very, very important to keep them off their feet and make sure they are
getting rehab and all those things and also understand what the game plan is.  
  
Q. Richard, watching your team since you played Michigan State earlier
in the season, you guys have evolved. You're not the same team. I'm curious
how has Michigan State evolved or have they stayed the course?  
RICHARD PITINO: They're always pretty good. You know, I mean, they've been
pretty consistent since I've coached against them. They've got the certain
pillars or the way they want to play. They don't deviate from them a whole
lot. Cassius is so rock solid with everything that he does. Nick Ward on and
off with injuries. Those younger guys are getting better. Henry is an X factor
for them on the glass. They've been good for a long time. Coach Izzo is one of
the best for a reason. They are a good basketball team and they beat Michigan
three times and Michigan is a really, really good team.  
  
Q. Coaches yesterday found some spotlight for heated interaction with
Aaron Henry. What's your take on how that unfolded from watching the video of
it? Could you comment on what your reaction to basically the national reaction
has been? There has been some negative and positive, but there has been a lot
of it, regardless. What's your take on that?  
RICHARD PITINO: I can tell you this, I'm not surprised that there is outrage.
There is outrage with everything that goes on with everything that any of us
do, so that's not a surprise. As for Coach Izzo, I've coached against him for
six years and I've never seen a group of players that play harder, respect and
love more than Coach Izzo. He's going to be hard on them, but every single
player when he talks to them, arm around them. He's tough on them. He should
be tough on them. He's in the Hall of Fame, and I didn't see too much of all
of that. But I know his players love playing for him. I was at Michigan State
when they had the National Championship team with Magic Johnson and all those
guys that came back, and I don't know how many missed that. That's a testament
to Coach Izzo. Those players are lucky to play for him. Every time I coach
against him I learn something from him, so I have 1000% respect for him more
than any other coach I've ever faced.  
  
Q. Richard, just being from in the locker room now and on Wednesday
seems like your team has a good camaraderie off the court. In your opinion,
how does that translate on the court and do you put much stock in the whole
team chemistry thing?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's important from a chemistry standpoint to have off the
court a respect level for each other as human beings and obviously as
teammates. It's important but you've got to develop that on the court, too.
That's just as important as being friends, hanging out together. There's got
to be a chemistry on the court in the heat of the battle, when adversity hits
being able to talk to each other, being able to push each other, being able to
address something on the court the right way talking to each other and you're
probably going to do. You're going to be better at that if you like each other
and respect each other. Winning helps that, having good kids like we do also
helps that as well.  
  
Q. Richard, certainly Izzo is not going to let Gabe take open looks.
What is the counter to how you expect Michigan State to defend him?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, Louisville has got a terrific defense and
offensively I thought we executed very well. We rebounded the ball well. It
all starts with us with our defense. If we can defend we can rebound and it
allows us to get out on the break. That's been kind of the ingredient for us
all year. When we've been good we've been able to defend. It's all about
execution. We're all going to know everything that we're doing this time of
year. It's just a matter of how hard do you cut, how hard do you screen, how
well do you move the ball and share it?  
  
Q. Richard, the last seven games are arguably the best stretch of Amir's
career. Looking at the big picture how have you seen him develop the last
three years to get to where he is now?  
RICHARD PITINO: Just been a normal, natural progression. Everybody is in a
rush to skip steps. For Amir he was An All-freshman player in the Big Ten.
Played the most minutes in the league for a team that was a 5 seed in the NCAA
Tournament, and last year he was playing well and unfortunately he had season-
ending surgery. He's healthy and he's reliable and what he's attacking the
right way he's tough to keep in front and tough when he's getting to the
basket. He's played a lot of games forty minutes. That's hard to do. He's
quietly a fierce, fierce competitor.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke about Gabe's professionalism and work ethic. How
have you tried to use that as an example for other guys or has it inherently
rubbed on off on them?  
RICHARD PITINO: There is no better peer pressure than seeing somebody like
Gabe when you break for practice and you can either go to the locker room, the
training room, you can shoot half court shots, mess around with your teammates
or Gabe Kalscheur will go straight to the corner and do a shooting routine,
doesn't matter. He did it today. Doesn't matter where we are, when we're
playing, what game we played the night before, that does not affect him. When
he shoots free throws and he does his free throw shooting routine. Every free
throw he points up to the sky for whatever reason. He does that when he is
practicing. He is methodical in his approach and you see what he did last
night. I would hope that would motivate our guys. It would motivate me.  
  
Q. Obviously we know yesterday Jordan is going to play regardless, but
how is he doing healthwise; and Matz, if he doesn't play what do you like from
the guys off the bench?  
RICHARD PITINO: Matz is going through the concussion protocol, so it's day-by-
day there. We don't really know. Jordan has improved. He was struggling,
laboring through that second half. We got a lot of treatment for him. We
didn't go full-go today in practice by any means, but we held him out. But I
would anticipate knowing the way I know Jordan I would be very surprised if he
doesn't play.  
  
Q. When you first started recruiting Gabe Kalscheur what were a few
things that stood out about him?  
RICHARD PITINO: The ability to hit shots. I know he played on a really good
AAU team and he would have games where he would hit five, six threes. I did
see kind of like that business-like approach, which I really liked. He's a
good person, cares about being a good person, cares about winning.  
  
Those are guys that the more I'm in the Big Ten you win with guys like that.
Guys that are smart players, take this thing seriously, not afraid of contact,
not afraid to guard the best player. I mean, it's kind of amazing because he
didn't have a lot of high, major offers. But he was a guy that we identified
with, we didn't care about rankings or anything like that and we wanted him.
He's been a great player, had a really good freshman year.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about how even keeled this team is. You have used the
phrase that they didn't have a pulse?  
RICHARD PITINO: Did I say that?  
  
Q. I think so. And guys like Amir are competitive. Do you think that
even keel approach is a form of competitiveness and how do you see it play
out?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think it's a strength. I do think when you're in the Big Ten
and you're playing 20 league games and you're in, like we talked about, all
the outrage in today's world you can't get too high or too low. You really
can't, because it's going to happen. There is no running from that part of it
in our profession today, especially with social media. So you need to be able
to, if you lose two or three in a row in the Big Ten you just gotta move on.
You've got to learn from every single game that you play in. Guys have had
nights where they haven't hit shots and they've stayed the course. You have to
do that. It's a long, long season.  
  
We're playing our best basketball now and I think a lot of that has to do with
kinda the mentality of the team. They really don't get too high. They really
don't get too low.  
  
Q. Just how do you see your bigs, whether it's Daniel and Jordan or
whoever else off the bench matching up against Xavier Tillman, Ward and
Goins?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's not easy. They're big, strong, physical, and you try to
game plan for it, but when you don't have that on your roster it's hard to
see. So obviously playing against them opens our eyes a little bit. But there
is not a lot of front courts with that size and that physicality and as
relentless as they are. We're going to have to do a great job on those guys.
That's extremely important when you're playing Michigan State.  
  
Q. Coach, winning an NCAA Tournament game hasn't happened much in the
last 20 years. What does that do for the program moving forward and obviously
having kids on the team from Minnesota having big moments like Gabe and Daniel
and Amir?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, when you are building a program, winning, facilities,
all that stuff is great, but at the end of the day winning is what sells your
program more than anything. From a recruiting standpoint when you see a guy
like Gabe Kalscheur and Daniel and Amir and Jarvis and Michael, those are five
kids playing in a NCAA Tournament game and helping us win and advance, that
sells more than anything else. Their families are in the stands, and, you
know, they're excited about it. You see an arena that's filled with Gopher
fans. That's what playing college basketball is all about. You see these
players are getting better and getting that exposure. That's a dream come
true. To hear Gabe Kalscheur I get chills and I'm not just saying that, but to
hear Kevin Harlan calling that, that's special even for me. Winning helps and
you need to be able to capitalize off that success and continue to get good
recruiting classes.  
  
Q. Did you do anything to commemorate the win or do you have any well
wishes that you would like to speak of?  
RICHARD PITINO: I went to dinner. Is that something? I went to dinner with my
wife and my brother. No, other than that, just move on. It's a great win, you
know? It's a great win. But in this tournament, it's like anything else, I
told our team you got to the tournament which is a goal. Are you just happy to
be here or would you like to make some noise? Obviously they showed the
ability to do that versus a really good Louisville team. Now you've got your
one game away from a Sweet 16. You've got to beat a really, really good
Michigan State team. So, no, I didn't do anything besides get a bite to eat
and watch film and try to find our guys a way to beat a really, really good
Michigan State team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Matt McQuaid, Cassius Winston and Nick Ward.
Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For all of you playing a Big Ten team in the NCAA Tournament probably
not something you guys were necessarily expecting. How is the prep different?
How do you guys expect the game to go considering it's a team that you're more
familiar with?  
NICK WARD: To be honest, we played them earlier this year. So we do know a
little bit about them and of course they're a Big Ten team. So it will be a
little bit of a challenge, so we have to come out and play hard.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like Nick said, we played them before. So we probably know
their tendencies a little bit better and they probably know ours better and
it's not going to come down to X's and O's. It's going to come down to who
plays the hardest.  
  
MATT McQUAID: Playing each other earlier in the season they're a different
team now and they're good. We just gotta be ready.  
  
Q. Nick, curious how you're conditioning? How do you feel it's coming
along? Do you feel like you're making progress? Secondly, how are you doing in
terms of catching entry passes? Has that part been an adjustment in your
recovery?  
NICK WARD: My condition has come along. I've made great strides. Last week
wasn't the best. This week I'm starting to feel normal and stuff like that. As
far as catching the ball it is a bit of a challenge. Catching hard entry
passes was my thing for a while, but since it's on my left hand it has made it
challenging. But it's something I have to get used to.  
  
Q. Nick, for you personally and also for Kenny and X, going up against
Jordan Murphy and Daniel Oturu, how do you think you match-up against their
bigs?  
NICK WARD: Well, you know, their bigs are very talented and rebound and work
hard. That's something we all do. And we just the got to know their tendencies
at the end of the day and box out. That's a big part of our game plan, you
know. In order for us to win we're going to have to contain them on the boards
and contain them as best we can.  
  
Q. Matt and Cassius, Amir Coffey has been playing more of the point the
last few games since you guys have played each other and he's put together a
string of games where he's really put the team on his back and carried
Minnesota to the tournament. From a defense standpoint, how do you make
adjustments on a guy who has suddenly gotten hot or has become a lot more
successful at finding his game?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: I think this is a better question for Matt and those guys,
the stoppers. Like I said, he's been playing really, really well and doing a
lot for that team. You've got to watch the film, watch his tendency and just
try to make it as uncomfortable as possible for him. He's a good player, so
he's going to make things happen. But if you put him in uncomfortable
situations you got a better chance.  
  
MATT McQUAID: He's a big reason why they're playing so well and watching the
film and executing the coach's game plan is the main thing in stopping a
player like that and trusting each other on the court and having each other's
back.  
  
Q. Cassius, your coach yesterday was praising your leadership more than
your play. He was saying it was as well as you've ever led. Can you talk about
holding players accountable and being a buffer between the players and your
coach?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yes, I've grown a lot in that area, being more comfortable,
being vocal, and like I said, my teammates, they trust me. So I wouldn't steer
them the wrong way. Took a while to gain their trust and things like that. So
I wouldn't steer my teammates the wrong way and Coach trusts me, too, to give
'em that message and stuff like that.  
  
Q. You probably have heard the reaction that Coach got nationally for
the moment yesterday on the floor with his passion coming out. Everybody who
plays for him comes out and just says that he's one of the best leaders that
you could possibly have. Explain to us why Coach Izzo's style works for you as
a basketball player as you try to lead and grow in yourself?  
NICK WARD: Well, you know, Coach, him yelling yesterday was a sign that he
wants the best for you and he wants to push you to be the best you can be on
and off court. That's something we harp on in this program and something we
build around, just making players into young men.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Coach is filled with passion and emotion and love, you know,
those are the main things that make him as great as he is. When he's getting
after you or when he's yelling it's never out of harm. It's never out of hate.
It's literally him wanting the best for you and him challenging you and
pushing you the best you can be and it's worked for years and years and years.
He's a great coach and even a better person. Him yelling, he is the first one
to yell and he will be the first one to cry when something bad or good
happens. It's all emotion and it's all him caring for you.  
  
MATT McQUAID: Like they said, it's a lot of love and you feel that when you
get here and talk to him. He's got a passion that's crazy for this game and we
all had the same goal and that was to win the game yesterday and you could
feel that in the huddle. We just wanted to win.  
  
Q. Guys, question for all three of you, Cassius you spoke yesterday
about needing to settle into the tournament, the confidence and the nerves and
everything that comes along with this tournament. Talk about where are you now
compared to where you were 26 hours ago, nerveswise.  
NICK WARD: I feel like this isn't our first rodeo. We know what to expect, you
know, and we're experienced guys, you know. We got two juniors and a senior up
here. I feel like our mindset was just to win the game yesterday. That's the
whole mindset of the tournament is to survive and advance.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like I said, the first game is always going to be difficult,
just the rhythm of it, the pace of it, the referees, all the type of stuff
you've got to adjust to and I feel like now we got that out of the way we can
focus on the game of basketball, focus on our opponent at hand.  
  
MATT McQUAID: We had to take it one game at a time; and like Cassius said,
everything is important and now we just got to get ready for a good Minnesota
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen. Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
Welcome head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, Tom Izzo. At this time we will
have an opening statement.  
  
TOM IZZO: We are excited to be here. I don't know if I'm as excited to play
another Big Ten team. We just did it for 20 games and we just did it for three
in the Big Ten tournament, but that's the way the schedule it. Everybody asked
me is it easier to prepare for a team, we were two completely different teams
than we were a month and a half ago. We didn't have Kenny Goins in that game.
We did have Kyle Ahrens. We had Nick Ward full go and he played very well on
the other side of the coin. Amir Coffey wasn't a shadow of the player he is
right now, and Gabe Kalscheur is playing much, much better. Murphy and Oturu
are playing better. We have only played once. It was a long time ago and the
prep feels brand new. I'm proud of where we are. I'm excited for Richard
because he went through hell there in early part of the Big Ten season with
some injuries of his own and he got that team back playing and they're playing
as good as anybody in the league. That was proven in the Big Ten tournament.  
  
Q. Tom, you have long said since you started you wanted to build a
program and earn respect. Richard Pitino just said every time he's coached
against you he's learned something and there is no coach in America that he
has more respect for. Your program has it, but so do you. As an elder
statesman in the game are you able to appreciate that appreciation and
respect?  
TOM IZZO: What a kind way of saying you old man, elder statesman. That's
pretty good. I gotta remember that. Richard, hey, same boat, I remember going
against his dad and learning things from him. But I have watched his career
because it's not easy to do what he did at his age and kinda go through the
tough times of the job, but he's survived them. I think that's the greatest
part. You know, he's not only survived them, but he's got his team playing the
best its playing. Who doesn't love a kid like Murphy? If you're me you
definitely love him because he can be rebound with anybody in the world. He's
set some records. He's a tough kid, yet a humble kid. I recruited Amir Coffey.
I know how good he is. Unfortunately, for us he might be playing at the best
level. It's great to go against people that, you know, players that you admire
and a young coach who is coming into it and setting these standards that he's
set coming off the canvas like they did early on when they struggled a little
bit early on and now playing their best basketball. So hats off to him, too.  
  
Q. Given the make-up of Minnesota's roster, why has Gabe Kalscheur as a
freshman developed into such a match-up problem for a lot of teams?  
TOM IZZO: Because it's hard. Who do you guard him with? You've gotta guard.
Amir Coffey has become a point forward and Amir Coffey and Dupree McBrayer, if
there is one thing that's changed on this team they're getting into the paint
a lot, and they can see over people, 6'7", 6'5", they're athletic, long. They
shoot good enough, but they can get into that paint and look over people and
if you get into the paint you gotta help at all, they've got two true Big Ten
big men that are rebounding the ball. They're physical down there. So I just
think in general, Gabe Kalscheur, if you double down, he's a spot-up shooter.
If he penetrates the guards are big enough to find him. He moves pretty well
without the ball. I watched him in AAU tournaments and the kid can flat out
shoot it. He had 17 against us the first time, but you can just see everybody
is becoming better because those freshmen become sophomores at this time.  
  
Q. I know that you were real close with the late Flip Saunders and you
have had talks with Ryan. Has he's gone through a tough year? Are you speaking
to him and are they late night conversations like you had with Flip?  
TOM IZZO: Not as late as with Flip. He used to watch what was that, QVC, or
whatever it was, I think he bought cheap watches and cheap coats there. Flip
was a special guy. I got to know Ryan early on through Flip and when he played
at Minnesota. I'm so impressed with what Ryan has done. I talked to him the
day he was being offered the job. I was up in Minnesota earlier in the year.
We scrimmaged Gonzaga and spent some time with him over at the hotel. It's a
sad deal, a really sad deal, because not only one of the great coaches in the
profession but one of the great guys. I remember going up there for the
funeral and the coaches that flew in, Popovich, Doc Rivers, they had games
that night and they flew up. That's respect beyond respect. With Ryan, I
watched the first night what he won his first game and got his little shower
and everything, and I said how was that? He said, I had my suit on. I said,
trust me. Enjoy it. Hope it happens a lot because it never happens enough!  
  
He's doing a great job. It's not easy to do what he did. I see that team. I
read some of the comments by some of those players, and if he can hang on I
think he's going to be a star in that league before he is done. I really do.  
  
Q. What are some of the challenges associated with defending someone
like Jordan Murphy and how big of a challenge has he been over the years?  
TOM IZZO: God, he's a rebounding machine, you know, and I love rebounders.
Every time we play him at the end of the game, I guess I secretively would be
trying to get him to transfer immediately because I love the kid. He's humble,
he's got no ego, he doesn't talk it, he just is does it. Who doesn't love a
kid like that? What he's done a better job of is putting the ball on the floor
a lot better. He never used to be able to shoot the ball over his left
shoulder. He was a right hander who shot it over his right shoulder which was
weird. I think he's developing and his game. I think Richard and he both
deserve credit for that. But he is a lot different and I think a better player
than the one we faced a month and a half, two months ago, whenever it was.  
  
Q. I know there was a lot not to like yesterday but in terms of, it was
a win and you're moving on. So what did you like in terms of items or moments
or observations that you saw that can help the team however far the rest of
this tournament run goes?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I liked the way that we sucked it up, you know, I mean, it was
a tough week with the three games and the travel. A lot of people have to do
something like this, but it was hard. I think Kenny Goins, you know, he played
like 39, 40 minutes in those games in Chicago and had to play a ton of minutes
last night and I thought struggled a little bit. But I thought Cassius is
feeling better. The toe is better. The knee is better. Still got fatigued a
little bit, but I think healthwise he's better and Xavier came on.  
  
I think a big key for us right now, because we need a lift, too, is getting
Nick back. Nick came back when he probably wasn't ready to come back. It
wasn't anything that was going to damage his hand. I just mean physically
ready and conditioning. He got the approval to go and it was like playing.
Nick has played very well against Minnesota and I was hoping to get him a few
more minutes last night. When you play those smaller teams they got guys that
can pick and pop and shoot threes or put the ball on the floor. Now we're
getting back into more traditional teams and I'm hoping to get Nick in there
more and get a real rotation so Kenny and X get a little more rest. On the
perimeter we are what we are. There might even be times we can move Kenny
around to different positions. So we'll see. I liked the competitiveness. I
liked the fact that we dealt with some adversity and handled it. I like the
fact that Cassius really took over the game again like a good point guard
should. Matt McQuaid hit a couple big shots. Aaron Henry made the big post
move and a couple of free throws and I had to love the fact that you go 26 for
27 or 25 for, whatever we did from the free throw line. It was a couple years
ago when we were a disaster. So I think our coaches and our players deserve a
lot of credit. They've worked on it. They made all their free throws and Kenny
apologized to them for missing that one and didn't bother me any.  
  
Q. Tom, you talked about Kenny playing a lot of minutes. I believe he's
4 for the last 18 from three over his last three games. He said yesterday that
his shot felt flat. What are you seeing from a fatigue standpoint or
mechanically about his shot?  
TOM IZZO: I think there are two things when your shot is a little flat means
you're not getting enough lift with your legs, but I also think people are
playing him different and without Nick in there you can press up on the
perimeter because you don't have to worry as much down low. So a combination
of things. Kenny still found a way to get 9 rebounds and do some things and
that stretch for him, what he did was one of the reasons we won the Big Ten in
the Big Ten tournament. I think just being here a day and getting through that
first game, last night's walkthrough, today's walkthrough there is a little
bit more of a freshness to this team. I think we will be ready to go. We're
going to have to be because they're playing their best basketball of the
season.  
  
Q. Tom, you always talked about player-coached team being better than a
coach-coached team, what does it mean for you that Cassius can project your
message and help the young guys?  
TOM IZZO: Cassius has grown a lot. I always kid him because his freshman year
wasn't a walk in the park or all roses either, but who's was? It's amazing the
calls you get at this time of year from former players and everybody,
freshman, that's why you're called a freshman. You don't know anything. You
have no idea what it takes to win because you've never been at this level. So
I always believed that leadership, and I think Matt McQuaid and Cassius
Winston have done a phenomenal job. My whole thing with him is let's take your
defense to another level and your leadership to another level and he keeps
answering the bell, you know?  
  
I get proud of people when I see a change, especially change in an area that
maybe as a lot of people say, well that's his personality. I've always said,
you gotta change your personality, too, if you want to be a great or elite
player. I think Cassius is really working on that. So I'm proud of him for
that. He came in to a huddle one time when he made some mistakes and a couple
of turnovers and that 7-8 point lead went down to minus 1 for us. When people
take blame that is such a beautiful thing nowadays. He's just turning into a
good leader, a great player, and able to do some things because he is the even
keeled guy on my team. You know, there is nobody like Cassius. He's learning
how to use that to his advantage.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the Big Ten going 6-0 so far at March Madness. What
does that say about the conference and the toughness?  
TOM IZZO: It's one of the rare times in my whole life that I ever pull from my
in-state rival for a little bit. I have to do it because I don't think the Big
Ten sometimes gets the respect it deserves, you know? I said all year I
thought ours was the best conference top to bottom and you can argue that a
million different ways and there is no way to prove it. One way to prove it is
to just keep winning and when I see all those Big Ten teams winning, I just
watched Iowa before I came here and I had my Hawkeye jersey on, especially
when you've been in the league as long as I have and I'm the guy who has been
here the most years. It's not only part of my job, part of my obligation. I do
feel my school is Michigan State, but I have a sense of ownership for the Big
Ten, too, and I think it's been great. That's the only part that's
disappointing, that we gotta face each other in the second weekend, at least
us and Minnesota do. But I hope the league keeps winning.  
  
Q. Tom, I know you've talked about how Minnesota is different than the
first time you played 'em. What about you guys? You were coming off a losing
streak and busting out. How different is your team since then?  
TOM IZZO: It is different. Kenny is back and he wasn't there but for a couple
of minutes of that game. Kyle is not there and he played in that game and
maybe the biggest difference was I think Nick had 22 or 20 points. And Nick is
pretty good defensively, especially on a good post player. Now, I think a guy
like Murphy or Oturu are both better at putting the ball on the floor than
they were early. We're both different. If they shoot the ball like they did
yesterday, that makes them a lot different than they've been all year, you
know? They've been a low 30s shooting team from the three and they're just
shooting the ball better right now or at least did yesterday. Like all of us,
everybody is a little inconsistent, you know? They played so well a couple of
games. Then they played a game or two that they weren't as good in and we've
done the same thing.  
  
I thought it was a big win for them yesterday. I thought, I know how good
Louisville is. We played against them and I thought pretty much Minnesota
dominated them, definitely over half the game.  
  
Q. I was in between you and Bob yesterday when you guys were talking
about the exchange with Henry. Were you surprised at all by the national
reaction? I guess those of us who are around the program more often were less
surprised by what happened.  
TOM IZZO: You know, it's funny. I learned in the last couple of years about
sound bytes, and there is a 10-second sound byte in a two-year relationship. I
just think that people don't understand that coaches, at least this coach,
relies on relationships with his players. I think more than any coach in the
country. That's an egotistical or selfish statement or self proclaimed. But I
think it's been earned. The number of players that called me last night that
had already called Aaron, and that thing was, I won't say it was nothing, it
was nothing. The 10 seconds, you gotta appreciate that there is a year and a
half of recruiting. There is a year that he's been there now. There is hours
and hours and hours spent on what did you want to accomplish? What do you need
to do to accomplish that? What do you need to do to help our team win? If you
don't do those things what do you think my job is? So a little bit surprised.
This day and age doesn't. To me it was ridiculous the way it blew up. I would
publicly thank the many, many people that just saw it as ridiculous. People
reacted. It's nothing to do with anything with me, with Aaron. I was thinking
of benching him, but I decided I'm going to start him anyway and we're going
to move on. He's a great kid. That has improved so much, but for us to be a
championship team for us to move on he's got to continue to improve even more.
He understands that. I understand that. My players understand that. I hate to
say it, that's all that really matters to me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Isaiah Livers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35185)

### [Jordan Poole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35155)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome student-athletes from Michigan, Isaiah Livers
and Jordan Poole. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Isaiah, Coach talked yesterday about how you stepped up the last few
games or so. Has there been a change in your game or you're just taking what
you see?  
ISAIAH LIVERS: Nothing really different, Coach B. just really believes in what
I can do and the confidence I have to have when I'm out there playing for my
guys and for myself and for the coaching staff. They believe in a lot of
things I do and I just gotta go out there and play aggressive.  
  
Q. Defensively Florida has mentioned that they are wanting to try and
throw a lot of different looks at everyone here this week. They did so against
Nevada a couple times, especially down the stretch. What do you guys know
about the overall defensive challenge they provide?  
ISAIAH LIVERS: The defensive challenge they bring to the table is they change
defense. They can go from a man-to-man, 1-2-2 press. They have a lot of
different looks that they can do, so that's different for us.  
  
JORDAN POOLE: Yeah, they have a lot of different defensive schemes being able
to go against a defense team like that we need to be locked in on our
offensive flows and our offensive sets, being able to have X at the top in the
point guard position and being able to call those out and identifying them
early should really help us.  
  
Q. I know we came back last week, but what does it do for the whole team
with Charles being involved in the offense again like he was last night?  
JORDAN POOLE: Being able to have Charles back brings a different dynamic to
the team, having a leader and a guy who has been able to provide so much on
the offensive and defensive end, being able to have him on the court gives us
a different type of feel and aggressiveness. Being able to have the
performance he did yesterday shows what we're capable of.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: It's harder for teams to scout when you have an extra weapon on
the floor like Charles and what he brings to the table. Jordan was talking
about his leadership and another voice out there talking is helpful for young
guys like Iggy or us two because having another leader who has been through it
already.  
  
Q. You guys have been through this process before. What are the couple
most important things about this in-between day when you have short
turnarounds? You've got to focus on the next opponent coming and you've got to
rest and you've got to mix all those things together. What's the most, whether
it's physical or mental frame of mind? What's the important thing about a day
like today?  
JORDAN POOLE: I personally believe it's rest, only because you're coming off
scouting a team for an entire week or not even an entire week, just trying to
figure out you know who you have to play and this in-between day gives us time
to rest our bodies physically. But mentally we have to be locked in and
prepared to go against an entirely new challenge, so the dynamic of mental and
physical. I feel like rest is the key, but you can't mentally rest because
there is so much you have to do in order to face a new team.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: I agree with Jordan, a lot of mental preparation between that
one day. You change from one team to another who does something totally
different than the team before did. You've got to shift your mind and also
your body because you just played the day before so that's also key.  
  
Q. For both players, the Florida coach and players talked about how your
size is going to be a problem with them bringing a smaller lineup and small
ball approach. Is that going to present a problem for you guys?  
JORDAN POOLE: I feel like our preparation for Montana really helped us. I
think that a 6'5" man yesterday, Jon did a really good job on him yesterday
and having guys who are able to play different positions, I feel like is a
strength of ours. So even if they do go small ball lineup we are able to
switch-up our personnel and have different dynamics in order to guard them.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: I have a lot of confidence in Jon Teske guarding them because
that guy can go 1 through 5 without a problem. He did it yesterday. I think he
will be just fine.  
  
Q. Both Coach Beilein and Coach Izzo talked about how the short
turnaround was taxing from Sunday to Thursday. Did you guys feel that?  
JORDAN POOLE: Me personally, I remember last year after the Big Ten tournament
we had a week after and we had to come and prepare for March Madness and being
able to go with the momentum and go while you're ahead and continuing to have
positive energy throughout the week I feel like is a strength of ours and
being able to stay locked in and not have too much downtime or too much out
time is helping us.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: I also agree. I like the short turnaround. Like he said, stay
locked in. You don't got to shake any rust off and wait a whole week like we
did last year playing against Montana. I just agree with Jordan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
Happy to welcome Michigan coach, John Beilein. Questions for Coach? Thoughts
on tomorrow's game?  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: I wish last night I had congratulated Montana on their season.
Being a mid-major coach for so long, it's hard to get to that point. We just
had one of our better defensive games of the year.  
  
We have great challenge and opportunity right now with Florida. They've got a
great mixture of some really good talent but some seniors who have had really
great careers there. They've had a lot of success in the postseason, and they
had a great win yesterday over a Reno team that was in the top-10 earlier in
the year. Really have a great coaching staff, one of my former players, Darris
Nichols, is on their staff, and I'm probably as close to him as I am any of my
former players, and I have a lot of them. Darris is one of my former guys. I'm
sure it's going to be a great game. The Florida people have done a great job
and are running a great program.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot has been said about Iggy throughout the year. In
addition to his precociousness as a freshman. He seems to play his best when
his stakes are the biggest. Does he get enough credit for that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I was asked that same question, another Lithuanian from Toronto,
was Nik Stauskas. Nik came in to the big stage and he loved to play the game
and it was a bit of a stage for him. Iggy has that. He will not be doing this
to any players tonight. He usually does it sometimes to the crowd. He made a
mistake there, but he is a really good kid who looks at me every day and says,
he really loves this part. He loves college basketball. He really loves being
part of Michigan.  
  
Q. In terms of setting up an offensive approach for this game, what's
the biggest challenge of a team like Florida that really wants to throw a
whole bunch of different looks at you? Coach White mentioned that specifically
throughout the week and he showed it during crunch time in the Nevada game.  
JOHN BEILEIN: That is the challenge. You just said it. Sometimes they change
defenses in the middle of a defense. They throw the ball in and they are in
zone and they may change it in the middle of it. You have to play with heads
up. The shot clock is ticking and last night we couldn't run a lot of stuff
because they were pushing us down and icing us the whole game. We have to
adjust, but they're going to try to keep up off balance. If they saw the way
we attacked the press yesterday they'll probably press the heck out of us and
we've got to be ready for a whole lot of things in that we do see that
occasionally in our league, but it's still always needed with new players.  
  
Q. I asked you yesterday about Charles and his development back and you
said when you play the 1-2-3 you don't have a lot of time to evaluate what he
needs to do to improve as he recuperates. But then you said if you had that
period of a day or two days you could figure a better strategy out. Now that
you have this one day, what did you think that Charles can still do as he gets
from that 90% level to probably something closer to 100?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think he will be more comfortable today with the different
things because we were trying to pace him to get ready. It's just a comfort
level right now. If we're fortunate enough to win this game then we can get
more specific because we were just getting back to square one a little bit
about, all right, putting him back in a ball screen, back doing some things
that he's done well at times this year. He's getting more and more comfortable
every time he gets out there and we really need him on the floor for his
defense and all the intangibles he brings to us. But as you saw yesterday he's
a really important part of our offense.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about getting Charles involved and Iggy is a
stalwart in the offense, but is it a point of emphasis to get Jordan more
involved?  
JOHN BEILEIN: All those guys, we look at the match-ups and who is guarding
them and what we've seen from that. It's tough to dial up four guys, right?
It's really tough to do that. A lot of people play through one, two or three
players, but everyone else gets residual affect. Jordan is one of the guys we
will choose at times and it depends on the match-up or what style of play they
have.  
  
Q. John, you and Izzo have had similar success in recent years. You're
both going for win 30 this season tomorrow in a conference that hasn't lost a
game in this tournament yet. Can you talk about different coaching styles and
different ways to get to the same end and any reaction you had to what
happened yesterday with Michigan State and Tom?  
JOHN BEILEIN: No, I think that Tom's record speaks for itself, how really good
they've been. We talk about this the whole time in our great state of
Michigan. We have two elite programs within the state. If you look at the
especially the last decade the number of Final Fours, the number of conference
championships that we have had in combination, Duke and North Carolina are the
only ones that are even close, and the rivalry that we have. We both are very
are different. I don't know enough about what he does in practice or whatever.
I've never been an assistant of his or gone to a practice, obviously. So I
don't know how our styles contrast. I do know our style and it works. His
certainly does, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Florida 70, Nevada 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome the victorious Florida Gators and their head coach,
Mike White. Coach, opening statement?  
  
MIKE WHITE: Thank you. What a game, my goodness. We did enough in the end. The
Wolf Pack were terrific. They continued to fight. They made great adjustments.
They sped the game up. I thought we did a great job of controlling tempo. The
biggest key to the game I thought it might put us if we played well enough to
put us in a position of success both offensively and defensively, 12 or 14
minutes in the game, anxious to watch it. They did a great job of changing
their defense, pressed us in both the half court and the full court and sped
us up. They got downhill in transition offense. Now we know firsthand, we saw
it live and up close, why this team has won so many games these last couple of
years. It was a big win for us. Nevada is terrific. We did enough down the
stretch led by these two seniors, had enough poise and toughness, few
possessions there late where it could have got away from us. We lost a little
bit of poise at times but did enough, made some huge plays down the stretch to
obviously survive and advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Jalen, you guys held Caleb 5 of 22 in shooting. What did you do to
make him so offensively inefficient?  
JALEN HUDSON: We just tried to slow him down and both the Martin brothers are
really good in transition. So we were just trying to slow them down in
transition and make him take tough, contested shots.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, what do you think happened in the last 15 minutes that it
almost got away from you guys and how did you feel like you were part of the
turnaround?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I felt like we didn't pay attention enough, felt like we got
a little bit of a lead, a little too casual, reminded the team it was far from
over. We had to stay locked in, in the moment and we had to stand together and
eventually we dug ourselves out and could do enough to finish the game.  
  
Q. Jalen, obviously Nevada made a couple of huge second half comebacks
in the last year's NCAA Tournament. They made a run at you. What do you think
made the difference this year that they weren't able to do that?  
JALEN HUDSON: It was really just a team effort. I felt like during that
10-minute stretch six or seven minutes of it they were controlling the tempo
and they were able to speed us up and we were making jump passes which are not
allowed in the program. So that stood out and took us out of character and we
were also in the bonus, too. They were starting to foul and it helped us get
to the free throw line and stop the clock and get into our defense and we ran
a zone at them, and us playing the 13 slowed the clock down as well. So it was
good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the switching to the 1-3-1? Had you seen anything
on tape that decided if it was close you would break that out? Describe what
you did to implement that switch late because it threw them off?  
MIKE WHITE: Sure. What we saw on tape was just how dynamic they are
offensively. You've got a little bit of time here where you want to sharpen
all your tools, if you will, leading into the NCAA Tournament, of course, and
we worked on the three or four different zones this week in preparation just
knowing that, again, we wanted to be able to throw everything at them. We had
decided to run our 13 much earlier than that, but we had to score to get in
it. We just couldn't score. I had to remind, I've got a great staff and
actually one of them suggested it early and then the other couple guys kept
saying we got to get into 13 and we had to remind each other we had to score.  
  
They did a great job of speeding us up. They made us play a little bit faster
and if we had just been able to convert one of those floaters, contested
layups, one of those, and they've got great length. Obviously you're not going
to get many open looks against them, but we had a couple that rolled around
the rim there which might have been able to help us settle in a little bit and
change defenses on them.  
  
The run was fantastic. I mean, their effort in the second half, the way that
they played, they were terrific. I think that the average viewer would
probably attest most of it to their offense but they were out in transition
because they were getting stops. They were playing with a crazy amount of
energy, running and jumping both in the half court and the full court and it
was a great adjustment. Obviously, again, we did just enough. We were very
fortunate to hold on.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys for the first 10 minutes were getting outrebounded
10-2 and then the next 10 minutes you outrebounded them 12-2. How did you
change the intensity and get after the 50/50 balls?  
MIKE WHITE: I'm not sure we made a big adjustment there. First media I
remember talking to our guys and they talked. Our seniors have taken good
ownership especially late in the season led by Kevarrius and Jalen here
lately, understood that we were getting beat up on the glass led by Jordan
Caroline. He is as good of an offensive rebounder as we have played all year.
He is just a handful. We understood once the ball went in force a few times we
settled in. Sometimes that can happen for you. You play with a little bit more
pep in your step with the lead when you are in a decent flow, getting some
stops and getting some scores.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like this was a new level of a resolve that your
team showed down the stretch? They did make it interesting, but they got
within two and your guys still held them off.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I would say, playing in the SEC and then playing the
nonconference schedule that we played, it seems like we've had, I'm just
guessing off the top of my head, 15 games like that where late in the game,
you know, it's a 1-2 possession game within a couple of minutes, whether
you're up or down. We had a stretch during the season where we lost those
games. Continued to play really hard and lost some composure at times and then
we went on a stretch where we won some of those games and then we had the home
game against LSU and we lost a heartbreaker. Then we were able to win a
heartbreaker against LSU in the tournament and then lost one to Auburn. We've
been here in these situations. These may be unique where you are up big where
you make that type of run but you used the word "resolve" I believe. This team
has been pretty good in that category and gotten better throughout the year.
This team early in the year I thought had a little bit of toughness. I think
this team now possesses a lot of toughness, and mentally we've probably made a
bigger improvement than the physical level of toughness in that it's more
important to our seniors late in the year and our freshmen have grown up a
lot.  
  
Q. You're going against Jordan Caroline and Caleb Martin and you hold
them to 9 turnovers and 7 made field goals. Why were you so effective against
those two players?  
MIKE WHITE: You know, we've been really good defensively all year. I'm looking
at their offensive numbers and we have had a lot of performances like that.
This team, we have struggled to score at times. I think slowing the tempo
helped us a lot, and if they lived in transition offense the whole game we
would have been in trouble. They're so electric playing downhill. Jalen said
it by setting our half court defense it gave us a better chance to guard these
guys. Our guys have active hands. They have gotten more competitive throughout
the year. I thought we contested a lot of shots but they missed a few,
especially late in the game. I thought both the Martin twins had a few open
looks and sometimes it's a make-or-miss game, and we were fortunate that they
did. Beyond that, I don't know that we did anything really special. I would
say probably more than anything it came with the preparation and level of
respect that was necessary to guard these guys. Our guys, when you watch film
on these guys and you show personnel our guys were like, wow! They knew we had
our not hands full. They knew we would have to guard at a really high level to
have success tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, 3:44 mark of the game, final media timeout. Describe what the
huddle was like and how proud of your guys are you that they were able to
finish it out?  
MIKE WHITE: Really proud. We looked a little disconnected there for about six
or seven minutes. When the run started we looked like we could stymie it and
we would be fine. All of the sudden they cut it to maybe ten and they looked a
little different. When it was in not single digits, there for a little while.
That's probably the mark there, probably the last media. I didn't like the
body language. I was very concerned with our level. We talked about toughness
and focus. I thought we were just watching the clock and hoping a little bit
and we had been there earlier in the year. I don't know what the score was at
the last media, but I know we got a couple of stops there and converted a
little bit, whether it be a field goal or two. I don't quite remember, but I
know we converted some at the foul line late that allowed us to change
defenses and I thought we did a pretty good job in our zone late in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 76, Bradley 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome the Bradley Braves. We will have an opening statement
from Coach Brian Wardle.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's a tough loss for us. But I told the team, very proud of
them. They're toughness, their competitiveness in this game, I don't think
there are many teams that could have beat us today. I thought we might have
ran into one that could. They did everything we asked game plan-wise. We were
aggressive. There was just around the six minute to four minute mark where we
had opportunities with some good looks and they didn't go down and they closed
the game out and made some big plays and big shots and we just didn't. We've
been doing it all year. Making those big shots and big plays, especially the
last couple of months. It just didn't fall our way today.  
  
But the leadership, the aggressiveness, the toughness, it was on display and I
told these seniors who I'm so proud of, where we've come with this program and
these seniors. I told them they've left this program in a much, much better
place and our goal is to continue to improve and hopefully get back on this
scene again and get this opportunity again because I think these guys deserve
it. Very proud of them.  
  
Like I said, Michigan State is a very good team. They were composed. Game was
tight with six minutes to go and they made some big shots in key moments and
we just weren't able to connect on those same shots. But overall just proud of
how our guys competed and executed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Elijah, you had a big first half and capitalized on that in the
second half. What was working for you against that physical Michigan State
defense?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think my teammates were finding me and I was getting to my
bread and butter which is down low, just trusting in my shot and just
executing the plays.  
  
Q. For any of the players, Michigan State is known to be a very physical
team. You guys held your own. You mentioned toughness. Was that a point of
contention going into the game, a point of emphasis or is that just the way
you play?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: We're a very tough, physical team, too. So we came into the
game knowing it was going to be a physical battle and we prepared for it, and
I think my guys did a great job of being physical.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: That's our identity. We pride ourselves on being tough and
playing defense and we play in one of the toughest conferences in the country,
so we have been prepared for this moment all year. Wish we could have got some
shots to fall down the stretch so we could have pulled the win out.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: It's what we do every day. We talk about compete,
defend, rebound and that's what we do each and every day. We did it today. We
were physical. Just didn't fall our way.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: For our program I think the lesson we learned with the guys
coming back is we gotta play with an urgency every single game. I thought
today, like I said before, there weren't many teams that were going to beat us
today. Unfortunately, we had that 15 seed and playing a really good Michigan
State team. But if we can put it together for a full season and not have any
lulls and take care of business, the Valley prepares us for this. Mississippi
Valley prepares us for this. This is consistent in Valley play all year. So I
thought our guys were tremendous today in that aspect of the fight in their
heart.  
  
Q. You guys came into this 15th seed playing a No. 2 seed. There is
another game tonight that's going to be that situation. Do you have any advice
or thoughts about that?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Advice I would have? I don't know who is playing, but execute
your game plan and go out and play your basketball. At the end of the day it's
all basketball. Once you step between those lines doesn't matter what's on the
front of your jersey. Just play hard.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: Same advice. All guys put their pants on the same way. You just
go out and do the best you can to get the best result.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Stay true to yourself. What you do is going to help
you stay true to the game and just be true to your teammates.  
  
Q. Different setting to play on in the tournament. How would you
describe the feeling of the arena? What did you feel here?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: It was a great atmosphere out there. We had a lot of fans
travel from Peoria, Illinois and we are thankful for that. It was a great
atmosphere playing in a big crowd and a big setting like this. It was great. I
dream about this. It's what I wanted when I came to college and for me to
complete that goal, it was just a dream come true. We will be back here next
year. So looking forward to getting back to work.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: The atmosphere was great. Our fans do a great job of traveling
and supporting us regardless of the circumstances. Hats off to them. I enjoyed
it. It was a dream for all of us, I think. It was a blessing to be out there
today.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Yeah, it was a game in a big arena. We played a lot
of games in neutral venues and our fans travel super well. They were there
with support and they helped us.  
  
Q. Biggest take away from when you guys first walked on to campus in
Peoria to winning the Valley Tournament title to where you are today, in terms
of trusting the process, trusting Coach, trusting each other. What's one thing
you can take away from that entire process to where you are today?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: One thing I can take away is staying level headed, just staying
true to who I am and just going to my bread and butter, what I worked on all
off-season and what I will work on now. Staying true to it.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: I mean, I think the main thing for me, D-Lo and his group, they
won five games in the year before I got there and my freshman year we probably
within 13 games or something like that, and last year we won 20 games and lost
a heart breaker in the semifinal tournament. Putting in hard work, we got to
where we wanted this year. We got to the tournament. It was a dream come true,
and like Eli says, staying true to who you are, putting in the work that got
you this far and working to get back here.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: No shortcuts. Nothing that we did was simple, years
of hard work, years of believing, years of trusting and just staying together.
We couldn't have done this without everyone being together and helping each
other out. Seeing where DB has grown, Eli has grown and the rest of my
teammates, it's lovely to see because the position the program was in was very
low when I arrived and now as a senior leaving and the position it is now is
just a dream come true.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the D-Lo affect after the conference
tournament and D-Lo got to the line 10 times even though the shots weren't
falling from the field. Talk about how he was able to get to the line and
causing trouble for the other team?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I told the guys in the back room, I'm going to miss D-Lo
flipping and flopping in practice. But he is relentless and competitive in
attacking the rim, attacking the glass. He just doesn't stop. He just keeps
going and going and going. I think it's contagious. It's contagious. All these
guys have something that's contagious and that's what they brought to the
team. Darrell's work ethic is contagious to the team, and Elijah's enthusiasm
and his ability to lead is contagious to the team. D-Lo's affect is what it
is. We're going to lose leadership and a lot of toughness with this senior
group.  
  
Q. Coach, you have great ties back to Michigan State. This team all year
has not necessarily been pretty but resilient. Now that you've played them can
you give us what your scouting report was and what you were thinking,
please?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Well, it's a team that's improved and matured throughout the
year and has very high level of play. I think that's one thing that we've
shown all year, that no matter who it is on the other side of the floor, we
can compete with anybody.  
  
Our game plan, we wanted Winston shooting mid-range jump shots. I thought they
were hurting us on the ball screens a little bit. I liked our aggressiveness
in transition, and I liked how we attacked when we created misses and
rebounded the ball. I like a lot of the shots we took in the second half and
the looks we got. We just weren't able to get it. We probably didn't get to
the offensive glass as much as we would like, but give Michigan State credit
there. They're disciplined in blocking out and offensive rebounding. But at
the six minute mark a few shots fall for us and they don't for them. We could
be sitting here with a whole different outcome and that's basketball. That's
momentum and that's those game-changing plays. We've made a lot of them all
year, just not today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you quickly talk about the pace of the game? There was a
lot of fouling and traverse. Were you trying to slow it down or did that just
happen?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think we wanted to get up and down, and so did Michigan State.
We had opportunities in transition. I thought we capitalized on a lot of them.
I'll go back and watch the film. It just became two defensive teams getting
back and in transition and getting half court defense set. Making the other
team run a lot of clock and I think there were several times where it got
under 10 seconds. We knew it could be there and we had to foul and let the
game open up. Give Michigan State credit, too. I haven't even addressed the
free throw shooting they had. They shot the daylights out of the ball on the
foul line and give them credit for shooting 25 out of 26.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Gabe Kalscheur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36835)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Minnesota 86, Louisville 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Glad to welcome the Minnesota Golden Gophers. We will have an
opening statement by Coach Pitino.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, great win for our guys. I just thought we played really
good defense when we needed to. We showed great toughness and grit down the
stretch. Obviously they were really pressuring us and sending us to the free
throw line. We hit some big free throws, but you can't undersell it. That's a
terrific win for our guys. Louisville is a great team. That staff does a great
job. Chris does a great job, so being proud is probably a bit of an
understatement for these guys. It's a special win.  
  
Q. Gabe, you played almost the whole game. Jordan, you had a little bit
of a break. I know you guys are used to that right now with all of the
injuries. But do you feel like you're ready to go in a couple days for another
game?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yes, for sure. We just gotta come, be ready for Saturday.
We're ready.  
  
JORDAN MURPHY: Yeah, I think I'm going to be ready to go, 100 percent. There
is no way I'm missing it.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Telling be fine.  
  
Q. For both players if you don't mind, seemed like neither team was
having much luck scoring early, but then all of the sudden it looked like you
were getting everything you wanted. Did you figure something out? What
happened at that point?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I just think we were able to get stops and that's what gave us
a lot of confidence going down the stretch. Once Gabe saw that the ball went
through the hoop for him and Amir and Dupree that's when our offense really
started to flow.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I felt like we eased into it after the first five minutes and
then we started to get confident at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you walk us through the injury and what you were dealing
with?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think it happened like early in the second half. My back just
locked up on me. I mean, I don't know what else I can do about it, but for now
just get treatment and take care of it. It just happened down the stretch and
just had to keep playing through it.  
  
Q. Gabe, y'all make not even six threes a game and you cashed in eleven.
Can you talk about what you saw from the Louisville defense today?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I felt like they were giving it to us at the end in the middle
of the game. I feel like we got confidence during the game as well. I felt
like Dupree, once he hit his, everybody was feeding off each other.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
GABE KALSCHEUR: He was hitting, too.  
  
Q. Gabe, that first three, was that the key? You didn't seem to shoot a
lot early, early on, and then you make that one and it just flowed from there.
Was that first one the confidence booster?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yeah, for sure. Once that first one hit I felt confident. The
first two were unsure, in and out, but after that I just kept feeling
confident.  
  
Q. Jordan, early on, especially, Louisville seemed to aggressively
collapse on you and Daniel. How much fun was it watching Gabe and Amir and the
guys take advantage of that?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Man, I love when we take advantage of the collapsing defense
and when they're huddled in on me in the paint. I found Gabe in the corner a
couple of times and he got some good jump shots. So it was fun being able to
see that, having confidence and smiling a little bit and having fun.  
  
Q. Jordan, with the amount that Louisville shot threes was there a sense
going into this game that you guys were going to need to shoot a decent amount
yourselves to keep pace almost? Because you got involved as well.  
JORDAN MURPHY: I don't think there is a necessary, like, sense of urgency to
shoot threes. I think overall we needed to score the ball, put the ball in the
hoop and stop them as well. They definitely didn't shoot that well from three
today. So credit to our guys for playing defense and credit to our guys for
hitting the shots.  
  
Q. I know nobody wanted to play into the Louisville match-up before the
game. Now that it's over are you happy you won it for Richard?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Like I said earlier, two days ago, this wasn't really about
getting a win for Coach P. It was about getting a win for our team in general
and making sure we advance to the next round. I think that was what makes him
happy and that's what makes our teammates happy.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: What he said. It wasn't about Pitino. It was about advancing
to the next round.  
  
Q. Guys, there have been games where you have definitely struggled
shootingwise. What changed today? You guys got hot and you weren't just good,
you were great at times. What changed from the games where you do struggle to
a day like today where there's times you can't miss?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think it's all confidence, honestly. I think it's all
mentality and once we have the right mindset going into the games and we're
confident locked in, I think there are very few teams that can stop us and you
saw that today.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yeah, it's just confidence and forgetting about that one you
missed and going onto the next. Confidence is a big key.  
  
Q. For Gabe, how confident were you? By the time the fourth three went
down you back peddled and were strumming like a guitar. Have you done
something like that before? Is that a regular thing? Or did that just come out
of your body?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I haven't strummed the guitar.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Did you do that? Did you really do that? Act like you've been
there before!  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I've seen the arrow before.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: He can do whatever he wants if he hits five threes.  
  
Q. Gabe, just branching off that. You haven't been in this situation
before. It's your first NCAA Tournament. Did this feel any different to you
than any other big games this seen and how do you feed off that?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: It's a big atmosphere and a big stage. We've been here, Big
Ten tournament. I just eased into it, another big game. Felt good.  
  
Q. How would you guys sum up the significance of this one given the fact
that it's the first win in the NCAA Tournament for the program since 2013?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Obviously means a lot to us and it means a lot to our state and
our fans and our program as well. So it's really significant to us, been in
this position two years ago where we lost and now just being able to redeem
that loss and win and keep moving and advancing and then going into the next
game with a good mindset I think it's a pretty positive thing.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Very big for us and our community and our fans. Just big that
we're advancing and moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you gotta be proud of the shooting performance, but
how proud are you of the defense performance as well?  
RICHARD PITINO: I thought the defense was great. Jordan Nwora, I thought we
did a really good job on him. That's a tough offensive team. They put you in
binds. I thought where we started to build the lead was we got stops. We got a
little tired at the end, but for the most part when we needed to we got stops.  
  
Q. Coach, Jordan's game is so consistent. I feel like you know what
you're going to get out of him, but one of the keys is if Amir is on his game
you guys are tough to beat. How early did you get a sense that he was really
feeling it today?  
RICHARD PITINO: Amir has been pretty locked in over the last month. When he's
good and understanding where his shots are coming from, he's terrific. He's
playing forty minutes a game. He's very, very durable. He's playing great
defense. He played great defense on Nwora. He was locked in early, you could
tell. If you're not locked in now, there is probably a problem.  
  
Q. Richard, they came into the game with a significant advantage as far
as three-point shooting. You guys beat them at that time. Was there an
emphasis, or did it just happen?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think it just happened. It wasn't anything that we
necessarily saw. It's a confidence builder. Gabe is a great shooter. Murph
chipping in with two. That's an addition, but we stuck with our offensive flow
and I don't think it was anything necessarily that they did. We were just
confident with open shots.  
  
Q. What was your reaction to the crowd and how did that help you guys?  
RICHARD PITINO: The crowd was awesome! The crowd was absolutely awesome. When
I meet people I try to explain to them about Minnesota and how much pride our
fans have, not just for men's basketball but for the University. When I took
the job everybody was saying, oh, you work at the U. The U? I just left Miami.
It's special all across the board. That crowd carried us. It was a big-time
performance from them and hopefully we see them in a couple days as well.  
  
Q. Gabe's game, as I said before, looked like he didn't want to shoot
that much early on and then he makes that first shot and it just sorta
steamrolled from there?  
RICHARD PITINO: And he drove the ball a couple times in crucial moments got
that "and one" knocked down free throws. He had eight rebounds. That's
remarkable, and he's a terrific three-point shooter. He has a beautiful
stroke. He's one of those guys, he deserves success. Doesn't matter what you
do that guy doesn't take the day off. He sneaks into the gym. He's a throwback
and he deserves success.  
  
Q. Seems like you guys did a groat job of handling the ball screen
action. Do you think that played a big roll in the team defensive success?  
RICHARD PITINO: That's important. They have great pick-and-rolls. They can
shoot the ball well, so I thought from a scouting report standpoint the guys
were locked in and did a very good job there.  
  
Q. With three minutes left there was a three-minute review on the shot
clock situation. I know you were asking okay wrap this up, wrap this up, with
you guys in the point of advantage, I guess, how were you trying to make sure
the guys stayed focused and locked in with that long of a stoppage at that
point in the game?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, just stay poised. That happens. We're used to that.
Those reviews can happen from time to time, stay composed, give them the next
play, what we're going to do if it's their ball, our ball, et cetera.  
  
Q. When you consider Murphy's durability over his four year career is
there any doubt in your mind he's going to be good to go for Saturday?  
RICHARD PITINO: Absolutely no doubt in my mind. He'll find a way even if we
tell him he can't.  
  
Q. I know you don't want to talk about Louisville, but are you going to
get a nice gift out of your father for this? Are there any emotions you want
to speak to?  
RICHARD PITINO: I'm truthful with it. I'm not being diplomatic. It was really
about that. It's very hard to get to the tournament, especially in our league.
We had five new players. We had some ups and downs. The focus was on
preparing. It didn't matter who we played. I'm proud of our players. I'm proud
of our University that they can be a part of this. They can come drive over to
Des Moines, so it's not really anything extra. That's always been my
mentality. I try not to get too high. I try not to get too low.  
  
Like I said, I was not being diplomatic. I got respect for Chris Mack, his
staff. They do a really good job. That was the focus. How can I help my team
beat a really good team?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Jazz Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36765)

### [Cody Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35052)

### [Tre'Shawn Thurman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36766)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Florida 70, Nevada 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Wolf Pack of Nevada.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I give Florida a lot of credit. I thought they played really
hard, controlled the pace of the game in that first half. We missed some
crucial free throws down the stretch. Guys had a good year, but we weren't
good enough today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Cody, this game looked similar to the games against Texas and
Cincinnati. You guys got into a big hole then made that push. Why were you not
able to get over the hump like you were then?  
CODY MARTIN: We just didn't get the stops we needed. Like he said, we missed a
lot of crucial free throws we needed. But realistically the problem was we
didn't start off in the first half and that seems to be what we do all the
time and this time we just couldn't get over the hump. A good team slows the
pace down and unfortunately this time it didn't work.  
  
Q. Cody, you mentioned pace and Florida had the reputation of being
slower than you guys. Was there anything they did that surprised you, any
frustration, or were you prepared for that?  
CODY MARTIN: We're always prepared because our coaching staff does a great job
of making sure we know them better than anybody and at the beginning of the
game in the first half we were moving the ball really well and that's on me.
I'm the point guard who has no assists. I mean, I got to do a better job of
moving the ball. We had four assists as a team to their 10. I mean, that's on
me that I gotta control the pace better and control the tempo, make sure we
get our teammates involved. I didn't do a good job of that. Nothing surprised
us, honestly. We knew what they were going to do and unfortunately we had a
lot of mental breakdowns. Like he said, didn't make free throws and just
didn't get off to a good start and tried to come back as usual and it just
didn't work.  
  
Q. Tre'Shawn, you guys seemed like you were able to speed them up over
the 12, 14 minutes. What did you do to be able to get back in the game and get
back in transition offensively?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: We made an adjustment to trap them when they had the ball.
He's a good point guard and we had to pick randomly to trap him at random
times.  
  
Q. Seniors, how would you like to be remembered? And Tre'Shawn, being
from Omaha, did you have a big fan following here tonight?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: Just a hard-playing dude, I guess, gave 'em my all. Every
time I stepped on the court I gave 'em my all. I cared about this team and I
cared about winning. As a senior that's what you're supposed to do. You're
supposed to come out and play and put your heart on the line for the guys in
the jersey next to you. You're supposed to care and I cared and I cared about
the Nevada fan base and I cared enough about my teammates to play every game I
could. The following was great to see, I guess.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I mean, I hope on our way out people understand and think that we
represented our community and Nevada the best that we could and not only on
the court but off court, having character guys, being good kids, you know,
putting other people first besides ourselves. I hope people understand how
much work we put in and how much we sacrificed to get to this point, and there
is a lot of people that helped us get to this point. Unfortunately we didn't
get as far as we wanted to, and at the end of the day I'm not satisfied with
how it ended. But I'm really glad we got to go this far with this group of
guys. I had a lot of fun throughout the season. Couldn't ask for a better
team. Couldn't ask for a better coaching staff. They gave me everything. I
just want them to know that, you know, as a team and as a whole we tried to
represented Nevada the best we could.  
  
Q. Jazz, how would you describe this season? I know you guys came in
with a lot of goals and you were able to achieve a lot of them but not all of
them. How would you sum up this year?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: It was a learning experience especially for a guy like me who
has never been here. I had the opportunity to learn from a lot of good
players. I never thought I would meet guys like this and I'm blessed to have
the ability to learn from these guys and from this coaching staff. I know,
like I said, it's a big learning experience and we all got a lot better this
season. Like Cody said, we didn't get as far as we wanted. But we made a lot
of memories and we will be brothers forever.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you notice in the first half that gave your guys a
bit of trouble? Take us through the first few moments of the second half where
a bit of a run came and then Florida started to go back on their march?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah, we just didn't make a lot of shots. Some guys that
normally score the ball for us had off nights and when you shoot some of the
percentages that we did, you're going to struggle and not win games. So we
tried to junk it up defensively and our guys executed that defensive game plan
great to try to speed 'em up. We had 'em on their heels a little bit and a
couple of calls happened and momentum shifted and changed and we got beat by a
team that outplayed us tonight.  
  
Q. Cody, nutty things happen in this tournament every year, but given
the season you had this finish really doesn't seem to fit. I wonder if you
find it especially shocking that it ended like this?  
CODY MARTIN: I would say more irritating than anything just because there was
a lot of goals that we wanted to accomplish that we didn't meet. You kinda
just gotta live with that. But, I mean, at this point it is what it is. You
can't really dwell on it. I know our team and our coaching staff put in a lot
of time, a lot of preparation to even get to this point. But it just sucks
that it got cut short. You know, you wish you had possessions back. You can't
get that done. At the end of the day, you know, you can sit there and, I mean,
I hope we can all say that we left it all out there on the line and gave 110%.
If that isn't the case then that's an issue and it is what it is. I'm proud of
our guys. I'm proud of how they fought. I'm proud of how we fought. I wished
we would have started off a little bit better, but like Coach said they just
happened to outplay us.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's hard to sum up a six-month season as we all sit
here and I know you think it's a special group and I was wondering if you
could tell us right now what you think of this group?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Twenty one teams I think that have been to three straight NCAA
Tournaments and you can look up the names of the programs of the 21 and we've
come a long way in a short amount of time, and I'm proud to coach these guys.
Things weren't going well. We struggled and they fought back and got within a
possession of the game, and I'm proud to coach these guys. We got a lot of
guys in that locker room that are really hurting, a lot of guys that are
tough-minded people and they will be successful in life because of their
toughness and competitive nature. I think a lot of these seniors have won a
lot of games for our program and given our fans a lot of good times and
tonight we came up short. So it hurts and stings.  
  
Q. Cody, can you take us through your day? We heard you were getting a
couple of IVs. You guys had 5 assists last game and 4 assists in the game
before that. What happened to you guys the last couple of weeks?  
CODY MARTIN: I think we got stagnant as a group, including myself. We have to
try to make sure our team is involved and for me to have 0 assists is kinda
ridiculous and I don't look at stats and stuff like that, but when I look at
that, it's irritating. I don't know what I had the game before or the game
before that. I don't look at stuff like that, but if it's like that, it's
irritating. I don't really like to talk about it because I feel like it's
making excuses. So, yeah, I got some IVs. I just wasn't really feeling well.
We just didn't play well enough.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys came into the season with a lot of expectations and
you did a lot of great things, winning 29 games. How do you think you will
think about this season over the off-season in what you were able to
accomplish and how you fell short in reaching your goals?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think our record is going to go down as one of the best in
school history. Tonight it hurts. It will hurt tomorrow and a week from now.
But to have 29 wins and whatever, 29-5 whatever it is, we had a really good
year. We didn't advance in the tournament and there are a lot of good teams
that won't advance either and there are a lot of really good programs that
aren't in this tournament that have great facilities, that have great budgets,
that have great everything. It's hard to make this tournament. It's hard to
make this tournament back-to-back years as an at-large, and we've done that.
Now I've got to get with Jazz and some of the sit-out guys and look forward to
next year. I look forward to coaching those guys and start working with them
and working on depth charts tonight for next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck in the future!

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Khwan Fore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32961)

### [Christen Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36127)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Minnesota 86, Louisville 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have an opening statement from Coach Chris Mack.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Hats off to Minnesota. I thought we were the better team. The last
couple of minutes in the first half and the first couple of minutes in the
second half, they delivered quite a punch. Goes from a 1 or 2-point game to 10
very, very quickly.  
  
We were playing uphill from there. It's really a tough feeling, you know, to
end your season so quickly in the NCAA Tournament. I am very proud of our
group. They exceeded a lot of people's expectations. It's sorta hard to see
that in the moment, but to get a group that was picked 11th preseason in our
conference and to represent our conference in the NCAA Tournament, I don't
take that lightly. I thought our guys, our three graduate transfers, did a
tremendous job of showing leadership and being every day guys and bringing
some excitement back to Louisville basketball. As I said before, Minnesota was
the better team, and hats off to those guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Khwan, this is a team that doesn't make a lot of three pointers. What
was the scouting report going against guys like Gabe and them?  
KHWAN FORE: Keeping a tight floor, helping each other out once they try to get
it into the paint. They knocked a couple of threes down. We was living with
it, but we started to press up and they just kept making shots. Just what
happens.  
  
Q. Christen, whenever you guys pulled within 7, what was going through
your minds? You guys were pretty pumped up.  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Just trying to make a comeback. We dug ourselves in a big
hole. We was just trying to turn the game around.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Same question to you, Coach. They don't make six threes a game, they
make eleven. Were you focused on collapsing in or were they just making
shots?  
CHRIS MACK: I wouldn't say collapsing in, but coming into the game we felt
like their strength was in the paint. Oturu and Jordan Murphy are medal
leaders. They make big shots, scoring around the basket and that was a big
challenge for our team. Obviously Kalscheur shoots big, and for Jordan Murphy
to make two in a game, hats off to terrific player. Good players rise to the
occasion in those type of situations and he did that. That's why they're
moving on. But tough thing when you know their identity is built around the
paint and they make some shots like they did today. But they earned the
victory and we weren't quite good enough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Matt McQuaid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36910)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 76, Bradley 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will go ahead with questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cassius, congratulations on the victory. Take me through the second
half. How did you guys get it going? I know team rebounding was better the
second half. Was that a point of emphasis?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely. Just the first game is always tough. You've
got to get used to the atmosphere, the arena, things like that. First half,
that was a really good team, also. They were solid in a lot of areas. So
second half we pride ourselves in dominating games and do what we do best,
that's rebounding and getting stops. We knew if we did those things we was
going to come out on top.  
  
Q. You had a big three-pointer coming out of a timeout that gave you
guys separation. What was the process there and take me through that
scenario?  
MATT McQUAID: Coach saw something throughout the game and he called it in the
huddle and Aaron went down, pinned his name and I came up and hit the shot.
Cassius gave me a good pass.  
  
Q. Matt, in a tight game when the other team is scrapping and standing
with you, you have Cassius out there leading things, controlling things.
What's it mean to have a guy like that you know you can lean on?  
MATT McQUAID: Means a lot. He does so much for this team. The way he leads and
controls the game, just his passing ability and his vision, along with the
scoring ability. It gets everybody on the court open and you've got to be
ready for his passes.  
  
Q. Cassius, you talked about the first game can be the toughest
sometimes. What's it feel like? You've got one out of the way and the way the
other team pushed you today. Sigh of relief or momentum now? What's it like to
survive this game?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely feels good to be advancing, you know? I think
Coach said at the end of the game even after all that we're still one of the
last 32 standing right now. We know there is a lot that we can improve, but
that's our plan to get better and better each and every step of the way and
now we got a chance to get better and that's always a good thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, guys. Coach, we will get an opening statement.  
  
TOM IZZO: These guys probably did a better job than I did. I felt like we were
ready to play. I just felt like, in all honesty, Bradley played well the first
half. They made shots. I think we covered real well. We missed shots. Kenny
Goins really struggled. I thought he had some great looks. Then we had some
bizarre lineups, and Conner and Gabe are not household games right now and
just because of foul trouble we had to play with them. But you know, we wanted
to get Nick Ward more minutes, and we got him some. But because of some
defense coverage and that it made it harder. He's just not quite there yet,
not all his fault, a little bit ours. He was productive getting to the free
throw line and scoring a bucket and getting 5 rebounds. So I thought we got a
little more out of him. We were 7, 8 up that was the first time I saw Cassius
collapse, you know, the guy has been going so many minutes in that
Sunday/Thursday turnaround. I felt he couldn't go. We had a turnover. They had
a rebound. He let his guy go right around him the way we told him he was going
and hard to get mad at him when he's doing everything he can for me and
playing every minute of the game. It's just the situation we are in. I thought
in general Bradley play better than I've seen them play this year, and that's
a great tribute to Brian and his team and what they did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
Q. Coach, with all the adversity, how proud are you of your players to
hold their composure, break away with a lead in the second half and survive
and advance? How important was it for the team to hold on to that composure?  
TOM IZZO: First of all, thank you for the question, because usually the
questions are leading to, I'm a tell-it-like-it-is guy. I'm not giving my team
enough credit. I know what we've been through from that Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, get home and what we've gone through. You say it's an excuse, you
don't say it. You're damn right, I'm proud of them. I am. We're still going to
grind it. We're going to push it. We are still going to make mistakes. We
didn't show mental toughness. I thought we were worn down. It's going to be
good to go back to the hotel and look at some things. I am proud. Matt McQuaid
and Cassius Winston just wouldn't let us lose and that was the two guys that
talked the most in the huddles. Xavier struggled and then came around late and
rebounded the ball really well, and in all honesty, Kenny just struggled. But
he, too, played forty minutes in Chicago. Excuse. Reality. Whatever. I'm proud
of this team until I get back to the hotel and then it's going to be dog-eat-
dog until Saturday and then get back at it.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Bradley played well particularly in the first
half. Is there anything specifically that they did better than you thought
they could do?  
TOM IZZO: They cut so hard and they've got really good athletes, those guards,
Dwayne Lautier-Ogunleye and Lundy, you know where they're going. They drive it
right. There is nobody making any scouting reports there. It's simple, yet we
couldn't stop 'em. We couldn't do that. I felt bad for my assistants. They did
a hell of a job on the report and we didn't follow it as well. I think some of
it was we've just had some bizarre line-ups in there and we're trying to
change things because of who we think we could have in the game and that's not
a great coaching job on my part. Instead of staying with what we do and plug
another person in, but trust me there are some things we had to change and it
makes it hard on Nick because we're changing in the middle.  
  
So now we're going to play a team that has a couple bigs, that's more of a
conventional team. I think that's going to be better for us in a way because,
you know, I love the kid. Everybody loves Brown, but I thought Childs played
really well today. He posted us up. He scored on us. I thought he did a very,
very good job. I thought we did a decent job on Nate Kennell, and I don't know
what Brown ended up. But that kid is a load to cover. Very good.  
  
Q. Tom, at one point in the second half you got after Aaron Henry going
into a timeout. Saw what he did but wondering why that made you so angry?  
TOM IZZO: You think there was one thing that would make me that angry, you
don't know me very well. There was a bunch of things, you know, and, hey, he's
playing a lot of minutes, too. He's tired, too. When you are a freshman now at
this time of year you don't make mental mistakes on things we're telling a guy
which way he goes or not running back. There are some things Aaron didn't do a
very good job of and yet, you know what? I did get after him and he did
respond and he did make a couple of big buckets and he did make a couple of
big free throws, but that's not good enough. This is one-and-done time. The my
bads are out the window. If it's my fault because that guy played better and
it's my bad because I walked back and didn't sprint back, then it is your bad
and you're going to hear about it. So that's what it was.  
  
Q. Tom, after the thing with Henry you knew you had to stick with him
because you don't have much of a bench and at the end of the game did you call
to feed the ball into him and when the ball found him in the post. Did you go
to him even though you challenged him because you knew you would have to
challenge him at some point or you knew you would have to go to him?  
TOM IZZO: We challenged him and we said if he's going to down screen, Matt
McQuaid hits the one, and we said the next time we will slip and get it to you
in the post because they would sorta jump on Matt McQuaid. It sorta happened
that way and he made a couple of big plays in there which is capable of doing.
I get a kick out of you guys. Get after somebody because you're trying to hold
them accountable. I don't know what kind of business you're in, because if I
was head of a newspaper and you didn't do your job you would be held
accountable. That's the way it is.  
  
Q. You guys were minus 6 in rebounding at halftime. You were plus 15 in
rebounding in the second half. How did you make that happen?  
TOM IZZO: No, no, it was a love fest! We said, hey guys it's okay if we got
rebounded by another team and we said that's okay. But if we could do a better
job that would be great because then we could win. That's what we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Travis DeCuire](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35012)

### [Ahmaad Rorie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35016)

### [Sayeed Pridgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37003)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 74, Montana 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the Montana Grizzlies. Opening statement from
Coach?  
  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Whew! That's a good basketball team we played tonight. You
know, I think more importantly than this game, I just proud of my team. You
know, our seniors led us through tons of adversity this year. The way they
helped me lead this team to what it is now. The level of expectation is way
different than it was five years ago. The emergence of the underclassmen to
get us to this point was huge. I think it's unfortunate we couldn't get the
ball in the basket, 27% is never enough in these types of games and someone
has to make shots.  
  
But I credit the Michigan defense. They did what they do. They make it very
difficult to get good shots and I thought for a while we were doing the same
thing, but then it just kind of snowballed on us a little bit and it got away.
But we wish that team the best. I'm proud of mine. From there, I will answer
questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Ahmaad, how did you want to be remembered as a Grizzly?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Just knowing I gave it the best effort every game. When I came
here I was complacent. I didn't have good study habits, basketball habits, and
Trav, all I can do is thank him, honestly. Known him for a long time. From the
same area, and he pulled me in when I was a sophomore and told me from the
jump just to, it's all about your reputation. I was kind of a guy that didn't
care about reputation. Just wanted to play basketball. Didn't care about
school, but I think I've improved in that regard, graduated, got a degree and
working on another one in media arts. The kind of guy who improved off court
and now basketballwise I feel like I've grown a lot as a leader.  
  
Q. You guys were down double digits the last three minutes and you
stepped on to the court after the last timeout and it was the last few seconds
or minutes you were going to play with Bobby and Mike. What was going through
your head and what were you saying to each other?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Definitely with them being part of the senior class and me,
they're two guys that I've loved to compete with. So just tried to tell them
let's go out there and fight, give it our best shot, no quit. They're two guys
than don't miss practices, don't miss games. They work hard all the time. So I
feel like myself and the rest of the team owed it to them to work hard and try
to go out there and cut into the lead, not give up. That's why I tried to pull
the team together and then just try and do that. It's been an honor to play
with them and be a part of the senior class with them.  
  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: Me being out there with those guys and telling them that this
game didn't make their legacy. Just trying to let those guys know just because
we lost by however many points, this is the best the senior class that we ever
had in Montana. Just trying to keep the confidence in those guys and let them
know we will always be brothers. It's a family.  
  
Q. Sayeed, talk about the seniors and what you learned from them?  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: These guys taught me a lot, honestly, and I only wanted to
score and Ahmaad told me you're not always going to be the person who is going
to lead in scoring. Sometimes you're going to be the hot guy and sometimes you
need to do what the team needs you to do, and Bobby and Mike had faith in me
that I could make shots even when I didn't have it in myself.  
  
Q. Ahmaad, how did this year feel compared to last year as far as your
level of comfort at the NCAA Tournament having had this experience last
year?  
AHMAAD RORIE: I feel like last year we came out and kinda just wanted to enjoy
the process. We're here. We made it here, but I don't think our full focus was
on winning. This year we kind of flipped the switch and said we want to win.
They're a beatable team, but we have to do all the right things to beat them.
We came up short but we fought. Last year, I don't feel like we fought. We
weren't fighting and having a great effort, but everybody fought tonight and
it just not didn't go our way. We actually felt like we could come out and
compete. We weren't just happy that we were here.  
  
Q. Talking about you guys fighting, you kept up full court pressure on
the defense. Talk about how that speaks to your ability to fight through
adversity and keep going?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Yeah, um, you know we have this year in practice. We get up and
down a lot, a lot of guys, you know, even when you're tired you have to guard.
Trav is honest about that, fighting to the end, end of practice. We run for
free throws and our practices are really tough. We knew that and came together
and we knew how much we were down the fight we wouldn't give up. We wanted to
do that. We want to go there for each other and on national television if we
were going to go down we weren't going to go down without a fight.  
  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: I feel like Mike and Bobby were being aggressive and I felt
like that was greatest thing about Coach because it let the guys know that we
were going to pick them up full court just to scare them a little and let 'em
know we are still here.  
  
Q. Sayeed, what was your offensive approach tonight being guarded by
such a big guy like Jon Teske? What did you try to accomplish tonight?  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: I knew I was faster than him, so I tried to get him in the
lane and close out, get penetration for the other teams and make plays for
everybody else if I didn't have anything. So tried to use my speed against
him, honestly.  
  
Q. Travis, can you talk about the situations being switched this year?
You were up 10 last year and this year you guys didn't come out shooting very
hot. How did you keep the team on track and keep them focused?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: That's one of those tough timeouts, right? We just got off to
a rough start in terms of how we were playing. I don't think we were on the
same page offensively. A lot of tough shots, not a lot of patience. So a lot
of the conversation was playing together, staying together, staying focused,
scoring off of the defense if we can get some stops. Once you get a basket
your confidence tends to increase and it took a while to get that going. Once
we got a spark we had a little life in us, and I thought we were decent coming
out at halftime. But we had another cold streak, made it tough.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Michigan's defense. I know you watched a lot of
film. Was it more or less what you expected or when you see it in person is it
a different animal?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: We faced it a year ago, so watching film I saw the same
things. There's a lot of openings to take advantage off because they do what
they do. They have rules like any good defense they guard certain things a
certain way and so on offense you try to manipulate those things. We did that
early, and we got shots leading into the game. But the problem is we didn't
make those shots. When you watch Michigan State against them, they got those
shots in the second half. They were down and they started making shots to get
back in the game.  
  
For us, we just gotta make 'em, right? But on the flip side of that, for them,
they're a very physical basketball team and they adjust well. So once we
started knocking a couple down, they took some things away and changed how
they defended those actions which forced us to change. So it's a game of
adjustments. I think Beilein is probably one of the best in the country at
making adjustments. Once again, this happened last year. We got some things
going and it was gone and then we had to find something else and then it was
gone. Eventually if your team can't continue to adjust as quickly as they do
defensively then you go into ruts and that happened to us early and late.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys talked about legacy. What kind of legacy do you
think the senior class left at Montana?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: There have been a lot of good senior classes, so if you
compare them basketballwise, it's argumentative. But for my group, we were
about more than just basketball. We've been fortunate to have 100% senior
graduation rate. None of our guys have gotten in trouble off court. You don't
read negative things about our team, our guys.  
  
So with the consistency that these guys have had for four, five years as
seniors in this program, I think their legacy is that they're the best senior
class in the history of Montana basketball because of what they represent and
how they represent it. The way the community supports them and embraces them
proves it. There have been some kids that have won more games. Maybe there's
one class that might have three rings as opposed to two, but my group is the
only group that's 100% graduated and no issues off court.  
  
So I think they represent all those things Ahmaad talked about which is
growth. To me, that's what's more important than winning games is the growth
of these young men. When I sit across from their parents there is only one
thing I promise, is to be fair. If I'm fair and I treat them all with the same
amount of respect I want in return from 18-22 years old they mature and
they're men because they're not quite men when we get 'em. That's the most
important thing with our job, and I think that all of my seniors are walking
out of the door as men.  
  
Q. The senior class has been with you for most of your time as a coach
at Montana. What did you learn from them and what are you going to take away
going forward in your career as they leave and go on to other things?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: I have coached for a long time before moving on to Division I
and then before being a head basketball coach. At high school level you don't
get to recruit your kids. You just coach who is in the hallways, and kids
might transfer in or whatever. But you pretty much have whoever goes to that
school. In junior college I had a taste of recruiting kids in my community
that could represent me as players. So I had a slight taste of what that is,
but I always dreamed of the Division I level having an opportunity to go into
different communities and pick the kids that I think would represent me the
way I wanted to be represented and play basketball the way I think it should
be played.  
  
For me, I finally got that. So this class is that. They're the first group
that I actually brought in. This is the first team that's 100% mine. I enjoyed
last year a lot more than this year, but I'm more proud of what this group
achieved this year than last year because of the adversity they have been
through and because of that I feel like these guys are ready to move on with
their lives. It won't be easy and they will hit speed bumps and they will see
more adversity, but I think they're ready for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Jon Teske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34361)

### [Zavier Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34703)

### [Charles Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34355)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 74, Montana 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Michigan Wolverines, Coach Beilein,
with an opening statement.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Thrilled about this win, watching Montana and playing them again
I thought last year's team was very good. It's tough to compare great to
great. I thought this team had more weapons offensively. They were a great
three-point shooting team and there is a reason why they ran through the Big
Sky and won it. We were fortunate we were able to defend the three-point game
and defend their isolation match-ups, et cetera, and really proud of these
three guys and the whole team and how they bounced back after losing a
championship game late Sunday and here we are playing Thursday and they
bounced back like champions like they are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Charles, you certainly looked more comfortable out there than you did
last week. Perhaps just for you describe what the recovery process has been
like and how tonight felt different from last week; and then for Zavier and
John, describe for me what difference a 100% Charles Matthews means to your
team?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Dealing with any injury can be tough and understanding it's
a process to get back to where you were before it happened. Like I said, I had
a great group of guys around me. Our athletic trainer was tremendous helping
me with rehab and the coaching staff did a great job of supporting my as well,
and I was able to take my time and get back to where I wanted to be.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: It's always good having Charles back. His presence means a lot
and great to see his baskets fall through tonight and he communicates a lot.
He's a great leader on both ends of the floor and we know he's going to give
his best.  
  
JON TESKE: He's worked hard to get back to this point, his presence on both
sides of the ball. We really feel that when he's in there. He's worked hard to
get back to this point.  
  
Q. What does this game mean to you guys moving forward to have gone
against a tough defense team? They did force eight steals.  
JON TESKE: They're a great defense team. We had a couple of silly turnovers.
Give credit to their pressure. We knew coming in that might be a problem and
we coughed it up a little bit. But we were talking about sometimes the
toughest game to kinda get over and to get this one under our belt feels good.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: We knew they were going to have great pressure. They have
great guard play. They are decent size all over the court and they were active
on the ball and off the ball as well. We just wanted to get the jitters out of
the first game and keep our head focused.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: This weekend always seems to be the toughest, for all teams,
just the nerves of the tournament. Montana is a great team, being able to
switch their positions and they present defensive challenges, and they were
definitely tough on the floor. But we were able to win.  
  
Q. Zavier, Charles was active all night you seemed to find him a lot
especially early. Was that a point of emphasis or how the match-ups
dictated?  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I just play honestly with our offense and coaching staff they
put us in a great position to find others. With me being a point guard it's my
job to find others and early on Charles was open. He was knocking down shots
and feeling it. His body language was great and it's always good to see that,
but it's nothing with Charles. I just try to find whoever to get them easy
points to get their rhythm going.  
  
Q. Charles, Zavier is giving you credit. Talk about what Zavier means to
you on the court?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: We just found out that he set the school record. The first
guard to have eight 10-assist games in a season. So that's a huge testament to
what he does. I feel like so many times he kind of gets I don't want to say
undervalued if he's not having an offensive game. But he means so much to us
and none of these big nights that we have would be good without him. So we
really appreciate him as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. John, you touched on this at the start, but quick turnaround. How do
you feel about your team's energy and focus at the start and throughout the
game?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I was a little worried. We had a logistics meeting on Monday and
the faces were way down, and realized that, but, you know, mine was, too. And
Tuesday's practice was just okay. I thought when we got here and you get to a
nice city like this and we had practice, we had a really good practice
yesterday where I think everybody was focused. We got another chance. Some
teams lose a championship game and they don't get to go to a tournament.
They're smart kids and they hate losing just like their coach. But we bounced
back and we had six losses all year and we have bounced back and won after
every single one and that's an important quality to have for a good team.  
  
Q. Incrementally what have you seen in Charles' health improvement? The
tournament last weekend was one thing. The difference between Sunday and
Thursday, what did you see?  
JOHN BEILEIN: It's hard. In the tournament you're in the mix of things, so you
play one, two, three. It was really the fist time he had really played. You
had a game, couple days off, okay, here is what we gotta work on, and you
could work on it. We just had to keep going and by the third game he still
wasn't himself.  
  
So we played Isaiah more. He played great. But the last two days we tried to
get the ball back in Charles' hands, make him make decisions to just get him
back. Basketball is a funny game. You're two weeks off. It's really different
to step back on and be yourself.  
  
Q. John, speaking of decisions, what do you think of your team's shot
selection tonight? How do you like your flow on offense?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We had probably two of them that were a little crazy, right? But
other than that I thought it was pretty good. We've been, you know, as the
year went on we've been getting better, not at the pace that I wanted it to
be. But it is getting better. These kids, sometimes you have to fail if you're
going to focus even better in the future. But I thought today was pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys mentioned that, like, it's the first game, they've
gotta ease into it. Is that something you have been harping on?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We showed them and we had a really good team last year, we
showed them the first four minutes of last year's game where the first media
timeout we were down 10-0. And we showed them the fouls that were being called
because they don't believe the coach when they say they're going to call these
in games. As the Big Ten went on and every probably league comes on they stop
calling the fouls that they did earlier in the year. The NCAA is a new year.
We were able to show them that and we only sent them to the foul line 14 times
and they had the appreciation that this is a fresh start. I loved the way we
came out in the game and a little blip to start the second half, but then we
responded to that, too.  
  
Q. Coach, not so much in this game, but Isaiah had the big game in the
Big Ten tournament. He did have a big game today. Is seems like he's taken a
step forward in the last handful of games. Do you see that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: He's become a more versatile player and he was taking, where he
was settling for jump shots way too much. We've been working on it. How to get
two feet in the lane, land on two and finish in crowds. Everything was a jump
shot or a fade-away, reminds me of D.J. Wilson, who is with the Milwaukee
Bucks now. A lot of it was the fade-away, not getting your body in there and
Isaiah is doing that. Plus he's playing the 3, the 4 and the 5 for us now. And
that's really good against a team like this. If you only have bigs you're
going to have trouble with this team, right? Because they're going to take you
off the dribble and having him be able to go and switch the ball as a 5-man
today was great for us and our freshman wouldn't be able to handle Austin
Davis as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Kevarrius Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33121)

### [Jalen Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28465)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the student-athletes from the
University of Florida.  
  
Q. Jalen, I'm curious what it's like for you to match-up with the Martin
twins. Obviously, you guys go way back.  
JALEN HUDSON: I'm excited. I actually won the last match-up against them when
they were at NC State and I was at Virginia Tech. I know they're going to be
super competitive and honestly I consider them family. I'm just excited to see
them. It's been a long time. I'm excited and looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Looking at the season, there have been any number of times in which
you guys could have gone into a mental bad place, roller coaster, ups and
downs, big wins, frustrating losses. How have you guys been resilient enough
to get here and with this fresh start of the tournament even though it's one
and done what kind of energy do you have to make a run like any team could?  
JALEN HUDSON: All these post-season games are considered new seasons. So right
now we're 0-0. I don't count the SEC Tournament for now. I'm excited to get
our feet wet again in another postseason game. As far as the season, we're not
looking back at all. During the season, obviously we have ups and downs. But
like you said, it's a fresh start now, especially in the NCAA Tournament. Just
looking forward to getting our feet wet and competing and playing hard and
some of us for the last time with Florida across our chest. So just excited to
compete.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: We have been able to stick together by drawing close to one
another, relying on each other as far as moving forward, all the frustrating
losses, you know, rough times, I feel like we just want to be able to overcome
all of that because we all have a positive mindset. Coach talks about learning
from the losses and then even from our wins, kinda keep building on the
positives and fixing the things we do wrong. Like he said, it is a new season,
0-0, coming out the right mindset and coming out and play the way we play.  
  
Q. Curious what you think of the Wolf Pack. There will be several guys
on each side with a lot of experience in this tournament so it could be a fun
match-up?  
JALEN HUDSON: They're a very experienced team. Obviously, they have had a lot
of success. They are a mid-major team though. I don't think they've seen a
team like us in a long time. I know they had a match-up with USC and I think
it was another high major team they kind of had trouble with. So I'm just
excited to bring our SEC vibe to the game and see how they kinda can match-up
with that. Obviously they're a very good team. I know the Martin twins well.
They've played at a very high level in the ACC at NC State. I don't know the
other guys, but I know they can play and a bunch of them have transferred as
well. So I think it will be a good match-up for both teams.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: This team has a lot of experience as far as a lot of seniors
and transfers and it will be interesting to go up against them. I know they're
talented players from the perimeter down to the post. I feel like it will be a
good way to test our strengths and some of our weaknesses right now and just
kind of give it all we got. The Martin twins are very good and they've got a
lot of three-point shooters. We're going to stick to what we do, play our
principles.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, you're playing some of your best basketball. You're
averaging over 11 points. What do you attribute that to?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Staying the course, working on it a lot, just trying to get
shots just about every day, anytime I can. It's kind of starting to show and
pay off a little more, the confidence to hit the mid-range shot like I did in
one of our games. Just kinda keep building on that. I feel like I always play
hard in every game. So that's never going to go away. I'm just going to keep
building on that.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, do you think there is something about this team playing
better given the rotation has shrunk a little bit? You guys, all five starters
averaging over 30 minutes a game last week in the SEC tournament and Mike says
you all are playing your best basketball right now. Is there a coincidence
there or is this the best lineup for you guys right now?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I feel like we owe that to our chemistry, how we are off
court. It's starting to transition on the court, understanding each other's
play style and playing around our strengths and even then our bench is
actually really good. When they come in they keep up the energy, and I feel
like that's what we do very well. We keep the energy going. When we have a lot
of energy in our games we send a snowball after of that even when something
goes wrong we can band together. Everybody has the right mindset as far as we
all like want to win, and the starting five set the tone as strong as we can
and we build off of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, guys.  
  
We have Florida head coach, Mike White. Coach, welcome to Des Moines.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Thank you. Great to be here. Appreciate you all's time. Exciting
to play in the NCAA Tournament as always. Anything can happen in this
tournament and our guys are excited to be here. We're coming off an SEC
Tournament in which we won a really close one and lost a really close one. But
feel like we're playing our best basketball of the year and we certainly hope
that teams against a team in Nevada who is coming after a great tournament in
their own right last year in this tournament and has had another terrific
season, a highly ranked team all year, a team who we're going to have to play
really well against to have a chance. Excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, what are going to be the keys to beating your opponent
tomorrow and what's your biggest concerns? Have you ever been to Iowa
before?  
MIKE WHITE: I will answer the first ones first, because I might ramble on the
second one. Keys to the game? Defensive transition is important against these
guys. A lot of things are important against these guys. Live ball turnovers
and floor balance, it's all the same category. We're coming off a game in
which we would have given ourselves a better chance against the Auburn Tigers
to potentially play in the SEC championship on Sunday, if we didn't have 19
turnovers, uncharacteristically, like we did. We have got to do better than
that against Nevada. Isolation defense has gotta be huge. These guys can go
get it. They're great at drawing fouls. They're great at playing downhill.  
  
Then for us, not only specifically to these guys, but they are terrific
defensively, but for us going into every game, offensively we have to figure
out how we're going to score. How we're going to score. These guys defensively
are very, very efficient. Again, we've got to value the ball at a high level
and those are just a few keys, a few factors. But there's a bunch. This is a
team that is as old as anybody in the country. They've done a great job with
balancing that and managing that roster. They are as big as anybody in the
country, an incredibly long lineup. They've got a good mix of shooters and
handlers. They seem to have a bunch of guys that can pass, dribble and shoot
it.  
  
They go at you. Coach obviously knows how to go at you with his background in
terms of picking on certain guys at different spots on the floor and putting
guys in position to be successful offensively, and they're tough. They're
physical. They battle you. They're really good.  
  
Have I been to Iowa? First through fourth grade I lived in Dubuque, attended
St. Columbkille Elementary as we just talked about behind the curtain. Fun
time in my life, and my siblings lives. We loved it here. My father was the
Athletic Director at Loras College right down the road. It was a great time.  
  
Q. The whole roller coaster word is a horrible cliche, but parentally to
this team it might actually be something that close to fits. There has been a
lot of chances for the team to really get down on itself, up points, down
points, winning streaks, losing streaks, following those. How has the
resiliency of this team impressed you to get to where you guys are today?  
MIKE WHITE: Very much so. It's been a really odd year. This team was 12-11.
Went through losing streaks, winning streaks. We've been through different
guys starting. We've been through seniors going off. Seniors having slumps.
Freshmen trying to figure it out. Freshmen leading us to victories.  
  
It's been unique to say the least. We've had several opportunities having lost
some very close games to lose interest, if you will, lose a little bit of
fight. But instead it was about the next practice, the next play, the next
timeout, the next film session and obviously won our share down the stretch,
playing our best basketball of the year, won enough close ones. You wish we
could have back some of those close ones that we lost and we might be sitting
here not having to play Nevada.  
  
That said, it speaks to, you said s resiliency, toughness, character, you
know, we have our flaws as a team, but collectively this team has got a lot of
character in that we just kept plugging, kept work and anything can happen.  
  
Q. Coach, Nevada and you guys both have a lot of experience on this
stage. What have you learned from the past couple of years about what it takes
to succeed on this stage?  
MIKE WHITE: I think the last thing I said was anything can happen, and I'll
stick to that. We know everyone has a clean slate and that have been ten teams
that have made big runs in the NCAA Tournament and there was an 11 seed who
came in last year and beat us on our home court and ended up going to Final
Four in Loyola who was an 11 seed.  
  
That said, just like the SEC tournament, you can make a lot of noise. Who
would we play next? None of that matters. This is about the first possession
against Nevada and lock in on these guys, the scouting report, the film
session tonight, the next film session tomorrow, trying to get a great shot
versus a stifling defense, trying to get a stop, trying to get your second
stop. That's it. Playing in the moment, moving on to the next play, playing in
the game, locking in on the Wolf Pack. Hopefully we're competitive enough down
the stretch to where we've got a shot. That's it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Brian Wardle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30352)

### [Dwayne Lautier-
Ogunleye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32673)

### [Elijah Childs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36624)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to welcome the Bradley Braves, our student-
athletes, sophomore forward Elijah Childs and senior guard Dwayne Lautier-
Ogunleye. Questions for our Bradley Braves?  
  
Q. For either of you, you guys sit at 0-5 in conference play. What are
the biggest things that change for your team to turn things around?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think one thing is staying with the game plan, staying
together as a team, encouraging each other day-by-day, staying in the gym,
keep working hard. As Coach says, stay with the game plan and keep level
headed, and we knew we would come out of this slump. It's just a matter of
time and that's what we did and we got the job done.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Kinda what Elijah said. We had a meeting, spoke about
the season as a whole and if we still wanted to pursue and keep going and
finish off strong and everybody was committed to our work ethic and we were
committed to a change and win the first game and keep our momentum rolling to
where we are now.  
  
Q. When was that meeting, Dwayne, and who led it? Was there a certain
point that made you think, okay, we've got to get this turned around? Second
thing, in addition to just the attitude you took, did you guys start playing
at a faster pace or make defense changes around that time?  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: After we went 0-3, we sat down and spoke. But there
was a big meeting after the fifth loss. The seniors came together as well as
the rest of the players and the coaching staff and we sat down and said this
hasn't started the way we wanted to, but we have time to change. I don't think
we made major adjustments. We concentrated on the little things. We're a team
that defends, rebounds, and breaks well on off. We tried to remain true to
ourselves and maintain our identity, and once we got things clicking it
started rolling and the confidence grew and once the confidence grew everybody
started playing their roles even better than they were before and that's what
really helped.  
  
Q. Can you please tell me what stands out to you each individually when
you watch the Spartans on tape scouting them?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Just the way they run the offense. They play at their pace.
They don't beat themselves. We've got to come in and execute our game plan and
play at our pace and do what we do. Just another thing, offensive rebounding
and rebounding on both ends, everybody gotta box out and rebound, and if we
can play a half court game I think we will be in great shape.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Yeah, their bigs run really well the floor, which is
something we were impressed with. They're physical. They rebound, but they
play a lot like us which is kinda cool. We ought to match-up really well. They
do a lot of things well. They compete. They defend and they rebound. It should
be a good game because it's two teams similar to each other playing against
each other.  
  
Q. Dwayne, if you could tell the story of how you made it from London to
Bradley, how that happens? Elijah, there are players from seven different
countries including the United States. If you could describe what it's like
and maybe what you learned about different cultures or things that maybe
surprised you or how it's helped you grow or expand your viewpoint?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think it's been pretty fun playing with international guys
not from the U.S. I've learned a lot about them and I learned their style of
play and our style of play and going over there, I took an overseas trip. I
think I learned a lot and learned how things operate and how things go over
there. It's been fun playing with these guys, and I love 'em like my brother.
We can make a run in the tournament.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: My story is kinda funny. I played for a team in
Bristol and they had a couple of Americans on the team. From word of mouth,
one of my teammates spoke to people in America because he knew I wanted to
play college basketball. I don't know how it managed to happen, but word of
mouth ended up getting my name to Coach Drew Adams when he was leaving New
Mexico and just got hired by the Coach Wardle at Bradley. He messaged me on
Facebook, said he liked the film and he wanted me to come on a visit with my
mother. I came on my visit, maybe a week after we actually spoke. I loved my
visit and I committed before leaving Bradley. The coach said they wanted to
change the program from the ground up and said I would be a part of it from
the start and I was sold on that and to be able to take the program from where
it was my freshman year until now is incredible.  
  
Q. Dwayne, this week in practice Kenny Goins talked about you guys do do
things scrappy like they do. Is there a sense of excitement this is going to
be a physical, bang-it-out battle, is that kind of like what basketball should
be. Do you enjoy that aspect?  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: We thrive on it. We are a group of competitors. We do
it every day in practice and this is exciting. This is what March basketball
is all about. I grew up in London wanting to be a part of this and now to be
able to play a game like this is just exciting. We are all pumped and ready to
go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We are joined by the Bradley Braves head coach. They won the Mississippi
Valley Conference Championship. They will be making their ninth appearance and
first since 2006. They will play Michigan State. Welcome Head Coach, Brian
Wardle.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: Thank you. We always enjoy coming to Des Moines and have had
tremendous hospitality and we're excited to play in the NCAA Tournament,
excited to be back after 13 years and excited for the program. Couldn't be
prouder of our group. We've had a great group of practice. I think the focus
is at a high level. We know we're up against a great challenges against a
great time, a great coach. I know our guys are excited in getting out and
showcasing what Bradley is about, but more importantly what Missouri Valley is
about.  
  
Q. Brian, Michigan State and you are both gritty teams, grind-it-out
teams, you do the little things. As a coach, is it fun to compete with people
who mirror you and play that same kinda game?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Absolutely. I would say we mirror Michigan State in a way. I
have a lot of respect for Coach Izzo. I had Mike as my coach at Marquette. Tom
Crean who came from the Tom Izzo tree, and a lot of what we do is man-to-man,
rebounding is an emphasis for us. We like to get up and down when the
opportunities are there and push it and then we will try to execute in the
half court. It's a great challenge. The competitor in me is excited about the
opportunity and I know our guys are, too.  
  
Q. Coach, you had an extra week to prepare over Michigan State. Do you
see that as an advantage or a detriment?  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's hard to tell. I called a lot of coaches especially from our
league that have had success in the tournament with our time gap between our
tournament and the NCAA. Asked them what were some of the things you did? What
did you try to do? I thought our game plan as a staff was pretty accurate on
what most teams did. We tried to do as many things as game speed as possible.
We scrimmaged a little bit, but we also got the rest. Will we be rusty? I hope
not. We had a great practice this morning. It was intense. It was up and down,
and I think it's been important that we scrimmage a little bit to try to stay
as sharp as possible. But this time of year I know players want to play. They
don't want to sit around very long at all. Once you get to January that's
their mentality. Keeping them engaged and sharp, I think we've done a pretty
good job of that. But tomorrow will tell.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that the situation with Dave Reynolds was resolved over
the weekend. But I kinda think we need to ask on one level, why did you think
that you had that perception of what the local coverage there was like? What
do you think you ultimately learned from that entire situation as you try to
move forward with how you work with everybody as the years go on?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Well, I had a great talk with Dave face-to-face on Sunday, and I
apologized to him for not handling the situation very well.  
  
We had a great talk, and we're excited to meet after the season and work some
things out and continue to build our relationship. I learned a lot. I think
what's important is that when you talk to your team, we've built this program
on, you know, high character young men, accountability, responsibility,
discipline, unselfishness, being honest communicators, and we've grown the
program every year and improved it every year.  
  
I think in the classroom, in the community, and on the floor, one of the
things you teach your kids a lot is what's hard for them is when you make a
mistake you've gotta admit it. You gotta own it and then you've got to teach a
lot of young men now if apology is necessary then you've got to apologize and
own it and then you've got to learn from it and grow and move on. That lesson,
I tell my kids all the time, I've done it before and I did it on Sunday again.
I think hopefully we've all learned that you own things, you move on, you
learn and you grow and you keep moving forward and you try not to repeat
mistakes.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously none of your players have played in the NCAA
Tournament, but this is a first for you. Who do you look to in preparing for
something like this?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Well, you reach out to your mentors and you talk to, like I
said, I talked to other coaches about the preparation side of things. A lot of
them said just really enjoy it. Especially for your student-athletes, for your
young men, enjoy the moment. We fear none, respect all. We're coming into
compete now and we're coming into play. But I want these guys to enjoy the
moment out here, enjoy the media, enjoy the hotel, enjoy the Bradley fans that
will be here and take in those memories, because life is about memories. You
forget the games. You forget your stats. I tell 'em all the time when you get
to my age you forget all that stuff. But you remember the bonding, the hotel,
your teammates, all the fun stories in practice, on the bus, and I said try to
soak all that in as much as you can because that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Brian, when you watch Michigan State on film can you give us your
initial thoughts? I know we talked about them playing like you, but your
initial thoughts and breakdown?  
BRIAN WARDLE: When you call other coaches and you know what Michigan State
stands for, you know what their identity is, that's why they're a great
program. They have that strong identity. They're very good in transition. You
gotta get back and you gotta rebound with them, right? You have to rebound
with them. Then everyone talks about the toughness, the physicality, all of
that I hear. But when I watch on film and I studied them Sunday night and the
last two days, they're a very smart team. They do not beat themselves.  
  
I love how they're all stars in their role. You look at their team, no one
goes outside their lane. They stay in their lane. They do their job and they
do it very, very well. They don't try to take crazy shots from three if
they're not a three shooter. They do their job in their roles and that's why
they're consistent, I think, even through some injuries. That's why they're a
really good program.  
  
Q. You know, there's a real international flavor to your roster this
year. Besides learning how to become a team on the floor, what has the whole
cultural learning been for this particular group of players and how has that
kind of impressed itself upon you, I guess this year, too?  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's been great for all of us. We had a chance to go to the
London and Netherlands this summer and Delo and Luuk's home. Having guys from
different diversities, different cultures. We do presentations in the
summertime every year where everyone talks about their home city and family
and all the traditions they have with their family just to get educated on a
whole different side, really way of thinking in a way and a way of living and
I think I say great for our guys to experience it. For example this morning,
we were having breakfast. Luuk is the last one to finish his meal. The whole
team laughs because Luuk is a slow eater. When Luuk came to me, he goes, why
is everyone in a rush here? I like to take my time. We take our time over in
the Netherlands, so things like that for our guys to experience and talk about
is a lot of fun for our group.  
  
Q. I was just talking to your point guard and obviously we were talking
about Michigan State's point guard and that match-up. How do you assess your
teams are both led by point guards. What do you think Darrell can do well
against a guy like Cassius?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think Darrell has done a great job all year and done an
unbelievable job of not only having the pressure of having the ball in his
hands a lot, just getting double teamed, getting bigger, always getting the
best defender on him during the game. For Darrell, though, we gotta get out in
transition. He is a weapon on the floor. You can't measure a person's heart. I
think he has a huge heart and a huge work ethic. He has all the intangibles
you want in a point guard. He can change a game in a minute or two. There are
not many guys that can do that, but Darrell is that for us. He is a constant
threat on the floor. He can rally off three or four three-pointers, and he's
done that for us all year. If we can set good screens for him, get him going,
then the rest takes care of himself. For Darrell, it's all, gas no brakes. I
say that all year. When he has the gas pedal down the whole game and never
lets off, he's going to be productive.  
  
Q. Coach, Lugman stepped up in that game against UNI. Who is going to
step up like he did?  
BRIAN WARDLE: We are at our best playing as a team. We have unselfish kids.
Whoever is hot at the time that's who they will be talking about in the
huddle. Let's get him the ball, let's get him the ball. Everyone was saying,
let's get L the ball. Lugman hasn't been a threat all year, but that's who was
hot. Whoever is matching up against us and is doing well, that's who we will
attack.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a close draw to Peoria. How well do you think they
will travel here and how will that benefit for you?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think you will see a lot of red tomorrow. We are hoping. You
just never know in the selection process where you fall, but a lot of our fans
were hoping it would be here. It's a four, four and a half hour drive for us
and it's not too far and we got a lot of fans in Chicago. It's a 5-hour trip
from there. I think you will see a lot of Braves fans, and we call 'em the Red
Sea. But you will see a lot of Red Sea fans in the arena tomorrow.  
  
Q. Obviously, the fact that you guys were down so much in the
championship game in what's essentially a tournament game. How do you think
that translates, if tomorrow you do get down against a team like Michigan
State there is no fear in this team. What are those processes like?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think it's a resiliency we have had throughout the year. It's
a connected, committed group to each other. We've matured a lot as a group.
It's become a player-lead team, I always say that. Leadership and getting from
a coach-led team to a player-led team, there is no doubt we did that. But we
do not want to be down 18 to Michigan State tomorrow. Let me make that clear,
and we do not want to have 15 points at halftime like we did because they're
too explosive of a team as we all know. Down two, three, four possessions our
group is going to battle. We have shown that all year. We have heart. We have
toughness, and even if the shots aren't falling we've got to stay committed to
the defense and the rebounding. If we can do that, we can play with anybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, wish you the best of luck tomorrow. Thank you.

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Dupree McBrayer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32984)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome senior forward Jordan Murphy and
senior guard Dupree McBrayer. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For each of you, your thoughts on where the team is at right now and
what's going to be important tomorrow against Louisville?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think our team is in a good place, confident going into
tomorrow. We're still figuring out our game plan and stuff like that and
figuring out our plan of attack. Obviously, it's a very important game to us.
Means a lot to our young guys and our older guys going out in a good way. I
think that's about it.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Still figuring some things out on how we are going to guard
and stuff, but we feel really good about tomorrow.  
  
Q. The angle in our town is Rick Pitino and Richard Pitino and all of
that. Does that cross your consciousness in Minnesota? Does it even come up?  
JORDAN MURPHY: No, not at all. We probably see those headlines all the time
and we take it with a grain of salt and pass by it. It's not something our
team is focused on. It's about our team versus Louisville and that's it.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: I've been telling the guys from day one it's not about the
Pitino family. It's about Minnesota versus Louisville and knowing that our
coach came from Louisville and it's just Minnesota versus Louisville. We will
be fine.  
  
Q. In the absence of other questions, how much contact have you had with
the senior Pitino? How much has he been at your practices? Have you learned
anything from him about basketball? Take all the other stuff out of it.  
JORDAN MURPHY: We really haven't had a lot of contact with him. Obviously, he
got a new coaching job overseas. So we haven't had a lot of contact with him
this year. Obviously, you see him tweeting all the time and giving us his best
regards. So I think that's about the most part, but we appreciate his support
wherever he is at.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Before he got his job over in Greece he was able to give us
pointers, and that's about it. He's in Greece, and like Murph said, we see his
tweets giving us his best regards. We thank him for his support.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.  
  
At this time, we have Richard Pitino, University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.
They are making their second NCAA appearance and second in the last three
years under Richard Pitino. Coach?  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Excited to be here. The grind of a regular season is a lot,
and the goal is obviously going to an NCAA Tournament. So that in itself is a
great accomplishment. Proud of our guys to be able to bounce back from a lot
of things out of their control last year to get back to an NCAA Tournament
with five new players, starting two freshmen, playing one of the toughest
schedules in the country and obviously one of the best conferences in all of
college basketball.  
  
To be here is great. We move on to a new season. Celebration is over and now
it's time to go compete for a championship and play a really, really good
Louisville team.  
  
Q. Richard, of all the teams you could have played in the first game
here it's Louisville. What was your reaction when you saw that team in the
bracket opposite you?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, I was wanting to know where we were playing. Location is
important to me. Then I wanted to know what day we were playing because we got
a little injury with Matz. I was hoping that we would play Friday. But other
than that it was more about okay, how does Louisville play? It's get to work.
Watch film on them. Put together a game plan.  
  
You know, all that other stuff didn't even really cross my mind to be honest.
It was doing my very best to put ourselves in a position to play a really good
Louisville team, a very well-coached Louisville team.  
  
Q. With Jordan Murphy, how has he picked your brain over the years to
try to become a better player, and how have you seen him do that?  
RICHARD PITINO: Jordan is a thinker. He's not one of those guys you yell and
scream at. He's analytical. You more need to talk to him about his game. Every
big guy in the country has an identity crisis. They want to be outside. They
want to be shooting threes. They want to do those things, and Murph did can do
that. He can shoot threes, but he knows where his bread is buttered. We've
talked about that. And we've told them not to deviate from where he is. Do
great at what you're good at. Obviously, with Murph it's a process of me and
him communicating all the time about where we can put him in a position to
succeed. He's a real coachable kid.  
  
Q. You picked up things from your dad along the way coaching in the
tournament. Have you picked up X's and O's or mentality? This team is good at
relaxing at this time of year. Was it more strategy or mentality you picked up
along the way?  
RICHARD PITINO: I would say the coaches you are around. The X and O part you
are going to do what you feel comfortable with, but it's that environment that
you take from and the culture that they build and the way they are at times
like this in March. I've been lucky to be around it, obviously, growing up my
whole life. As an assistant coach I was in several tournaments as well. You've
got to make it about the game. You've got to enjoy this. You've got to enjoy
the exposure and the spotlight being on your program. You've got to enjoy
these open practices, be in front of fans and to do these things. But then
you've got to make it about basketball. That's the biggest things. You've got
to execute. You've got to go tough. It's a single-elimination tournament, and
playing at this level in the Big Ten tournament we were able to get two wins
in single-elimination games. So I think we understand that part of it, but
we've also got new guys that haven't been here before. So that may be a new
adjustment period throughout the course of the game as well.  
  
Q. Your dad is not known for holding his tongue, but he has not tweeted
about this game. He has not texted as far as I know about this game. Has he
been asked to be quiet?  
RICHARD PITINO: Not by me. We spoke. Normally he would listen if I told him to
be quiet. I think you know better than that. No, I spoke to him once. He's in
Greece. Not easy to get ahold of people in Greece. We didn't talk much about
anything other than he asked about Matz, how he's doing, asked about the team.
At the end of the day my focus is totally on helping our team be put in a
position to succeed, not a whole lot else more than that.  
  
Q. When you talk about the job and I know you and Luke Murray are
friends. The job that they've done and that the staff has done and you knew
the guys and the job that Chris has done this season?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's been really good. Whenever you're bringing in fifth year
seniors. Do they have a true freshman on the roster? They don't. Obviously,
with them coming in here and scrapping together a pretty good roster,
obviously Jordan Juarez one of the most improved players in the country.
Offensively what they run is tough. Defensively very good and what Chris Mack
did at Xavier is phenomenal. I've got a lot of respect about what they do. I
think Chris does a terrific job. Luke is one of the best up-and-coming
assistant coaches in the country. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a head
coaching job at some point soon. He is really, really connected. So all those
guys do a great job. I think Chris will win big there.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned mental toughness. Is this team tougher mentally
than any of your past teams and if the answer is yes, why?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think some of 'em are. You know, anytime you get whether
it's the Big Ten or any of these power conferences you need to try to stay old
to the best of your ability. It's hard to do with transfers and deflections
and so on, but when you got Michael Hurt, Jordan Murphy, Eric Curry, Dupree
McBrayer, guys like that who have played in the NCAA Tournament and who have
finished in the top 4 in the Big Ten, played on the road in the Big Ten, went
undefeated two years ago. Those are the guys that need to be the voices. The
other guys need to follow suite from there. That's what being part of a
winning program is about. You need guys in your locker room to step up and I
think we've got really good leadership in there. They don't get real
emotional. They're not too high, they're not too low. I try to be that way and
I think the personnel is as well. They go about their business. They're not
about a beat your chest type of team. You make a three you're not going to see
a bow and arrow. They're just going to get back on defense, and that's the way
I like it. They're a fun group to be around.  
  
Q. Coach, update us on Matz?  
RICHARD PITINO: We held him out yesterday, slowly coming back, getting a
little bit better. That will be a game-time decision, but he got popped pretty
good in that Purdue game. So we've got to make sure we're careful with him and
do what's best for him.  
  
Q. Jarvis has a unique role on your team. Talk about that?  
RICHARD PITINO: We did a military team building thing in the fall and you do a
bunch of team building exercises, and Jarvis, they've done the program for
seven or eight years and at the end of it they give an MVP t-shirt to the best
leaders and at the end of it Jarvis was one of the two best leaders. Crazy
good quality leadership. Played off and on. You would never know it. He is on
the bench, not afraid. We talked about vulnerability. Russell Westbrook is one
guy. He is not afraid to compete, and that's Jarvis. He is not afraid to be
emotional and pour himself into the team. He came in that game versus Michigan
and everybody was exhausted and he was like the Energizer bunny, because he
plays so hard. So I think his future is bright.  
  
Q. What has Matz meant to the team this year especially with Curry going
down?  
RICHARD PITINO: Curry does down right before the Purdue game and Matz hadn't
played a lot. He played in the nonconference and did some good things. But
with Curry going down Matz comes into the game with 7 blocks, 9 rebounds, 6
points, and changed the game. That's what being part of a team is all about,
being ready to go, not feeling sorry for yourself when you don't play. He's a
terrific, terrific kid. He's been a valuable member of the team. He's never
pouted and never felt sorry for himself. That's what being a team member is
all about, being ready when your number is called. It's crucial. We will
hopefully have him back tomorrow and I don't know if we will or not, hopefully
he gets healthy more than anything.  
  
Q. I know earlier this week you said this isn't about you versus
Louisville, but as you get closer to the game how do you control those
emotions and make sure they don't seep into your preparation?  
RICHARD PITINO: As you get closer, more and more it's about the game. It's
been that way from day one. I think when you see Louisville pop up you are
more about okay, what am I going to say to the media? How am I going to lie to
the media? I think you have to be prepared for those questions. But from an
emotional standpoint when you play in the Big Ten there are so many emotional
games. I learned that. I'm only 36. As a young head coach you have to keep
your emotions in check. I think I do a pretty decent job of that but that ball
goes up and I'm watching film and I'm watching Louisville play, it's not about
who the name on the front of the jersey is. I'm watching a really good team
Louisville, a well-prepared team with a lot of talent, and how can I put
myself into a position to beat them and I know it's going to be difficult.  
  
Q. For Johnson, it's been a complex path over the last four years for
him. He had a big moment on senior night. What has he brought to the team?  
RICHARD PITINO: Jarvis Johnson was an important recruit for me when I got to
the Twin Cities. He was a fringe guard. We thought he would fit us well. The
cool thing about Jarvis is he signed with a third year head coach, to believe
in me and when he's been here he's provided unbelievable leadership. He is a
voice in the locker room, regardless of the fact that he plays and he talked
about the right things. He's been appreciative. His family has been
appreciative. You don't always get that as well, so he's been a very, very
valuable member of our program and unfortunately hasn't been able to play. But
we all see the big picture and we are happy that he's going to be able to
graduate.  
  
Q. NCAA was asked if anybody in the room said, "Is this a good idea to
match Louisville and Minnesota," chose not to comment. What is your thought on
that? Should this game have been played or should they have found a way to
match you with somebody else?  
RICHARD PITINO: I don't have a whole lot of opinion on it because when I'm
sitting there Selection Sunday I'm looking around. I'm excited about the fact
that I know we're in the NCAA Tournament. I'll play whoever. I'm excited.
There is not one part of me that isn't 1000% honored, appreciative, humbled by
the fact that we're in the NCAA Tournament. It's a hard tournament to go to,
only 19% of our college basketball teams get to go to it. So you never are
going to hear me ever complain about anything that we play. Like I said, I got
tons of respect for their program. Their coaching staff does a really good
job. So I'm going to be very, very excited tonight leading up to this game and
tomorrow. Doesn't matter who we play. I'm just grateful for the opportunity.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jordan, but also Steven Enoch and Malik Williams and
other guys that can step out and hit the three. How do they affect the game?  
RICHARD PITINO: The way that they play is a coaches dream. We've got five guys
that can step out and shoot. Malik can knock down a shot. Enoch is so big down
low and the fact that he could hit a three is a different dimension as well,
and anytime you have pick-and-pop and pick-and-roll, I think we've got really
good personnel. I think Chris does a good job of putting them in the right
spots to put you in a bind and make you make decisions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome student-athletes from Nevada Wolf Pack, Caleb Martin,
Cody Martin and Jazz Johnson. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For both the Martin twins, what's your first memory of Jalen, and how
well do you know his game going into the contest?  
CALEB MARTIN: We're really close with Jalen, our first memory is playing an
AAU team loaded with him and I forget exactly we met, but I just know that our
coach used to call him a primadonna all the time, because he has to get going.
He is at his own pace. He's a relaxed, chill dude and it would take him a few
minutes to get going in the first half, but once he did he was really smooth.
He was dabbing lose balls and really gritty, so they didn't understand how
Jalen worked at first. That's our guy. As soon as he saw the name pop up that
we were playing us, he sent me emojis, me and Cody, and I've been talking to
him throughout the year and that's my boy. I got a lot of love for him, but
whenever we play we can't be friends.  
  
CODY MARTIN: Same thing, remember him from AAU, feels like forever ago. He's a
pro. He's got size. He's athletic. He can really play, can shoot the ball
well. I don't know, I think it's going to be really, really fun and it's going
to be really competitive and we haven't got to see him in a while. The last
time we saw him was going through the process of the NBA workouts. It's been
nice to keep in touch throughout the season and we got a little text and it's
going to be good to see him and once we get on the court all that goes out the
window. Somebody's gotta win.  
  
Q. For Jazz and either Cody or Caleb, Jordan Caroline, how is he as a
teammate, to hangout with, something about his personality?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: I'm really close with Jordan. He's goofy, an incredible
teammate. He's really all about the team trying to make sure everybody is
good, morale is high. He's the jokester on the team, him and Trey. But he's
overall a really fun guy to be around.  
  
CALEB MARTIN: Really good dude to be around, really funny, see him on the
court, get-after-it type of dude and really play-angry type of guy. But off
court he's a good dude, man. He's one of the best teammates I could ask for
and just really goofy, like Jazz said, brings a good vibe, a good energy.
Really good dude to be around. Couldn't ask for anything better, honestly.  
  
CODY MARTIN: When he's on the court, he looks mean and aggressive, but he's a
lot more outgoing than people think. A lot of people don't get to see the
other side of him, rather than being on the court, just what they see on TV.
He's outgoing. He's funny. Love having him around. He's always a good time.  
  
Q. Seniors, how have your past NCAA Tournament experiences, how will
that help you this week and what's it like with your last chance going around
this time?  
CALEB MARTIN: Always being in a tournament like this, it's always good to
experience this no matter how it goes from previous times being here. It just
helps you with knowing that the main thing coming to this tournament is
keeping your composure. You just don't know how the crowd will be or how the
game will go or anything like that because everyone is playing their best at
this time of year. You can expect guys that you might not expect to be playing
well can come out and be a spark for other teams and same thing for your team.
Guys who might have had a slow start to the year could be one of the biggest
factors of advancing to the tournament.  
  
It's one of those things you expect the unexpected, at least try your best to
and keep a level head no matter how the game is going.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I think the biggest thing learning from my past experience is
don't make it bigger than it actually is and just realize that it's just
another game and you've been playing basketball all season. I think sometimes
when you build it up in your head and you try to play different you do things
different and you approach it different, rather than the same thing you've
been doing all season. Because at the end of the day we're all going out there
with the same teammates. You're playing the same steps and the same way. I
think it's having a consistent approach so you don't try to do too much.  
  
I think a lot of our experience and how old are guys are is going to play a
big part in how we do consistency-wise and having that experience on our side
and understanding that consistency is the biggest thing for us and having that
mindset and that approach will benefit us in the long run.  
  
Q. For the twins, you are on a team with a lot of transfers. You
transferred yourself, a lot of experience. What's it like being on a team with
so much experience and so many players who came from other schools?  
CALEB MARTIN: Like you said, experience in college basketball is everything. I
learned that quickly my freshman year at NC State getting to play in the
tournament, we got to go to the Sweet 16 that year, too. So I got to see how
much experience played a role in advancing to this type of tournament and
winning games in general. One thing I will say for our team even though we do
have a lot of experience it's a lot of guys' first time in this tournament. So
when it comes to this tournament we don't have that much experience and things
are played a little bit differently and guys on other teams play a lot better.
It's one of the things we're learning on the fly. It's a lot of guys' first
times here, so it's one of those things we're going to have grow up and learn
really quickly how things are going to go from the tip and you don't really
have too much time to prepare.  
  
So just trying to, you know, I think our staff does a great job of preparing
us to the best of their ability and they do a really great job of letting us
know the realm of things, what's going to go on, and I think we will be
prepared really well for it.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I think experience is going to be really, really good for us. We
have a lot of older guys that's been in a lot of games, played in a lot of
games.  
  
I think, you know, playing obviously in a tournament like this is huge. But I
think it ties back to just being consistent and having the same approach and
just understand that it's basketball at the end of the day. Our team and our
staff approaches every game like it's a championship. So us being in an
environment like this, obviously there is a lot more eyes and people watching.
But at the end of the day we're playing basketball. It's a lot different from
having a freshman who has been in there and throwing them in a fire like this
than older guys who have played basketball for a long time and have a lot of
games under their belt and throwing them into an environment like this it's
nothing new. It's basketball at the end of the day, and we just, you know,
play like we've been playing all season and just try to figure out a way to
get it done.  
  
Q. Jazz, how is it for you coming into a new program and have you been
able to fill the expectations that you had for yourself?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: It's been a really fun experience, honestly. I had a lot of
questions coming in, obviously and you know a lot of doubts but, you know,
through working hard and staying in the gym and talking to my teammates,
talking to Cody, Caleb, Jordan, guys who have obviously been through it. It's
really just an eye opener. Especially, you know, being in a tournament like
this, I ask a lot of questions not as of recent, but during my sit-out year
and throughout the season I would ask Cody and Caleb and JC a lot of questions
about the tournament, what it's like and like they were saying, we do have a
lot of older guys. I think the biggest thing is just for, you know, for the
guys like me who it's our first time it's important for us to learn as much as
we can and try to get that experience through talking to them, instead of, you
know, because we didn't have the be opportunity to be in the tournament
ourselves. So a lot of it comes from being curious and asking those hard
questions in order to figure out what it's really like.  
  
Q. Cody, obviously this team doesn't have one big-time scorer, but six
guys that score 8 points per game. You're the defensive anchor for this team.
Who is the guy that you have to stop when you look at the head of the snake to
defend them? 1CODY MARTIN: Like you said, there is not one person you can key
on because at the all score the ball really well and they share the ball. They
do a great job of actually everyone getting a touch, everyone being able to
have that green light. So that's what kinda makes them dangerous, so there is
not one person we can key on. It's going to be a team effort on our part. It's
not going to be one person that we can single out and try to double team or
whatever the case is. We're going to have to play and a lot of them are really
great scorers and they can go one-on-one ball a lot of times.  
So it's going to be our job as a group and a whole to be able to help each
other out at the same time. Just realistically just have the same principles
we have had all season when it comes to playing defense and they do a great
job of rebounding. They're a really great team, so we're going to have to be
prepared when it comes to their offensive game and we're going to have to have
to play all thirty seconds and make sure we end it with a rebound.  
  
Q. Jazz, a very good defense team in Florida, top 15 in the nation. What
do they do so well on that side of the ball that has given SEC opponents
troubles?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: You have to credit Hayes, one of the top shot blockers in
history, and he's down there and they do a great job of packing the paint and
to hold teams to 63 points a game. For them to be in the SEC that's a major
accomplishment. It's just really important that, you know, we key in on what
we can do and we figure out what we can do to score because that's what makes
them who they are. They play defense and they make sure they crash the boards
and rebound and they defend at a high level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. We're pleased to welcome head coach Eric
Musselman of the Nevada Wolf Pack. Coach, welcome to Des Moines.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Thank you, appreciated it. Well, we're excited to play a
40-minute game tomorrow against a really well-coached Florida team that has a
lot of weapons and I think our guys are in a good physical spot right now and
we look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. You're undefeated in the nonconference, beat some good teams then you
go to New Mexico and get thumped. How did you turn that around and what was
the mindset there?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, we did get thumped, and it happens in college
basketball. It happens in the NBA. It happens in the NFL. It happens in
college football. That's the one game that we felt like, you know, we weren't
in the game so to speak. Our other losses we felt like a couple missed shots,
block out here, we could have won. But that was the one game we played really
bad.  
  
I think for our guys they did a phenomenal job. There was a lot of preseason
hype and our guys it did an incredible job in nonconference. We got to
conference play, played in a lot of sold-out buildings. It's been a learning
experience all year for all of us because court stormings has been the thing
the last year and a half when we have lost. It happened last year at Wyoming
and you know some of our guys, the coaching staff, it's been new to have that.
But I think our guys to be 29-4. Look everybody in college basketball has a
goal. How do you get to the NCAA Tournament? Doesn't matter if you're coaching
in the Big Ten or playing in the ACC it's how do you get to this tournament.
We're here and we're looking forward to playing a really, really good
basketball team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordan Caroline was telling us he feels like a 10 out of 10, very
fresh. How crucial were those six days off for the injury he was dealing
with?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think Jordan is in a great spot from a physical standpoint.
He was held out, like I said, off the Mountain West for precautionary reasons
because of the fact that he did feel like he had a lingering injury. So we
felt that was the best decision at the time because we certainly would not
have wanted to come into this situation minus a player of his caliber.  
  
Not always easy decisions, but I think as a coach, as a program, you've got to
make the best decision for a student-athlete and then you always think long-
term and short-term goals and you gotta think about what's in the best
interest of everybody, so that was in the best interest.  
  
Q. Continuing on Jordan, what has he meant to your program through his
career and the players were talking about how he's kind of goofy, maybe keeps
people loose. How important has that been?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Jordan is one of the first players I recruited the first year
at Nevada. He sat out and it was a player development year. Some of the things
we talked about on his recruiting visit were, how do we improve his perimeter
skills? How do we improve him as a three-point shooter? He came to us as an
undersized five man at his prior university and this year he's been a small
forward for us. There's not many players in the country. Last year, 24 hours
from now he was guarding Mo Bamba and fronting him at his size and battling
for rebounds, and now he's a small forward for us. So he's made a dramatic
shift in his game from a versatility standpoint as is Cody Martin. A year ago,
Cody Martin was our starting power forward and now he's our are starting point
guard. I'm really proud of the development that a lot of our guys have had in
a very short time frame.  
  
Q. Your team has had a lot of transfers. Why have you made that a
cornerstone in Nevada?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think, number one, it's the nature of our society. My son
played on about fifteen different AAU teams. Guys are unhappy with their
roles. They go to a new AAU team. Guys are playing at three, four different
high schools now. When many of us in this room were growing up, nobody
transferred from any college, not a student, and not student-athletes. Right
now there's already 320-some guys in the portal as of this morning and we're
still playing basketball. I don't think it's just Nevada. I think you look at
some great, historical programs that now have grad transfers or transfers. But
we had to find a niche. We wanted to be as good as we could as quick as could
but yet have sustainability. So we took kind of an NBA format. We looked at
high school guys kind of as draft pick and transfers as like an NBA free agent
as we tried to put the pieces together. Sometimes it gets lost, the freshmen
that we brought in because Lindsey Drew and Cameron Oliver were part of our
first class and they were freshmen and we rolled with them and played them a
ton of minutes but certainly our roster is full of transfers.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Jordan Nwora](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36733)

### [Christen Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36127)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the student-athletes from Louisville,
Jordan Nwora and Christen Cunningham. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Christen, is this what you envision the when you decided to come to
Louisville? The projections were 11th in the ACC and all that. Did you think
the NCAA Tournament was attainable?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, my number one goal when I came to the University of
Louisville was to be able to compete for a national title and I thought we
could make the tournament from day one. So it feels good to finally achieve it
and be here.  
  
Q. This may sound like a simple question, but how did you guys get here?
Not many expected you here in March. What is it about this group that has
allowed you guys to make it here?  
JORDAN NWORA: You know, getting here I think it's just us working hard and
being tough, so really just working hard, being tough, listening to what Coach
Mack and the coaching staff has preached to us all year and because of that
sticking together and because of that we won a few games and did well in the
ACC which got us here.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: I would say similar. We were a resilient group. We had a
really tough schedule. We knew that coming into the year, but we took the
motto of being stronger together and unbreakable and we used being 11th as a
chip on our shoulder for motivation and knew what we wanted to achieve.  
  
Q. Coach Mack is known for using negative motivation to fuel you guys.
Has the whole Minnesota-Pitino angle been played out in practice or privately
among you players and with the coaching staff as a source of motivation?  
JORDAN NWORA: No, we haven't really talked about that at all, actually. We're
just worried about playing Minnesota. Coach Pitino was here and now it's Coach
Mack and we know that Minnesota has Coach Pitino's son, but we haven't talked
about that. Minnesota is our focus going into tomorrow and doing our best that
we can to win the game.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: For sure. It's kind of a sexy story line for the media,
but as far as our program is concerned, we are worried about beating Minnesota
and advancing. It's not about any name that's associated with the school. It's
just about players going out there and making plays.  
  
Q. What is the biggest thing that stands out about Minnesota to you
guys? What do they do really well? They're a team that's won a few straight.
What stands out to you?  
JORDAN NWORA: Probably their big guards. Coffey is a really good player, and
obviously Jordan is a great player, too, double-double machine. They can beat
you up in the post. We're going to have to be physical with them, too, and
just do our best against that.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, they're a really physical team. Bigger guards and
some really physical guys in the post. So we understand what they bring to the
table. We just gotta match their intensity in the paint.  
  
Q. I know you're not supposed to look ahead, but you've already beat
Michigan State. When you saw this bracket did you think this is a really good
route for us? Really good draw? Either one?  
JORDAN NWORA: I mean, everything is going to be tough, no matter where you are
in the bracket. Every team at this point in the year is going to be good.
They're here for a reason. Right now we're not even looking ahead to Michigan
State. Michigan State has to play Bradley first, so we're not even worried
about that. Worried about playing Minnesota. They're not going to be somebody
we're going to go in and trounce by 20. We've to play hard and do our best to
beat those guys first, and then we will worry about the game after that. It's
going to be tough regardless of who we play, but right now we're just worried
about getting past Minnesota.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: I don't think we have looked ahead to Michigan State at
all. Obviously, we played them earlier in the year. But I would probably say I
know we're a much different team that played them and I'm positive they're
probably a much different team as well. But like Jordan said, we are focused
on Minnesota. Gotta take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Christen, what did you anticipate your role to be when you
transferred to Louisville? What were you looking to provide on the court?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: I knew right away I was going to be a guy who would come
in and provide leadership for this team. They had a lot of talented players
but not a lot of experience. So that was one thing I wanted to come in and do
is try to be a leader on and off court. As far as on the court just be a
playmaker. I got a ton of great players around me, really talented. I knew it
would be my job to put them into position where they could be successful.  
  
Q. Jordan, you are the most improved player in the ACC. What do you
attribute that to?  
JORDAN NWORA: Just a lot of hard work in the off season, Coach Mack and my
teammates pushing me and being in the weight room over the summer and also
this summer playing overseas, boosting my confidence, being able to do well
over there translated to being able to do well, here, too. From there, just a
confidence thing, keeping that and staying in rhythm.  
  
Q. There are so many teams in the NCAA Tournament, but you guys get the
first game of the day. Does that up the ante knowing that all eyes are going
to be on you guys to kick this off?  
JORDAN NWORA: I think it ups the ante, kicking this thing off. But like I said
earlier, we're already hyped enough for this first game. A lot of guys, it's
their first time being in the tournament, and we just wanting to out and show
everybody what basketball is all about.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: It's definitely cool to be the first game of the
tournament and everybody is going to be watching. But also the flip side is if
we don't bring it we could be the first team out of the tournament. So we are
going to use it both ways. But, yeah, it's something we are looking forward
to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We are joined by Louisville head Coach, Chris Mack. Coach, welcome.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Thank you. Glad to be here, and obviously a big challenge here
tomorrow against a very physical opponent in Minnesota, and, you know, it's
odd to be the first game of the tournament. But that's how the draw works. So
we're excited to be in Des Moines and start off the tournament.  
  
Q. Chris, this is the first game of the tournament. There are a lot of
people that think this match-up was designed for ratings or story lines or
that. As you process all that, A, what do you believe along those lines; and,
B, have you used some of the perceptions about it as motivational fuel for
your players?  
CHRIS MACK: I haven't even talked about it with our players. I just feel like
it's such a special experience to make the NCAA Tournament for a few of our
guys for the very first time and only time in their career. So to focus on
anything other than trying to be at our best against a really good Minnesota
team I think would be robbing them of the experience of being here.  
  
You know, I don't mind, and I understand why media are going to ask about it.
But here is the thing: I took over for a Hall of Fame coach. I get that. He's
a terrific coach. I asked him his advice on Louisville when I took over the
program, and he was nothing but gracious to me. But this is about the players
and the coaches' experience in the tournament and that's it. It's no more than
that. I think the Committee could have probably had a little bit more self-
awareness so we don't have to be up here answering these type of questions and
focusing on the student-athletes and the coaches' experience and the fan
base's experience, but, you know, I can't control that.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of people haven't seen you play very much this year.
They're going to see you play tomorrow. For people who aren't familiar with
your team, how would you describe this particular group, what they've done to
get here?  
CHRIS MACK: That's a great question. I feel like we're a resilient group.
We've been through a lot. I think we're a very together group. Sometimes that
may not come out on the floor in terms of making the right play or being at
our best, but the intention has always been clear with our group. We are a
very, very together group, a close-knit group. It's no secret that when I took
over there wasn't the greatest light around the program. I told our players in
the very beginning when I met with them that they weren't the cause for it,
but they could certainly be the cure for it. I think anybody that's watched us
play this year, I've asked our players to be this way. I want fans or people
that watch our team to say, wow, those guys play hard. They play together.
They play the right way. We haven't been perfect, but I'm really proud of our
group because they've done that all year long and that's all you can ask for
as a coach.  
  
Q. You've acclimated yourself to the Gophers. How much has Jordan Murphy
stood out and to be 6'5 " or 6'6" to be able to produce?  
CHRIS MACK: He's that short? I haven't been next to him, so I don't know that.
But he looks like he's 6'11" on film. He's very, very strong. I think like all
great players he knows who he is. He has an identity in terms of how he plays
and he doesn't try to get outside that identity. You know, you hear him in his
interviews. You can tell he's really smart. He would be a great leader. I
mean, to be where he's at in the history of the Big Ten rebounding the ball
says a lot about the type of player and the will that he has. We're going to
have to do it collectively. Some teams in the Big Ten have put their 5 on him.
I've seen him seek and destroy 4's and 5's, so we have to be able to do it as
a team. He jumps out on film. Like a lot of teams that make this tournament,
he's not their own threat, not even close. He's just a part of their machine.  
  
Q. Not to look ahead, but the first Michigan State game was kind of a
breakthrough for your program. I think people perceive that you were further
ahead maybe than they expected. In your own mind, did you see this potential
that early? What told you that this had the makings of a tournament team?  
CHRIS MACK: Yeah, this will have nothing to do with who is on the other side
of our pairing or bracket because we're not naive enough to think that we're
going to get past Minnesota. We're focused on trying to play the Gophers. I
really had this belief in the summer when I worked with our players I saw
their work ethic up close, their skill level. I saw the strides they were
making, and I think they all, and I'm talking about our players, they all
became a little bit more believers in themselves when we went to New York and
played in the Barkley's, and even though they didn't win two games I remember
Mike DeCourcy saying if Louisville doesn't play bad and doesn't get decimated
by Tennessee or Marquette, which was a valid point from an outsider's
perspective early in the season.  
  
But we played Tennessee tooth and nail and the last five minutes couldn't
score against their zone, and then we had Marquette. We had control virtually
up to the last two games and I don't feel like anybody in our locker room felt
like we played perfect in either of those. So when we left we felt like we
could have done the job, should have done the job. Now we have to figure out
what we need to do to win those type of games.  
  
Q. Chris, you have so few players who have done any of this at the NCAA
level. They haven't been through any of the trappings of the tournament. What
kind of a challenge is there beyond that?  
CHRIS MACK: It's basketball, and we try to be the same people whether we're in
the practice facility at Drake today, at the Yum! Center or Chapel Hill,
doesn't matter, you could point to all kinds of teams. UMBC last year I don't
think they had ever been to a NCAA Tournament. It's not a rock in a sling
shot. It's basketball. We have to be prepared like we are every game, and then
we have to try to go execute that game plan to the best of our ability against
a really good team.  
  
Q. When your team has been good, it's done some pretty special things
against some really good teams, maybe not for forty minutes. When you look at
that, is that kinda the upside for this team? Are they that much above their
heads or is it a matter of them getting to that more consistently?  
CHRIS MACK: I tell our team all the time that we don't have to be perfect.
Nobody that we play is going to be perfect. It's not going to require a
perfect effort to win or a perfect game plan. It's just our effort and our
energy and our resiliency. Those things have to be perfect. Those things have
to be perfect. You might miss a shot, might miss a free throw, turn the ball
over. But our effort and our energy needs to be better than our opponent's,
and it needs to be consistent each and every night. That's hard. That's hard
to do for a long stretch of games from October all the way through now. That's
very difficult. A lot of teams can't do it. I think our team has done a great
job of that. We're not always, again, perfect, but I think we've done our
part.  
  
Q. A lot of the teams that are seeded 1 or 2 are familiar to you,
ridiculously so --  
CHRIS MACK: I would like to thank Kenny Klein for that scheduling.  
  
Q. What is the value at this point in the season for having gone through
that gauntlet?  
CHRIS MACK: I know our players feel as though there won't be a team that we'll
face where we will wonder whether we can compete with them or not. I think
there are a lot of teams that come into this tournament that say, hey, we want
to win some games. But, man, if we're matched up against a few teams can we
really play with those guys and give ourselves a chance to win? I know our
group feels like we can because we have been. We've been forced to because of
our schedule. We have come out on the short end of the stick, and there is a
reason why they are the best teams in the country. One of the teams we played,
I believe, will be holding a National Championship trophy if it's not us.
That's the type of schedule we have played. I think it should give our guys
great confidence if we stay within ourselves and play with great energy and do
what we work on every single day, that would be good enough to keep us there
down the stretch to win a game.  
  
Q. If it's not you, who?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't know. It could be different teams on different nights.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome student-athletes from Michigan State, Cassius
Winston and Matt McQuaid. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Matt, you came here four years ago a skinny kid who can could shoot
the ball and basically all we thought you could shoot ball and now you're one
of the most feared defenders in the Big Ten. Every time you put on that
uniform now it could be your last. What's going through your head? Describe
your feelings?  
MATT McQUAID: I definitely have more of a sense of urgency, you know? I love
playing with this group. I love my teammates. They're like my brothers, you
know, close group. I'm going into every day trying to cherish every minute,
every second I have with these guys and just taking it one day at a time.  
  
Q. You guys getting Bradley as a 15-seed. What have you seen on film in
the last couple of days of the way they play?  
MATT McQUAID: They got a lot of really good shooters, and they're solid in the
paint. They run their offense really well. They even get out in transition.
They've got a lot of tough match-ups and run their offense really well.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like Matt said, they're a solid team. They don't have a lot
of flaws, good guard play, good inside play. So this is a really good team and
we've got to play to the best of our abilities to beat 'em.  
  
Q. Bradley is a team that was down 18 in their conference tournament and
battled back to win. How do you deal with a team that doesn't go away even if
they're down?  
MATT McQUAID: They're definitely a relentless team. They finished their
conference strong. We just gotta be ready and come out with a sense of
urgency, knowing they're not going to quit the whole game and staying on our
toes until the end of forty minutes is up.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely. They're going to play their best, you know?
They're going to fight the whole time and we gotta be ready, you know? We
can't be lackadaisical, anything like that. We've got to come out and play
with energy and come out and play with heart.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We would like to welcome Michigan State head Coach, Tom Izzo. Coach, welcome
to Des Moines.  
  
TOM IZZO: You made it sound impressive. I wish I felt that way. Thanks for
having us. It's been great so far. We got in yesterday and looking forward to
the game. Bradley, any team that starts out 0-5 in the league and finds a way
to win 10 out of 12, win their tournament, beat a team that was in a Final
Four last year and had a lot of players back in Loyola, got guards that can
shoot it. Brown and Kennell can shoot it from long range and that's always the
worry against a lower seed against a higher seed is a three-point shot. I've
seen nights where they've made a ton of them from long, long rage, we're going
to have to do a good job of defending that. They want to run. We want to run.
We're adjusting without Kyle. He was 18, 20 minutes a game, and he will be not
with us. He's with us, but dragging a damn boot around instead of tennis
shoes. So just the way it is.  
  
I think, in general, when you get to this time of year, I know from my career
every team is here for a reason, because they have had some type of success
and the excitement of getting into a NCAA Tournament will make teams better. I
know it will do that to our team and I'm sure it will do that to their team.  
  
Q. Tom, in 2007 you brought your team to Peoria to play against Bradley.
The all-time attendance record in that game for Carver Arena, which still
stands. What do you remember about that night? It was a close ball game. What
do you remember about it?  
TOM IZZO: I told Jimmy how stupid I was. Why would I come there to do that?
You know, and I don't mean that insultingly, I mean I know what kind of team
they were. I remember going to a luncheon that day and there were 400 or 500
people at the luncheon, and I was like, God, what did I get my hands into. It
was a great atmosphere. Peoria has had great basketball for 100 years it seems
like. I remember when it was stocked with high school players, kind of like
our Flint. There has been some fall off maybe because of companies leaving and
going and staying, but it's always been great.  
  
My college coach and Stan Albeck who was at Northern Michigan I used to hear
about Bradley forever back in those days. Rabid fans, great city, and Brian
has done a very good job with this team. You know, I think they're building it
back to where it needs to be.  
  
Q. This is a little bit of a homecoming for Jack Hoiberg, and I know
he's in the locker room. What has he been like for the guys in the locker room
even though he's only been there a couple of years now?  
TOM IZZO: I love Jack Hoiberg. I was a walk-on in college and things turned
out for me okay at a Division II school. Different level, but it looked like
Jack was going to go play golf. But I don't know what made Fred, his mom
Carol, come over and I think there were a couple of guys on his staff at
Michigan State and he came over and wanted to be a walk-on. I hope it was a
great thing for him, but if you know Jack Hoiberg at all, as a worker, as a
student, he's making himself as a player. Like a lot of guys, he is too small
for this, too slow for that. He has been one of the best scout team players
we've had. We talked about it and redshirted him for the first year and I
think he's a kid I questioned whether he could play at this level early on. I
told his dad a couple of years ago I think he can play at this level. And
what's he like in the locker room? Last year he got along with everybody and
those were the super stars. This year I don't have as many super stars, but he
gets along with everybody again. I think it's his background, his mom, his
dad, and his homecoming. He said he has a bunch of people coming. I couldn't
be more honored to coach a kid that does it in the classroom, on the court and
off court and with the work ethic he's done it with. Jack is a special player.
I bet you if you asked our players they wouldn't say we don't like Jack
Hoiberg, we love Jack Hoiberg.  
  
Q. Coach, when you started this annual March habit in this event, I
think it's '98 at Eastern Michigan and Princeton?  
TOM IZZO: Good memory!  
  
Q. I looked it up.  
TOM IZZO: Good honesty! With a bad memory! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. I have a really good memory, but I looked it up. I want to know what
you remember from just this point, the day before, maybe, or the week before
that and maybe how you might critique that coach?  
TOM IZZO: That was a weird year, you know? The year started 5-4. We had gotten
beat by I think Central Michigan and U of D, and I think they were talking
about firing me seriously and then we went on a run and won the next 18 of 22
and it was my first NCAA Tournament as a head coach and we played Eastern
Michigan and they were really good. We won that and had to play Princeton and
we started kind of what I do now, 20-minute segments, get up, 20 minute
segments on Princeton, have breakfast, another 20 minutes on Princeton. I
understood the attention span, and that was pre-Twitter. Now we have four-
minute meetings, and it's changed a little bit since Twitter has evolved.  
  
But we found a way to beat them and that first memory I have about that
weekend is right before the end of the half. Princeton was notorious for
backdoor plays and we ran one on them and found a way to beat them and then
went down and North Carolina took care of us. It was great start and I think
anytime your first game in this tournament, although sometimes it still feels
like my first game in the tournament, I just have a better idea of how to get
the hotel and the tickets and everything. But the excitement of the
tournament, I don't think it's ever changed for me. I love March. I love the
tournament. I love the way it goes. I love playing in games and I love
watching other games. I don't know what the second half of that was, but the
first half was I got a lot of memories of that and I don't have to look 'em
up. But I appreciate them still to this day, 22 years later.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on that a little bit, to what extent do you do
the job of telling some of your kids in the program who are about to
experience this one and done atmosphere for the first time. What part do you
play in helping to explain to them what it's like versus how much you rely on
veteran players to tell their teammates that from a player perspective?  
TOM IZZO: I'm starting to realize more and more, you know, as we all get
older, we're in this weird profession where our clientele are always 17 to 22.
So I think it helps to have other people telling them, you know? I've been
blessed at our place. We've been at one and done mode for about three weeks
now, when you think about it. We had to win so many games to win the Big Ten
Can championship, and then Magic coming back to Steve Smith, and I would
always ask them to talk to our guys. Then I would ask the Tum Tums, Jaren
Jacksons, and Myles did a good job calling guys and telling them how to deal
with those pressures. Then you get in the Big Ten tournament and you've got to
win 3 and I think we have more practice now of being one and done and we
haven't experienced what it means to lose and that's a good thing. But I try
to tell my freshmen there are different pressures, the "my bads" go out the
door because one "my bad" and we're going home.  
  
So I try to explain it, but that's where Matt McQuaid and Kenny Goines are
really helpful because he's been in the Final Four, and I think our guys know
what's at stake.  
  
Q. Tom, I wanted to ask you about the merits and the pitfalls of winning
the conference tournament going into this because your teams have done it both
ways. I'm wondering if winning the conference tournament can make guys maybe a
little complacent or overconfident going into the first couple of rounds or
whether maybe losing in a conference tournament can scare your team in a
productive way?  
TOM IZZO: Coaches are great creatures of habit and if we lose I'm going to say
that damn conference tournament and if we win I'm going to say that real good
conference tournament gave us a boost. You've got to have an excuse if you're
a head coach, so I play it both ways. But what I really believe, this is new
territory for me. Ninety percent of the tournament games I think we played on
Friday, 90% of the 22 games, I believe we have. I'm not proactive. We picked a
year where we're on a Thursday and we won the conference tournament. Is that
harder? Of course it's harder, but it also, there is momentum that you gain
from that, you know? The one thing I don't have, and I really don't worry
about it much in my program. We play such a good schedule every year I've been
there and usually we get the brains beat out of us by a couple of people. So
that big ego, thinking we're better than we are, you know, Indiana who didn't
make the tournament beat us twice. So we're not very cocky in that respect,
but I think when you do win you do get a little confidence. I think because of
the players that come back and explain to the guys what it is like. A lot of
writers three years ago who got beat by Middle Tennessee thought we looked
past them. We shot 50% from the field and 50% from the three. They just shot
above us. They just played better than us. We got in foul trouble. We had an
injury in that game to Kenny Goines, the match-up. They just beat us, and
there wasn't been many times I've worried about us looking past the team or
thinking we are better than somebody because that's something I try to do
every single day of my life. Never forget where I came from and never forget
those tragic losses, but never forget those exhilarating wins either. It's
just all part of the deal. I don't believe we are going to be looking past
anybody. I worry about fatigue because of the injuries and playing Sunday
night and getting home at 11:30 and all the things we went through. But cocky
or too confident, or go the other way, as you say, man, they came to this
program to try to win a championship. They signed up for that the day they
signed up and the goals and the rules have never changed. When we're down and
out they don't change, and when we are really good they don't change. When we
are not so good they don't change. This year's team has been consistent, if
you look at our offense and defense, and hopefully that will carry us through
here and win a game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Off track here, but Iowa State is just down the road, and they're
going to play an Ohio State team you're familiar with. What should people
around here expect from that team?  
TOM IZZO: Ohio State is a very good team. They had Wesson out for a while and
early injuries, but Wesson is a monster. He got in foul trouble, he's 6'10",
two whatever, but their guards are starting to play a little bit better. They
had a fifth year kid in there. They're athletic. They guard pretty well. Chris
is a very, very good coach. So I think it will be an hell of a match-up
because I've got a chance to see Iowa State on TV and Shayok was hurt for a
little while and he came back and he made a difference. So they both lost guys
and got 'em back. So it should be a heck of a game. Where is that game played
at?  
  
Q. Tulsa?  
TOM IZZO: Tulsa? It will be a good game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the Montana Grizzlies. We have Bobby
Moorehead, Michael Oguine and Ahmaad Rorie. Questions for our student-
athletes?  
  
Q. What are your thoughts being in Des Moines, and how does it feel this
time around as opposed to last year in Wichita?  
AHMAAD RORIE: It feels real good. Travel was good. It's a blessing just being
able to be out here again for a second year in a row. We're coming out here
prepared so we had a good practice today and just been trying to get a lot of
rest. So it feels good having some downtime and be able to have some fun.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: It feels similar to Wichita, the last site we were at. I'm
sure there are going to be a lot of fans here, neutral fans enjoying a good
game. So I'm looking forward to that and having a good time with my teammates.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: Excited to be here, second year in a row making the NCAA
Tournament. It's a dream come true. I think we're more focused, more locked in
and ready to get after it.  
  
Q. Guys, part of the winningest two-year stretch in school history. What
are you most proud of in your Grizzly career?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Just being able to make it to the tournament twice in a row, win
two championships, and we have a group that has worked hard each year. With
that being said, just having this group that's, you know, been through a lot
of adversity but been able to achieve a lot as well.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: Just like Ahmaad said, getting to the tournament two years
that's been a big part of it, but also building something we could be proud
of, the people in the state are proud of and putting a product on the floor
people can enjoy and bringing enjoyment to the community is a special thing,
and I feel like we've been able to do that in our time.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: I'm proud of how much we've grown as a team over the last two
years. Like Ahmaad said, all the adversity, the championships are amazing, and
just going through everything with your brothers. Just to have these guys as
life-long friends is awesome.  
  
Q. You guys have grown up watching the tournament and watched upsets and
all that. What would it mean for you guys to be that darling, that upset
team?  
AHMAAD RORIE: It would mean a lot, you know, and I feel like we honestly have
the team with the potential to do that this year. We have a very old veteran
team and we've all been through a lot, prepared a lot. So I think just having
a good game plan, you know, and not really playing with pressure. I feel like
if we do that then we will be good. Just growing up watching a lot of games
it's been great to see teams go far that probably weren't supposed to go far.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: It would be a dream come true. Like Ahmaad said, growing up,
it's always fun to root for the underdogs, to pull off an upset is obviously
our goal. To do that it would mean a lot, for ourselves, for the team, for the
city, for everyone that supported us along the way that would mean a lot. So
that's the goal.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: We know there are going to be upsets every year, so why not
us? I believe and the rest of the guys on our team believe. So it would be a
dream come true. It would be awesome.  
  
Q. Ahmaad, this team is a strong defensive team and they're bigger than
you guys sizewise. When you approach the game, how do you look at the way to
run your offense against this team? They defend ball screens very well and
defend the three ball well. How do you approach this offensively?  
AHMAAD RORIE: I feel like we need to get out in transition. We don't do that
enough and when we do we score at a high rate and moving the ball side-to-
side, and I know all the shooters are going to be ready to shoot and getting
offensive rebounds. We have guys that are capable of getting rebounds. So if
we do those two things we'll be good.  
  
Q. Bobby, along those lines, matching up with their size, something
you're going to have to do personally. So what do you think about that match-
up going up against them?  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: It's going to be tough. We've dealt with size issues a lot
this year, and it's going to be nothing new. I know their center is over 7
foot, so it's going to be a tough match-up. But it's been tough the whole
year, so we gotta get mentally prepared for it and do our best and I think
when we have played our hardest and our best this year things usually work
out. So that's what we're going to do. Just play our hardest.  
  
Q. What do you guys remember just from before tip-off as far as the
jitters of last year and being on this experience and the scene? How much do
you think it will be not as big this go-round?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Well, it was my second time going to the tournament. I went with
Oregon before, so I was familiar with it a little bit. But obviously playing a
different role on this team. But I kinda had a little bit of jitters but try
to relax, know that my team was well-prepared, and I think this year will be
my third time and everyone else's second. We'll just come out here and be
focused and try to win the game. I don't think it will be too big of a deal
being nervous.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: Last year the game got delayed a little bit, the game before
went to overtime. So that helped out with nerves. You had pregame nerves, but
watching that game going extended time, kind of were able to relax a little
bit and go out and play our game. Experience definitely helps with that, so I
don't anticipate that we will be as nervous. So it will be more like let's
take care of business and get this thing going and go from there.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: There were jitters last year all around. You're traveling on
a charter flight which we're not used to with a lot of people who aren't
normally in our normal travel crew. So there is a lot of different things
going on, a lot of hype going on. This is different. This year we expected it,
prepared for it and I think this year are more focused. So I don't think the
jitters will be there as much. Obviously, you're still playing on the biggest
stage in the country. But when one year under our belt and we truly believe
that's the difference.  
  
Q. Michael, Coach John Beilein mentioned how much better of a shooting
team you were last year missing shots being the difference in that game. What
do you think about the shooting team you have this year?  
MICHAEL OGUINE: It definitely makes us stronger, a better team, sustaining dry
spells. We had a really big dry spell last year against these guys that put us
in a deep hole. The improved shooting this year is definitely going to help us
stay in the game more. We're going to rely auto that and get open looks and
have confidence to knock 'em down when the time comes. So it's definitely
great to have this year as compared to last year.  
  
Q. You guys face plenty of adversity as you mentioned, couple low points
when you fall to Eastern Washington before the Northern Colorado game and you
were able to regroup. How much did this motivate you guys to get back to the
tournament although you had things going against you? How much did this moment
fuel you guys behind those closed door meetings?  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: We have a one-game mentality, throughout the year we're not
looking toward March Madness, so for a small school like us it's tough to get
there. So you have to get through those losses and we believe what we are
capable of and we got away from those things we do, and once we got back on
track I believe that's when we started to believe we could do this again.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: We knew it wouldn't come down to a regular conference loss and
we had a bigger picture at hand and we said let's get through this point,
let's regroup, get better and be the best we can be when it's time for our
conference tournament so we can win three games in a row and get back here. So
that's what motivated us.  
  
AHMAAD RORIE: At that point we weren't playing that good of basketball. We
were able to regroup like they said and just knew that it would come back to
the three games in the tournament and we knew that we would be fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, best of luck. Thank you.  
  
Pleased to have with us the head coach of the Montana Grizzlies, Travis
DeCuire. Coach, welcome to Des Moines.  
  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. This is what it's all
about for these young men is an opportunity to perform on the biggest stage.
I'm sure they just expressed that to you. Kinda feels like Groundhog Day, a
lot of familiar faces. Hopefully a different outcome. We've got a lot of work
to do. This Michigan team is very good. I think a lot of people may expect to
see the same thing as far as teams go. But I think we have evolved in a
different direction. They're more wing dominant. We spread the floor and play
a little faster and put a few more points on the board. Should be an exciting
game tomorrow and once again just fortunate to be here.  
  
Q. Coach, what's going to be the keys to beating Michigan, and do you
have any ties to Iowa?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: No ties to Iowa. Michigan is a tough team to beat. They're
good on both sides of the ball, a lot like last year. I think John Beilein is
one of the few coaches that spends a lot of time on both sides of the ball,
most teams have an identity on either side. They defend as well as anyone in
the country, 28% from three. It is common to look up to teams in the 30s,
field goal percentage overall. We like to do the same thing. For us, it's
going to be containing Zavier Simpson. I think he's the one that creates a lot
of offense for the others, keeping him in the paint, slowing down the
transition, containing him in ball screens and trying to force the others to
make plays for each other.  
  
If we can get them a little out of sync, slow down their timing in offense
maybe we can force turnovers and see if we can get out in transition
ourselves. We want to score in the high 70s, low 80s, they keep the game in
the 60s. So I think the higher we can make the score the better off we will
be.  
  
Q. For your entire conference season, you were the ones at the top that
everyone was chasing. The position has switched, you are now the underdogs
going up against Michigan. How does that change your mentality for better or
worse?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Well, we've had a few games like this year where. The bullseye
wasn't on our backs and those were the ones that our guys performed best at,
whether we were on the road or we found ourselves in the second or third in
the standings and we tried our best to get back to the top. We played with a
high level of desperation. I think for a rematch our guys will go into the
game the same way. Hopefully we will be hungrier and focus on the details and
play our best basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, last year you had the same starting lineup all season long and
this year it's been up and down, changes left and right. Going into this game
knowing that this lineup you've done a lot of small ball this year, do you
feel confident even though you've had so many changes this year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: I do. I believe in these guys. I've got veterans in this
lineup. Sayeed Pridgett has played a lot of basketball as a junior. He's a
senior now. We've got a lot of older guys going on the floor. So with our
maturity we've been able to settle in through adversity. Right now I think
we're playing our best basketball, and hopefully we can continue to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Beilein said that compared to last year's team the way
you guys are different as far as spreading you out and matching the pace, it's
hard to defend. We've heard a lot of Big Sky coaches say those same things. So
how do you think match-upwise it will be different than last year and maybe
you can exploit some of that?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: We ran into a brick wall last year. We were post dominant. We
threw the ball inside. We played inside out basketball. Film doesn't tell the
story in terms of how physical and how big a team is. I thought we would have
some advantages at the four spot in the post and we couldn't get a shot off.
Once the game settled down and it became a half court basketball game we
struggled to get shots.  
  
We're a different basketball team right now and I think the way we're built
could be advantageous to how they defend. But on the flip side, they have
advantages with size. We've got to find a way to keep that ball out of the
paint and rebound. But we've done that with bigger teams this year and the
question is if we can do it again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, along those same lines, you missed some open shots last year.
This team has been great at knocking those down. How confident are you with
the shooting you have this year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Doesn't matter how confident I am. Those guys you just talked
to up here, they gotta believe, right? I think we're a very confident
basketball team. I think we have found a way to grind and trust each other and
play with a high level of confidence in each other, which means our shot
selection is a lot better than it was a year ago. We will turn down an okay
shot for a better shot. If we can be patient knowing that this is a good
defense team that's going to take way first and second options and contest
everything and just work and not panic at the end of shot clock we will get
open shots. We've just got to be patient enough to wait for them. I think we
will knock those shots down, but I think the key is always to get as many high
percentage shots as you can. We are not going to settle and bomb away from
three because that's the best shoot you're going to get. We're going to find a
way to get two-point shots, and the more of those we get the better off we
will be.  
  
Q. You guys had a tough nonconference season at the beginning of this
year. How did that prepare you to be here and playing tomorrow?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: We played quite a few teams that either were built to be
championship teams or actually did compete for championships, and it's a
different feeling when you go on the floor and you match-up against someone
who thinks they're good enough to hang a banner. That prepares you for March.
I thought we did well. I thought we improved from the adversity that we dealt
with during those stretches. I don't think we were ourselves when we played
Creighton and I don't think we were ourselves when we played Arizona.
Unfortunately we didn't perform many of those games the way I thought we would
when I signed up for those games. But we had injuries right before or day of
that kept us from putting our best product on the floor and we weren't able to
play with what we prepared. This time around the guys we're putting on the
floor we have been playing with for a long time, but I do think those games
prepared us for this situation.  
  
Q. Travis, your team pretty much everybody here has been to the
tournament on this team. How has the feeling been? Have they been more calm or
how have they approached this year as opposed to last year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: It's been more calm the last twelve hours. From the one big
league you're going to celebrate. You can go ten years in a row. That Saturday
night if you win you're going to celebrate like it's the first win in your
life and that's what our guys did. They enjoyed the moment. Sunday they
enjoyed Selection Sunday. We had an incredible crowd come and watch the show
with us, enjoy the moment with us. Monday's practice high energy, probably not
the most disciplined or detailed-oriented group that day. But then as time
passed, Tuesday morning, 8 a.m. practice, hard to get up for. They were ready
to go. As focused as any team could probably be at 8:15 in the morning, and
today they were ready to go. I thought I was focused and ready to go and I had
a couple of them on me making sure I was ready. So it turned into more of a
business trip today.  
  
Q. I think we asked the players what it's like stepping on the court and
playing the game. What is it like for you getting going on this game and going
up against a coach that I know you have a lot of respect for as well?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: It's exciting. But I've built this team to treat every game
the same. Whether you're playing Michigan or Eastern Washington or Idaho, you
have to treat each game the same so that when one becomes more meaningful you
can handle the rise in intensity in the moment. Right? But you also show up
for a game that you might not pencil in on your calendar when the schedule
comes out.  
  
So, you know, for us it's more than just another game, obviously, your season
either continues or ends tomorrow night. But our guys are excited and ready to
go. I'm excited and ready to go. It's a big moment for me. This is what I
dream of is coaching in the NCAA Tournament. As a head coach, it's my second
time. I would love to be able to do this every year until I have that type of
program. I'm going to enjoy the moment. So when I step on the floor I look at
the bright lights, smile, enjoy the moment and when the ball goes in the air
it's time to go to work.  
  
Q. Something about Michigan is they can have spurts offensively where
they don't score, five, six, seven minutes. You guys are a defensive-oriented
team. How do you force them into those stretches and take advantage of them on
the offensive end?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Hard to answer without giving up the scouting report! We just
gotta do what we know how to do. We know where they're trying to get a shot
for the most part and if we're in the right places at the right times that
moment will happen. And that's what we're known for is holding teams scoreless
for two, three, four minutes. We finished the season leading the conference
for scoring and we held them for what, ten minutes? Hopefully we can do that
again. Michigan is a better basketball team. There is no question about it.
But if we're in the right places and we pick up the flow of their offense at
some point in time we should be in all the right spots at the right time and
hopefully it turns into one of those stretches.  
  
Q. Coach, what are you most proud of during this two-year run to lead
your Alma Mater to the tournament two years in a row, twenty six wins in each
year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: You want me to answer that without bragging? Hard to do. I'm
proud of my guys. Ahmaad Rorie, you are talking about a top-50 recruit in the
country that's playing for a program that's in a one-bid league, transfers
down from the Pac-12. He's been on the number one nationally ranked team in
the country. He's got a lot of reasons to throw up 20 shots a game like a lot
of guards we played against this year. He's taken a backseat not to anyone but
just to the moment to benefit our team, our program, to give us an opportunity
to sit here in front of you right now. I'm proud of him for that because
that's hard to do.  
  
When you dream of playing in the NBA you dream of playing for money, sometimes
your stats, your accolades are important. And a lot of times those things are
worth dollar signs. He put those in the backseat to get here to win a
championship. I'm proud of him for that. Sayeed Pridgett, for two years he has
wanted to be the guy and he has wanted to get shots and get the ball in his
hands and he wanted to start and he waited his turn and he trusted me. Michael
Oguine had his best year as the freshman in the history of Montana basketball
and going into his sophomore year everyone had big expectations for him to be
the best player to put on a jersey at Montana. But here comes Ahmaad Rorie and
Sayeed Pridgett. He's got to share. Here comes Jamar Akoh. So he goes from
expecting to score 25 a game himself to 12, 13. But he's had 30-point games.
They've all had 30-point games, but none of them averaged 20. It's very
difficult to do. So I'm proud of the selflessness that my group has expressed
and shown together to build a championship program.  
  
Q. What do you hope with the senior crew that you're going to play with
for possibly the last time tomorrow night or maybe moving on? What do you hope
for them?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: I want to see them walk out of this arena with a smile on
their face. That means either we won, or they're proud of the effort that they
put forward and the product that they put out in representation of our
community, our program, their families, their friends. I want them to walk out
of here proud. That's not easy to do in defeat. We gotta find a way to win and
play our best basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to have with us student-athletes, University of
Michigan, Ignas Brazdeikis, Charles Matthews, and Zavier Simpson. Questions
for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. What was your guys' first reaction to seeing Montana again in the
Selection Show and you guys had just got done playing and your first
thoughts?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: I wasn't here last year, but this is really exciting for me.
Any team we would have played I would have been just as excited for anyone
else. We are not going to take anyone for granted. We're going to be ready to
go and I'm just excited for this opportunity.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It was a coincidence that we ended up playing the same team
we played last year. They are a really talented team and we are excited to
play them tomorrow.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: Yeah, extremely talented team. Excited to have the opportunity
to play.  
  
Q. Coming off the loss with Michigan State this past week is there any
areas that you guys are looking forward to being able to work on in this game
on Thursday?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: I feel like we got a lot better as a team in the Big Ten
tournament. It didn't go the way we wanted it to, but I feel like we learned a
lot of different things and now I feel like we're moving the ball really well.
We are locked in on the defense end and I feel like we're getting better and
better and you will see the best of us in this tournament.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Our approach right now is really just taking it with a clean
slate, try to forget about that loss. We understand that we wanted to win that
game, but we can't let that lose us another game in this tournament. We gotta
be fresh minded and take on the next task.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: Our focus is Montana. We're just trying to get better every
single day.  
  
Q. Based off the run from last year what's the biggest take away that
you guys take from that three-week experience to try to make sure that y'all
are in the right frame of mind yourselves and passing that on to someone like
Iggy?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: You've got to take one game at a time. That's one thing I
noticed from last year. You've got to have a little bit of luck and we had a
crazy shot to continue our run. But staying in the moment and having the most
fun and enjoying each and every night. Those are the teams that have the most
success around this time.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I would just tell the young guys to enjoy every moment,
practice, the media, everything leading up to it because it goes by quick and
last year we were so focused on winning this, I don't think we got a chance to
enjoy being in the NCAA tournament, which is unfortunate for every team.  
  
Q. Charles, you were on you a great scoring run before you hurt your
ankle and you tried to get back in the groove with the Big Ten tournament.
Talk about that?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It's a process. I understand injuries are part of the game.
Like I said, there is no pressure on me, though. I have so many great
teammates around me where I can ease myself back into the game, back into the
flow of things. But I'm confident in my abilities. I know I will be back to
where I was before, prior to this injury and right now I'm trying to help the
team win, whatever role is needed.  
  
Q. Charles, at Kentucky you were playing 10 minutes a game and now
you're playing 30 minutes a game for a really good team. Is this what you
envisioned when you transferred to Michigan?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: That was the goal, but I knew I was about to put the work in
and earn my coaching staff to trust me to be out there for that amount of
time. Right now it's not so much about Kentucky. I've been gone from there
forever. Now it's just trying to get back to the icing on the cake right now.  
  
Q. Charles, last year against Montana you had 20 points and 11 rebounds.
Do you approach this rematch similarly knowing it's a similar group with not
Montana or is it different for you this time?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Honestly, I just play to win every game I play. I never go
into there with the mindset I've got to get X amount of points, X amount of
rebounds, X amount of assists. It never really mattered to me, throughout the
game I heat up, do what I need to do for the team. Last year we had some early
foul troubles and I knew I needed to do more on the offensive end and rebound
as well.  
  
Q. Do you guys know anything about the state of Montana at all?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: I'm from Canada, so I definitely don't know too much about
Montana. Pass it on to Charles.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It's on the west coast.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I don't.  
  
Q. Montana runs a pretty heavy guard off and they're shorter than you
guys. Is that going to change the way you play? Is there anything that you are
excited to change when you face them Thursday?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: We always have a specific game plan for each team we play.
So depending on what they have, we kind of adjust our offense, defense. But
every single game we play hard, you know? We never let down for anyone. We
don't tape anyone for granted, so we're going to come into this game like it's
the national championship game, and that's the mindset we've got to have. I
feel like if we have that mindset we will be fine.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: We don't take anyone for granted, but they are a smaller
team and that produces strengths for them as well, and that helps to create
for themselves and others. So I feel like we're going to respond to it.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: They're going to present challenges, great guard play, great
team and coaching staff. So I'm excited for the game, and we just have to do
our best to contain them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen.  
  
We would like to welcome Michigan head coach, John Beilein. Coach, welcome to
Des Moines.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you very much, Mike. We're thrilled to be here. I just
told our AD I love being in these venues where it means a lot to Des Moines to
have a tournament like this and so much interest coming into this area. My
first time coming here. Looks like a wonderful place to live. Looks like we're
going to have great excitement here and you can guarantee Michigan is excited
to be part of this round of 64 by the time we play.  
  
Q. John, the players will know that it's Montana again, everybody has
probably asked and talked about that already, but from the coach's perspective
you have to balance the confidence that you have in your guys with the fear of
any complacency that they might have in a first-round game. Do you have any
extra worries that you have to guard against knowing that this is the same
way, the road that went so well last year is starting again? How do you make
sure that that deja vu factor doesn't make your players complacent?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I hope it doesn't go the way it did last year. They were ahead
of us 10-nothing to the start the game, and they have a lot of guys back. I
don't know if Akoh is going to play. I know he might. We have three guys that
played any minutes in this type of game at all. We are a little brand new to
playing in this type of game. They know Montana is even better than they were
last year, and like you say, we were up by 3 at half and very fortunate to win
by 13 points.  
  
So it wasn't a 30, 40-point game. They're a good team. Every team playing in
the tournament is a champion and the way they have played without their big
guy out is really going to present problems for a lot of high major teams
because they're going to spread you out with all guards and that can work
really well.  
  
Q. John, the 10-0 run that Montana started with last year, do you think
that works to your advantage knowing that these guys like Zavier and Charles
won't take them lightly this time around?  
JOHN BEILEIN: They know that and we've been really good so far this year. You
go into your games early. You have your games where you've beat the team
already, right? And we've been able to really respond. We usually respond
pretty well after losses, too, and we had a tough one Sunday. We've been
really good at that. I hope that trend continues. But I think our kids are
sometimes unique to other teams. I think they get all that part, right, that
we don't look past anybody, that we are ready to play every day.  
  
Q. Coach, last year Montana was the only team in the tournament that had
the same starting lineup for every game. This year they have had to evolve in
and out with Akoh being out. What would you say is the difference from last
year to this year?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think having Dorsey and the other transfer, Manuel, that's the
difference this year, between Oguine and Rorie, those two guys are like Big
Ten, Pac 10 guards, and now you ad the shooters around them and everything has
changed. So this is a legitimate team that can have a Cinderella run. They're
terrific. They have a terrific coach, four out of the first five years they've
been in the NCAA Tournament. This is a traditional NCAA team and we're going
to have to play well. There is not a team in the country that can go out and
have a bad game and win. It's not going to happen.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been in this tournament representing a smaller school
before. So the newness, people were bummed that it was Michigan again, because
you guys are really good. So maybe the perspective of a smaller school getting
to the tournament. Your thoughts on having it be a repeat match-up?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Knowing how hard it is to win those three or four games in a row
and get to the tournament. I don't think people really care. For me, you know,
whether it was Canisius or Richmond. We made the tournament. We were just darn
happy to be there. I remember this bold statement we played Utah with Rick
Majerus and Doleac and Keith Van Horn. They had like four pro's on the team
and I said, that's a great match-up for us. We lost 70-40 or something. You're
just excited to get here and everything is positive from this point on. I
don't think anybody is saying, oh, it's Michigan. They're saying, oh, it's
Michigan, a great opportunity for us to have a great win.  
  
Q. The Montana Grizzlies are a heavily defense program and you guys are
one of the top defense programs in the nation. What are the advantages of
having a first-game match-up with two heavily defense teams?  
JOHN BEILEIN: That's one constant you have in basketball is to have a good
defensive team. There have been times we have had a great defensive team.
We're going to have to be great defensively against them. This is one of the
most efficient offensive teams in the country and a leader in a lot of
different categories. So the ability to shoot the 3-ball is a great
disadvantage for us. They're a downhill team and their fast break is
tremendous. It's going to be a big challenge for us.  
  
Q. John, I want to ask you about the merits and pitfalls of winning a
conference tournament. You won the conference tournament last year, got all
the way to the finals and this year trying to go as far as you can without
winning the conference tournament. I'm wondering if losing in the conference
tournament can scare your team in a productive way so they're not too
confident going into this venue?  
JOHN BEILEIN: As long as I've been coaching and I have been coaching a long
time and I've had a lot of wins and a whole lot of losses and after a loss,
every time there seems to be a bounce in our team. You've got to go through a
painful 24 hours. There have been a few times I lost in a championship game.
West Virginia was one of them, and we had to turn around and play right away
and because of the Big Ten schedule and the travel and the amount of time
we're playing I think we're pretty resilient to that. But it is three games in
three days and I know a Hall of Fame coach who said, if you're going to lose
in the tournament, lose on Friday, not Saturday or Sunday. Well, we messed
that up. We had Monday off and we've tried to stay fresh. So it's all part of
it. Our kids are resilient, I think. Montana has one more day of rest, I
believe. But this is the time of year you can't worry about being tired or
anything. We've got to manage that and just go play. But hopefully we will
have the same edge, right, that we have had in the last couple of years in the
first rounds after winning. I think we will have more of an edge, hopefully.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Eric Paschall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35201)

### [Phil Booth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34930)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Purdue - 87, Villanova - 61  
  
JAY WRIGHT: I want to congratulate Purdue on just an outstanding basketball
game. They are a very, very good team. We knew that coming into the game. They
just have great balance, inside game, iso game, drive, shoot threes, defend
great as a team. Just really, really impressive, and we wish them luck going
forward. They're a good team. Classy guys, too.  
  
We just, as a staff, did not get our guys -- we tried to make them understand
their ability to hit threes and execute their offense with great precision,
and we just didn't have them ready from the start. We just gave up, to a team
like that, a lot of threes early, uncontested these. And then once you get a
great shooting team like that going, and then you're overaggressive trying to
take away those threes, then they start slipping. They get you on the inside,
they get you on offensive rebounds. It became an ugly game. I thought it began
with their ability to get threes and our inability to recognize where their
shooters were.  
  
Q. I guess Eric and Phil, the only two returning seniors, there were no
returning juniors. Realistically this wasn't the national contending team.
Somebody didn't even think you would win a game in the tournament. Could you
talk about the difference bringing along young players in the future, the job
you two with all these freshman and sophomores and maybe making another run in
a year or two from now?  
PHIL BOOTH: They did a good job all year. They bought in tremendously. We
won't be here without them because of all the things they did, listening and
learning. Demanding sophomores be like juniors and seniors on the team; making
freshman not to be freshman. We asked a lot of them and they responded. I
think this team will be in years to come very good. Next year they'll have a
lot of talent and a lot of experience and they'll learn from games like this.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I mean, same as Phil. I mean, I feel like our young guys did a
great job this year of just coming along. I mean, they've been through a lot
this year. I feel like through this whole year, ups and downs, they'll take
that on to the next year and years to come and do a great job of it.  
  
I mean, just feel like me and Phil just tried to show them what Villanova
basketball is all about. I mean, it's about playing hard, and playing for your
teammates and coaches. And I feel like in the years to come, they'll be very
good.  
  
Q. So, what do you guys think that -- you know, there was a lot of
emotion at the end of the game and especially with the seniors. Can you
describe what you were feeling at the end of the game and what is your advice
for, you know, your advice leaving the program, for the next age of
students.  
ERIC PASCHALL: I mean, my emotion, I was just sad to not play in the Villanova
jersey anymore. I thank Coach Wright for everything he's done for me. Without
him, I wouldn't be here. I guess losing in your senior year, but at the end of
the day, I love Villanova. I mean, everything they've done for me, every
little thing, that's all the emotions that were happening.  
  
PHIL BOOTH: Yeah, just a lot of the emotion in your head, going through your
head. Last college game, our last time with that special group of players we
had. This young group, they did so much and learned so much. It's just a lot.
It doesn't really sink in yet while you're on the court, because you're still
just losing. But later on how much the University has meant to me, coaching
staff, Coach Wright, players I played with. Couldn't have asked for a better
experience.  
  
Q. Continuing with that point, the legacy that you guys have left at
Villanova, if you could reflect on that and how this is just a loss, but the
legacy you leave behind is probably bigger. Do you both feel that way?  
PHIL BOOTH: I don't feel that way right now, I'll tell you that. You know,
going out like that, just wish it could have been better. But that's just more
credit to the guys I played with, just been fortunate to play with a group of
guys. Like this team here, just unselfish, all about the team, do anything for
the team, for the win, or whatever it takes just to play Villanova basketball.
Guys have bought in and this team is no different than any other team I played
on in the past in terms of committed, wanting to play Villanova basketball.
Wanting to be together, love one another. This group is special in those
terms. It hurts going out like this, but there's a lot here. I learned a lot
from this year.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: Definitely not thinking about any type of legacy right now. I
mean, it's just hard going out like this, but everything comes to an end.
Again, I just feel fortunate enough to play with great guys throughout my
whole career and them teaching me things to help me this year. I hope I did a
great job of teaching our young guys how to continue this tradition of playing
Villanova basketball.  
  
Q. Phil, I saw towards the end you were kind of talking to Jermaine. He
was a little emotional. What kind of advice were you giving him, you know, him
and Collin, and Dhamir?  
PHIL BOOTH: Just telling them how proud of them I was from this year and how
much I've learned from them, and how much they bought in to Villanova
basketball and would do anything for anybody on the team. I just told them to
keep your head up. You'll be back here again. You'll learn so much from this.
Try to keep their spirits up. Those guys have done so much for me, for this
team. Became brothers, you know, connected with a group, maybe younger, two,
three years younger. But we became very close with those guys. Just told them
how proud I am and how thankful I am for them.  
  
Q. Now that the tournament is over, and when you get back to campus,
Coach Wright, what are you looking forward to working on in practice and going
forward from here?  
JAY WRIGHT: We have a really young crew next year. No seniors and these
sophomores become juniors. We got a couple of these freshman we got to
develop. So we've got a lot of work to do, but I'm looking forward to it. I
like these young guys a lot, and tonight will teach them how hard you have to
work to prepare every game and to play against the top teams. I hope Purdue's
a Final Four team. I think they're good enough to be. But we have a lot of
work to do. But I look forward to it.  
  
Q. You said you thought you were in a little bit of a race against time,
you know, maybe try to buy another week of working with these guys, maybe get
to that next level. Tonight didn't look like you were that close. Are you
rethinking that or do you think maybe with a few more days and the right
match-up, it could have swung a little differently?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. In these games, match-ups and the way things go, the score's
not always indicative of where you are as a team. We don't have the man power
-- we got to keep the tempo down. We've done it all year. We don't have the
man power to play from behind and then speed up the game. Once we decided to
speed up the game, it was desperation. We knew we were going to be in trouble.  
  
We needed to keep that close and grind it out. That's what we needed to do.
When they started drilling those three and got up 19 at halftime, it was not a
good situation for us. So, I don't think we were that far, but I think we ran
into a really good team and a really tough match-up for us.  
  
Q. Jay, I wonder if it almost felt like a Freaky Friday situation for
you. Because this game -- the Kansas game you won in the Final Four last
season went the exact opposite way. I mean, you guys came out so hot. Felt
like Purdue did the same thing, too. I wonder if that came into your mind and
as a veteran coach, when a team like that comes out and does this. It's a
devastating end for Eric and Phil, but sometimes it's is just not your
night?  
JAY WRIGHT: I would be lying if I said that didn't come into my head during
the game. You job as a coach, is get it right out of your head. But it did
come in there, and you just have to compete. You have to continue to compete
each possession. And this game is a humbling game. You could be on either side
of it. And it's one of the things we said to the guys after the Kansas game:
Give those guys respect because we came out and made every shot. It doesn't
happen every night.  
  
And they did it tonight and when it happens to you, you give them their
credit, and you learn from it. But if you get in them early and don't let
great shooters get hot, and you keep the game tight, that's what you have to
learn from that. That's what we didn't do. We didn't get up on Edwards early,
didn't get up on Cline early, and when great shooters get hot, you're in
trouble. That's what happened tonight.  
  
Q. Jay what was your message to your seniors especially the last few
guys that have been there for you during that first National Championship run
in 2016.  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you. And from me personally as the head coach first, thank
you for keeping the culture strong and the tradition alive this season rather
than going for your own personal glory. And then on behalf of the whole
Villanova community, thank you. On the court, off the court, they were
gentlemen, leaders. They were the consummate Villanova basketball players.  
  
Q. Jay, kind of piggybacking off of Matt's question, does this Purdue
team and program kind of remind you of Villanova in the way that you guys have
built your program, the way the offense can click, especially along the
perimeter with someone like Carsen Edwards or Ryan Cline at all?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, it does. It reminds me of our team last year. Just great
perimeter skill, but still have a drive game and a good post-up game. Really
unselfish. And you could see they had a confidence shooting the ball, no fear
of failure, very impressive. I did think of that.  
  
Q. Jay, obviously two of the last three years, your team was cutting
down the nets. Worst NCAA Tournament loss in program history for you all
tonight. How do you process that? And what do you tell the guys going forward
about the highs and lows of this game?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. The game's humbling, you know. And it's good for us
sometimes. You don't choose to be in this position. But when you win, you've
got to realize that there's guys on the other side that are working just as
hard as you, and you've got to be respectful of them and understand you could
be on the other side of it, and today we are.  
  
And it doesn't mean we can't get back there, but we have to be respectful and
give Purdue credit, and we have to get back to work. Stay hungry and keep
getting better.  
  
Q. Coach, this was a rebuilding year really for the whole Big East not
just Villanova. It's been so strong for several years. Looks very strong
again. Is there any chance just not having quite the same level of competition
throughout the year made you not as prepared for going up against a team like
this today?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't know. That could be. Our league was a really young league
this year. A lot of young teams who will have everybody back next year. There
will be a lot of really good teams. We could be one of the younger teams next
year.  
  
But I think we were prepared for this game, I think in terms of competition,
you know. I think St. Mary's is a really good team. We played Florida State
during the year. I just think you saw a lot of young Big East teams this year
just get worn down at the end, and when you get to this tournament, you run
into experienced teams and that's what happens.  
  
Q. Jay, Jermaine Samuels may be one of the lone bright spots in this
game, seemed to be really effective in the first half and also grew through
the second half of the year. I saw you coaching him throughout the game quite
a bit one on one. I wanted to get your thoughts about Jermaine and how he grew
and what he means to the program.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. He comes so far. Last year he really struggled picking
things up. Then he broke his hand. It was a really tough year for him where he
didn't really get the experience we needed him to get, so he had to go through
it all this year. And he did it under fire and has done an amazing job. Has
really become a really good player for us. He's going to be a big part of our
team and a leader. We have no seniors next year, so he's going to be a leader
on this team. He's very important to us, he's a great kid, and he will take
the responsibility of being a leader very seriously. I think he's got a great
upside.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Ryan Cline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36335)

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Purdue - 87, Villanova - 61  
  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously, you know, we're excited about moving on. I thought we
played the best game of the year, and you know, you want to be playing your
best basketball at this time. I thought our defense was really good. It's a
little bit easier sometimes to play defense, and be detailed when the ball's
going in for you. So we got into such a good rhythm offensively but we also
got good balance, rhythm threes and getting the ball to the rim on some slips
and getting lay-ups.  
  
I thought our guys were really good on both ends of the court and excited
about being able to move on. We beat obviously a very good team, Big East
champs, the defending National Champs. We bragged on Villanova, and the
closest thing we have to that is probably Michigan State. Just talked about
how tough they were, how disciplined they were, and that we were going to have
to be able to have both of those qualities ourselves if we're going to put
ourself in a position to win this game.  
  
Just proud of our guys for battling tonight and being hooked up and being
ready to play.  
  
Q. Carsen, obviously, there's like 7 for 23 the last game. You started
off so hot in this one. How important was that, and when did you know you were
having a career night?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Honestly, I wouldn't say I knew I had a career night until the
game was over. I was just so focused on trying to get the win, especially in
games like this where you value every possession. I was out there fighting
with my brothers, and was able to get the win and I was able to have some
shots fall for me.  
  
Q. Carsen, how tired have you been of people asking you about not
shooting well and kind of what a statement this performance makes?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: If we're being really honest, I'm very tired of it, but I
understand. I just have to keep working even after being able to have a game
like this, I still have to stay in the gym, continue to work, and continue to
prepare for the next game. I'm really tired of it, but I'm thankful to be able
to have some shots fall for me today.  
  
Q. Ryan, coming into this game could you have imagined having a
performance like that where you beat the defending champions by about 30
points?  
RYAN CLINE: Obviously, coming out hot and playing really well defensively was
big-time for us. We were able to maintain that lead and basketball is a game
of runs. And we stopped them from getting that big run.  
  
Q. Carsen, you probably don't know this, but you now have the record for
three-pointers for a game in this building. You beat Ray Allen. He had 8
against Miami in 1995. Does that make this performance tonight even more
special to you?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Well, that's crazy. I didn't know that. That's crazy, and I'm
blessed to be able to shoot the ball like that and be able to make threes like
that. But I feel like the most memorable thing is just being able to make it
back to the Sweet 16 and beating a good team like this, and I guess just
playing well individually. But I'm just happy for my team, we still have a
game to play for the season.  
  
Q. Both of you, can you just address how important it was to have Matt
do what he did early in the paint, and what that did for you guys on the
outside?  
RYAN CLINE: Yeah, I was obviously very impressed with Matt. He's already shown
that he can do that, but he was rebounding the ball really well tonight. He
was there on a lot of slips offensively. He was at the right place at the
right time.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah. Basically the same thing he said. Matt played well on
both ends. To be able to protect the rim, but also rebound the ball, get some
slips and get some easy baskets for us. Just playing hard and bringing energy
was big-time for us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little about the job Nojel, especially on his
ankle, did and Eric Hunter on Booth?  
MATT PAINTER: Phil Booth is obviously a very good player. We wanted to keep
him out of the paint, and we also wanted to stop him from getting rhythm
threes. He obviously got away from us a couple times. Nojel did a really good
job. He's played well for us all season and has done a good job defensively.  
  
And I was very impressed with Eric Hunter in these two games, to be able to
play 12 minutes tonight, got close to 13 minutes, so really playing almost a
full game and not turning the basketball over at all. That's pretty impressive
in an NCAA Tournament game. Both of those guys played really well and played a
great role for us.  
  
Q. Matt, kind of the same question I asked Carsen about the frustrations
of hearing about bad shooting nights and finally putting on a show like this.
What's that like as a coach, and how do you see that in him and to see what he
did tonight?  
MATT PAINTER: You know, he's a very dynamic player. But he sometimes tries to
find his way into a game by being a volume shooter. That's where he gets into
trouble at times instead of letting things come to you. They're obviously very
aggressive. They switch a lot of things. And so just trying to get into a
rhythm and break people down when he has some mismatches.  
  
I thought tonight with some of the size they put on him, he was able to get by
them, but also dribble to where he can make some space and make some pull-up
threes also. I thought he had a good balance tonight. Him coming in and out of
a game a lot of times, he'll get into a rhythm, he'll get out of a rhythm.
Tonight he really stayed into it and stayed on the hunt and really made some
good decisions. I don't look at him in terms of his percentage and stuff.  
  
I look at him more as just the decisions. He shoots a low percentage normally
when he makes good decisions. When he makes good decisions, it takes cares of
himself. He will have a couple outlier games, but for the most part it worked
itself out. He's played a lot of basketball. You don't get really talented
guys like him that stay for three years. He's got a lot of experience and he's
going to his third straight Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Matt, coming out of the halftime you had to figure they'd be ready to
try to make some runs. You played greet defense. It was a 13-0 run coming out
of halftime. What was the discussion at halftime, and what was the reaction to
that.  
MATT PAINTER: I think any time you start a half, whether it's the first or
second half, it's that first five minutes. But now when you're up 19 points
and it's so unexpected, there's no way you're thinking in your mind, like hey,
this is going to happen against Villanova.  
  
So we just thought they would be really aggressive, and try to double some
things, double some ball screens, trap. We knew they'd pick up into their zone
press, and we just wanted to execute. We were fortunate. I thought we played
pretty good defense in that run, but they also pressed a little bit and had a
couple good looks. It just didn't go down for them. We knew they would be
aggressive and our guys were ready to play.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what it means for this program and
where you are on the map after three straight Sweet 16s?  
MATT PAINTER: You know, it's hard to be consistent. Just trying to get better
from an individual standpoint and develop guys and also understand kind of
that role definition with your team. It's a hard thing to do as a coach to get
everybody to buy in. It kind of just shows the character of our guys. They've
really bought in this year. Everybody's played their role. To be able to have
the consistency we've had within our league and also in the NCAA Tournament.
You know you're greedy, as a coach, you never look at it that way. You look at
it like you didn't advance further, you should have played better in
conference play.  
  
We're excited about going to the Sweet 16, but we want to do better. We want
to do better for ourselves and for our fans.  
  
Q. Matt, you said in your opening statement that this was the best game
you guys have played this year.  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah.  
  
Q. And I'm wondering offensively or defensively, this is what offense
can look like when it's firing on all cylinders.  
MATT PAINTER: It's the balance. We have a lot of guys who can shoot the three,
and sometimes we fall in love with the three. I thought tonight we had a
really good balance. Not just Matt getting slips to the rim, but Carsen also
driving the basketball. I think that's going to be important for us if we want
to continue to advance.  
  
If you get into a rhythm, that's one thing, to be able to continue to shoot
the basketball. But if you struggle a little bit or the shots aren't falling,
you got to find a way to the free-throw line. You got to find a way to the
rim.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

### [Matt McMahon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35054)

### [Shaq Buchanan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36901)

### [Ja Morant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36900)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Florida State - 90, Murray State - 62  
  
MATT McMAHON: Obviously a tough afternoon for us. Congratulations to Florida
State. They have a terrific team, and they played outstanding today. I can try
and sum the game up fairly quickly.  
  
I thought in the first half their ability to make open threes was huge. We
were not very good defensively there, but they did step up and knock down
shots. And in the second half, I thought we were much better defensively. Five
or six straight stops there, but we couldn't get the defensive rebounds. They
just crushed us on the glass there in the second half. And credit to them at
their defensive end of the floor.  
  
We've been fifth in the country this year in two-point percentage, up around
58 percent. They've been one of the top teams defending the two-point shot.
And they just made it extremely difficult on us to finish plays around the
basket. I think we were under 30 percent from two. So that's a great credit to
them. They're an elite defensive team.  
  
But lastly, I'll just say, especially since they're here with me. It's just
been such a great privilege to coach these two guys, Ja and Shaq. It's been a
tremendous two-year run for our program, and I'm extremely proud of our team
and what we've been able to accomplish this season with the back-to-back
regular season championships, the back-to-back OVC Tournament championships,
and now an NCAA Tournament win. I'm very proud of these two and our entire
team.  
  
Q. Ja, obviously a disappointing finish, but what has this 48-hour
stretch been like for you with the triple-double and all of the buzz and hype
around that that you've experienced?  
JA MORANT: The experience has been good for me and my teammates. Being able to
come in the tournament and get a win our first game and just prepare for this
game, it's been great.  
  
Q. This is for Ja and Shaq. I'd love to know -- this is clearly a season
of incredible highs. When did you both realize this was a special season, not
just a good season?  
JA MORANT: I'd say since we all stepped foot on campus, getting to see what
kind of team we have. We have a very special group. And since day one, we came
in and worked and I felt like that's when I knew this would be a special
season for us and it turned out good.  
  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: He touched on when we first stepped on campus. We jell together
and we didn't have to worry about bringing nobody in. We all was as one, and
everybody just played their role. We knew that was going to be great for us.
And we didn't have nobody stepping outside of their comfort zone.  
  
Q. Ja, what's going through your head when you had the towel over your
head and you know the season's about to end? Just walk us through the emotions
of that moment.  
JA MORANT: I'd say I was just hurt not being able to take the floor with these
guys for the rest of this season, for another game, or possibly two, three,
four. But it's been a great season. I really was just thinking back on what
all we have accomplished this year. And I'd say I was more hurt by not being
able to play with these guys for the remainder of the season.  
  
Q. Ja, I'm curious, the first five minutes, I think you had three
threes, a couple assists. Were you getting too winded out of the start. That's
A? And, B, did you tweak your ankle, knee, in the first half there?  
JA MORANT: At the beginning, I just got to my spot and stayed, was going under
the ball screens, and I was able to knock down shots and make plays. I didn't
get winded. I was just playing our type of basketball, was running the sets.
Coach was calling for us and late in the first half, I was coming off a screen
and one of the defenders just pushed me, and I went knee to knee with one of
the players.  
  
Q. Ja, what will you do as you sort of evaluate the next steps and the
NBA and everything attached to that? How will you evaluate the right decision,
your next move.  
JA MORANT: That time will come. My focus is not on that right now. It's just
celebrating what a great season we had with my teammates.  
  
Q. Ja, I just had an opposing coach say they watched film and concluded
you were unstoppable, but they respected the rest of your teammates almost
like they were going to given you points, but you couldn't have another huge
assist team. Did they give you different looks? Did they look like they were
all over your teammates than maybe Marquette?  
JA MORANT: Honestly, no. We took some great shots, but they just rimmed out.
Obviously, if I pass the ball and a shot rims out, I can't have an assist. So
that's the assist part.  
  
I've been seeing a lot of defensive schemes all season. They just played great
defense tonight.  
  
Q. For both of you, it just sees even though not everything was
technically a block, that their hands and arms were in every shot, especially
the ones in the paint. Did you feel that way? Was it harder, Ja, for some of
the passes that you found holes like against Marquette. Did their length kind
of feel overwhelming at times?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: I feel it bothered us at first, but once we got used to it, we
knew we had to finish with power, and we started doing and made a couple lay-
ups.  
  
JA MORANT: I'd say after our first offensive position, I got very comfortable.
Really just seeing what type of defense they were playing, and really just was
trying to get to my spots and make plays for me and my teammates.  
  
Q. Ja and Shaq both. Ja, your fourth assist to Devin Gilmore on the
hoop, you passed Don Mann all time in assists. Any thoughts on that knowing
that you broke what was a four-year career in two and, Shaq, just your
thoughts on that as well?  
JA MORANT: Obviously, something good. I feel good about that, but it's
assists. I wouldn't be able to get it without my teammates. Again that record
goes to them.  
  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: It's great for him. We knew we had to finish plays for him to
be able to break that record. I'm happy he got it. Just another award for him.  
  
Q. Matt, at what point in the season or before the season did you think
that Ja could have the sort of performance that he's had so far?  
MATT McMAHON: Really when we recruited him, we thought we had a very special
talent. We were thrilled to get him. And his first day on campus, I think I
talked about it after the Marquette game. We had a point guard Jonathan Stark
who averaged 22-6 as a junior and was going into his senior year at the point
guard position, and he walked in after the first day and said, hey, Coach,
Ja's going to start for us from day one.  
  
So we played the two point guard attack last year in Ja's freshman season, and
he put up historic numbers last year almost 13 points, 7 rebounds, 6 1/2
assists. Then he's just shown great growth here this year, had a tremendous
spring and summer. You see all of the talent and ability out on the floor and
how he makes everyone better, but he's got some of those intangibles that
really separate him. He loves to play. He's just a relentless competitor. He's
tough and he's a winner. His growth as a leader this year was a big key in the
success we were able to have.  
  
Q. Matt, I'm curious if that tempo in the first half, is that how you
wanted to play? Because it did seem as if your team got a little winded.  
MATT McMAHON: We have to play fast. We've been top three in the country all
year in scoring and transition. Ja's the most electric player in the country
on the open floor. So, it really wouldn't have made sense, I don't think for
us, to sit in the half court and try to grind out a game against Florida
State. I thought those would be our best opportunities to score and score
efficiently. But they did.  
  
I know there's been some questions of Ja and Shaq. They impact everything
around the basket. They are an elite defensive team. That's why they are top
ten in the country in the stats that matter. We just weren't able to finish
some of those plays around the goal. But I thought we got some good looks.
But, again, credit to Florida State. They were just terrific today.  
  
Q. Coach, how was it managing the outside world around Ja on campuses
here with him being talked about being a top-three pick in the NBA?  
MATT McMAHON: It's a great question. It was really easy. And I think it's
because of the humility that Ja has. I think it's because of the great family,
the support system he has in place, his parents back home and then his
surrounding family, they really keep him grounded. And he's a winner. So he's
about the right things. I thought he was able to really do a tremendous job of
blocking out all of the noise and just staying focused on becoming the best
player he could be. Growing as a leader, as I mentioned, and then really
helping this become a very special Murray State team.  
  
And I've said it before, I look back to when I was 19, I couldn't have done
it. It's amazing the way he's handled it and just a great credit to him and
his family.  
  
Q. Matt, I wonder if you would be able to share with us what you said to
him when you knelt down. He had the towel over his head and you, for a good
solid minute, you were talking to him there.  
MATT McMAHON: I just thanked him for what he's done, not only for our program,
not only what a joy he's been to coach this season and through the whole
recruiting process, but thanked him for what he's done for Murray State
University. He's been an incredible ambassador for our school, for our
community, and has really shined the light on the great tradition we have at
Murray State.  
  
Q. Coach, bringing it a little bit back to basketball, when Florida
State opens by making 8 of its first 11 three-pointers, did that change
anything for you guys from a defensive standpoint, or what do you do at that
point when they're that efficient from behind the arc.  
MATT McMAHON: If they shoot the ball consistently that well, they're going to
be a tough out in this tournament. Some of them were some breakdowns on our
part certainly, but they don't have many weaknesses. And I don't know if I
should call three-point shooting a weakness, but if you go through the
numbers, that's one of the areas where they aren't as good. And they just
stepped up and blasted shots on us.  
  
Like I said, the second half, we were better defensively. We're down 16 at
that point, but then we couldn't keep them off the glass. They just dominated
us on the glass in the second half.  
  
Q. You took a lot of your starters out. We talked about Ja's emotions.
What were your emotions as you were hugging your players?  
MATT McMAHON: It's tough. You don't ever want the season to end, especially
when you've had a special group like this. They've been very easy to coach, a
very close-knit group. Going to practice every day, it's been a lot of fun, so
you want to keep playing. It's tough. And you hate for it to end that way. I
mean, we got whipped. That's the bottom line.  
  
Coach Hamilton is one of the most underrated coaches in the history of the
game. He's a Hall of Fame coach. He's won for a number of years. They got a
great, great team. You hate for it to end that way. But again I told our team
it doesn't take away from what we've been able to accomplish, not only this
season but over this two-year run with guys like Shaq and Ja.

_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Florida State - 90, Murray State - 62  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: In our game preparation for Murray State, as we watched the
films and saw the statistical analysis and tried to come up with a game plan,
they were awful, awful impressive. And the because of the respect we have for
what we had evaluated, we knew we had be at our very, very best in order to be
successful.  
  
I thought our guys really locked in. They gave all of the attention to detail.
I thought we moved the ball. I thought we -- obviously, we had to stop them in
transition. I thought we did a decent job of that, but we came to the
conclusion that Morant was almost basically unguardable. So we had to make
sure we defended the other guys that fed off of him. And we worked hard and
made him earn all his baskets.  
  
And I thought we did a really good job defending the other guys, and I thought
that really made the difference in the game. We had scored 45 points off our
bench. I thought we had tremendous help from our rotation players. And taking
into consideration that two of our top players didn't play at all, I was very
pleased that we were able to beat what I thought was a really good basketball
team. And the score is probably not an indication of how much respect I have
for them and how talented they are. I think tonight was one of those nights
everything that we were doing, we were clicking and I thought our guys played
really well.  
  
Q. Terance, how could you describe matching up on Ja both on the offense
and defensive ends. How personal was this game? You showed a lot of emotion on
the court. How much were you feeling out there?  
TERANCE MANN: I wouldn't call it a personal match-up or anything. I just
brought the fight. What I did the night before was Google and YouTube Mike
Cofer, my teammate's father who passed and just saw how hard he played, how
much fight he gave on the field, and I just wanted to bring that with me. And
I feel like that's what I did today. I played my heart out for that.  
  
Q. What does it say about this team that you guys had ten different guys
score, a bunch of people with eight or more points?  
RAIQUAN GRAY: I mean, Coach Ham preaches 18 strong. That's who we are. We
scored 45 points off the bench. That's the strength of our team. I came off
the bench the majority of the season. With Phil being out, I'll be starting
now. We just come in an bring energy. Everything we do falls behind. We get
deflection stills and that leads to easy baskets. That's the main thing, come
off the bench and bring the energy.  
  
Q. Terance, I know you were tweeting out about Phil the last few days,
fund-raisers, everything for his family. What type of person was Phil and what
type of person is his father and how strong is the connection between you and
him and his family?  
TERANCE MANN: You know, Phil, he just brings a lot of energy. He's a funny
guy, always up-tempo making us laugh as a team. He's that leader that we have.
From the stories he told me about his father, they're the same. And he told me
a lot of stories about when his father was playing and the stories that his
father told him. And Phil embodies that and plays with a lot of great
toughness just like his father, so you want to see Mike Cofer, you can look at
Phil.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, you made 8 of your first 11 three-pointers. How
much did that change Murray State's defense, and how were you guys able to
take advantage after that?  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: I feel like going into every single game he played, teams
try to stop our penetration. We do a really job at doing that. So when we
knock down shots, it just opens the floor for everyone, and we go back to
Florida State basketball. The guys who made shots, the guys who helped create
shots did a really good job. Opened the floor for everybody, gave the guys a
lot of confidence. Motivated us and we continue to get stops on defense. The
way we knocked down shots that first half was essential for our success today.  
  
Q. I wonder if all three of you could please give your impressions of
Morant, seeing how it's different when you're on the floor with somebody than
to see him.  
TERANCE MANN: I just think he's a great player. He can score the ball at all
three levels. He finds his teammates most of the time, and that's what's hard
to stop him. You never know what he's going to do, if he's going to find one
of his teammates or he's going to score the ball. He's a terrific talent and
has a lot of the athleticism.  
  
RAIQUAN GRAY: Like Terance said, he's a great player. Overall he's a great
passer. He does a good job of getting his teammates involved and that was a
key thing for them. Making that run and beating Marquette, he got his
teammates involved and had 16 assists. He's a great passer and great player
overall.  
  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: For me, personally when I first saw him in the game of
battle, he is extremely quick. He can use both hands really well. He does a
great job getting inside and penetrating and creating offense for his
teammates. He's an overall great player and he's one of the players that is
really keyed on his passing compared to other guys I've seen. So overall, he's
a great talent.  
  
Q. Leonard, how could you describe Terance's game on both ends of court
especially on the defensive end?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Like Terance said -- Terance and Phil were very close. We
had a very emotional situation when we found out about Mike Cofer. And before
we came on the road trip, Phil got worried that his father was not doing very
well. And coupled with the injury that he had, we had to make sure he was
okay. And I think that our team decided that we were going to dedicate the
remainder of the season to Mike. And I thought that had a lot to do with the
emotions that he displayed tonight.  
  
You guys probably know a lot about Mr. Cofer. I've known him now going on four
years, and you know the part of him, watching him play football. And everyone
who knows him talked about his character, his toughness, and the energy that
he brought to the game. But people don't know how tough he really was to have
to endure the fight, and the courage that you had to have to fight the disease
that eventually overcame him. And he never complained. Through all of the
challenges that he went through, he stood tall, and he fought it with such
toughness and aggressiveness.  
  
And when you see the way Phil plays, the way he acts, the way he responds to
challenges, you see Mike Cofer. And I thought that our kids tonight decided
that's what we wanted to play for, something bigger than ourselves and bigger
than the game. And I think that's why you saw our guys so focused and because
the unit -- our guys have created a culture where they call themselves 18
strong. They're brothers. They're family. And I think that we feed off each
other. And when one's hurting, I think that we all hurt.  
  
And I think the night was in response to the respect we had for Murray State,
but also the respect we had for Mr. Cofer and we wanted him to be happy with
the way we performed tonight.  
  
Q. Leonard, 44 points in the paint. I mean, you guys were able to just
power the ball to the basket in the second half. I mean, it's pretty
impressive when you think about it.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: That's kind of who we are. We've had games -- we've had
periods in every game where we played well and executed well inside. We've
shot the ball well from the perimeter, but we have not consistently throughout
the year put it all together. Even though we've -- what, I think we went 12 or
13 out of the last 15 games. We've been fairly successful, but we still have
not put it all together.  
  
And tonight I see that kind of coming together. I think the situation with Mr.
Cofer, the excitement of the Big East Tournament, knowing you have to perform
or you're going home, is kind of creating the atmosphere that our guys are
really locked in now.  
  
Q. One quick thing on Ja. I think he had four assists. I think he had
one in the second half. Was that something of the game plan, so to speak? I
know he had 5 threes, but did you want to sort of put it on the other guys to
make shots and sort of let him get his?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: The game plan was be solid on him and guard him as best you
could. You saw we really locked him up in the first half that he had 18
points. We did a tremendous job. We held him down to 18 in the first half.
He's just a talented youngster. But after watching all of the films, we really
felt seriously that he has a good team. And we had to defend the other guys
with the same level of focus that we were giving to him. And I think that made
a difference in the game, the respect we had for the overall team and not
wanting them to get their numbers. Because to be honest with you, I'm still
not sure that we stopped Morant, and I'm not sure anybody can.  
  
Q. You talked about the 45 bench points. Can you talk to how balanced
your team is?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, that's who we are. You know, we've had nine or ten
different guys lead us in scoring. Some people find that challenging and maybe
a little unorthodox, but that's the way we have to play with the talent that
we have in order for us to be successful and our guys have bought into that.
We have a tremendous unselfish culture. Tonight Mfiondu came to me at least
three times begging me not to put him back in the game because he wanted
Christ Koumadje to gain confidence moving forward. Matter of fact, before I
even asked him, he came up and said Coach, please don't put me back in the
game. Let Christ play so he can gain confidence and move forward.  
  
Last year when Mfiondu was playing well, I think we were playing in the Elite
Eight, I tried to put Phil back in the game because Mfiondu was a freshman and
he said Coach, he's playing well. Just let him stay in the game.  
  
But we created that culture where the guys pull for each other. That's unusual
in today's time when everybody's trying to get numbers to impress people. But
we've created that type of culture on our team, and I think that's one reason
why you see the guys playing together. They really feel that they're 18
strong, and that's the motivating factor, I think, behind the focus that we
have displayed especially tonight.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Jay, Matt Painter has talked about how getting old and staying old
has been a big part of their success. I am curious how that's playing into
what you've been able to do at Villanova.  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely important to us, and it's something we're really trying
to work on with our recruiting and our roster structuring. And we got caught
this year. We expected to have Donte DiVincenzo and Omari Spellman back. But
for all good reasons, it worked out great for them. So we're willing to take
that hit. And it probably will affect us more even next year than it will this
year because we won't have any seniors next year. Thank God for Phil Booth and
Eric Paschall. They've had a lot of responsibility, and the old guys still
carry this team.  
  
Q. Matt Painter lost four seniors last year, probably one of his top
classes. What can you say about the job he's done this year to get his team
here?  
JAY WRIGHT: I just saw him in the hallway. That's exactly what I said to him.
I said I'm so happy for you to have a season like this and impressed. It's
amazing, it really is. Because like we just talked about, I know in their
program, they rely on guys that understand their system and that have played
in their system and are proud of being a part of something bigger than
themselves. That's what makes them good. And then you lose four of them. It
takes time to build that again.  
  
And I think not just what they've been able to do this year, but the way
they've been able to improve throughout the entire season. To win the Big Ten
-- they were 16-4, I believe, right? In the Big Ten? That's impressive any
time, any year, but after losing four guys, that's amazing.  
  
Q. Are you excited that it's a single session tomorrow so there will
actually be people in the building when you tip off?  
JAY WRIGHT: I feel bad about saying that now. Everybody in the building's been
awesome. The building's been great. We have great locker rooms. Everyone
treats us great. Everything's set up. I just meant it was just shocking to the
players who have not been in an NCAA Tournament, when you tell them how
special it is. I know it was because of TV and the NCAA, but I didn't mean to
say anything bad about the people of the building. It's not their fault. The
building's been great. We've been treated extremely well. So I am happy to
have a crowd there.  
  
Q. Jay, just your thoughts on what Matt Painter's been able to build
over his 15 years at Purdue, the sustained round of success?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. You can look around college basketball. It's the hardest
thing to do. It's the hardest thing to do in anything is sustained excellence,
right? You can get hot for a while and then how do you handle success, right?
Or you can be down for a while and how do you handle failure?  
  
He's handled everything, and every year you just know that team is going to be
well-coached, disciplined. They're going to execute and they're going to
compete for championships every year. It's really impressive. And greatness is
sustained excellence, right? And that's what he's done.  
  
And I'm sure Coach Keady is really proud. I was watching film and just to see
him sitting in the stands at one of their games. I think that's a big part of
it. I think Matt respects Purdue's history, respects Coach Keady, and that's
what makes him so good. It's not about him, it's about the tradition of Purdue
basketball. To be as successful as he is and as good a coach as he and not
make it about him is probably what's unique about him and Purdue.  
  
Q. Jay, Carsen Edwards, a guy who has such an incredibly high volume of
takes and makes, the kind of guy that scares you a little bit because if he
goes off, it doesn't matter in some ways what else you're doing. I don't want
you to give me your game plan. I asked Booth for it. He wouldn't give it to
me.  
A guy that quick is it hard to deny. Is it then just switch and help and
make sure he doesn't have a lot room to maneuver. How do you look at him?  
  
JAY WRIGHT: But similar to those guys, Powell and Howard, where you're not
going to stop them. And part of the game is not getting frustrated. If he
comes down in transition and pulls up literally from 30 foot and makes a shot,
that can't break you mentally.  
  
And the thing about Purdue more than any team we've played is the other guys
are really good, too. Cline could put up the numbers that Edwards did if
Edwards wasn't on the team. Again I think that's what makes them a great team
that it doesn't bother any of them and it's obvious the way they play
together.  
  
Haarms, yeah they can go inside if Edwards -- if they just choose. Eifert
shoots the hell out of it, right? And then you look at Eastern, that kid can
do a lot. He can post up. He can drive the ball. He can score and guard
anybody. So we can't just try to hold Edwards. He could score 25 and maybe you
could win, because he's just so good. But what makes them so difficult is his
explosiveness and then the ability of the guys around him.  
  
Q. You mentioned sustaining excellence and obviously you've had player
turnover. You've also have an enormous amount of staff turnover because of the
all of the winning and guys going on to get jobs. How have you handled that? I
think you started a little feeder system in your program. I wonder if that's
intentional or happened organically?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know what, that is something we're really proud of this year.
Over last two years, we lost our top two assistants to head coaching
positions. Baker Dunleavy is here at Connecticut at Quinnipiac and Ashley
Howard at LaSalle.  
  
From our top assistants to our third assistant Mike Nardi to Dwayne Anderson,
everybody is in a new position for the first time. That was one of our
struggles about being young this year, too. And those guys have done an
incredible job and I'm really proud of them. And when you talk about the
feeder system, one of the things that we've learned over the years is all of
those guys on our staff have either been previously assistants on our staff or
have played for us.  
  
And it's harder to teach our culture than it is to teach the X's and O's of
what we do. So we want to keep guys that understand the culture when they come
in, so it's an easier adjustment to whatever we're doing X and O wise. That's
been part of our feeder system.  
  
Q. Jay, I don't know if you had a chance maybe to sneak a peek at Murray
State yesterday or if you've seen them in person in the past, but I just
wonder as a basketball guy, your take on Ja and what you like about him,
what's unique about him?  
JAY WRIGHT: I haven't seen a lot. But the thing that I have -- so take this
with a grain of salt. But I love when guys that are that talented, that could
play to get outrageous numbers in terms of scoring always makes the right play
and always plays to win. That's what is really impressive to me. Now, I
haven't seen a lot. But when you have that much talent, and you know you can
really get a shot off any time you want and you could score as much as you
want, but you still make the right pass and make the right play to your
teammates and you still defend and rebound, that's always hard to do, but in
today's players' mindset it's really rare. It's really impressive.  
  
Q. Jay, offensive rebounding last night was a bit of a problem and it
seems to have been --  
JAY WRIGHT: It was non-existent.  
  
Q. Non-existent, I'll use your word. But it's been hot and cold. What do
you guys have to reinforce especially tomorrow night because Purdue averages
over 12 offensive rebounds a game.  
JAY WRIGHT: There's two sides of that. Number one, is keeping them off the
glass. You know, even their guards offensively rebound really well, which is
rare. So that's what's interesting about the NCAA Tournament. When you go
against different styles and you really only have a day to prepare and that
team that you're preparing for has not just a different style, they're really
successful at it or they wouldn't be here. How we can quickly get our guards
to rebound against their guards is going to be important.  
  
And then for us to just do a better job of stealing an extra possession or
two. We got a couple at the end of the game that were -- last night, but we
only got a couple, but they were crucial. We watched film today and we've just
got to commit to it and maybe do a better job, but they're a great rebounding
team.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about Purdue's offense. What do they do
defensively that concerns you?  
JAY WRIGHT: Very disciplined in terms of using their size. They've got great
size, to keep you in front of them, but still remain close enough to contest
your threes. Some teams could back off and keep you in front of them, but they
can't guard the three. And then some teams can get up in you but you can go by
them. Again that's why Matt's a great coach, and they all do it. They just
give you just enough space that you can't go by them, but they can still get
up and contest you and they keep you in front of them.  
  
So offensive rebounding is difficult when you don't go by anybody, and they
always keep you between them and the basket, though a, great job of that.  
  
Q. Question related to Ja. The kid comes in, he's a little off the radar
and takes big steps each year. So many of the superstars, like a Zion, in the
one-and-done era, seem to be sort of ready-made superstars. Do we underrate
the development that happens in college basketball? In other words, like guys
can actually take some time to develop into stars?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. We do. And I get it. You know, I get that everybody likes to
see the phenom and the new guy that just came on the scene, and he's going be
a great NBA player. And it's a no-brainer, right? I get that. And you have to
celebrate that. It's pretty cool. I actually feel bad, I've never seen Zion in
person. I want to see it. It would be nice in a game, because that means we
advanced.  
  
But I think true college basketball fans really desire knowing more about the
guys that develop, you know. And I wish we would do more of that. And I wish
somehow we could figure out in college basketball -- -- I do not want to take
away anything from those guys that are the stars, because they make the game.
They make people come to the game and watch it on TV. But the true college
basketball fans, I wish there's a way in college basketball we could really
celebrate those guys.  
  
There's some awards, like the best senior in the country that stayed for four
years, but I don't feel it gets the publicity, you know, maybe of the one-and-
done guy that's a great player, too. And those guys are really valuable to our
game and those guys are valuable in the NBA, too. So it's something that, hey,
maybe we can all work on together.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Jermaine Samuels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37014)

### [Phil Booth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34930)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. You guys are going up against Matt Haarms who is 7'3 ". How often do
you guys play guys who are over 7 feet and what kind of mismatch does that
present for you guys?  
PHIL BOOTH: We play a lot of guys like that. I mean, last game we played
against Hunter from St. Mary's about 6'11". In the championship game, we
played against Seton Hall, Romaro Gill is about 7'2". We played a lot of guys
over 7 feet. Michigan has someone that's 7'1". So we still learning how to
deal with guys with that much height. Haarms bring a lot of skill to it as
well. He'll present some challenges.  
  
JERMAINE SAMUELS: Going off what Booth said, you now he's a really, really big
guy. We'll discuss as a team how to deal with that and execute on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. You had a lot of big buckets down the stretch yesterday. What do you
need to do to start off the game hot and continue that momentum tomorrow
night?  
JERMAINE SAMUELS: I would just say, just staying confident, staying ready. My
teammates and my coaches are always going find ways to put me in positions to
score and make plays. And as long as I look to score, be aggressive, the rest
should take care of itself.  
  
Q. Phil, what is it that you've seen from Purdue that would concern you
especially on the defensive end?  
PHIL BOOTH: They do a lot of great things offensively. So many shooters. Of
course, Edwards is averaging over 20 a game. He can really take over a game.
They have, between Cline and Eifert, great shooters, and inside they have
Haarms, and they have a guy like -- No. 20, I can't remember his name. Eastern
who can do it all. He handles the ball, finishes, does a lot of good things
for them, passes the ball very well, they have a lot of different guys can
beat you.  
  
Q. Phil, you mentioned Carson Edwards. He's such a high-volume shooter
and high-volume scorer, and you've seen a lot of those guys. And without
giving away your game plan, which I don't expect you guys to do, I mean, how
do you guys like to contend with a guy who has that possibility of going off
and changing the game all by himself?  
PHIL BOOTH: Those type of guys are very dangerous. Between Markus Howard this
season, Miles Powell and now Carsen Edwards, those guys can take over a game
and dominate, go for 30 or 40 if you let them get in a rhythm. Just trying to
make everything difficult on these shots. He's the type of guy that can get
going no matter what the defense is giving him.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. I'm just curious, any similarities you see between either the program
you have or the program you want to have and what you see in Villanova from a
culture standpoint?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, obviously, they've done a very good job of finding their
guys and developing those guys with, you know, the four guys that we faced a
couple years ago that are now in the NBA, and Paschall and Booth were in the
game that we played also. So you can see kind of the evolution of their
program from one year to the next, and then how it kind of continues. And
they've had some guys leave early, but they've also had older guys. They've
had a very good balance.  
  
That's what you have to be able do is have consistency in recruiting and not
have those empty classes, especially in their case where guys will leave after
they have developed in a short amount of time. That's so key. That's how you
keep winning. That's how you keep winning Big East Championships and National
Championships is by advancing. Not by having a couple of good guys, but by
having a handful of really good players that buy into a system.  
  
So their discipline and their toughness and obviously their decision-making
and their skill isn't just like a one-year deal or a one-player deal, it's a
vision. It's a group of guys buying into it and sticking together and playing
hard.  
  
Q. You guys got a lot of components to your team, but you've got such a
volume shooter and scorer in Carsen that I'm sure team do a lot of different
things to try to limit him.  
He can obviously get off and change a game for you all. What have teams
tried? And you look at the man-to-man switching defense, how do you expect
them to attack Carsen?  
  
MATT PAINTER: I think they're going to make it difficult. They always try to
take guys away whether they're switching ball screens or trapping ball screens
or switching other action away from the basketball. They're going to get you
out of rhythm. The one thing with Villanova, no matter who you have on your
team, they're still going to do the same things they do.  
  
They might change a little bit, but for the most part they're going to be very
physical. They're going to play very hard. They're going make you beat them in
a different way than you're used to. I think that's probably more important
for our team to understand is when they take something away, you know, you
can't stand. You have to keep moving. You have to go to that second, third
option, and you can't panic.  
  
I think once they get you kind of shooting into a crowd or shooting a little
further out than you're used to, they have you where they definitely want you.
You still have to be able to get the basketball in the paint. It's no
different than what they're trying to do on the offensive end. If you let
Villanova live in the paint, they're going to beat you. You have to do
something and you have to be steady enough on the defensive end to keep them
out of there.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on what Jay Wright has been able to achieve at
Villanova in his time there. Obviously he couldn't get over the hump for a
while, but two times in the last three years he got it done.  
MATT PAINTER: I think people that don't win the National Championship, I think
they do get over the hump. It is pretty difficult. You can't just call one
team a successful team and the rest of us are failures. I think there's a lot
of great coaches out there that don't make the NCAA Tournament some years.
It's very difficult. It's very competitive. It's a hard thing to do.  
  
He obviously did a great job at his previous stop and obviously earned the
right to get the opportunity at Villanova, and he's been here a long time.
That's a hard thing to do is stay some place for a long time. You have to have
consistency. You have to have discipline, and you have to continue to learn
from your own mistakes. Just from reading articles from him, five, six, seven
years ago, they might have got a more talented guy or higher-ranked guy, but
it wasn't a Villanova guy.  
  
Here they've done a much better job the past five, six years getting his type
of guy and the fitting into their culture and it led to a lot of wins and a
lot of championships.  
  
Q. Just to extend further on that, how hard is that to do in this sport
with a current culture to get four-year players like Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart,
those types of guys?  
MATT PAINTER: Not all of those guys were four-year players even though they
stayed three years. I think you put them in that mold. I think the hardest
thing to do for him is knowing when they're going to leave. If you have a one-
and-done guy who is the number one-ranked guy in the country, and everyone
knows he's going to leave, you prepare for that. And when it's obvious, the
people you're recruiting understand that and you don't have to argue that
fact.  
  
But when you have guys that wait in the balance and after their second year,
they might be an end of the first round or second round guy or middle to the
second round, they really don't know if they're going to go or not. With that
most people that you top 100 type players, you sign them in the fall before
you get to that point. That's a very tough balance to be able to do. You
always have to prepare that people are going leave. When they don't leave,
these freshman, they don't want to come in and sit. They want to come in and
they want to play right away and they want that opportunity.  
  
I think he has a great situation because now he's won at such a high level,
been very consistent. He can show the substance. He can show what coming and
maybe playing a role for a year and then developing into one of his stars in
year two and three has paid off for those guys that have been successful at
Villanova and also been successful professionally.  
  
Q. Matt, can you provide an injury update on Nojel and whether he's a
game-time decision and whether he's cleared?  
MATT PAINTER: I think he'll be all right. We're going to go and practice a
little bit here, not much. I think he'll be okay. I think it was good for him
to get into the second half and be able to play a couple minutes for us.
Everything looks like it's going to be a go.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you got any chance to see Murray State
yesterday or how much you might have seen of Ja Morant, and just as a
basketball guy what your take is on him?  
MATT PAINTER: I just watched him a little bit. I watched a little bit of the
game yesterday, obviously not live. But he plays in a league that I used to
coach in 20 years ago. So there's always been talented players in the Ohio
Valley Conference. We played Belmont this year and were fortunate to beat
them. They're a really good team, well coached. But the guy at Murray State,
Matt does a good job. It's hard sometimes when you get a guy of that
magnitude, but it's also kind of easy when they're passers. Ja Morant passes
the basketball. He keeps everybody happy, and when you have the guys that can
score 30 points in a game but also can get guys open shots, and they have a
couple guys that can make shots and they got a couple good interior guys, and
you have that balance at that level, that's pretty special. Because you have a
big point, but you have size and you have shooters and now that's what high
major teams look like. High major teams look like that kind of a balance
because you're able to get out and guess those guys.  
  
But I think Ja Morant is a pretty special player. When you can affect the game
in different ways -- it's hard to get into a tournament and really scheme for
those guys. You overdo some things, and those guys are making threes, they're
going to be a tough out.  
  
Q. Coach, how cool do you think this week has been for Aaron Wheeler
being a Connecticut kid and what are you expecting for him tomorrow?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, he did some good things for us yesterday. He got in foul
trouble. He had four fouls. I should have played him more our the last game of
the tournament. He did some good things for us. They had a good front line,
big front line in Minnesota, but he offset some things with his ability to
stretch the defense. That's what we really need from him. We need him to
stretch the defense and get out in transition and make some plays. Last night
he had a really good play in transition where he got fouled and scored the
basket. So we feel Aaron is going to be a really good player. Obviously last
year he redshirted. This year he played about 10 to 15 minutes a game and
keeps working hard on his progression where he will play more for us in the
future.  
  
Things work in various ways. To be able to be from Connecticut and then come
to a school in the state of Indiana and play in your first NCAA Tournament
back in your home state, that's pretty cool, a little surreal.  
  
Q. Matt, what do you think about the versatility of Eric Paschall for
Villanova?  
MATT PAINTER: He's a tough cover. I just got done watching him versus us three
years ago. He had like 14 points in 8 minutes. But we had a different group.
He played like the undersized five for them in that tape. And obviously we've
watched him a lot through clips and things this year. So not too many guys can
say they can play the two, three, four, and five and guard those positions.
He's one of the few guys. I think he's got a bright future just because of
those interchangeable pieces. He can shoot it. He can drive it. He's powerful.
He's explosive. I think he'll play in the NBA for a long time.  
  
But you have to be there with him and get him of rhythm and then you have to
be able keep him in front of you and I don't think there's a lot of people
that can do that. That's going to be a challenge for our team, just to try to
keep him out of rhythm, keep him away from the rim as much as possible. Just
not let him get going. When great players get go egg they're tough to stop.  
  
Q. When you're in the recruiting process and you were looking for a
guard and I know there's some local-ish guys who were you looking at Zavier
Simpson and the guy that went to Illinois whose name escapes me.  
Anyway, what made you say no we're going to go with this kid from Texas who
really likes to fire it up. We're going live and die with him. What about him
made you say let's give him this scholarship?  
  
MATT PAINTER: Actually the scenario was different. We had a guy commit to us
in the fall that decommitted to us in the spring. So then we had to start our
recruiting at that time. So trying to now get back involved with Zavier
Simpson, start recruiting the kid that went to Illinois, that has transferred
from Illinois since, and then pick up Carsen's recruitment along with about
four, five other guys, it's something I don't like to do.  
  
Everybody says these four or five guys that are left are good enough to play
in the Big Ten, but that doesn't mean they're the right fit for Purdue. I want
the guys that fit at Purdue and are productive. Now, if there's five, six guys
out there you can get involved with, how many of those guys fit your criteria
and how many of those guys can you get that do fit your criteria? That's a
sticky part of recruiting.  
  
When we jumped in with him, just his ability to make shots is what jumped out
to me. You know, I just think when you have somebody that can shoot that way
and put that kind of points on the board, you just got to be able to figure it
out. So we took him kind of as a point combo, but just a quality player, and
we're very fortunate. We're very fortunate to be able to get him especially
the circumstances I explained.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked Carsen and Ryan this question as well. Two different
questions. First one about the growth of your team from 6-5 to now 18-4 your
last 22. What has been your biggest areas of growth in your team in the great
22-game stretch you've played?  
MATT PAINTER: What did they say? Because they're the ones that play. They said
it was all coaching?  
  
THE MODERATOR: They said it was coaching.  
  
MATT PAINTER: They said it was coaching?  
  
Q. Yes.  
MATT PAINTER: No question. They are trying to get more minutes, and they play
34 minutes a game.  
  
I think it was our ability to defend and just ultimately play harder. You
know, the thing I talked about after the Notre Dame game was, we all try to
find our ways through our scoring. And one of the best things to be able to do
as you grow as a player is to get over yourself, and it's really hard to do.
As a coach, you got to get over yourself. Bill Walsh calls it the disease of
me. You win games and you think it's you, but in reality, it's just a small
part. If you win games at Purdue and you coach at Purdue, do you have a hand
in the success? Yes, you have a hand in the success, but a very, very small
part. It's still a player's game.  
  
But as a player, if you have that attitude this a team game and we're in it,
if you score 30 points and you understand a lot of people helped you score
those 30 points, it makes it work. If you score 30 points and you think you're
the one that did it all, it just doesn't work that way. But when you're trying
to find your way in a game and you play 6 to 10 minutes a game or 10 to 20
minutes a game and take your value from the three shots you get, then you're
missing the big picture. If you take three good shots and miss them, there's
nothing wrong with that. If you take three bad shots and go one for three,
there's something wrong with all three of those bad shots even though one went
in.  
  
You have to take your value, effort, attitude and ability to be productive.
Guarding your man, not turning the ball over, executing. Those are the things
that lead to winning. So I really just try to get each guy to understand that.
And also kind of like when you're losing close games -- we lost to Florida
State, Texas, Virginia Tech. They were all possession games. Two of them were
on the road, one was neutral. We're not that far away. Yet if everybody can be
just one possession better, we're going put ourselves in a lot better position
going forward.  
  
That's just kind of the message that I try to get across to each guy. And I
thought each guy in their own little ways sacrificed and did those things. I
thought the guys coming off our bench really helped. It really helped
understanding that their ten minutes was important. Instead of thinking I
played ten minutes and this stinks, I don't get to play more. If you play hard
and you're a freshman your time is going to come.  
  
Q. St. Mary's deployed two big men occasionally last night against
Villanova. Is that something you saw that you think you can work with Haarms
and Williams. You used it a few times this year.  
MATT PAINTER: I think we could possibly do that. But whoever is playing well,
whoever is defending and doing a good job, I think is who we'll stay with. I
think that's going be an important piece to this game. You know, what guys do
we have who start and what guys do we have coming off the bench that could
match up well with them, that they have some -- they're very versatile guys so
it's a tough match-up for us. If we can do that and still take care of the
basketball. I don't see why there's any problem of us playing two bigs but a
lot of times we just stick with our rotation with the guys that we have.

### [Ja Morant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36900)

### [Shaq Buchanan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36901)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. For both guys, what kind of challenges does it bring playing such a
big team? Obviously they start 7'4 ", 6'9", and their best player might be
6'10 off the bench. Have you seen teams that big and what kind of challenge is
that?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: It will be tough. We haven't matched up with the team with that
type of size all year. We've seen bigs though, playing athletic teams. So we
practice on things like that, but I don't think it will bother us. We're ready
for the challenge.  
  
JA MORANT: They are a very long and athletic team. Like he said, we haven't
seen a team like that before since Alabama. But we're just going to go into
the game the same way we've been going into every game. Just try to play our
game and just do what we do.  
  
Q. Obviously, Ja had a great game yesterday, but the team as a whole
played tremendous. I think you had 30 field goals and 23 assists. What do you
need to keep that up tomorrow night against Florida State?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: We have a solid team. We know Ja will get all of the attention.
Like it's amazing, but at the same time, we know how to handle that. And we
know everybody's going to be keyed in on him tomorrow, so we just going to
make plays for him like we did against Marquette.  
  
JA MORANT: I'll say we just have a very talented group. We have a lot of
people who can score the basketball, and we are very unselfish. Like you said,
we had 23 assists yesterday. It's just how we play the game, just try to
instead of taking a good shot, get a great shot. So really just try to go out
and make the best of every possession.  
  
Q. I guess I'm wondering what your offseason was like. You made such a
big jump this season from very good freshman to to All-American sophomore.
What were you working on? What was your process like this offseason to make
this big improvement?  
JA MORANT: I really just worked on the same things I've been working on most
of my life really, the fundamentals. I'd say I keyed in more on just shooting
more game shots this year, coming off ball screens and such, and feel like I
got way better at it.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the culture at Murray State that attracted
each of you to want to come play basketball and go to school at Murray
State.  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: We knew about the winning tradition, getting to the tournament,
producing pros, and then the fan base, the family atmosphere. That's what I
was looking for coming into -- my next school, me coming from JUCO, and Murray
State brought me in, and I saw all those things. That's why I chose Murray
State.  
  
JA MORANT: Murray State just has a great program. And really I'd say what
brought me in was the family thing. I'm a big family person, and since day
one, they made me family and they just made it their job just to get me to
come here and I felt like I made a great decision.  
  
Q. For both you guys, can you just talk about what the whole deal is
with the wrestling belts in the locker room?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: Our Coach Matt, he a huge wrestling fan. One of our managers
brought a wrestling best last year to the first OVC game. We just used it like
our trophy, our motivation. This year we added two more. It's just something
to look forward to. After a big win, we get to celebrate putting on our
wrestling belts.  
  
JA MORANT: Like you said, Coach Matt is a big wrestling fan and we just kept
it going since last year. And this year, obviously we won the regular season
championship, won the OVC championship, and now we're looking forward to
winning the National Championship and that's the three WWE belts.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about each of you, the process that is so important
to the Murray State basketball program and as Coach McMahon alludes to,
getting ready for the next big thing that's there. How do you apply that to
what you're doing now and preparing for Florida State?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: It fit in well with this tournament right now because we play
Thursday, more like we play Thursday/Saturday. We going through it the same as
we would if it was in the conference, play that Thursday, celebrate that
Thursday and move on after that, Friday, like today, and get prepared for
Saturday.  
  
JA MORANT: Like he said, it's something we're used to playing on
Thursday/Saturday. So we just take every game -- go into every game the same
way. We been doing this really most of this second half of the season, playing
Thursday, recovery Friday, focus on the team we got coming up Saturday, focus
on them before the game and go out and just fight, try to get a win.  
  
Q. Guys, against Florida State tomorrow, what do you feel like will be
the biggest challenge that you'll have to earmark going into the match-up?  
JA MORANT: I'd just say they're length. Like I said before, they are a very
long and athletic team, can get after the ball some. So really I think our
focus will just be taking care of the ball.  
  
On the defensive end, we try to play the same, just focus on trying to force
the team to take tough shots. Don't give them any easy looks. I think really
taking care of the ball is our main focus.  
  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: Like he was saying, taking care of the ball. Forcing them at
like a terrible shot, limiting them to one shot, making sure we rebound. We
know the taller and tougher they are, it's going to be a tough game. We know
we have to box out.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Matt McMahon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35054)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. The story about Ja's high school recruitment has an oft told. I want
to ask it slightly differently. Going from freshman to sophomore year, over
this last summer, did he take a leap or was it more he's just due to the
design of your team able to showcase it more. And if I did take a leap, when
did that happen and how?  
MATT McMAHON: Well, I think he did take a leap, but I think he did not receive
enough credit for the terrific freshman year that he did have. I think we
talked yesterday. His numbers of almost 13 points, 7 rebounds, 6 1/2 assists a
game have only been accomplished by eight other players in the last 25 years
of college basketball.  
  
So I thought there were plenty of signs for what was in store last year as a
freshman, but it's a great credit to him and the work he put in in the
offseason. You see the growth in his game. But what I'm really most proud of,
I think, he's really grown and developed as a leader and has done an
outstanding job of being a great voice and leader of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked your players, Ja obviously had a great performance
yesterday, but the team as a whole did as well: 23 assists on 30 field goals.
What do you need to do to keep that up against Florida State tomorrow night?  
MATT McMAHON: I think when you talk about Florida state, there's a lot of the
things that jump out. The first to me is they're one of the elite defensive
teams in all of college basketball. Tremendous physicality, great size at
every position. Make it very difficult on you to score around the basket. They
turn teams over. We will certainly have to execute extremely well to be able
to score against such a dominant defense.  
  
Q. You guys played Thursday/Saturday since January, and you talked a lot
about that rhythm this year, about the execution and the way that the week has
played out. Is that something that you feel like maybe is a boon for your team
going into Saturday knowing you have the Thursday/Saturday day bounceback?  
MATT McMAHON: I don't think so. We've been able to stay in this routine going
on 11 weeks now and kept things pretty similar. Last week we scrimmaged on
Saturday during the long layoff to try to keep our guys in the same routine.
But our guys know we have to turn the page now and start to turn focus in on
finding ways to beat Florida State tomorrow.  
  
Q. Matt, I'm wondering if you can just kind of reflect on your coaching
trajectory a little bit, and what it meant to get this opportunity at Murray
State, a place you knew the culture and the program and the basketball
excellence, and how you go about sustaining that.  
MATT McMAHON: I'm always forever grateful to Allen Ward, our former Director
of Athletics, and Dr. Davies, our former President who believed in me and gave
me the opportunity. And as we built the program, we had to basically start
over with our roster and the culture in the locker room. And it was not easy
and they were right there, extremely supportive and really helped me along the
way to get to this point.  
  
And then I think for us, what was really critical was this signing class, when
we were able to add Ja Morant Tevin Brown, Shaq Buchanan, and then that
spring, Anthony Smith. You're talking about four just relentless competitors,
very unselfish players who are all about winning. And I think their two-year
record really reflects that. 54-10 now; 42 of those wins by double figures.
They really made it a dominant two-year run for our program.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on -- you were in Ruston for like two weeks, then you
get the call. What that period of time was like?  
MATT McMAHON: Well, it was an interesting story. I'll try to go through as
quick as I can. My college coach, Buzz Peterson, was named the head coach at
the University of Tennessee. This was back 2001. I went with him to be a
graduate assistant. My roommate was Eric Konkol who is now the head coach of
Louisiana Tech, so we got to be very good friends over the years. He's a
rising star in the business. And we always talked about if one of us got an
opportunity to be a head coach, the other one joining as an assistant.  
  
So I got the opportunity to do that, went to Ruston. I was there two weeks and
luckily for me, my family, we never moved. We never packed up a single box. We
didn't buy a car. We didn't buy a house. And then out of of the blue, Coach
Prohm got the job at Iowa State, and I was fortunate to get the opportunity to
come back and interview for the job at Murray.  
  
Q. Some of the players were talking about how high energy you are and
how you're kind of bouncing off the walls even at 8:00 a.m. Are you a coffee
person? Is this like natural energy? Where does this come from?  
MATT McMAHON: No. There's a drink that we do enjoy. I mean, it's all legal.
But I'm not a coffee person. But, no, I love what I do. I mean, we're coaching
college basketball. We get to make an impact on young people's lives,
hopefully help them be in a position when they leave Murray State to have
great success, not only as basketball players, but as men, as fathers,
husbands. And those things very important to me, so I say it all of the time.
I wear shorts and T-shirts to work every day. I really have it made, so just
very passionate and fortunate to get to do what we do.  
  
Q. You go back in that locker room right now, everyone seems relaxed.
How do you have guys going from being loose and relaxed to knowing when it's
time to focus? And it seems like that's something these guys have been good at
all year.  
MATT McMAHON: I think it's really important and these guys have been able to
strike that balance. I think that's one of our biggest strengths is the
chemistry of our team. I think we have guys who get along really well. They
are all in, bought in to what we're trying to do. They love playing together.
They love winning together. And I talk to them about it all of the time. It
should be fun. I think sometimes that gets lost in the business side of
college athletics. I want them to have the absolute time of their lives
playing. They've put in the work. We give them basically Christmas Day off,
and they work the other 364 days out of the year. You only get so many game
days. They need to go out and enjoy it and just play and have the time of
their lives.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about it a few minutes ago, but how do you
beat Florida State and how do you guys execute your game plan tomorrow to
perhaps come away with a win?  
MATT McMAHON: Well, there's a long list of things that will have to get marked
off if we want to have an opportunity to win tomorrow. I touched on their
elite defense, so our ability to execute at the offensive end will be
critical. Obviously, you see they have great size at every position. They're
relentless to the offensive glass. Can we compete with them on the boards, I
think will be important. How we're able to guard them will be critical.  
  
I mean, this time of year, you're not going to play any bad teams, so we'll
have to play very, very well to have an opportunity to win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about Ja Morant being the latest of the
Murray State point guards to have success, but the string of guards that have
come through recently and why that culture has cultivated the players that
have found success after college.  
MATT McMAHON: I think during my eight years, we've been very fortunate to
recruit some great point guards. It starts there. And I really believe in our
player development program, helping guys get better on and off the court. But
it started for me, getting to be an assistant and Coach Isaiah Canaan, Cameron
Payne, two terrific players, both NBA draft picks, who have over a combined
ten years in the NBA of experience.  
  
And the Jonathan Stark who was such an elite player for us our two years is
having great success in the G-League as part of the Timberwolves organization.
I think it says a lot about him. He averaged 22 points and almost 6 assists a
game as a junior at the point guard position. And after Ja's first day on
campus, going into his senior year, he came in and said to Coach Nichols, Ja's
going to starting for us on day one. So we went to the two point guard attack
that year and it worked out really well for us with the championship and the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
And now Ja is the latest, and I think we have a couple more great ones on the
way. For me, when I talk to our coaching staff, it's about recruiting,
scouting, and then the player development program. How much time are you going
to invest in our players, in the gym, off the court, building those
relationships. I think those are what helped players build that trust and keep
getting better while they're at Murray State.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Ja and the rest of the team had a great trajectory
the last two, three years. But yourself as a head coach, you're starting to
have that trajectory as well. How do you keep yourself grounded in the moment
here in Hartford and perhaps keep it going as head coach in Murray State?  
MATT McMAHON: I don't worry about trajectories and all of that stuff. I'm just
trying to help build the Murray State program as strong as we can. Make sure
we're investing a lot of time and energy and care in our players, help them
get better. I always try to keep things in perspective. For me growing up, I
always wanted to play in the NCAA Tournament. It was always a dream of mine.
You know, skipped school as a kid so I could stay home and watch the
tournament all day, wanted to play in it one day, was fortunate to get that
opportunity.  
  
And then when you see what a great experience it was as a player, I want our
guys to get to experience those same things. That's what it's all about for me
is making sure our players have a great experience while they're at Murray
State. I think if we do things the way we want them done, the culture is built
the way we want it, the foundation is in place, the winning and all of that
will take care of itself.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Mfiondu Kabengele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35137)

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Talk about facing Ja Morant. Have you watched him at all? What kind
of challenges does that represent?  
TERANCE MANN: He's a good player, we're just going try to contain him as best
we can. He's a good passer also. He likes to find his teammates. So we just
try to get in the way of that, stick to our principles, and things should fall
in place.  
  
TRENT FORREST: Kind of what Terance said, just kind try to disrupt him as much
as you can. It's kind of hard to stop a player who likes to pass and get the
ball to his teammates because you never know what he's going to attack or
pass. Probably just disrupt his rhythm is the biggest thing for us.  
  
Q. You guys obviously have a big size advantage, but that's not
uncommon. You're larger than a lot of teams on the wings and especially in the
middle. How do you best take advantage of that? Obviously you'd love to
dominate the glass. They're small but not as small as some teams you played.  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: We recognize our size is going to be a advantage. It's
important to stay consistent through the first half. We know they going to
very energized. We have to keep chipping away and wear them down with our
length and our depth and continue to be aggressive on the glass, just wear
them down. With our guards being as disruptive as much as possible, getting on
transition. I feel like we'll chip away and be victorious.  
  
TRENT FORREST: Yeah. Just try our best to use that to our advantage as we did
that pretty much all season, just with smaller teams. Just like Fi said, just
chip away at it the whole game, stick our game plan. Make them see bodies,
make them go around our length and size. I feel like we just need to use that
to our advantage.  
  
TERANCE MANN: I agree. Just being consistent, I think, with our length and
athleticism throughout the whole game and especially sticking to our defensive
principles to try to disrupt them.  
  
Q. You guys obviously faced Zion this year, too, and that was a huge
challenge. What do you compare this challenge with Morant like to facing
him?  
TERANCE MANN: I would say they're both great players in what they do. Zion is
very athletic, Ja Morant is very athletic. We've been facing great players all
year especially throughout the ACC. Both guys are different, so our coaches
have a great came plan for us. Try and stay in front of them and contain them,
and I think we'll just do a good job of that.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I know your teammate had a tragic loss
yesterday. I'm wondering how he's doing and how you guys are helping Phil sort
of get through a tough time?  
TRENT FORREST: I mean, it's hard any time when you lose a parent. I mean, he's
been doing pretty good. I mean, we've all been there for him since it
happened, and we're just helping him get through it and giving him his space,
his time that he needs, and just be there for him when he needs it.  
  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: Sums it up.  
  
Q. Throw you one more at you on Ja Morant, because he's obviously been
such a big story. I'm sure you watched tape. Can you sort of appreciate his
game yesterday? I mean, in other words, do you sort of sit back and say, this
is kind of fun. Or is it too much, like man, we got to deal with this guy? Can
you sort of step back from a fan's point of view and appreciate his game for
the sort of spectacular plays that he makes?  
TERANCE MANN: I mean, yeah. He had a triple-double, and that doesn't happen
often in college basketball. So, I mean, you could appreciate the triple-
double that he had, but also facing him next also is in your head, trying to
figure out how you're going to cut that down and not let him have the type of
game that he had yesterday. But like I said, you know, we're just going to use
our athleticism, be lengthy, be smart on our defensive end and try to disrupt
it.  
  
TRENT FORREST: Yeah. I mean, what he's been doing as a season -- as a fan, I
mean, all you can do is respect it honestly. As Terance said, it doesn't
happen when you see triple-doubles in college. I mean, I feel from a fan's
perspective, you definitely have to respect what he did all season. Just going
into tomorrow, we just have to be locked in, and it's going to be tough
stopping him because he's such a good player.  
  
Q. I was just curious, obviously a lot of questions about Ja, but what
do you think you guys bring to table in a game like this knowing that the
Sweet 16 is right in front of you?  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: I think with our team, obviously our quality of our depth,
our length, but more especially our intelligence. I feel like we're one of the
smarter teams in this conference. I feel that goes underrated, and I feel like
our decision-making and our game plan preparation is very excellent. Our
coaching staff does a great job. Players do a great job of adjustment,
especially in the Vermont game. It was tied and you know, we were able to
regroup. And seeing where we could have made mistakes and what we could
improve on, and especially in the second half, I give credit to the our
mindset and our intelligence. I feel like with this team our overall mental
preparation, our game intelligence, and basketball IQ, it is something we will
bring to the table.  
  
TRENT FORREST: Definitely our athleticism, our length, our size, so I would
say that definitely. And another thing going along with the IQ is our
experience. I mean, I feel like from top to bottom, we have a lot of guys
that's been here. We understand what's at stake. We understand how to win
these tough games. I mean, yesterday it seemed like they had a pretty good
crowd. So just being able to manage their crowd, manage the emotions of the
game, just for the whole 40 minutes, that experience, I feel is going to be an
advantage for us as well.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Coach, in watching tape on Murray State and particularly on Ja, what
did you notice different -- have you had a chance to see any of them play last
year and did you notice big differences in the team and Ja?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: What I notice is he's one of the most exceptional players
that I've had a chance to watch play. He's kind of a throwback to guys who
have the ability to score points. But also has the passion and the excitement
about creating opportunities for his teammates, guys like a Nate Archibald who
can lead the NBA in scoring and lead in assists at the same time. A guy like
Magic Johnson, who got so much joy making the game easy for his teammates.
Even a player like Muggsy Bogues, who has an uncanny way of making things easy
for his opponents.  
  
My opinion is you have to be careful because he's not winning the games by
himself. He's surrounding himself with good players who feed off of who he is
and what he is about as a player. And I'm excited for him and for their team,
because I enjoy watching guys play with such an unselfish spirit, that they
actually get excited about it. You can just see the gleam and the joy in his
eye. It motivates him.  
  
Like some guys, they play harder and with more intensity when they make shots.
Whenever he completes a pass and makes an assist, you can just see him
glowing. That's an unusual player and you don't get a chance to play against
people like that. And I have tremendous amount of respect for him.  
  
Still at the end of the day, it's going to be Florida State against Murray
State. It's not going to be one particular player against -- a player who
probably is going to be very difficult to keep from doing what he does best
because he's such a highly skilled, physical-skilled and mentally and
emotionally savvy youngster. So we're pretty much going to be who we are. And
I think the team that's going to be successful is the team that comes as close
as they can to playing up to their potential. We have a defensive scheme and
an offensive schemes. They have offensive schemes; they have defensive
schemes.  
  
I'm sure they're trying to minimize ours and play to their strengths and we
plan to do the same thing. I think the team that's going to be successful is
the team that comes closest to being who they are to the best of their
abilities. I hope that answers your question.  
  
Q. Leonard, what was it like to find out about Phil's father, and then
how do you as his coach approach that and be with him and support him? I
imagine it was a very incredible difficult night.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Of course, it was. Mike Cofer, Phil's father, was one of the
most competitive human beings that has ever played in the NFL. Tremendous
amount of character, loved and respected by everyone. Not only the guys who
played with him, teammates, but anybody who's ever been around him after his
playing career was over. He is a guy who had to endure an unbelievably
challenging debilitating disease that mentally and emotionally was draining in
itself, but the physical toll it took on his body is beyond anything that you
possibly could explain. And he never complained. He always faced it every day
with the heart of a lion, with tremendous amount of courage, and he passed
that same mental and emotional aspect over to his son, Phil.  
  
He always challenged Phil, and he always encouraged him to play with the heart
of a lion, and without making any excuses for anything at all. And Phil's
attitude has been as good as anyone that I've ever coached in my whole
coaching career. He's always positive. He's always energetic. He's a fun guy
to be around, a great teammate. He's a guy that uplifted other guys on the
team when they were down. He's had to deal with a lot of injuries himself
during his coaching career.  
  
Yeah, it was very difficult for him and his teammates, and we spent a lot of
time last night dealing with it in our own way. Our heart goes out to the
Cofer family. They have been unbelievable Seminoles. We'll be there for Phil
in every way possible. We have a culture of our basketball team, I think,
that's healthy and we're going to do everything we can to minimize the effect.
But you don't ever really know how challenging going through that experience
would be on the individual.  
  
But because of our culture and the love that these guys have for each other,
they feel the same level of pain. But they also have the same love and
compassion and care for him that they are going to do everything he can. He's
going to know that his brothers are there with him. And prior to the news that
he got yesterday, we had already dedicated the season and our play to his
father. That meant a lot to Phil.  
  
So it's challenging. It's never easy, but we're prepared to, and I think we've
started doing everything we possibly could to let him know his basketball
family is with him. And we can't do anything than pray for his family that
they endure this tragedy as best they can.  
  
Q. Leonard, one quick follow-up. Phil's status, is he going to try to
play? Is he going to remain with the team? Do you know? Is that clarified at
this point?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: He's going to remain with the team. We've had several
conversations was his family. And they want him to remain with the team, and
he wants to remain with his team. And then we'll make whatever adjustments we
have to from there. But he'll be with us during the game tomorrow. And then
we'll make the decisions that are necessary as we move forward.  
  
Q. I know it's been a little while but your ties to UT-Martin and Austin
Peay as an assistant. Some people might not know Murray State, but you on the
other hand might have a little bit of experience. Does this bring up fond
memories from your yonder years?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: When I was a student at the University of Tennessee at
Martin, a couple of guys that played with me came from Paducah Junior College.
Rick Leeper, I think was one of the guys that is still a friend of mine, I
think we might have scrimmaged them. And whether you know it or not, Cal
Luther, I believe was a head coach at Tennessee-Martin.  
  
But to move on to Austin Peay, back in those days, we had some tremendous
battles. If you go back and read the newspapers, you can see that with the
team that Coach Luther had there and the team we had at Austin Peay, they were
always packed houses, and they were very, very exciting games. And if I
remember correctly, Murray State was probably the team to beat in the
conference until we got at Austin Peay. And we had some tremendous,
tremendous, exciting games against them in the two years, three years, I was
at Austin Peay.  
  
I got a lot of fond memories of the challenges and atmosphere that exist.
Hector Blondet and some of the guys that played at Murray State, I think we
had two, three guys from New York and we had a guy on our team from New York
named Fly Williams that averaged 27 points and 9 rebounds in a game as a
freshman. In a game we had to win to win the conference, I think he scored 36
points or something like that. It was an exciting era for me and it was a
great way for me to start my coaching career.  
  
Q. I guess without giving away any secrets, have you thought how your
guys are doing to defend Morant and who might guard him at all?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I addressed that earlier. Florida State's defensive system
will be playing against Murray State's offensive system. Now, you can spend
all your time trying to figure out how to stop somebody who might be
unstoppable, and you could end up not worrying about Murray State and give all
your attention to the one particular player. He's outstanding. He's hard to
watch unless you're coaching against him. We're not going to change very much
from who we are. We can't in one day turn around all of a sudden and invent a
whole new defensive system.  
  
We play against a lot of outstanding players and schemes in the ACC.
Hopefully, that has prepared us to play against another outstanding player.
He's definitely one of the best players in the country. We'll make necessary
adjustments out of who we are and the system we've used all along to be where
we are now. We know it's a tremendous challenge when you play against a very
special talent like him, but we can't lose sight of the fact that it's Florida
State against Murray State, not necessarily one or two guys against a great
player like Morant is.  
  
Q. Coach, this is related to Morant but not necessarily about him. Seems
nowadays with these one-and-dones, we sort of expect these guys to be stars
immediately. These great players like Zion come in and already think oh,
that's going to be a number one pick. Do we maybe underrate how much
development there is in college basketball and how much guys can improve, like
there's sort of room for guys who are ready-made stars and guys who can become
stars?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think what we've done in the sport of basketball, we
created an unrealistic mindset. In the NBA, you got 400-some players, 150 of
them come from probably Europe. Every year you only have maybe 20 college
basketball players matriculate into the NBA, maybe 20, maybe 25. But that's
all we talk about is one-and-dones. It's like they're everywhere. That doesn't
exist. There's a lot of development that's needed. I think we have an
opportunity for those elite players, maybe 20, maybe 25, that have an
opportunity to go to the next level.  
  
And you have about 7,000 kids playing basketball and all we talk about is one-
and-done and this cliche that we have created a mindset that's available for
any and everybody. I think it's good that this kid's been in school for a
couple years. He's had a chance to hone his skills and obviously he's prepared
but that that's not easy. You know, you talk about him, you talk about Zion,
and probably two, three other players on Duke's team that we had to play
against. I think having an opportunity for youngsters to be able to realize
their dream and move on. But I think the one-and-done phrase is overused
because there's just not that many. We act like they're growing on trees and
dropping off like apples. That's not the case.  
  
These guys are elite guys, and they come along few and far between, and then a
lot of them that are drafted in the first round, even though they are one-and-
dones, they are in the D-League by January. So, this is something I think you
guys need to be careful about. This is just not as easy. But he's one of those
special elite guys that it's obvious that he has that "it" factor that you
can't really put your finger on that makes him special. But I do think that
even as talented as he is, having the opportunity for a couple year of
development, I think when he moves to the next level, he's still going to have
a lot to learn, a lot to grow.  
  
Those guys that are able to move in and be major contributors as first-year
players are not as prominent as sometime we make it out to believe that this
is what's going on in the basketball world.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

### [Ryan Cline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36335)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. If you could just talk a little bit about this stretch of early on in
the year through 11 games, you were 6-5, and now I believe you won 18 of your
last 22. What's been the biggest difference from the first part of the season
until these last couple months from both your perspectives?  
RYAN CLINE: I feel like when we were 6-5, we had a couple games that were
really close. We couldn't quite close them out. But that 18 out of 22 stretch,
we just kind of figured it out.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I'd saying the same thing. Just kind of buying in to
what Coach Painter was telling us and just kind of, I'd like to say, focusing
in on the defensive end. I feel it's the small things and the details we
weren't really executing. We were able to put that together and able to string
along some other wins.  
  
Q. If you guys could talk a little bit about last night, sort of a
unique situation with Eastern and him, supposedly, I guess slipping in the
warm-up line and sort of how you guys got word of that. And then one of your
elite defenders is not playing the entire first half, just playing in the
second half. Just sort of talk about how as a group you guys handled that news
and how that played out if you can explain a little built about the dynamic of
that story.  
RYAN CLINE: Yeah. I think some of us saw it happen. He kind of slipped and
fell under the basket. I thought it was a wet spot, but he ended up hurting
his ankle it kind of stinks when one of your key players gets hurt. Those non-
contact injuries are also scary. He came in at halftime and was running and
doing some cutting drills. We're just happy to have him back Saturday.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Same thing. Just kind of seeing the incident happen, which I
was standing right there, just kind of helped him stand up. I thought he would
be okay. But when he went to the sideline, I realized it was a little more
serious. Then Eric Hunter stepped up and just kind of played on the fly, just
kind -- got to make changes and just kind of go with what you have.  
  
Q. Last night you guys took 30 of your 53 shots for three-pointers. Is
that something that is a little bit of a concern or is that where you guys
want to be in terms of the balance of threes and twos?  
RYAN CLINE: In a sense, you know, I thought most of those shots were pretty
good shots. Some of them did fall; some of them didn't. That's actually a
pretty good stat. I didn't know that. It's something that against Villanova,
we need to get the ball in the paint and then they're pretty good with not
allowing that. So when we get so those paint touches, good things happen. So
hopefully we can change that next game.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah. I mean, I didn't even know that, but I just guess it
goes with the flow of the game. You have guys around you that can shoot the
ball well, Sasha Ryan, Aaron can shoot it some. Even Matt hit a three. Just
being able to have guys around you that can shoot threes, it doesn't seem to
alarm me to shoot a high amount of threes. At the same time you want to have a
good balance, be able to get the ball in the paint, get the ball inside and
things like that.  
  
Q. They have three guys who are 6'9 " and obviously you guys have Haarms
and tall guys of your own. How do you guys take advantage of that miss-match
situation?  
RYAN CLINE: We kind of just got to play our game. I feel we've been moving the
ball pretty well, especially last game. They're pretty good at guarding their
first and second action. We got to make them guard the second, third, fourth
action to get what we want.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah. Just kind of agreeing on what he said. I mean, just kind
of, I guess, going with the mismatches, but then also they have strength of
areas. So, we just kind of -- we just got to be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Speaking of strengths, if each of you all can answer this question,
what do you think at this point in the season is probably the two or three
biggest strengths of your ball club overall?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I'm going to go first this time. The biggest strengths, I
don't know. I don't like to kind of just talk about what we -- I think our
strengths are as a team. I feel like we still have so much more to work on as
a team. We're continuing to improve even when it's late in the season like
this.  
  
But I mean, I can tell you what our main focuses are every game. I can tell
you that. And I think that's just honestly, just getting stops, regardless of
how we are in the offensive end, just being able to get stops and limit them
to the one chance to score the ball. Getting the rebound and not giving up
second-chance opportunities. And after that just executing on the offensive
end, whether that's a set or a play or even in transition getting the best
shot possible. Those are the three things we focus on, being patiently
aggressive.  
  
RYAN CLINE: I obviously agree with what he said. I think our strength varied.
Every game it kind of changes. We need to be a little bit more consistent,
especially against a good team like Villanova.  
  
Q. You guys are playing the defending champs tomorrow. Does that enter
into your mind at all when you're taking the court, or is it just we're trying
to get a win in the tournament?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I wouldn't say it doesn't enter my mind. I guess it enters my
mind just in the respect factor. You respect them as a team and you respect
the history they have, the players they have on the team that are really good
players. They play really well together and they're fundamentally sound,
things like that. But at the same time you have to go out and try to take it
as every game and just value every possession and just try to get a win.  
  
RYAN CLINE: I agree.

### [Eric Paschall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35201)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Villanova - 61, St. Mary's - 57  
  
JAY WRIGHT: First, we want to just congratulate St. Mary's on a great season
and great game. Man, are they good. It's so impressive to play against them.
How disciplined, how well coached, how they execute. Everything we try to do
defensively, they've got an answer for. They're really good. That team just
beat the number one team in the country pretty handily. It was no surprise it
was that difficult of a game. We give them a lot of credit.  
  
As far as our team we're growing, our young guys are growing, but we have two
seniors that do everything for us on and off the court. We're just so lucky to
have them.  
  
Q. Phil, I wanted to ask you about the Big East Tournament and how the
games that you won against Xavier and obviously Seton Hall, grinding out those
games can be a benefit in a game like tonight where you had to grind it out
again.  
PHIL BOOTH: That's a major benefit. This team, St. Mary's, is one of the best
in grinding out like that in close games. You saw what they did against
Gonzaga in their conference tournament. So the Big East really helped us for
that, learning how to grind out game. We had games like that where we lost
early in the season, so it was good for us to get that experience in the Big
East Tournament.  
  
Q. I happened to be walking back to the floor when you guys were doing
your huddle before the second half, hearing words like urgency. What do you
guys think was missing in that first half and kind of how frustrated were you
as veterans, like, come on we can play better than this.  
PHIL BOOTH: We weren't doing that bad actually. It was more they were playing
very well, and we were trying to match how they were bringing it. I think we
just had to take it to another level because they were playing at a high
level. I don't think we weren't doing that much wrong. It was more credit to
good St. Mary's was playing and we had to match that level.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I totally agree with Phil. I felt we had to bring it to another
level. They're very good, very disciplined. Very well coached. They know what
they're doing. Very veteran team. We just knew we had to bring it to another
level and play Villanova basketball.  
  
Q. What perspective are you giving the younger players, you know, with
all of the experience you've had going forward in the tournament obviously.
Like what's the perspective and advice you're giving them so they can be able
to be more focused and be in that championship mentality?  
PHIL BOOTH: Just trying to stay -- where are you? I can't see you. Okay. There
you go. Sorry in the back.  
  
Just trying to stay focused in the game. There's a lot of distractions that
come in the NCAA Tournament. So best thing you can do is focus on your
opponent, take care of your body, and focus in on what you have to do as a
team.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I'll definitely say just take it day by day. I mean, focus on
your next task. If it's practice, focus on that. Focus on hydrating the right
way. Take care of your body. Cold tubs, whatever way we can prepare ourselves
to keep getting better. Definitely nutrition as well. Just doing all of those
little things to stay prepared and not took too far ahead.  
  
Q. Phil, you didn't take a three-point shot at all in the first half,
but it seemed like you were looking for that shot. Did you see something that
would enable you to drive the ball repeatedly as you did?  
PHIL BOOTH: They did a good job defensively of closing out, not giving much
air space for a three-point shot. So just trying to be aggressive, get
downhill. Just read whatever the defense is giving me.  
  
Q. Eric, I'm curious, how would you evaluate the way you guys played
defense especially in the second half. It seemed like defensive intensity
picked up.  
ERIC PASCHALL: Definitely, I feel like we picked it up. I mean, we did a good
job just playing together, and knowing that we're on the other side, not in
front of our bench talking a lot more. I mean, we should have talked like that
in the first half. Also just communicating, playing team defense. I felt
that's what we really did and felt like we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. With the expectations coming into this tournament, given that this
team or this program is a former champion not too long ago, how did you guys
manage the expectations for your program coming into the tournament?  
PHIL BOOTH: This team is a totally different team, so those expectations don't
really land on this team at all. Many guys from the championship team aren't
on there now besides me and Eric. So we kind of don't talk about that or place
that upon them. We just try to focus on our next game and try to focus on who
we're playing against.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: Definitely. It's definitely a whole new team. Lost a lot of
guys, but I feel there's no expectations, just our expectations to try to play
Villanova basketball the best way we can by the end of the season.  
  
Q. Jay, could you talk about the tempo tonight, why was it so -- why
couldn't you like speed it up a little in the first half, and did you do a
better job of it in the second?  
JAY WRIGHT: The tempo was excruciating. It's much harder to speed up a game
than it is to slow down a game. And we just felt like they're such a good
passing team, they're so skilled that if we tried to speed it up, it was just
going to give them too many open shots. They're a great three-point shooting
team. We felt going in we were just going to have to grind with them, and we
weren't going to be able to change the tempo. We had to be disciplined enough
to grind. I wish it didn't have to be that way, but that's why they're so
good.  
  
Q. One of the great mysteries of this tournament seems always the first
game and how you're going to come out after a conference tournament and three
games, four games in a row. Is this kind of game good for you that you had to
grind it out you think? Does that set you up well for the rest of the way?  
JAY WRIGHT: It does. I would much rather a 20-point win. That would be nicer.
But, to your point, you're playing Madison Square Garden. It's sold out, crazy
energy when you walk out on the floor and you walk out here tonight, and
there's literally no one in the building. It's bizarre. It's really bizarre. I
thought both teams deserved a lot of credit for really focusing. That game was
intense and well-played from the start.  
  
You do worry about those things, you know? They're 18- and 20-year-old kids.
We have a lot of guys in the NCAA tournament for the first time thinking this
is the NCAA Tournament? There's no one in the stands. That's part of it,
that's what comes with it. I was really proud of our guys, and I give St.
Mary's a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Jay, this is the second time in three games you played against the
bigger team. They were able to throw to a couple 6'10 " at you at times. How
much of a concern is that for you going forward? You guys finished with like
five offensive rebounds.  
JAY WRIGHT: It is. We lost a big guy this year. Dylan Painter that
transferred, and we got two good ones coming in neck year but we've go to get
through it. I thought Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree gave us great minutes inside.
Even playing undersized, Jermaine did a good job on their bigs. It's a
concern, but we have to find a play to play through it. Sometimes blitz the
post sometimes, front the post. We have to figure it out each game.  
  
Q. First half you had zero offensive rebounds. You went to the line
three times all in the same play. I think the three-point shot that was
fouled. At halftime, are you saying to yourself, do we have to do more work
getting inside or we're not going to get inside, so we have to do better from
driving kick and getting court points what was on your mind?  
JAY WRIGHT: They are one of the best three-point defensive teams in the
country and I think they're 17th or something in defense. Somewhere either
defense or offense. One is 17, one is 55. But they have such great length at
the rim. We said we're not going to get to the rim. We have to go mid-range
and try to get threes. In transition, you saw Phil Booth a couple times went
all the way to the rim and got a shot blocked in transition. They just got
such great size, great length, and they play with there hands back. They are
well coached, very disciplines defensively.  
  
Q. Jermaine Samuels had a couple good buckets for you. How would you
rate his performance in the last couple minutes of the game?  
JAY WRIGHT: He was awesome. He gives us the ability to play with some size and
also handle the ball and make plays against their press. He had a great
finish. End of the shot clock, he made a play at the end of the drive, a great
left-handed drive. He's been playing great basketball for us. Through the Big
East Tournament, I would have to say he's our most improved player this
season. And he's having great impact. Lucky we have him.  
  
Q. Coach, not at all for the first time you had at least one freshman
playing very serious late minutes for you. You've done it before, but I'm
wondering is there any different thought process for you when do you that
given that, unlike some of your other guys, these guys were literally playing
high school basketball a year ago now it's the NCAA Tournament.  
JAY WRIGHT: We try not to do that. We try not to be in that position, but, if
you -- Saddiq Bay this year has played so much for us and was forced into that
action, that by this time of the year, he's pretty solid and pretty confident
out there. And we're confident in him. But you've got -- it's tough to put --
like we have a freshman Cole Swider I wanted to get in there. It's tough to
find positions in real close situations in real close games for a guy that
hasn't had a lot of minutes, that's a freshman for us.  
  
Q. Jay, you've alluded to coming out to an empty stadium and you've
alluded to having to play a different style, slower than you wanted to. How
does the experience that you do have carrying over from last year manifest
itself. One you have to adapt to whatever the tournament throws at you.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that teams that have NCAA Tournament experience and have
guys on their team, even if they don't play, they have an advantage. Just
because of things like that. There's so many unique aspects to the NCAA
Tournament. 95 percent of them are positive, but they're just different than
all of the other games you play. And to not be distracted by that is really
important. And then when you don't have guys that are experienced, I worry
about that. Phil and Eric help our guys. Our sophomores didn't play a lot but
they were there. I think it's been beneficial for them.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

### [Markus Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32862)

### [Sam Hauser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36904)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Murray State - 83, Marquette - 64  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: First off, my hat's off to Murray State. They're a great
team. They have an incredible player in Ja Morant, but they are far from a
one-man band. They are an outstanding team who played an outstanding game
today. And, you know, I'm disappointed for my team, especially the seniors,
but there's a lot of lessons that we can learn from this year. And some of
them -- most of them are really good. We have to build off those things and
the things we didn't like, we have to work to be better yet. I'm sure we'll do
those both.  
  
Q. Coach, someone said you've got an All-American shooting guard next to
you that had to play point this year. I know your point guard missed the whole
year, you got them coming in. Did this catch up with you a little today you
had an all American there but he had to play point all year.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Markus is a great guard, and he's had an incredible year
for us. You know, we win and lose together. When we win, it doesn't go at the
feet of one person's feet. When we lose, it doesn't go at one person's feet.
He had an incredible year. He's a great guard and wouldn't trade him.  
  
Q. Markus and Sam, if you can both answer this. Murray State said their
plan was to run you off the three-point line and make you guys play one-on-
one. Why do you think they were so successful in doing that?  
SAM HAUSER: They're very athletic, a very good defensive team. Pretty scrappy.
They did a great job of doing their game plan.  
  
MARKUS HOWARD: I would say the same.  
  
Q. Markus, you know, things kind of spiralled at the beginning of the
second half for you guys. What do you think went wrong in those opening
minutes?  
MARKUS HOWARD: I think they got a lot of momentum on offense. They had some
big plays that they made, and it kind of gave them some juice and stuff like
that. Once they get on runs like that, they're a hard team to stop. So, I just
think, yeah, they got on a little bit of a run and we weren't able to respond.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of adjustments were you trying to make against Ja
Morant? Were you starting out trying to pack the paint a little bit? What were
you trying to do to slow them down?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, they're a team, based on the numbers and our study,
they are terrific in transition and they score well over half their points in
the paint. And we were trying to take those things away. You know, Ja Morant
makes a lot of plans look bad. I mean, I've been in this for a while. He's as
good as any guard that I've coached against, or played against, and I've
coached against and played against some outstanding ones.  
  
You know, obviously we studied Murray State a lot once we found out we were
going to play them. I have not had a chance because we were into our own stuff
during the regular season and Big East Tournament, but the highlights you do
see of them showcases athleticism, and certainly that's showcase-worthy. The
best thing about that kid is his decision-making. I mean, you're talking about
an elite, elite decision-maker, who's got elite athleticism. And, you know,
when you're talking about a point guard, you should always start with
decision-making. And he made great, great decisions, and he makes everyone
around him better.  
  
And they're good. They'd be good without him, but with him, they're pretty
unique. I have a ton of respect for him. He's a big-time, big-time player. I
mean, the triple-doubles, 16 assists in an NCAA Tournament. It's crazy. You
can't speed him up. You can run two people at him, you can switch, try to get
the ball out of his hands. There's nothing that we found that could speed him
up or shake his decision-making.  
  
Q. They were 8 of 11 from three in the first half. A few of these don't
fall. Are you looking at a different game at halftime?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, yes, probably. You know, again, obviously, we have
respect for them as shooters, but that's not what they've hung their hat on.
They've hung their hat on transition and points in the paint. But those kids
stepped up and that's what you need to do in NCAA Tournament game. You have to
have guys step up.  
  
Q. If you look at the end of the season and you guys lose 6 of 7, what
do you point to what went wrong for you guys?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I don't know if we can point to any one thing, but
certainly we didn't play as well at the end of the season as we did for most
of it. We've got to really exam that and figure out why. And I don't think
when we figure out why, it's going to be one thing. I think it's going to be a
combination of things.  
  
As when you hit a tough patch, usually it's not one thing, it's a combination
of things. So, we'll have to study that and figure out what happened.

### [Matt McMahon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35054)

### [Ja Morant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36900)

_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Murray State - 83, Marquette - 64  
  
MATT McMAHON: Well, I'm really proud of our players. I thought they played
with great toughness. Really competed at the defensive end of the floor. Made
it difficult on Howard and Hauser. Defended the three-point arc and then
offensively, I thought our unselfishness and execution was terrific. These
three guys sitting up here with me were fantastic.  
  
Q. Ja, you had this dunk over Joey Hauser. Walk us through that and how
it was to rise above the rim that way.  
JA MORANT: I felt like the defender was playing up my line. I just made a back
door cut, and my teammate Darnell delivered the pass and I seen the opening
and I took it.  
  
Q. Ja, how much fun was that?  
JA MORANT: It was a lot of fun just being able to go out with this group of
guys, and get a win in the tournament, just feels good.  
  
Q. Ja, talk about there's a lot of publicity and hype based on you, but
talk about how your teammates help you elevate as a player and as a person,
your teammates like Tevin and Shaq.  
JA MORANT: The stat, 16 assists. Obviously, I can't get an assist without them
making the shots. I just feel like I have great players around me, and they
made me look better.  
  
Q. Coach and you guys can jump in as well. For a lot of the offense that
you guys created, defensively, Marquette was 4 for 23 to start the second
half? What did you do in the locker room and what was their adjustment to take
away their shot?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: We had to make Markus Howard's shots tougher. He hit some tough
ones in the first half. Run the rest of the guys off the three-point line and
make them finish inside the paint.  
  
TEVIN BROWN: Basically make all their shots tough and not give them any easy
wide-open looks. Once we did that we forced them to take tough shots.  
  
Q. With what you guys got from Marquette today, you guys played so well.
Did this come a little bit even easier than you thought? Did you have a moment
in the huddle in the second half when you were listening to Coach McMahon.
Like it was almost dream-like in how well Ja was playing. But how easy it
seemed to be coming for you guys?  
TEVIN BROWN: We didn't look at it as being easy. The way we scout, we try to
take teams out of what they want to do and when we do that, we seem to stop a
lot of teams.  
  
Q. Shaq, I don't know, maybe nine, ten minutes in the second half, you
look like you went down, kind of tweaked something. You got up, kind of
limping a little bit, but then just kind of worked it out. What happened? How
are you feeling? Do you think that would play any role on Saturday?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: I just stepped on a player's foot and kind of tweaked my ankle.
Nothing major, I'm ready to go Saturday.  
  
Q. Ja, when you were in high school, you questioned whether you were
good enough. When did you realize you were good enough?  
JA MORANT: I'd say once I became -- I can't say when I felt like it. I guess
when the recognition started to come in, I guess that's when I had a little
relief, like maybe I am. I just got a shot. Murray took a shot with me, and
I'm really thankful for that.  
  
Q. Ja, a lot of the country saw you play maybe for the first time today
on a national stage. The tournament's on national TV. Did that give you any
extra juice knowing that -- there's been a lot of hype around your name, but
today you got a chance to show what you can do to a lot of the country.  
JA MORANT: I really don't pay too much attention to the hype. I just try to go
out and play the same game every night. Just try to do whatever I can to help
my team come out with a win.  
  
Q. Obviously, Ja is known for his scoring. What impresses you the most
about how he gets you guys involved?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: He makes our job easier. Once their men take their eyes off us,
we just have to find the open spot. He see us and we make the defense pay.  
  
TEVIN BROWN: It's definitely his eyesight. Sometimes he surprises me when he
gets to the goal and gets everybody to jump and he still finds a way to get
the ball to us.  
  
Q. Ja, did you come into the game expecting to spread the ball around to
start the game or was that a response to how they were defending you, and were
you surprised how they continued to help onto you as the game went along and
you were giving up the ball a lot.  
JA MORANT: I was just reading the defense. Early on I seen that they was
trying to pack it in on my drive and whenever I have the ball. And I just that
just opened up opportunities for my teammates to be open. So I just attack and
just drive and kick or and have an easy dump now.  
  
Q. Coach, after the game when you ran over to the radio guys to do your
interview, I heard you say our one-man team did pretty well tonight. I know
that's been a theme. The defense seemed to be things that stepped up. I guess
what would you say to the country that gets to see that performance about how
well your one-man team played?  
MATT McMAHON: I thought we did what we've done all season long today. We came
out, played extremely hard at the defensive end of the floor. We defended the
three-point arc. We knew Howard and Hauser are terrific players. We wanted to
make them a one-on-one team. I think they had 6 assists, 12 turnovers. We were
23 assists to 12 turnovers. I thought our shot quality was very good
offensively. I was saying it all year, Ja deserves every bit of credit he gets
he and then some. But we have a very balanced team. Four guys in double
figures. Tevin and Shaq were terrific today. Darnell around the basket and
everyone who played contributed in different ways. It was a total team win for
us.  
  
Q. Talk about how this is big for the Ohio Valley Conference? Belmont
had a close game with Maryland. They did win the tournament game themselves,
and you guys were impressive against nationally ranked Marquette team. Tell me
how big this is for the OVC in this conference?  
MATT McMAHON: First and foremost, it's great for Murray State University and
our great community, and the great tradition we have in Murray, Kentucky
State. I've said it all year, the top four teams in the Ohio Valley
Conference. 99 wins, our 101st now with Belmont's win Tuesday. Us today, so
101 wins between the top tour in our league. It's been very competitive at the
top.  
  
I know there's great financial repercussions for the league. But the exposure
and I think both teams we were more than deserving of being a two bid lead.  
  
Q. Matt, everyone talks about Ja and the shooters on this team. But how
important is Darnell on the inside to making this engine go?  
MATT McMAHON: Well, it's critical for us because it opens up the floor when
you have an inside scoring presence like that. I'm sure you saw he warranted a
double-team when we got the ball to him in the post. I know he's disappointed
in his poor three-point shooting today. He's highly skilled when he catches
the ball. He saw three assists, only one turnover. I think it opens up the
floor for Tevin and Shaq and our guards to shoot it and then if frees up a lot
more space for Ja to create off the bounce.  
  
Q. This program has a history of great point guard play. When Ja
arrived, did you have to be convinced, did you know that it was going to be a
natural part of the maturation he would turn out to be what he is?  
MATT McMAHON: I knew the first day he came on campus. He's just got some
special intangibles to him in addition to the athleticism, the explosiveness,
and ridiculous court vision and feel for the game. He's got an unselfishness
and competitiveness about him that's been contagious within our program, in
our locker room. Same for Shaq Buchanan, and it's been the structure of the
culture, the foundation of the culture of our team, that unselfishness and
that relentless drive to compete out there on the court.  
  
Q. Does the way he's handled the attention and the way he's done so much
to keep other guys involved, has that made it easier for guys not to worry
about not to resent any of the added attention that he receives?  
MATT McMAHON: It's probably been number one top keys to our team this year. We
talk all the time, you got to have a good offensive system and you have to be
fundamentally sound at the defensive end of the floor. Most importantly, you
have to have great chemistry. Our guys love playing together. This they have
great buy-in. They're about the right things. I try to put myself in his shoes
at 19 years of age, could I have handled this the way he has, and there's just
no way. He's just so humble. He comes from an incredible family. He has a
great support system. And he hasn't changed one bit through all of the media
hype, all the NBA hype. He's just stayed focused getting better as a player. A
Murray State leader and helping this team be the best team it can be.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [David Nichols](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36834)

### [Mfiondu Kabengele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35137)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Florida State - 76, Vermont - 69  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: This game felt more like an ACC game than any game we've
played outside of our conference. Nip and tuck. Team that's very focused. I
thought they had a great team plan. They double- and triple-teamed our big
guys inside in the first half. They were extremely well prepared.  
  
I thought they were shooting the ball well from the perimeter, but I didn't
think they would make 16 threes. But that's why they call it March Madness.
People going to step up and do some things that are extra in order to win
games.  
  
I thought we did a much better job, I thought, defending the second half than
we did the first half. I thought we got the ball inside a little more and
attacked the basket and got the ball inside to Mfiondu and Christ a few times,
and we were able to survive and advance. I'm not taking anyway from them. I
thought Vermont was very well-prepared. I thought they did an excellent job of
being patient this first half.  
  
As aggressive as we were trying to be, they only turned the ball over two
times. Second half, I think they turned it over 13 or 14 times. We got more
deflections and more steals and got some extra possessions and we were able to
come away with a victory.  
  
I've got several guys -- I don't know what David Nichols, the extent of his
injury is. Phil Cofer is he's kind of day-to-day. He doesn't have anything
permanently that's keeping him from playing other than it was challenging for
him to go three straight nights in the ACC tournament. We felt that he had
swelling, but we had MRIs and CAT scans so we don't feel we have anything to
keep him from playing other than he needs some rest. Hopefully, we'll get
those kids back for the game on Saturday. Any questions?  
  
Q. Dave, when you were at Albany you had plenty of wars against those
same guys wearing the green. How personal is it and how nice does it feel for
you to beat them in the NCAA Tournament with FSU.  
DAVID NICHOLS: I mean, it's no secret. I played them seven times at Albany.
I'm very familiar with them, they're familiar with me. They definitely had the
upper hand in my last school, so it felt good to beat them with the help of
these guys around me. This is just all credit to my teammates and coaches
putting together a great game plan and going out and executing it.  
  
Q. Terance, you're back kind of in your home area here back in New
England. What was that like for you to play here? I'm sure you had some fans
here watching. Just how did your mentality change in the second half scoring
wise?  
TERANCE MANN: It's amazing playing back at home especially to be doing it my
senior year, my last year, kind of last run in front of everybody. So it was
an amazing feeling. My mentality just changed, I didn't want to lose and go
home, especially since it's my senior year. I just wanted to score the ball,
keep my team involved and try to win.  
  
Q. Terance, talk about how playing in the tournament before experienced,
being a senior as you mentioned, how that played into how you, you know,
changed your mentality towards the end of the game.  
TERANCE MANN: I don't know if it had anything to do with before playing
tournament games. I think that's just being older and a leader on my team, and
these guys trust me to be able to do things like that. So having them and
knowing they trust me, helped me do that.  
  
Q. This is for any of you gentlemen. Defensively in the second half,
like were you starting to press more, you know, full court and press more
using your length and athleticism? Talk about early in the game how come you
didn't do that earlier.  
DAVID NICHOLS: I think we did pressure the ball all 40 minutes. That's what we
do. They just did a great job of handling that pressure in the first half,
executing our stuff. Then we had two turnovers. We forced them into 14
turnovers in the second half. That's just because we just keep coming at guys
with our length and athleticism. We go deep into our bench and try to keep
guys fresh, so I think that wore down on them.  
  
Q. Were you guys surprised at all in their confidence and shot-making
ability especially in the first half?  
TERANCE MANN: Surprised, no. We knew they could shoot the ball and, you know,
they did a great job of it. And it's March, so, you know, anything's going in.
So they are a real good team and they can shoot the ball well. I don't think
we were surprised that much by it.  
  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: Similar to Terance, going into film session and scouting
them, we recognized they are a really talented team. Anytime you can win your
conference, you much have a lot of talent. So the see the way they shot today
to that degree, was somewhat surprising because I thought we played solid
defense. But it's March, so it's understandable.  
  
Q. Talk about what Terance was able to give you in the second half there
and what's it like to have a senior with that type of experience in crunch
time like that?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: When Terance was a freshman, I dubbed him a stat-stuffer,
because he affects all phases of the game. Offensively, he was getting tip-ins
and put-backs and kind of a dirty work guy as a freshman. He's worked on his
game. He has always had a high basketball IQ. Could defend, play multiple
positions. He's one of those guys that a great, great teammate. Guys listen to
him and they respect him, and he does what he's supposed to do on and off the
court.  
  
So to see him -- he kind of gives us whatever we need in certain games. And
the interesting thing about him, he's unselfish almost to the point that if
we're winning and we have a margin that we're working on, he very seldom
becomes that aggressive. But when we're behind, he takes it to another level,
and this is something we've seen him do consistently night in and night out
for us this year.  
  
Q. You now have 28 wins on the season, the most of any team in school
history. What does that mean to you and the team as a whole?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: It just means that we need to go back and start preparing
for the next game. That's what it means. This is part of the journey that
we're on. I've been very fortunate in my career to have been on a lot of good
teams. It means that we're making progress. I'm happy for our team and our
staff and our school that we are trying to find a way to carve our little
niche out in the hierarchy of college basketball.  
  
We're in a conference with the greatest assembly of basketball programs in the
history of college basketball. So for us to be able to continue to keep
advancing, we just kind of -- fitting in with the guys that we compete in
night in, night out in the ACC. I feel good about it. Hopefully we can
continue to keep moving forward and then we'll evaluate where we are at the
end of the season.  
  
Q. Leonard, despite giving up about five or six inches, in height at
almost every position, Vermont won the rebounding battle in the first half and
it wasn't until the last seven, eight minutes in the game that your team was
able to assert itself in that area. Why was Vermont so able to be so good on
the game today?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think they're a good basketball team with talent. They box
out real well, they are fundamentally sound. Sometimes in the game of
basketball, size doesn't have a whole lot to do with the outcome of the games.
Might help you if you're a Sumo wrestler, but in a basketball game, it's the
person that's able to block out and do all the fundamental things.  
  
If you look back in the history of the NCAA, there will be a lot of teams
winning games because they went out and did things correctly and put
themselves in the best position to win. I think that's what Vermont did
tonight. I think you have to give them credit. I thought they boxed out well.
I thought they were extremely physical. They were smart. They put themselves
in a position that the game could have gone either way.  
  
I thought we exercised physicality, the quality of our depth, our athleticism
and strenght in the second half. Getting the ball to Mfiondu, I thought he was
a little bigger, stronger, and taller. He made some plays. But we had the same
guys trying to get the ball inside in the second half as we did in the first
half. And they did a good job keeping us from getting to the spots on the
floor we wanted to. You got to give them credit. Sometimes it's not what about
what you don't do. You have to give the team the credit for doing things the
right way. My hat tips off to them.  
  
Q. I know as you just mentioned you're going to be focused only on just
trying to go out and get the next one. I'm wondering, you had so much success
in different places. What would it mean to you to get to the Final Four as a
head coach.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, in order to get to the Final Four, you got to win the
next game, and that's why I want to stay focused correctly. If I start looking
too far ahead, then I won't take advantage of what I can control. And that's
going back tonight and debrief from this game, try to analyze the strengths,
the things that we did well, correct some of the things we didn't do well. And
start preparing for -- whoever we play, it's going to be another game that if
we don't play well, you could go home. So I'm trying to keep everything in
proper perspective. But thank you anyway.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

### [Matt Haarms](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34638)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Purdue - 61, Old Dominion - 48  
  
MATT PAINTER: I thought our guys were ready to play tonight. More than
anything, I thought they were ready to defend. I thought our guys did an
excellent job in the first half. You knew sooner or later that Old Dominion
was going to get going and get on a run. Just so many offensive players. I
think our guys hung in there and got late plays in the game. It's difficult.
They never let us get in a rhythm even though we were up by 20 at one time. It
was hard getting in there and getting down the key stretch and making key
stops.  
  
Q. Carsen, maybe you can address this. The coach said you expect them to
make a run and they did. You got it in single digits, I guess. What did you
guys talk amongst yourselves about, how to kind of fend that off, once it did
happen?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: We just focus on getting stops. We just focus on getting stops
and kind of pull it back out.  
  
Q. Carsen, first of all, how does your back feel? And second, you were
in a bit of a shooting slump. How did it feel in the first half to see some of
those go in?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I'm just glad our team won. We don't talk about having a slump
or things like that. I'm just focused on helping my team win, if I'm able to
hit shots and help my team get a win. I'm focused on helping my team win.  
  
Q. I just got a quick question for you. This is a late tip. I don't know
how often in your coaching career you had a late tip on a Thursday or Friday.
What goes into the prep for you and how do you keep your guys loose? You're
waiting the whole day to start this tournament game.  
MATT PAINTER: It's difficult. I think it's different for each player. I don't
think as a whole -- there's a few guys, they're so antsy, you get them going.
You wake up and have breakfast at 8:30. We went and had a shoot-around at
11:00 to 12:30. We went and had lunch, and they take a four-hour nap and then
you have pregame. There's not a whole lot you can do. You just want them to
get off their feet.  
  
But I don't know why the first game can't start, you know, 45 minutes to an
hour before, and this is a 9:20 tip, you know, or a 9:10. I just don't
understand. Like maybe there's an explanation to that. But I am kind of
bewildered why they do that. It really, to me, doesn't make a whole lot of
sense when you're talking about student-athletes. You can still get the games
in, it's not impossible. You just got to start it a little bit earlier.  
  
Q. Matt, obviously a big blow losing Nojel for the first half. What are
your thoughts on his limited performance in the second half?  
MATT PAINTER: I think when you come out and have the starting five and started
them the whole season especially the guy that started the whole game. Now he
slips, and hurts himself, now he can't go. You can't make an adjustment at
that time. It's just the next man up. I thought Eric Hunter was great. Even
though he didn't score a lot of points, he didn't turn the ball over. He had
the best plus-minus on our team. He did a really good job for us. I think that
was huge. Some other guys got some extended minutes.  
  
Getting Nojel in there wasn't as much for this game as it was for the next
game. He said he could go, but he needed to get in there and play a little bit
and hopefully get a little bit of confidence and feel better and hopefully be
able to go, full go against Villanova.  
  
Q. Matt, there's been a lot of talk about Carsen being in a slump. Do
you think he's in a slump?  
MATT PAINTER: I think any time you've played a lot and you've been in a lot of
games, it's the other things you have to be able to do to help your team win.
I think you kind of touched on that. He hasn't shot a high percentage this
year. He hasn't shot -- his percentages haven't been as good as it was in the
past year. Yet we won the Big Ten and we got a 3-seed. Ultimately that's what
your goal is. I think he's done a better job on the defensive end.  
  
Each team is a little different in terms of how they throw people at them, how
they handle the ball screens how they handle him in general. I think he's done
a good job. It's hard when you're a perimeter guy and sometimes you get in
some of those results. He's one of those guys you feel he can get out of it.
For us, he's had struggles and we've still won. He obviously touched on that.
That's what the most important thing is, you know, he's still helping us win
games.  
  
Q. Matt, I just wondered what your procedures and processes are for
preparing for the second game on the weekend when you don't have four days to
put into it, and also your thoughts on it's a totally different team with
Villanova but playing the defending champs?  
MATT PAINTER: We were obviously in the same bracket as they were last year and
we played them last year. And I don't really look -- I haven't watched them
play besides just during the year randomly. I always just keep the focus on
the opponent in front of you, so now we'll go back and wake up early tomorrow
and start getting ready for them, but they're very efficient. You know, they
play very hard. They don't beat themselves.  
  
Obviously the success they've had speaks for itself. So I think more than
anything, your preparation in that second day is more about you. Don't turn
the basketball over, make it hard on your opponent. But that's easier said
than done as you start to advance and get to that second round and try to get
to the Sweet 16. It's pretty difficult, especially when you're competing
against the National Champs.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the exact injury for Nojel and do you expect him to
be 100 percent Saturday?  
MATT PAINTER: They said he sprained his ankle. I have no idea. You would have
to ask those guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Ahmad Caver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36923)

### [Jeff Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18303)

### [B.J. Stith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36922)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Purdue - 61, Old Dominion - 48  
  
JEFF JONES: It's been a good ride for us this year. Obviously, extremely
disappointing that, you know, the season has ended. But I couldn't be more
proud of these two guys and the rest of their teammates back in the locker
room. They've been terrific all year long. I really couldn't have asked for
any more. I think today's game, obviously we were beaten by a very good Purdue
team, but it seemed to be shaping up almost as a microcosm of our season. You
know, we got down, things didn't look good, and our guys kept hanging in
there, kept hanging around.  
  
The difference is, this time, we didn't have enough bullets in the gun. You
know, I would have liked to have seen how things would have transpired if
either one of those wide-open shots, three-pointers in the corner had gone
down. That would have made things really interesting, but that wasn't to be.  
  
Hat's off to Purdue, they're a terrific basketball team. I certainly wish them
the best going forward but I'm just really proud of these guys and their
teammates.  
  
Q. Ahmad, B.J., how did losing Xavier to early foul trouble affect you
offensively? Did it change anything you were trying to do?  
B.J. STITH: It was tough losing an experienced player, and X is like that.
He's been playing really well for us these past -- last week, two weeks. I
guess he got a little too excited, picked up a couple fouls. It hurt, but it's
part of the game. I felt we still fought as well as we could in the first
half. But that's just how the tips fell.  
  
AHMAD CAVER: It definitely was hard losing our basically third scorer. Offense
was stagnant after we run the offense and after the play, so we tried to go
one-on-one or something like that. But, I mean he's been playing well. He got
a bright future, and I wish him the best after this year.  
  
Q. If you would just kind of comment, what got you triggered when you
went on that run, and did you think you could sustain it a little longer than
you did and maybe get a little closer. Coach mentioned those two shots.  
B.J. STITH: I don't think anything really triggered us. I just felt that
collectively as a team we said that we didn't come this far just to lay down
in the NCAA Tournament, you know? We fought all year. We fought to get to this
point. We faced greater odds, but we weren't going to let Purdue -- we weren't
going to fall on this stage. So, I felt that we really started a fight, and we
really started to crawl our way back. But as Coach said, shot didn't fall in
the key moments in that stretch. It's unfortunate, but...  
  
AHMAD CAVER: Yeah, just like all year, we battled and tried to get back in the
game, majority of the year, majority of the game. We wasn't going to let them
celebrate in one of the biggest stages in college basketball. We were just
going to keep fighting, keep trying to play hard and still stay with our
principles and see where we could fall out. Like Coach said, we didn't have
enough bullets. We couldn't hit the shots that we needed to and they got away
with the lead.  
  
Q. I think Jeff said yesterday the key was to be able to run your
offense and hit shots. You didn't hit shots percentage wise. How did you feel
the way you ran your offense. Did you get the looks you wanted or was it a
struggle?  
B.J. STITH: We got the looks we wanted. We got great looks both in the first
half and the second half. They weren't just falling. But that had nothing to
do with our effort. We fought, it just -- the ball wasn't going in the hoop.
Like I said, it's tough. Hat's off to Purdue. They guarded our sets. They
scouted us really well. Even though we did execute pretty well, we just
couldn't hit shots.  
  
AHMAD CAVER: Yeah, we got a couple good shots in the first half and in the
second half. They just didn't fall, and it's kind of hard to get back in the
game with shots not falling especially the wide open ones or the ones that we
want. But we still competed on the defensive end. We still -- like I said, we
still competed. We still got on the boards. We still stuck together as a team,
and then we just couldn't get back in when our shots wasn't falling.  
  
Q. It's always tough to lose this game and have the season suddenly shut
down. I just wondered for all of the particular things that you went through
personally and also with the team this year, how are your emotions right now?
Are they different than other times when you've gone through this? And then do
you plan on like taking a bit of time off or just hitting the recruiting trail
right away or what's going through your mind right now?  
JEFF JONES: It's tough ending the season this way. This group has been
special, even before getting to this point. You know, maybe there might have
been a season in the past where -- you never like to lose that last game, but
maybe it was time. I would have enjoyed having the opportunity to be with
these guys for a little bit longer. I think it is different. One of the things
-- my message to them in the locker room after is that 25 years from now, when
they get together, they're not going to remember this loss. They're going to
remember the fact that we had this opportunity. They're going to remember the
exciting wins that we had in winning the Conference USA tournament. They're
going to remember the fact that we were Conference USA regular season
champions and had some really remarkable comeback wins. Those are going to be
the things they're going to remember from a basketball perspective.  
  
But even more than that, the relationships. This was a group that truly was a
team. You hear it a lot. People throw out the term "family." People throw out
the term "together." This group was together. They stuck together through
difficult times, when normal teams might not. So, I think I'm probably more --
as much as losing hurts, I'm more appreciative of what these guys have done
and how they've gone about it. I think that's probably the overriding thought
and emotion.  
  
Q. Jeff, would you this think, holding on to 61, Edwards got some timely
shots but didn't shoot a high percentage. Would that have been enough or just
came down to the offensive droughts you had?  
JEFF JONES: Our defense at the half-court was really good, and I just don't
say that because of these percentages. We did what we wanted to do when we
were able to force them into the half-court. When they got their separation,
it came in the open court. We didn't have a lot of turnovers, but in a game
like this, you know, it was enough. But they hit some threes in unsettled
situations. They got some buckets. There was a stretch there -- you know, we
were hanging in there in the first half, and I was contemplating putting
Xavier back in because we were struggling so much offensively, but we're only
five or six points down. And so I made that decision to keep him on the bench,
and then in the last couple minutes -- and I don't know exactly what it was --
they stretched that thing out from being 5 or 6 to being the 13 margin, I
think.  
  
And those came on I think more because of bad offense, than it was bad
defense. If you're going to beat an opponent like Purdue in order to give
yourself a chance, you got to make shots when you get them. The question
earlier to Ahmad and B.J., I thought we got some really good looks in both
halves, but we had to work really hard to get them. And I think you've got to
credit Purdue for that, their game plan.  
  
Again, I don't know what they were trying to do but I looked out there. I
thought Haarms was phenomenal defensively. What he was doing with the ball
screen situations, still getting back and protecting the rim, I thought he was
the real key to their defense tonight. Bottom line, getting to your question,
you got to make shots. You got to make 60 percent. But you can't beat a team
like Purdue hitting 26 percent. That's just not going to happen.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Randy Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18282)

### [Jordan Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36919)

### [Jordan Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36918)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Villanova - 61, St. Mary's - 57  
  
RANDY BENNETT: Yeah, it was fun to be part of the tournament, fun to be part
of a good basketball game. Villanova is obviously a good team, and yeah, we
need -- I wish we would have played a little better second half, but proud of
our guys, proud of what they've done this year. Proud of them tonight. They
kept fighting and competing, so, I was -- yeah, you always want the other
outcome when you get the loss, but a lot to be proud of in this group, and
their leadership and their just stick-with-it-ness, staying together, high
character. Proud of them.  
  
Q. In the first half, they came out and hit a couple threes early on.
You guys were able to bounce back from that. What was a little different in
the second half when they made their run early on?  
JORDAN HUNTER: We just weren't hot enough. A lot of that's on me. They're
good. They'll pull it from wherever. We just got to put more pressure on them
and we didn't do it.  
  
JORDAN FORD: Yeah, we did a bad job of taking them off the line. That's a
total team cover. And on the other end, we just didn't do a good job of
responding with made shots. And most of that is on me. I didn't shoot well
from the field and I expect better, so --  
  
Q. 13 points on 17 shots, 1 for 7 from three-point. What was it about
Villanova's defense? Was it their length? What was it that kept you bottled up
a little bit?  
JORDAN FORD: I had a few good looks that I know I can make. They are a really
long team that could have affected me a little bit. A lot of those shots are
shots I know I can make. I have to going forward keep getting in the gym and
get better.  
  
Q. Jordan, they led for I think 33 minutes in the game but never by more
than eight points. When you cut it to four down at the end, did you think you
had a shot there and then can you describe what happened down the stretch?  
JORDAN FORD: I definitely think we had a shot. We cut it to four with 30
seconds left. We had a few game this year where we put the press on and were
able to get back in the game. And if we get a few of those loose balls, I
think it's -- or maybe make a three. We were down four, I think it's a
different game, so...  
  
Q. Coach, how big of a factor do you think it was Villanova's experience
down the stretch. Obviously Booth and Paschall played in these games and not a
lot of your guys have been in the tournament before.  
RANDY BENNETT: Yeah. They've been in a lot of tight games all year. We watched
the last six, seven games. Seems like every one of them but one was down the
wire. So they're used to playing that, and what you mentioned is definitely an
advantage. They played six games in the NCAA Tournament. I think both of those
guys played two National Championship teams and Gillespie was there last year.
Just knowing what the tournament's like, knowing what it feels like to play
under one-and-done pressure situation. Our guys moving forward will have that.
We didn't play in six games in the tournament, but we played in one. We have
everybody back but one guy. So, I just know the teams that we've had, they are
like that, when we had Dellavedova and those guys, it felt like a huge
advantage when it came tournament time that they knew what was coming. I
thought our guys did a good job playing in it. We didn't play tight. We didn't
play great. I thought we played pretty right.  
  
Yeah, I answered the question, and went on. Yeah, it's an advantage. They did
a good job and they're hard to beat in close games.  
  
Q. Coach Wright said that he kind of just hates playing against the
grind it out style that you guys have, one of the slowest paces in the
country. What sort of advantage do you think that gives you against the team
with the athleticism and length of Villanova?  
RANDY BENNETT: They're kind of grindy, too. That's how they play. If they get
up on you like six or eight, they're just going to use the clock and then go
to an on-ball at the end of the clock. I knew it was going to be that kind of
game, because they play that, and we'll play that. We play that defensively.
It's not easy for us to score. We battled that all year. When you play against
good teams like Villanova, and some teams in our league -- obviously Gonzaga.
San Francisco, San Diego, and those guys -- they're not going to give you easy
shots. You got to work for them. I think that's what happens. Unless you can
just outman people, just turn it in transition, go beat them on the boards
badly, you'll have to work to get good shots against Villanova. They're going
to switch everything, they're going to make it grindy. People keep asking
them, is that -- it's not really like their game plan. The game plan is to
score as soon as we can score. You got to take got shots to do it.  
  
We're a pretty young team, we don't have a ton of scorers yesterday. I think
we'll have those more next year, but we just had to compete, and compete for
every shot, and had to compete defensively to keep people from getting easy
shots. And I think that's how it gets at the end of the year. So I'm glad
we're hard for them to play against and hopefully be able to score it a little
easier next year. That's kind of how the game unfolded.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [John Becker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23477)

### [Stef Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36892)

### [Anthony Lamb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33082)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Florida State, 76 - Vermont, 69  
  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah, obviously very difficult when your season comes to an end,
so it's really hard for our guys. But I thought we played really, really hard
tonight and really, really battled a very good Florida State team. And they
need to get a lot of credit for how they played especially in the second half.
You know, probably wore us down a little bit with their size and athleticism,
and we had a little stretch there where we missed some free-throws and some
other stuff, to kind of keep us close.  
  
But, you know, we battled all night, even on the glass in the first half, and
I'm really proud of this team. It always hurts when seniors careers come to an
end, like Ernie Duncan and Sammy Dingba. So we're really sad for them. But I'm
really proud of my team, and I want to thank all of the Catamount fans that
came down from New England, from all over the country really. It meant a lot
to us to see all of the green and gold in the ground tonight. It was a special
experience for our team. Unfortunately, we weren't able to win the game, but
we'll take a lot of positives away from the experience.  
  
Q. Anthony, you guys are going back and forth with them first half,
early second half. What does that feel like compared to the last, say, ten
minutes when they sort of seized control and started to maybe keep you guys
maybe arm's length away?  
ANTHONY LAMB: I think we had a couple slip-ups with the team. Those will get
you if you give a few positions away. You're down by ten, then have to
scramble by the end of the game. In order to beat a really good team, you have
to play 40 minutes. I think there's a stretch where it just got out of hand
for us. So we just had to make up for that next time we play a team like this.  
  
Q. Stef, 16 made threes for you guys today. It was a pretty good day
shooting. What wasn't clicking so much from behind the arc that leaves the
team so confident from the get-go to shoot it?  
ANTHONY LAMB: There was a lot of new guys are on the stage and obviously might
be a little bit nervous. But shooting 50 percent from three at the end of the
day is really good and a positive takeaway from the game. At the end of the
day, we didn't get the win, so it doesn't really matter.  
  
Q. Steph, getting to this point, you guys played well. If I can ask you
to spin this forward, you competed with a really good team, how does that
impact your confidence and regrouping as you look toward next season?  
STEF SMITH: Definitely this adds a lot of fuel to the fire. I wish we could
have gotten this win in this tourney, but we have to move forward from this.
I'll remember this moment and try to get back here and rewrite the script.  
  
Q. Anthony, just how close did it feel when you're out there? When it
was close, what did that feel like?  
ANTHONY LAMB: It felt like any other game. There's different things you have
to deal with in playing really athletic, really tall team. It's just another
part of the game, I think. Whenever you're within two points, three points of
a team, you're always right there in the game, you're ready to go. But if you
let those plays get away, then it feels like you're losing ground. That's
where you got to try to stand up to them. Their athleticism got us a little
bit, but we'll find a way next year.  
  
Q. What has it been like playing alongside Ernie the last seven years,
and what did he bring to the program and how will the program be different
next year with him not wearing green?  
STEF SMITH: It's been amazing. Ernie's been like a big brother figure to me.
We play similar positions, so I try to learn from him as much as I can, and
he's been a great leader for our team as well as Anthony. So it's going to be
a big loss for sure. But, you know, this is also going to help us, you know,
try to avenge this loss and try to get it for him next year.  
  
ANTHONY LAMB: Yeah, Ernie Duncan is really the heart of Vermont. He's given
everything he's had to this program. He's bounced back. It's really important
that we try to give everything we can back to him. Even if we couldn't do it
now, try to continue to work and continue to develop and try to push Vermont
forward as a program. Just like Sammy and Ernie are great senior leaders that
have done everything they can to help. It's on us to continue to carry the
torch and do whatever we can to get it next time.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Vermont usually gets shipped a long ways
away. They were in Hartford, Connecticut this year. Talk about the venue and
how it felt, the crowd and how much lift it did give you.  
STEF SMITH: Yeah, it definitely was a big lift. The fan part was great ever
since I've been in Vermont. It's been amazing to see the fans come out and
support us. We just want to come back and give back to them.  
  
ANTHONY LAMB: This is a really cool place to play. I'm grateful for all of the
people that came out to support. And sorry we couldn't get it done, but I
appreciate everything you do for us year out throughout the whole year.  
  
Q. You talked about them wearing you down. When did you start to notice
that that was happening, and then, when you're in a situation like that, what
can you do to kind of counteract that?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah, I mean, you can just see they started to get to the glass
more. You know, I think, when the kid stepped through a triple team and dunked
it, it was kind of telling that we were wearing down. And as a coach, you got
to make that decision. You had a lot of guys that played long minutes, but had
played and were in the game. And then your bench, where guys are coming in
cold, late in the NCAA Tournament game against a really good ACC opponent,
you're trying to figure out what you can do there.  
  
We tried to do a little offense, defense to get more size in there defensively
to get rebounding with Sammy, and offensively, go a little bit smaller so we
could spread them out. We knew we had to make a lot of threes tonight. That's
the thing as a coach, trying to find that balance, what's the right thing to
do and also using time-outs. Time-outs were long tonight and there were plenty
of them.  
  
Just trying to motivate your guys and push your guys, trying to dig a little
bit deeper. Our guys played so hard, and they're not as naturally athletic or
gifted as your opponent, that can happen. That's why it's important that we
continue to develop depth, so that we can -- and they play a lot of guys on
top of it. So it's like a double whammy, and we got to develop depth and have
9, 10, 11 guys that can come in and all play in this game. And so that will be
something that we'll work on in recruiting and just developing.  
  
We're a young team. We have a lot of young guys. We'll continue to develop
them. Their bodies have to mature and everything. So, we're hopeful we'll be
able to do that this offseason.  
  
Q. John, what did you say to Ernie when you gave him the hug at the end
of the game? And then can you expound and say what he's meant to the program
especially being part of it for half a decade?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah. I just told him I loved him and just gave him a hug. And
he's meant a lot to this program. He's a big, big recruit for us when he came
out of high school. He's kind of the guy, the connecter, that enabled us to
recruit a lot of Midwestern kids. We have a lot of kids from Indiana and the
Midwest. And Ernie's reputation and relationships with other players out there
was the big reason we were able to get a lot of these guys that have helped
build this program and propel this program forward.  
  
And obviously battled a back injury as a freshman, and has had an incredible
career. When you sit back and look at the numbers, he's going to go down as
one of the greatest Catamounts to ever play. He's just the nicest kid.
Obviously we've seen some of the stuff recently that he's come forward with
and dealt with in the last couple years. He's an inspiration to a lot of kids
and a lot of people in general, and I give him a lot of credit for being that
courageous and honest as he is about things. And so he's going to be really,
really missed, really missed. And you don't replace guys like that. You just
hope to find new guys with similar type of character traits, and we have a
locker room full of guys that I think will step up and become leaders for his
team next year and beyond.  
  
Q. John, how close is that first half to the script you guys -- the way
you wanted it to go?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah. I thought the whole game, for the most part, we knew we're
going to need to make a lot of threes. We were 16 for 32. You can't do much
better than that. We knew we had to rebound the ball and we did that. Even if
you take the second half numbers, they out-rebounded us by six, which wasn't
bad. It's the free-throw line both ways that hurt us. We put them there too
much. We didn't convert on our opportunities well enough. Those are things
that's probably where the rub was.  
  
And so but we fought like hell. We had a chance right down to the end, and we
played a full 40 minutes. And that's the thing, Kansas, Louisville, similar
type things, we played well in all of these high major games. And like I've
said for the last couple years. We played these games. There's not gimmicks,
we're not expecting or needing a horrible game by our opponent, playing zone
and doing stuff we don't need to do. We played Vermont basketball. We tried to
go toe-to-toe with these teams, and right now they have a better athlete and
in some cases some better players, but my job is continue to close that gap
and see if we can, you know, take another step.  
  
Q. John, you had kind of a unique situation with three brothers on this
team. Can you just kind of, looking back now at the end of the year, kind of
recap what that experience was like for you as a coach.  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah. It was a really cool thing. And it wasn't a lot of work on
my end. Those kids are great kids and they kind of -- Ernie, they managed each
other very well and are very, very close and played a lot of basketball
together. So a couple of times I had to break up an argument and send them to
their room, so to speak, but for the most part, they were a joy to coach and
really easy. But it really hit me after we won the championship on Saturday.  
  
America East TV did an interview with them and you just saw the happiness and
the love they had for one another, and it hit me at that point like, wow, how
cool would this be to do this kind of thing with your brother. And I have two
brothers, and it would be -- so for them, I think the last week has just been
a dream, probably, for them, and I'm glad that we could help make that come
true.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Good afternoon, everybody. Great to be here in Harvard -- Hartford
-- Harvard. Yeah. Great Big East -- old Big East town, man. Brings me -- I was
shuddering walking into this building. We've had some battles in here. But
we're psyched about being here and know that we have a great challenge here
with St. Mary's. Just watching film, it's so eerily similar to the 2010 team
they had with Dellavedova and Sandman. They have great guards and forwards,
great bigs in Hunter, and the supporting cast on this team might be even
better. Really good team. Randy Bennett is an amazing coach. It's one of those
teams you like to -- I love to watch them play during the season because I
love their style. I love how disciplined, how intelligent, skilled they are.
And you love watching them until you have to play them, and then it's not so
fun watching the film. It's that kind of team, that kind of game. So, we're
ready. We're ready to go.  
  
Hoops is in the house, man. Let's get the NCAA Tournament started.  
  
Q. The one thing that they seem to do defensively, they take away
threes. They're only giving up five a game, 31 percent. What kind of
difficulty does that create for your kids?  
JAY WRIGHT: It's really amazing how they do it. I don't think anybody in the
country does it like them. They have the ability to keep you in front of them
-- keep enough space to keep you in front of them, take away threes, and they
protect the rim. It's really -- it's a great scheme. I don't think anybody
that we've seen does it like they do, and you know we like to shoot threes. So
it's going to be a really tough challenge for us because they don't do it like
anyone else does it. Most people get out on you, and they extend, they deny.
They use their length and they space you, and yet if you try to get to the
rim, they keep their bigs in front of the rim and they protect the rim.  
  
It's why they're one of the best defensive teams in the country. They get a
lot of credit for their offense, but defensively, they're really good.  
  
Q. Jay, how did you feel the young guys handled the pressure of the Big
East Tournament and how do you feel that's going to help them coming into a
week where a lot of them aren't used to the NCAA hoopla.  
JAY WRIGHT: I thought getting -- we count Joe Cremo as one of the young new
guys. And getting Joe Cremo, Cole Swider in those games, I thought Saddiq Bey
was really good. And Collin Gillespie and Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree and Jermaine,
they haven't been big players in those games. I thought as the tournament went
on we got better. I thought in the Seton Hall game, everybody looked really
comfortable.  
  
And I really think that environment, and that one-and-done feeling can help
them here in the NCAA Tournament. I do think all of this, you know, is
distracting for a player, in a good way. You know, they love it. The practice
you have in front of a crowd, that's the one piece you can't simulate in the
Big East Tournament. And so how they handle all that is going to be
interesting, but I definitely feel like the Big East Tournament helped us.  
  
Q. Your guys were talking about how this has been such a different kind
of year, and I know it started out with you kind of pulling your hair out a
little bit at the beginning of the season. But from an NCAA standpoint, you've
had all kinds of different experiences, in being the number 1 seed. Now,
you're a 6-seed, you're back to the smaller building. Last time you were on
the floor, 70,000 people and the confetti was coming down and you were holding
the trophy. Talk about how -- does this feel different this week?  
JAY WRIGHT: It does. It's different. We've been a 1 or 2-seed for a while.
You're in a different kind of hotel. We're a 6-seed. The hotel's nice, but it
just -- you know, you're -- it's just different, you know? And you could just
tell the way people talk about you. It's different. I don't think we'd be
honest if we didn't admit to that, you know?  
  
But it's not bad, you know? You could tell we always have a great send-off at
Villanova. There's kind of like different expectations, you know, but none of
that -- it's all there and we recognize it. But when we were a 1 or 2-seed and
we did have greater expectations, we tried not to let that affect us either.
So, we're not affected by maybe lesser expectations or lesser attention. We
really work on that. We really do.  
  
The real beauty of this tournament is the game you get to play. And that's
where you got to put your concentration. That's the real value. If you get
caught up in anything else, you miss the real joy in the game and being
prepared for the game. So, we definitely recognize it, but I think we're going
to take the same approach.  
  
Q. Did you rely on Phil and Eric a lot --  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah.  
  
Q. \-- to help the new guys get the feel for it?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely, definitely. We've relied on them all year for every
situation. I think the thing about the sophomores, although they didn't play a
lot, seeing all of this and going through all this, they've seen it. I think
that helps. But Phil and Eric, just when we leave the locker room here, I'll
say, make sure the guys are straight, they know what we're doing here. We rely
on them for everything.  
  
Q. Yesterday was kind of a dark day for Big 5 basketball. How did that
affect you? I'm sure that -- you get that news about Phil and, of course,
Dunph gets knocked out. What did that do to you yesterday?  
JAY WRIGHT: I was thinking about that last night. I was in my hotel room last
night watching Dunph's last game. They had a camera shot of him walking into
the locker room. I don't know if you saw that. It was emotional, and I was
doing a radio show -- I was actually doing Coach K.'s radio show, and I was on
hold. And the producer said Mike wants to know if it's okay if they ask you
about Phil. I said what? He said it just came across. They parted ways and I
got emotional. Philadelphia Big 5 basketball is a brotherhood. You know,
you're like brothers, you want to kill each other just like brothers do if
they're playing in the backyard. But you do everything together. We hang out
together at the Final Four, we hang out at the Jersey Shore, we do coaches
versus cancer. It's a sad day.  
  
The one thing in life that's a definite is change. It's going to happen to all
of us. It's just the day that it happens is really sad, a really sad day.  
  
Q. Is it a little odd that you're probably the Dean of Big 5
basketball?  
JAY WRIGHT: I didn't get that far with it yet. I still count on those guys.  
  
I think Phil, as long as I'm around, I'll be like the little brother. I think
Phil and Fran will always be the deans with me. I have a feeling whatever they
do next is still going to be big in Philadelphia. They're both institutions in
Philadelphia. I came up under them, learned a lot from them, and I'll be the
little brother to them.  
  
Q. You mentioned when you come up to the podium about the Big East. How
cool is it that you guys, Marquette, both Big East teams, Leonard Hamilton, a
coach with Big East experience are all here in a Big East building?  
JAY WRIGHT: It is very cool. I was walking -- the team went ahead of me. I
stopped to see somebody from UConn I didn't see in a while. I was walking
about myself, and I was thinking, man, there's been some battle in here, man.
Coach Calhoun and Kevin Ollie. I was really reminiscing, as I walked by, look
to the Westwood 1 studios, I see Donny Marshall siting there. Oh, my God,
another UConn guy.  
  
But I've been reunited with a lot of UConn people. Much like the Big 5, the
Big East is a brotherhood. And UConn was a huge part of it and still a huge
part of the history. When you come back here, that's what you think about, you
think about the Big East. Anybody that was ever a part of that as dominant as
they were under Coach Calhoun, that's what you think about, the Big East. I
know I do.  
  
I think anybody that had any connection with the Big East still thinks of
that. Like I said change is change, it's part of life and it's different now,
but you'll never take away what they meant to the Big East.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke earlier about being at this arena. And Geno Auriemma
spoke about what you think about the team. I know you had all of those battles
here.  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't really care about buildings except when you're on the
court, what it looks like on the court. I could tell you things about some of
the buildings we played in for National Championship games that there were
some things wrong. But when you went out on that court, it looked like heaven,
you know?  
  
And when this place is packed -- I haven't played in here as a neutral site,
but I've played in here with crazy Husky fans. It's not heaven, but it is an
awesome place to play basketball. This place rocks. And if I remember
correctly, I haven't been out there yet, but it's all one level, right?
There's no tiers and everybody is on top of you and it gets loud. It's pretty
cool place to play.  
  
Q. The locker room. Anything like that, could it use any upgrades in
your estimation?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, anything can use upgrades. We just built a new building and
we're fixing things up in the offseason. Yeah, everybody can use upgrades.  
  
Q. Jay, you've been down this road before. You sat on this stage before.
You dealt with us plenty of times, how much fun are weeks like this still for
you, even after having gone through this so much?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, it's still fun. It's still exciting. You know, just
walking up the steps here, realizing, you're on the podium again. You kind of
forget what it's like in the offseason and when you get here, it's a thrill.
You know you're a part of something that's a national treasure, this
tournament. The whole country's watching it.  
  
And we try to -- you know, every year when we do our Selection Sunday Show at
Villanova, we do a big crowd, and I say to them every year, don't ever take
this for granted. I know a lot of players and a lot of coaches, and I was one
of those guys. As a player, I never played in it. When we started our coaching
career, I never coached in it. First time I ever did, I assisted in Villanova
and it was a thrill. It's still the same thrill, it really is. There's nothing
like it in sports, the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Jay, what do you think about legalized sports gambling in the NCAA
Tournament?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know what, Hoops, I don't know yet. I don't know if I have an
opinion. I haven't thought this through enough. When you're responsible for
young 18- and 22-year-olds -- we watched a video, the NCAA has you watch a
video this morning. It's got organized crime members on there. It scares you a
little bit. The NCAA does a good job of the video. It's a little bit of a
scared-straight video.  
  
So, when you're responsible for young people, it concerns me. Because I'm
mostly concerned about them, right? And then there's so much more to it, like
how much more attention it brings to the tournament. There's probably a lot of
positives to it, you know. Maybe it cleans it up a little bit. I don't know.
So I haven't thought it through enough.  
  
But in the -- any type of gambling with college sports, when you're a coach,
you got to think about how it affects your players, so you're always
concerned.  
  
Q. You've now taken a team that won the Big East Tournament also to the
National Championship and the team that lost the Big East Tournament to the
National Championship, so, clearly there's no one way to do it. But I'm
wondering, reflecting on it, how the two experiences compare, if there's any
notable differences.  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good question. You know, each group's different. The
year, '16, I think -- '16 we lost to Seton Hall in the final, right? That loss
really helped us. I tell Kevin Willard all of the time. I said hey, I owe you.
The game plan they had really opened us up to what teams could do to us, and
then we prepared for that throughout the tournament and some teams did it, and
we were prepared.  
  
And then '18, we won it. It was an overtime game against Providence, which we
won the game, but Providence did some things to us, too. We definitely could
have lost that game. They hit some ridiculous shots. It wasn't great
execution. We were in trouble. Both of these times, we learned a lot from
those games. This past game, we weren't good enough to be -- we're surprised
every time we come out. We don't know what the hell's going to happen this
year. So it's totally different in that we're still learning about ourselves
every day in practice and trying to get better every day. We're really a work
in progress still this year.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: First and foremost. We're incredibly excited to be
a part of the NCAA Tournament, for all of our players and coaches. It's
something that, as a young person, you dream of being a part of, and so we're
certainly excited to be here. We know we have a huge challenge in Murray
State, having been able to watch them and study them since Selection Sunday.
Have a great deal of respect for their program, their players, their coaches.
They really do things the right way, and they're an outstanding team.  
  
Q. Studying Murray State, I'm sure you spent a lot of time on Ja Morant.
What do you think would be the one or two things you guys need to do?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously Ja is an incredible player and prospect.
I want to make clear this is not a one-man band. Murray State is not in this
position because it's a one-man show. Certainly, he's got special talent. He's
unbelievable in transition. I think they get the ball as a group, and he heads
it all down the floor as fast as any team we've played all year. They score
the ball early in the shot clock and often and he really keys that.  
  
And then you get in the half court, he's terrific off ball screens, so our
ball screen defense will be tested, not only with his ability to turn the
corner and score, but his ability to come off ball screens and set other
people up for really good shots.  
  
Outstanding team, certainly he's an incredible talent. It's going to be a huge
challenge for us.  
  
Q. I'm most curious about your reaction Sunday when you saw the match-up
and I'm sure as a coach, your thought goes to it's going to be a lot of
emphasis on that individual match-up between Markus and Ja. As a coach, does
that bother you to think about all of the focus being on them, you know, in
the media, or do you just roll with it?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: You know, we can't really control what the media's
focus is, and so we try not to worry too much about things that we can't
control. The things that we knew that we're in control of was our preparation
for an outstanding Murray State team, and, you know, I think a lot of people
won't want to make this a one-on-one duel. But, from our perspective, this is
Marquette versus Murray State.  
  
Q. I was wondering if, drawing on your experience both as a coach and
before that, there's this whole thing where, of course, you want to win every
game, especially you want to win your conference tournament. But a loss in a
conference tournament could be used towards like kind of waking your team up
and being like, you know, that's the last loss you guys can take before the
season's over. And I'm wondering how you've, you know, kind of lead your team
on that thinking over the past week.  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah, well, first of all, we never want to lose.
You know, so I'm not like a firm believer you have to lose to be motivated. I
don't think a loss should cause you to be more motivated. So we haven't really
talked a great deal about what happened in the Big East Tournament in
preparation for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
However, those experiences go into what our guys have now as we start this new
season. We have a lot of reference points, mostly from things that have done
really well, and then we have some reference points where things didn't turn
out the way we hoped. So we use all of those as we're at this point now.  
  
Q. I know it's a team assignment, but Sacar is probably going to be the
initial defender on Ja. What makes him a good player his feet, instincts?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Number one, he wants to. Sacar takes pride in
trying to be a stopper and trying to play outstanding defense, and he combines
that mindset with really good focus. Because, you know, in order to be a
really good defender, you have to have great focus and concentration
throughout possessions, especially when you're assigned to the other team's
best player, which he often is.  
  
So he's got the right mindset and want to. He's got great focus and he's a
really good athlete. He can get low in the stance, he can move his feet, and
the combination of those three things is the reason why he's, I think, one of
the better defenders.  
  
Q. Do you think playing against all of those, you know, those great
guards in the Big East, Myles Powell, Phil Booth, do you think that's prepared
Sacar for this match-up?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I certainly hope so. Obviously Ja is the guy that
people are saying is going to go in the top two or three in the NBA draft. But
Sacar on our team has had the challenge of playing other really good and great
college guards. So hopefully we can use that experience to our advantage.
Although Ja may be a little bit of a different type of guy.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you weren't coach of Marquette in the old Big East
days, but is it cool to you that you guys have Villanova, you guys, and not
Leonard Hamilton as Big East experience. Is it cool for your experience here
in the former Big East building?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah. It's cool. I haven't really thought about it
that way. Certainly I'm happy for all of the current Big East teams in the
NCAA Tournament who earned that honor. And know Coach Hamilton from not only
his days of being a Big East coach, but ACC, and have a lot of respect for him
and his program. A lot of focus has been on Marquette and Murray State, try to
stay in those two lanes.  
  
Q. Murray State's got a couple long-armed defensive guys, Shaq Buchanan.
Turnovers has been an issue for you guys off and on this year. What are you
telling your guys to prepare for that defensive attack?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: You know, I think we've seen -- and Murray State
can really pressure the ball, and as you mentioned, they have a lot of --
especially on the perimeter, very active defenders, and they can turn you
over. Buchanan's a heck of a defensive player. Ja Morant gets his hands on a
lot of balls. He gets a lot of deflections. Again, we have to be strong with
the ball. We have to keep it simple offensively and be as fundamentally sound
as we can possibly can be, because if you turn it over against them, you're
probably going to end up on "Sportscenter."  
  
Q. Woj, when you have an outstanding player like Markus, and they have
Ja, an All-American player who can dominate a game, is it a different coaching
challenge for you right from the beginning of the year to get your kids to
adjust to that, and then not sometimes not maybe be tempted to just kind of
stand around and watch and rely on them so much?  
COACH STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah.  
  
You know, I think the strength of our team this year has been our team and
certainly Markus has had an incredible year with incredibly high scoring
output. But it's a function of team play. And, you know, I think our guys are
wildly supportive of Markus, and Markus is supportive of the other guys, so,
you know, our offense runs best when we don't turn it over and we got to
really take care of the ball.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [B.J. Stith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36922)

### [Ahmad Caver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36923)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Can both of you just talk about the perspective this season has given
this team with what your coach has gone through, and how you guys have dealt
with that, and then how tough it is maybe to come to practice tired when your
coach is doing what he's doing every day?  
AHMAD CAVER: I think our season and the games we play all reflect off him.
There were plenty of times we were down and we could have gave up and gave in
as a team, but we kept fighting. And the same thing he's doing, he keeps
fighting and coming in with the same energy. I think his reflection of his
being strong and saying encouraging stuff, encouraged us to stay the same way.  
  
B.J. STITH: I think going off what Ahmad said, our season symbolizes what
Coach Jones and what we've been through this whole year. Coach Jones is not
the kind of guy that seeks sympathy. He shows the work every day. He's the
most hard working dude on the staff. He comes to work every day with the same
intensity, no matter what. He doesn't let us see him down in any way.  
  
So we fight every day and every game for him knowing that he sacrifices for us
so we sacrifice for him.  
  
Q. Guys, you've had a chance to look at Purdue a little bit on tape.
What can you say about them stylistically, personnel-wise, and do they
resemble anybody you guys have played this year or recent years?  
B.J. STITH: I guess Purdue is the stereotypical Big 10 team. Played extremely
physical. They are big across the front line. They play a lot of the same
sets. We've seen a lot of the same sets throughout year. Of course, they have
really good pieces and really good player in Carson Edwards. But nothing
flashy; they don't have anything, of course, that we haven't seen before. So
playing them will be a challenge, but I think we should be ready.  
  
AHMAD CAVER: Yeah. They have a balanced team even though Carson Edwards is the
one that's scoring the majority of points. But they have a lot of sets, and
off to the sets, they have a lot of counters to it. So we have to lock in and
never relax when we're on defense.  
  
So it's something that we've seen, but then again, they have a lot of hype as
well. So we've just got to battle.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up on my previous question. I mean, obviously an NCAA
Tournament game is huge for any basketball player. Do you guys have a
different perspective on it, though, than maybe other players with what Coach
is going through and everything else. Does it mean, not less to you guys, but
does it put it in perspective for you guys a little bit?  
AHMAD CAVER: We try to look at it just like a regular tournament game. We know
the significance of it. And us being seniors, we want to go out with a bang,
so we're going to go to it like any regular tournament game. We're going to
give it our all, especially for Coach, because I know he's going to give us
his all as he did all year. So we're just going to do what we do, and then see
where the cards may lie.  
  
B.J. STITH: Just like Ahmad said, we don't talk about it. We don't make it a
point of emphasis. We treat this game just like any other game or tournament
just like any other tournament. Coach Jones doesn't want all the focus to be
on him. He doesn't want us to approach it any differently because of him.  
  
Coach Jones actually shies away from that. He doesn't want any attention. So,
we just want to treat it -- of course, it's special because it's the
tournament, but we're going to treat it just like any other tournament.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Eric Paschall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35201)

### [Collin Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36757)

### [Phil Booth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34930)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. For Phil and Eric, how do you feel your young players handled the
pressure of the Big East Tournament and how do you think that will help them
coming into this week?  
PHIL BOOTH: I feel they've done a great job all season. They come in, made big
impacts all season. Especially in the Big East Tournament. They've won a lot
of games for us. Done a lot of great things. It's no surprise they played so
well.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I definitely feel like they did a great job. Especially with
three tough-it-out games, I mean, being all very close games, I feel like the
young guys are doing a great job and continuing to get better in practice,
just learning how to play Villanova basketball every second.  
  
Q. Phil, then Eric, what added responsibility and expectations did you
put on yourself as veterans who have been through this multiple times here for
Villanova up this season.  
PHIL BOOTH: I'm just trying to be a more vocal leader, make sure we're on the
same page of the team. Talking, communicating. With so many new guys, there's
a lot they need to learn, and teaching, making sure we're on the same page on
court. Make sure when we're out on the court the group of five is always on
the same page and locked in.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: Also leading by example; being a leader means a lot. I think me
and Phil have to do that every day. In practice, in games, any way we can even
off the court.  
  
Q. For Phil and Eric, getting back to the young guys, did you give them
any specific pieces of advice how to handle this next step into the NCAA
Tournament?  
PHIL BOOTH: Just try to tell them to try to stay focused, and stay locked in.
When we get to the NCAA Tournament, there's a lot of distraction going on, a
lot of things that can get in your head. If you focus on the opponent in front
of you, take it one game at a time and lock in on that, that's the best you
can really do.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I'd probably say the same thing, just one game at a time, don't
look too far ahead. But also just stay 94 by 50 feet. Just worry about what's
happening on the court and worry about your brothers and your coaches.  
  
Q. Phil and Eric, for both of you again, you've experienced just about
everything you can in the NCAA Tournament going to two Final Fours in
different settings and all that. Does this feel kind of weird for you to be
back to the starting point in Hartford, Connecticut as a 6-seed? I mean, last
time you were on an NCAA floor, you were hoisting the trophy, confetti is
coming down. There's 70,000 people in the building. Is this different for you
starting over again?  
PHIL BOOTH: Everything's different about this season. It's a totally different
team. So looking at last year, this team is totally different. So the journey
for this team has been different this whole year. Every place we've been top,
us being in Connecticut, whatever seed, it wouldn't matter. Because if we were
a four, two, or one, it still felt different because it's a completely
different team, a completely different approach we have.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I'll say the same thing. I mean, it's a completely different
team. We got a lot of young guys and it's their first time. Just going out
there and competing is what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Collin, going from a reserve player to a star and more major
contributor can be a huge jump for some players. How have you been able to
navigate that to become such an effective contributor here coming into the
tournament?  
COLLIN GILLESPIE: Just with the help of these guys. Last year, learned a lot
from these two guys and also the four guys that left, they taught me a lot,
how to handle starting and help these guys teach the younger guys, including
myself. Just learning every day, trying to get better every day, even in
practice, creating habits. So just trying to become the best team that we can
possibly be.  
  
Q. Hey, Collin, from last year's NCAA to this -- your experience in last
year's NCAAs, what will you take from that to help you this week deal with
just the pressure and the expectations and all?  
COLLIN GILLESPIE: I mean, there's a lot of distractions that comes with it, so
I think last year it really helped going as far as we did, getting a feel for
everything. And now just coming in this year, knowing what it's like, and just
taking it one game at a time like they said, focusing on our opponent and
worrying about them.  
  
Q. For all three of you, you guys have been down this road plenty of
times before, Phil and Eric, especially. What are some things you guys do
during this week, during the downtime to kind of refocus yourself, kind of
take your mind off things and just kind of recharge? What are some of the
things that you guys do in weeks like this.  
PHIL BOOTH: I mean, we're always watching film of the next game, the team
we're playing. I guess maybe take a nap, I don't know. That may be the only
thing I can think of. We've always focusing on the next team, watching film,
and trying to think of how we can better as a team and watch film from our
older games. It's kind of always focusing on the next opponent.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I feel it's the same thing we do throughout the year through
the first game to now. We just watch film, rest up, hydrate, and that's pretty
much our day every day.  
  
COLLIN GILLESPIE: Like those two said, they do a great job. Our coaching staff
does a great job making sure we're resting and we're hydrating. Whatever we
need, we're always making sure everything's available for us.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ERIC PASCHALL: Not allowed to do that on the road.  
  
COLLIN GILLESPIE: Not on the road.  
  
Q. For any of the three, St. Mary's has two very impressive players,
Hunter and Ford. Wondering what you saw from them on film and are you prepared
to deal with St. Mary's slower tempo?  
ERIC PASCHALL: Those two are very great. We watched film on them already. We
know they're very dynamic players and get their team going. And as far as
pace, we just go out there and play, just make the adjustments as we go. We
know -- but they can also push the ball, so, they're a very good team, very
well balanced and just going to be a battle.  
  
COLLIN GILLESPIE: Yeah. Those two are very great players. The rest of -- they
are a very balanced team overall. Whether it's inside the post or outside,
they do a great job. They're very well coached. So, we just have to do what we
do and do what we've been doing all year.  
  
Q. You guys were talking about how this is a different team, a different
year, and it just all kind of feels different from the first game. I think --
it seemed like Coach Wright kind of struggled with that a bit himself at the
beginning of the season. What did you notice, whoever wants to talk about
this, about the adjustments he had to make back to a younger team and then how
did the rest of the season kind of fall in place?  
ERIC PASCHALL: I feel like me and Phil actually had to kind of be assistant
coaches as well. I mean -- and Collin. We just all had to teach the younger
guys what it's all about because they never really been in this position or
played Villanova basketball. Because Villanova basketball is what we pride
ourselves on. I feel like me, Phil, and Collin are taking big steps and being
with the coaches and trying to teach them what to do when playing for
Villanova.  
  
Q. Did you sense that yourself, or did Jay have to come to you and say,
I need your help?  
ERIC PASCHALL: No, we sensed that ourself. It was kind of both of us. We
sensed it ourselves because we're the oldest. Collin got playing time this
year. Me and Phil have been here the longest. We had to take that role on
ourselves and embrace it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
MATT PAINTER: Like everybody else, we're obviously, you know, really excited
to play. I think it's different for each team, your experience, how you kind
of finish the season. For us, we were able to finish the season by winning our
league, but also getting knocked out in the first round of our tournament by
Minnesota in a close game. Anytime you lose a close game and no matter what
the circumstances are, you're really eager to get back on the court and play.
So I know our guys are really looking forward to play, but we know we have a
tough opponent in Old Dominion, that's well coached. Very talented guys, good
size, good skill. Very determined team. A team that's got in a lot of close
games and won a lot of close games. So we know we're going to have our hands
full, we're really looking forward to playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Matt, last year you make the Sweet 16. How is this year's team
different from last year's squad and how can it make a deeper run than last
year's team?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, last year's team, we started off conference play 12-0, but
we didn't win our league. This year we were probably picked six or seventh in
our league and ended up being a co-champ with Michigan State. After losing
four seniors and then being 6-5 this year at one point, our guys have really
improved. We've really gotten better, but we had to define some rules. Had a
lot guys coming off the bench last year that are now starting and doing great
things.  
  
We've been very consistent here the past couple months. But I definitely think
the experiences for our guys the last couple years going to back-to-back Sweet
16s, even though those did not play as big roles, outside of Carsen Edwards,
can help you. Any time you can get into a lot of tournament games, I think it
definitely helps you in the next tournament.  
  
Q. Matt, I know you kind of study on your own team but as a college
basketball team. Can you address what Jeff Jones is going through with the
cancer and the idea of doing that and getting a team to the NCAA Tournament.  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously when something like that happens, it puts everything
in perspective. It lets you know that basketball is really not that important.
But obviously, you're still doing your job. So when you're battling and you're
going through the daily regime that he has to go through to get healthy, the
team and everybody around your team is your support system and helps you.  
  
So, obviously, you see through the highlights what we were able to watch and
just the emotion of it. I'm happy for him and happy for those guys. So any
time you go through some adversity and then you're able to have some success,
you know, it makes it all worthwhile. For me, he recruited me many moons ago
when he was an assistant at Virginia, so, obviously, I watched him play when
he was at Virginia. And then to be able to get recruited by him, and -- but,
you know, at every stop he's been, Virginia, American, and Old Dominion, his
teams have been very, very successful. Obviously he's just a couple wins away
from .500, so you don't get to that point in your career without being a
successful coach. For him, I think it's kind of twofold. He's a great guy and
he's a great coach. I think his players would say the same thing.  
  
Q. When you were recruiting Aaron Wheeler, what differentiated him from
someone who could jump out of the gym, versus the Purdue guy that you
previously alluded to?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, the thing that jumped out, you know, for Aaron right away
was the skill level. I thought he could make threes. So that's something I
really tried to put an emphasis on for him. As then as you started to dig as a
person, we thought he really fit at Purdue. He was a good guy. He was a good
student. But we thought he could be a really good piece for us. His length,
his athleticism and then his skill level.  
  
And we knew from a physical standpoint it might take a little bit of time for
him. He's right there wedged in between a couple spots as a small forward in
kind of that face-up four. So, I think in time, as he keeps improving and he
gets more of an opportunity -- there's times that he doesn't get much of an
opportunity for us, and I stick with some older guys. But I think as his
career goes on and progress is -- you know, his improvement will definitely
jump up with more minutes and more opportunity, but he's been a really good
fit for us.  
  
Q. When you talked to the media on Sunday, you said you didn't know much
about Old Dominion. What have you learned since then? Particularly, what do
their big men bring to what they do?  
MATT PAINTER: I think they're a very tough, determined team. I think they're a
very good defensive team. Obviously Caver and Stith are good scorers. Caver is
a lead guard that can take you off the dribble, create his own shot. Stith can
drive down threes, knock down the ball, post the ball just a very -- player.
To go around with Green. Green really played well here. He only averages ten
points, but he has a game every four games where he stepped up and gives that
punch.  
  
But their size around the rim, whether it's Robinson, the guy that starts for
him -- really three centers are all guys that help them with their length and
their athleticism, their ability to block shots. I think that probably jumps
out more than anything. I think it's going to be important for us to keep them
off the glass, but I think that starts with containing the perimeter players
that I talked about. If those guys are beating you off the dribble and making
plays and getting to the rim, now you don't have great rebound balance.  
  
Now, those guys get dumpdowns, they get dunks, they get offensive rebounds,
and now Old Dominion is getting a bit of everything. When that happens to go
along with their great defense, that's how they beat teams. The thing that
really jumps out for me as a whole for Old Dominion is their ability to win
close games. A lot of times they split close games they seem to win one out of
three or three out of four when those games are close.  
  
Q. Matt, a few questions ago, a question about Aaron Wheeler, he came
out of Brewster Academy, the New England Prep League. What is it about that
league that is a cut above the most other high school leagues across the
country and why does it submit so many D-1 players?  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously, it continues to grow because kids want to be prepared
to play in college and they're looking for every advantage they can get, so
they can play immediately in college. Some people look at it as being able to
get through college quicker, you know? Some other people look at it as, hey, I
want to play immediately in college, so they want to put themselves in the
best situation.  
  
To be able to go to that league or play in that league at a school like a
Brewster definitely helps them. They get elite coaching, but it's also elite
competition. A lot of times in the summer -- you play elite competition in the
summer, but the preparation is not the same. Because not all AAU teams, you
are going to be able to put in time because the guys are scattered all over in
terms of practice.  
  
Here you're going year round. These guys are preparing, these guys are great
coaches, but the competition is at that level, too. Any time you have great
competition and great coaching, guys improve and help themselves.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at Old Dominion especially on defense seems like they
try to pack the line and force outside shots. Is that something you try to
tell your team not to settle for outside shots? That's the game plan there.  
MATT PAINTER: I try to get good rhythm shots more than anything. I think to
try to have like a general answer going against somebody that has had success
like them, each one of our guys is different. Obviously if you're talking to
Carsen Edwards, Ryan Cline, obviously those guys are going to be different
than maybe a couple other of our perimeter guys. Just trying to get things in
rhythm.  
  
More than anything, no matter who we play is trying to have a balance, just
not living and dying on your perimeter, shooting all of the time. You got to
be able to get the basketball to the rim in some capacity. Whether those are
drives or post-ups, offensive rebounds or getting into transition a little bit
more. I think it's important for us to be able to sprinkle our threes in
instead of dominating with our threes.  
  
Now, if the game kind of evolves and we're making a lot of shots, I think that
can change some things. But going into it with the mindset of doing a little
bit more than the other, but we really just try to let the game evolve. And if
that's happening, we try to be able to run some things to get the ball at the
rim more.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Ja Morant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36900)

### [Shaq Buchanan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36901)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. I was wondering, from both your perspectives, we know when they're on
defense, you're on offense. They're going to focusing a lot of attention on
Ja. What game plan are you expecting and how are you going to beat it?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: This year we saw a whole bunch of different defense for Ja. We
prepare for it. From film, they play solid man defense. I don't expect nothing
different. We been preparing for it the whole week.  
  
JA MORANT: Like Shaq said, all year, we've been seeing different types of
defensive schemes against me. And we watch film and they played a lot of man,
so that's what we prepare for. Also, just go through some of the other stuff,
like if they go zone, anything, so --  
  
Q. Shaq, I'm sure you guys are going to alternate defensive assignments
on Markus Howard, after studying him for a few days. What are you are you
going to try to key in on defensively?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: I know he's a very great player on offense, had different
moves. I did study a lot of film on that. I'm accepting the challenge to guard
Markus Howard.  
  
Q. Jumping off on guarding Markus Howard, I'm sure it will be multiple
assignments. How much do you think you'll get a chance at guarding Markus,
Ja?  
JA MORANT: Me and Shaq both have the assignment on Howard, and we have been
studying film on him. He's a great scorer, and we're both ready to take on the
challenge.  
  
Q. For both of guys, Ja and Shaq. Murray State has a long history of
success in the NCAA Tournament and in the OVC. How much does that motivate you
to put another banner up there in the rafters?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: It's been a goal of ours, we know the type of tradition Murray
holds, and know one of the reasons we came here is to leave our legacy and we
have a chance to do that with the team we have this year.  
  
ERNIE DUNCAN: Like you said, Murray has a great tradition, and this is our
goal since June, when we first stepped on campus with the team we have now. We
put a lot of time and hard work into this, and just hanging another banner
feels good.  
  
Q. Ja, I know you've got a huge cheering section and family that come to
every game. How many people are you expecting and what has that level of
support meant to you throughout the season?  
JA MORANT: As of right now, I have like 15 coming. I know most people don't
get the support from families. Sometimes their families can't make it in, and
just with me being nine hours from Murray State and probably further from
here, just to have my family come, it just feels good and I just appreciate
it.  
  
Q. Ja, your national profile has really risen here this year. I'm
curious kind of how you've tried to deal with that and just what you think
about all of the extra attention you're getting, the magazine articles, ESPN
and all that stuff, what's that been like?  
JA MORANT: It's something I'm not used to. I come from being under the radar.
My coaches, my teammates, really helped me with it. They haven't looked at me
any different since I guess my name started to get out there. And my parents,
I give most of the credit to them for keeping me level headed.  
  
Q. Ja, you started generating a lot of buzz at the Chris Paul camp in
the summer. What do you remember about that experience? I know Markus Howard
was there. Did you get to interact with him after that experience?  
JA MORANT: Markus actually was the first person I talked to. We had a meeting
that night when we got there. I sat at the table with him and had
conversations with him. The experience was great, just being there with Chris
Paul and other NBA players, just to learn some things from them. It was good.  
  
Q. Ja, just coming from -- lightly recruited as you were, to on this
stage now, what have you thought of the whole journey to get here and what
that's been like for you?  
JA MORANT: I say it's been rough. Like you said, coming from being overlooked
in high school, and not receiving that much attention, there was times I
questioned myself: Was I good enough? And now it's just my hard work is paying
off and it feels good.  
  
Q. Ja, I wanted to follow up on the Chris Paul camp question. What were
your impressions of Markus Howard at that time? I know he's been injured a
little bit lately; in February he got injured. What do you expect from him. So
two questions: What do you expect from him tomorrow and what were your
impressions of him at camp?  
JA MORANT: I expect a lot from Markus tomorrow. He had a couple 50-point
games. He's a great scorer, and we just going to go out there and try to play
our defense and contain him. I saw that at Chris Paul camp he was able to get
up and down a little bit and he score the ball very well.  
  
Q. Shaq, the OVC was so good this year. Belmont again with the win last
night. How much from the league helped you get ready tomorrow?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: I say, it probably was a tough league. Even though it was a
major, it was hard playing those teams twice a year and had to change offense
or your defense, you got to go do. Though, we did, it was tough but we grinded
it out.  
  
Q. Real quick, can you guys talk a little bit about just how the
experience from last year in San Diego against West Virginia has prepared you,
perhaps, for the match-up tomorrow against Marquette?  
SHAQ BUCHANAN: I would say last year, it was our first time, so guys are happy
to be there. But this year with me and Ja and Brion, we have the focus that we
can go far in this tournament. We have the team to do it, and I have all of
the confidence we have the team to do it. We'll see how we do Thursday.  
  
JA MORANT: Like he said, our first year coming here, we was a little excited.
I say probably a little bit nervous. This being our second year, we're a
little bit more comfortable and ready to lead this team to go deep in the
tournament.  
  
Q. I understand you're from the same hometown as Ray Allen. I read your
father was actually a high school teammate of his. I wonder if that's the
case, if you've gotten to know Ray at all, if he's been a sounding board or
played any role in your life at all?  
JA MORANT: I really haven't spoke to Ray as much. Him and my dad and my uncle
are still close, so I get the chance -- I spoke with his mom a little bit. But
other than that, I really haven't.  
  
Q. Ja, one more about the camp with Markus. You said he was one of the
first guys you talked to. Did you seek him out, or did you know him at all
beforehand, or was it just a coincidence that he was one of the first guys you
connected with there?  
JA MORANT: I think it was just coincidence. We just happened to sit at the
same table and just got to know each other. He told me that he played at
Marquette, and after that, we was just talking throughout the camp, and now we
play against each other tomorrow, so...  
  
Q. Did you stay in touch?  
JA MORANT: Yeah, we do stay in touch.  
  
Q. Ja, was there any interaction between you and Markus leading up to
this game?  
JA MORANT: We spoke a little bit last night, just saying how it's crazy that
we met at the Chris Paul camp and now both, obviously our names are out there,
and now we get to play against each other.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Matt McMahon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35054)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: Thank you. Excited to be here. I have a lot of respect for
a very good Marquette team we'll see tomorrow. Our guys have had a long layoff
here, 11 days now. But they're excited to get back on the court and play
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys have been really good defending the three-pointer. You are a
really good shooting team. What do you guys think you need to do to defend
against Marquette's three-point attack?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: I think it's a critical part of tomorrow's game. I think
they're better than good from behind the three-point arch making almost 10 in
a game. I think ninth in the country from a percentage standpoint. Not only
Howard's ability to create his own and shoot from well beyond the NBA three.
But they have guys at 6'8" in multiple positions who shoot it well.  
  
So it really puts a lot of pressure on your defense to be very solid and
fundamentally sound. I think it's going to be a great challenge for us
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, without giving away too many details, general offensive
strategy against Howard and their offense this?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: To play extremely hard. Try and make the shots as
difficult as we can. He's going to score. I think you look at some of the key
stats from him, it's not only his ability to shoot from the three and create
his own. His ability to get to the free-thrown line is a key stat. I think he
took 24 free-throws in his last game, so I think that's important as well.  
  
Q. I was curious, obviously guys like Markus Howard, Ja Morant, from an
average standpoint, they're probably going to get theirs. What do you expect
to be the X-factors and how you take care of them from a defensive stand
point?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: I think both teams -- and I can't speak for Marquette. I
think both teams have star players that get a lot of attention. They both have
good teams. We both have balance, multiple double-figure scorers. I think
everything's important.  
  
You look at things like Ed Morrow having 17 offensive rebounds in the last
three games, key stats like that. I think will be of importance. Who wins the
turnover battle, and on down the line. I think, for us to beat a team of their
quality, we'll have to play exceptionally well both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. You know, you have two good defenders in Ja and Shaq on the
perimeter. Without divulging too much of the game plan, are you going to throw
both of those guys on Markus Howard a little bit?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: I'm not sure how we'll match up yet. But it's not only
Markus Howard. Hauser's ability at 6'8". His efficiency numbers are off the
charts, averaging 15 a game and doing it at a high level. And his ability to
shoot the three as well and his explosive drives to the basket.  
  
One of our strengths this year has certainly been our perimeter defense and it
will have to be really, really good tomorrow.  
  
Q. You were a player and coach at App State for so long, late '90s,
early 2000s. Steve Wojciechowski was a player at Duke at the same time. I am
curious did you ever cross paths? Did you have a relationship with him?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: No, we did not. He is a much better player than I ever
was.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about the success that the Murray State
program's had in developing guards through the last few years that have been
able to go on and have success, after college level?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: Thanks, Kenny. I think it starts with recruiting. We've
been very fortunate to recruit some talented players from great families who
have come in and have been about the right things. They put in a lot of hard
work. Our coaching staff invests a lot of time in the player development
aspect of the program. And when the time comes for Ja to be drafted, he'll be
the third point guard since 2012 to be drafted into the NBA in the top 35. And
there are only two schools in the country that can stay that, Murray State and
the University of Kentucky.  
  
So we've just been fortunate to get great players like Ja Morant, and then
when he gets to Murray State he just keeps getting better, because he's about
the right things.  
  
Q. For those people who haven't seen him, what makes Ja such a great
player?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: He's a combination of a lot of great things. Number one,
athletically, and from an explosiveness standpoint, he is elite. And then on
the basketball side of things, phenomenal understanding and IQ for the game.
He's got great court vision. He sees things develop before anyone else on the
floor and then the intangible type things you combine with those traits such
as his unselfishness, his competitiveness, his drive to win. You combine all
of those things into one and you get this once in a lifetime player and that's
what he is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, is he the National Player of the Year?  
  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: I don't get caught up in all of that. I think it's a great
honor that in the past couple of days he's been named one of the four
finalists for the Oscar Robinson National Player of the Year as well as the
Naismith Player of the Year. He's certainly well deserving. He's had a
historic season. I looked the other day. There's 16 players with that have had
a game of 24 points and 10 assists this year; 16 out the entire country did it
one time. That's what he averaged this season. So he's had a magical year and
is very deserving of all of the awards that come his way.  
  
Q. Coach, of all of the different statistics in this game going into it,
both teams really rebound the basketball differently, but exceptionally well.
How do you guys plan on attacking the glass knowing they have such a
rebounding margin like you guys do?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: I think it's hard to just lock in on one stat and say
that's going to determine the game. I think for us, we know we'll have to play
a complete game. There's a reason Marquette's been a top 15-team all season
long, because they're very good in all areas. I think their offense gets a lot
of the attention, but if you go through the defensive efficiency numbers,
they're very, very good there. So we'll have to play a complete game at both
ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, for the first time in 20 years, Murray State's been to the
NCAA Tournament back-to-back years. What do you credit that beyond having good
players that enabled Murray State to rise to the top in the Ohio Valley?  
COACH MATT MCMAHON: Well, it's a great accomplishment for our team and our
program especially to do something that hadn't happened in 20 years in our
league. But we never talked about it one time until we were cutting down the
nets after beating Belmont Saturday. I think it starts with the players you
recruit, not only their ability and their, talent but what they're about. When
we brought in guys like Ja Morant, Shaq Buchanan, Anthony Smith, Tevin Brown,
those guys are winners, not only on the court, but off. It created a culture
in our locker room of unselfishness, toughness, relentless, competitive drive
to win.  
  
And I think Ja, Shaq, they take great pride in the fact they're 53-10 in two
seasons at Murray State, that they have two back-to-back regular season
championships and two back-to-back OVC championships and two back-to-back
appearances in the big dance. It's really a credit to them.  
  
Obviously I have three great assistant coaches. Shane Nichols, Tim Kaine,
Casey Long, have done a incredible job of recruiting, player development, game
preparation, recruiting, building the culture of our locker room. I can go
down the line. They've been fantastic.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Anthony Lamb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33082)

### [Ernie Duncan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36891)

### [Stef Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36892)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Anthony, this season, what expectations did you put on yourself going
into the year and have you achieved them thus far?  
ANTHONY LAMB: Yeah, so this year mostly for me, trying to get healthy and
trying to get back to myself and the level of play I expect from myself. I was
trying to become a leader on this team knowing I had to step into a bigger
role as upperclassman. Really trying to do what the coaches tell me and get
back to 100 percent is my goal. I think I've done that to the best of my
ability this year.  
  
Q. Ernie, can you -- I'd like you to kind of talk about Coach Becker a
little bit, what he brings to the program and what was it about him and the
tone he sets for the program that encouraged all three, both your brothers to
come as well.  
ERNIE DUNCAN: The winning culture is the reason why I came and the chance to
get to this stage is why myself and Everett came to Vermont. Coach Becker is a
competitor, a great person to relate to off the court. He did a good job
bouncing the life off court and on the court.  
  
Q. For Anthony and Stef, you played in an ACC school earlier this year
and had big games, can you talk about that experience and what you prepare to
do at Florida State?  
STEF SMITH: Yeah, it was a great experience, stadium, atmosphere, it's just --
that level of basketball is a little different, athletic wise, physical wise.
I think it's good we got to play that game, to prepare us for this game coming
up on Thursday.  
  
ANTHONY LAMB: It's a lot of fun when you get to play against better
competition, so I think we're going to take advantage of that experience and
try to bring it into this NCAA Tournament game.  
  
Q. For Anthony, then Ernie, you got here two years ago, lost to Purdue,
what do you take away from that experience and how much does it help you
prepare for the game you have tomorrow?  
ERNIE DUNCAN: Yeah, we're definitely hungry with Anthony, having a taste of
the big stage. I know him and myself are hungry for a chance to compete
against a major team. Overall win, we're definitely excited for tomorrow.  
  
ANTHONY LAMB: It was a great game two years ago. We were able to step up on
the big stage and now we know what it takes in the game like that, playing
against higher competition and how it feels to play in front of that many
people in front of such a great crowd.  
  
Q. Really for any of you guys, getting to play somewhat close to home,
what do you guys expect in terms of fan support, students and family coming to
the games?  
ERNIE DUNCAN: We feel like it's a home game for us in a way. It's really
exciting we'll have fans coming from Vermont and into the area and coming down
to support us.  
  
STEF SMITH: It's amazing. Fan support has been really great the whole year.
That's going to be great to have that support. It's like a home game, like you
said.  
  
ANTHONY LAMB: Just grateful that my mom can make the trip. It's not too far
for her. Anything that makes it easy for my mom is good for me.  
  
Q. For any of guys, but maybe Anthony. Florida State's length and height
is uncommon even for other ACC teams. How do sort of make up for that
disadvantage?  
ANTHONY LAMB: I think it's our job to understand that, and going into the
game, being prepared for that. We haven't faced a team as long or athletic as
him. We got close playing Kansas and Louisville. So, it's really understanding
where we can get to on the court and how we can best exploit our advantages
versus their strengths.

HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Jeff Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18303)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
JEFF JONES: Like pretty much everybody else, we're thrilled to be in the
tournament. Our team has done a great job all year long. We defend, we play a
40-minute game. But I think the thing that we do best is compete. I have no
idea what's going to happen tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure that our guys are
going to come out and compete and certainly try to challenge a very good
Purdue basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this is about your team, but obviously the fight you've
been waging against cancer, can you address how that changed your perspective
of the season and how you think it's changed the perspective for the players
in terms of guys looking at what you do and then coming to work every day and
then knowing what they have to do?  
JEFF JONES: I'll answer the second part of that first. Hopefully, it hasn't
changed them a whole lot. My intention, when I went public in September, I
wanted to let them know, simply because I didn't want anybody -- them hearing
from anyone else.  
  
I didn't want them changing anything. I wanted them to have the same
experience that they would have had normally. I wanted them to know that I was
going to be there for them, that this wasn't going to change anything as far
as how I was going to coach, or me being there for them. I wanted them to know
that I had their back. So hopefully they haven't had to adjust too much. We
didn't talk about it a whole lot, and I don't think they probably noticed a
whole lot of difference in me from this year to the year before.  
  
I think any time you have any health issues, it changes your own perspective.
And I think that certainly has happened for me, not just pertaining to
basketball, but pertaining to all areas of your life. I've been told -- I
don't know if this is true or not -- that I've mellowed out a little bit. The
players might disagree, I don't know. But I think there is -- if nothing else,
there's probably a greater appreciation. As you get older, and then throw in
the health stuff, you know, I think a greater appreciation, just for normal
everyday occurrences. And then when you have an achievement and accomplishment
like this for our basketball team, I think it becomes even more special.  
  
And, you know, I certainly appreciate having the opportunity to be here, to
bring ODU to the NCAA Tournament. Old Dominion has had a great history from a
basketball perspective, and there are expectations in Norfolk and Old
Dominion. So, I think besides just being happy that we made it and we won the
Conference USA Tournament, I think there's certainly an element of relief to
finally be able to cross that threshold. And then for me on a personal note,
because it at times had been a tough year, you know, I think it made it even
sweeter.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't know if you know this, but of the eight teams playing
in Hartford this week, Old Dominion is the only one that's played a tournament
game here in Hartford. My question is two parts: Number one, what were you
doing in March of 1985? And, two, what do you need to do to get past the first
round this year? I think Old Dominion lost against SMU in the first round.  
JEFF JONES: March 1985, I was an assistant coach at Virginia. In 1985, I'm
thinking that wasn't a real good year for us. I think we were either done or
getting ready for the NIT.  
  
What do we need to do? Number one, we need to play like heck. Purdue is an
extremely well-coached basketball team. Matt Painter, in my estimation, may be
the number one most underrated basketball coach out there right now. Year in,
year out, he does an outstanding job, and this year's is no different. We know
they will be very well prepared. We've got to be ready for Carson Edwards, but
I'm not sure -- we'll try to be there. We'll try to make him work and contest.
But sometimes when he gets on a roll, there's not a whole lot you can do. I
think our mentality is trying to make sure that he and all of the others have
to work for everything that they can get.  
  
I think the big key, quite honestly, is can we run our offense and make some
shots. And in the Conference USA Tournament, we were able to hold our three
opponents to under 60 points. That's not going to happen tomorrow night. We
can play great defense, and we're not holding Purdue to 50 points. That means
we've got to score at a greater rate. That's something that's been difficult
for us at times this year. We've struggled.  
  
I think it's a mischaracterization when people say, they look at the scoring
and all that, and say we want to play at a slow tempo. We want to run every
chance that we get. We just want to make sure we do a great job of having
defensive balance in our defensive transition and get back and try to hold the
opposition in the half-court. So I think the tempo is important. We're not
walking the ball down the court. That doesn't help us at all. But we want to
try to be opportunistic from an offensive standpoint. And defensively, keep
doing the things we've been able to do all year long.  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, what went into the decision to go public with
your health issues? Have you thought about not coaching anymore, or is this
something that gets your mind off it or something you want to do until you
can't anymore, or until you're old.  
JEFF JONES: Sometimes I feel pretty old already, so I don't know when that
occurs.  
  
So, initially, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2015. I had radical
prostatectomy surgery, followed up by eight weeks of radiation. I was cancer-
free for over a year and then it came back in the summer of 2017. We monitored
it closely, but there was no urgency to start treatment at that point, so the
circle of people that knew was very, very small. Basically, it was family and
not even all of them.  
  
Last summer, the summer of 2018, the cancer began to grow, and so I needed to
begin the treatment. And the therapy, the side effects from that therapy, were
such that there was not going to be a way to keep it private, that it was
going to get out. I wanted to control the message. I wanted my players to hear
it from me. I wanted friends and family and professional colleagues to hear it
from me. So that's basically why I decided to make the announcement.  
  
Now, coupled with that, I figured -- and my wife was really, really important
in this part -- I figured if I was going to go through this, kind of given my
status as a college basketball -- or, visibility is probably a better word --
as a college basketball coach, that perhaps I could do some good in being
public and bringing awareness to the fight against prostate cancer and trying
to present, or more importantly, detect early on the onset of prostate cancer.
Encouraging men over the age of 50 to get their PSA checked, because prostate
cancer, while it's a common cancer, is one that, you know, you can control if
you detect it early.  
  
So, trying to bring awareness to that was also kind of a secondary -- well,
not a secondary -- a second goal that was important to me.  
  
Q. Coaching future?  
JEFF JONES: Coaching future? Coaching is not just something that I do. That's
who I am. So I have every intention of continuing to coach. You know, the idea
of not coaching, the idea of retirement, that's not even on the radar at this
point. I think -- you know, I had heard in our community this year, there were
people saying, oh, this is going to be his last year. I mean, I guess I
understand how stuff like that gets started, but there's absolutely no truth
to that. And, to be honest, I haven't even looked that far ahead. I'm pretty
good at compartmentalizing and focusing on what's immediately in front of me,
and I haven't thought past March for months.  
  
Q. How have you had to manage it physically, in terms of just going
through a treatment and just getting through a day. What is that like for
you?  
JEFF JONES: You know, it's not like every day is torture. I mean, most days,
it's fine. The side effects are there. The side effects aren't a whole lot of
fun, but there have only been a handful of days where it's really kind of, you
know, really affected me. And I'm very fortunate, with my wife being just, you
know, a great friend and supporter and confidante and helping me through those
days.  
  
But I think especially knowing that I've got a wonderful coaching staff, guys
that I've known for years, and they've been great at picking up the slack if
there's been a day where maybe I just -- I need to stay at home and not come
in in the morning. And there haven't been many of those. But when they are,
those guys have helped me. So I think having a great support network is how
you get through that.  
  
And then, I'd be really remiss if I didn't mention, you know, my boss, bosses,
Wood Selig and John Broderick, our president, have been explicit in telling
me, make sure you take care of yourself and don't overdo it. And when you've
got that kind of support from the people above you, as well as the people that
are around you on a daily basis, I won't say it makes it easy, but you can get
through it. Everybody has some bad days. You know, I had some of those this
year, but we were able to plow on through and obviously be successful.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Markus Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32862)

### [Sam Hauser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36904)

### [Sacar Anim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34365)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Markus, Ja talked about when you met at CP3 camp. What's it going to
be like playing against him and a lot of fun, too?  
MARKUS HOWARD: Me and him were pretty close. We got close over that time in
camp. We've been in contact throughout the season, supporting each other. To
be able to share the court with him on Thursday is going to be pretty cool.
He's had a great year, their team has had a great year, and, us as a team,
we're looking forward to playing against a great opponent.  
  
Q. Sacar, you're probably going to get the tough assignment of Ja Morant
tomorrow. After studying him for a few days, what is the important thing in
defending against him?  
SACAR ANIM: Obviously, he's a terrific player with a lot of speed, the way he
can create for his other players and also get his own shot. Like I said, just
being able to stay in front and making sure we don't get on the side where we
let them get a head of steam going to the rim.  
  
Q. Markus, can you give us an update about your wrist and how you're
feeling?  
MARKUS HOWARD: My wrist is all good. I've been seeing our athletic trainer
each and every day about it. But taking really good precautions with it, so
I'm ready to go and I'll be perfectly fine for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sam, what is the defensive philosophy going to be tomorrow. Murray
State is a pretty versatile team. How do you start that?  
SAM HAUSER: It starts on the offensive end, taking care of the ball, taking
good shots. They're very good in transition, very athletic. So taking them out
of transition and blocking them out because they're a very good rebounding
team as well. And then obviously guarding the drive.  
  
Q. Sacar, you had guarded a lot of the really good guards from the Big
East, Myles Powell, all those guys. Do you think that prepared you for the
tough assignment you have tomorrow?  
SACAR ANIM: Definitely. I play against a lot of top players in the country.
Since this is my first time playing them, I haven't had that much time to
watch a lot film on them. But I played against a lot of great opponents in the
Big East, so I think that's prepared me so I'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Again, Markus, what is your philosophy to successfully play your
position especially in a big game like you have tomorrow?  
MARKUS HOWARD: I think definitely just leading my team in different areas,
being a vocal leader, making sure I'm taking care of the ball. And then when
the time present itself, maintaining and being aggressive, finding my guys in
open spots. I play with a bunch of great teammates that can really make plays.
So being sure I get them going to start the game.  
  
Q. I'm sure you guys are used to this any time you go into a game,
Markus gets the attention and against the other top scorer or whatever. For
the two of you, could you talk about what it's like? This game's getting so
much attention because of the high profile match-up. When you're playing, do
you ever get caught watching Markus and the other guy sometimes, or is that
too much of a distraction? Do you just focus on what you have to do.  
SACAR ANIM: Basically, I just focus on what I got to do. Obviously, Markus is
a terrific player. When he gets to playing his game and gets the hinge shots,
I just worry about doing what I can do to help the team, just focus on that.
When he gets hot, we let him do his thing. We have a big mission. We're just
focusing on winning the game.  
  
SAM HAUSER: Kind of piggybacking off that. We're not a one-man show; we're a
great team. Markus knows that as well. Usually the teams we are playing
against are great teams as well like Murray State. They're not a one-man show.
I just focus on that, not getting caught up in the hype and focus on what sets
us up in the game.  
  
Q. Has he done anything that just kind of stops in your tracks and makes
you go wow?  
SAM HAUSER: He's had 40 like five times this year, so that kind of speaks for
itself.  
  
Q. Sam and Markus, in your minds what makes Sacar such a good defensive
player, and how nice is it to have him on your team to take on tough
assignments that he's done.  
SAM HAUSER: Sacar, he's very athletic and very versatile. He's been able to
guard multiple positions over his years here. He really takes pride in it. I
think that's what makes him great, his competitive edge on that end, and he
continues to show it.  
  
MARKUS HOWARD: Yeah, a lot of people -- just playing with Sac for so long,
he's has one of the quickest first steps I've ever seen. Him having that in
his arsenal, he's able to defend players really well.  
  
Sac's one of the most competitive people I've been around. When he competes on
the defensive end, he can guard anyone in the country. I think he's one of the
best defenders in the country just based off his competitive spirit alone.  
  
Q. Sacar, you redshirted a couple seasons ago when these guys last made
the NCAA Tournament. What are you most looking forward to tomorrow and your
NCAA Tournament debut, and have these guys told you or given you advice or
anything?  
SACAR ANIM: I was looking forward to just going out there and competing,
honestly. Like you said, I was off that year and didn't get to play, so I was
just watching. I'm looking forward to going out there and compete. The NCAA
Tournament is something you grew up wanting to play in, competing on the big
stage. I'm just focusing on going out there with my boys, competing, and
getting the win.  
  
Q. Markus, can you talk a little about your own personal approach when
you know you're going into a Big East game or whatever it is. Whoever you're
playing, it's kind of another high profile, maybe all-American kind of guy. Do
you prepare any differently?  
MARKUS HOWARD: No. I treat every game the same in term of how I prepare. I
know I'm with a great group of guys that have my back no matter what. So going
into games, I don't worry about doing anything too extra. I just stick to the
plan, stick to the game plan that our coaches draw up for us, and then just
trust our guys. I play with amazing teammates with amazing ability. So just
relying on that each and every game is how I prepare. Not really thinking too
much into it, just going out and playing our game. That's really we focus on
each and every time we step out and play.  
  
Q. Markus, going back to that Chris Paul camp experience. That was when
Ja started generating a lot of buzz. What stood out for you in that
experience? Can you see his game developing?  
MARKUS HOWARD: There is some play where he just displayed his athleticism.
There's some alley-oops thrown where his torso was above the rim. Just seeing
that, I was blown away by that. Yeah, there's some crazy plays that he made
throughout the camp in terms of him playing above the rim. That was definitely
something that caught my eye.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
COACH LEONARD HAMILTON: Our team has kind of been on a journey from the
beginning of the year. We've had an awful lot of adjustments that we've had to
make. We start the season off with our lead returning scorer, Phil Cofer,
dealing with a stress fracture, which I thought really challenged our players
somewhat to make adjustments to our rotation. Guys had to accept different
roles.  
  
Once we got into the season, we started off 1-4. That was another challenge
that I thought that was unexpected. But it was challenging, and I thought
through those challenges that we've had to overcome, our team has grown
stronger, they've become more of a unit, trying to adjust to the different
challenges that we had. And I think that we hit a point there during the
season where I thought that we were growing in confidence, togetherness, and
unity. And that allowed us to sometimes win close games, overcome deficits in
games. And I think we've grown to be a team that played with a lot of
confidence.  
  
The best thing about our team, I still feel that we have not played our best
basketball, and I think that as we -- I'm hopeful, that once we get into the
NCAA Tournament, we can hid a stride similar to where we were last year, and
hopefully that will give us the confidence to be extremely competitive in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been a little while, but you have some familiarity around
here. You've coached in the building, coached against UConn, any favorite
memories? Nice to be back a little bit?  
COACH LEONARD HAMILTON: I can remember Ray Allen hitting six threes from that
deep left corner in transition, and I got introduced to the league. I thought
we were playing really, really well. And each time we would score, Ray Allen
would streak down the left side of the court and seemed like they'd throw the
ball from out of bounds and he'd hit a three. I looked at my assistant coach
and said, you didn't tell me that was part of the challenge that we had to
overcome.  
  
But no, we enjoyed -- the people in Connecticut really are basketball fans,
extremely knowledgeable, very supportive of the local teams. We always -- you
always knew when you came to Connecticut, you're going to be in a tremendous
atmosphere. I loved playing down at Gampel. We got invited to Gampel once. We
got a little more competitive. UConn would always bring the teams they knew
they were going to beat easily to Hartford. And once we got more competitive,
it was a compliment that we had an opportunity to play on campus.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, give us a brief scout on Vermont, what you know so far.  
  
COACH LEONARD HAMILTON: I've watched Vermont play and I'm extremely impressed
with how well they execute. They seem to always be in control. They play to
their strengths. They have great spacing, they move the ball well, they shoot
the ball well from perimeter. They have a go-to guy that they keep the ball in
his hands as much as possible. One of the radio announcers interviewed me and
asked me what we thought would be the keys to the game.  
  
And as I look at them, I think they execute very well. I think the team that's
going to be successful will be the team that come closest to playing up to who
they are. We have a system offensively and defensively. They have a system
offensively and defensively. The team that's going to be successful is the
team who executes who they are the best.  
  
I think both teams are extremely competitive and been very successful. If you
look back over the years, Vermont has a risk tradition. They are in the party
of the country opposite from Florida. They are at the top of the USA, and we
are at the bottom, so we probably don't know that much about each other. But I
have a tremendous amount of respect for the tradition that they have been
establishing. I'm not surprised at all. They've been one of the winningest
programs in college basketball that nobody really knows a whole lot about.  
  
But we have a tremendous amount of respect for them in the tournament.
Hopefully our players' response will be a direct reflection of how much
respect we have for their program.  
  
Q. What do you think this game, especially up in Hartford means to
Terance Mann? He's a New England kid and gets to come home for a few games.  
COACH LEONARD HAMILTON: I think philosophically, this means a lot to him,
being in an area where people are familiar with you. Once they throw the ball
up, Terance won't be thinking about anything other than competing. He's
extremely competitive. He has a high basketball IQ, he's a team player. He's a
leader of our team in the locker room, on the basketball court. I think it
will mean an awful lot to him to have an opportunity to go and play in
advance. And I think that's what he's going to be talking about.  
  
He has the ability -- he's a mature guy. He won't allow himself to be
distracted, I'm sure. He'll probably have a few more people asking him for
tickets. Other than that, I think he'll be old Terance and that's who we've
grown to love.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of comparisons with the ACC this year to the old
Big East, three number one seeds and all of that. Can you compare what it's
like to have leagues that strong and how did that prepare you guys? How does
it prepare a team for this tournament to be from a league that's that
strong?  
COACH LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, there's no doubt that the competitiveness of our
league is extremely challenging. Every night out in the ACC, if you're not at
your best, you can have -- something bad can happen. If you're on the road,
they can give you a hat and show you the door real quick.  
  
This is a league that, it doesn't seem to matter whether you're ranked number
one or you're at 15. You're in a competitive game. You have to end up
respecting the name on the front of your jersey and not worry about who you're
playing. Because if you allow yourself to be affected by the name on your
opponents jersey, you have too many highs and lows. If you are very focused
about representing who you are, and you have to be in that frame of mind.
Because it doesn't seem to matter who you're playing.  
  
You turn the TV on and you -- the number one and two ranked team in the league
can be playing a team that's 13 or 14 in our league and it's a three or four
point game. 70 percent of all of the games in the ACC are decided by four
points or less. That means that this league is competitive. And so I think
once we get into a tournament like this, because of the competitive nature of
our league and the challenges we've had all year long, I think we'll be well-
prepared.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Jordan Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36918)

### [Jordan Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36919)

### [Malik Fitts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36920)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. It's a question for all three of you. You beat a good Gonzaga team in
the WCC Finals. What do you need to keep up that momentum against the reigning
National Champions.  
JORDAN HUNTER: Just got to keep building what we accomplished towards the end
of the season. We grew a lot as a team especially down the stretch, so we just
need to keep getting better even this late in the season.  
  
MALIK FITTS: To piggyback what he said, just keep our intensity on the
defensive end. Lately, we've been doing a pretty good job of defending. And I
think these guys, every one of our coaching staff, our players, have a good
mindset of coming to the game defending as well.  
  
JORDAN FORD: Pretty much what Malik said. On the defensive end, we've gotten a
lot better. It always starts right there for us. We'll able to beat good teams
when we're good on the defensive end, and the offense will take care of
itself.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk a little about having to play Villanova right off
the bat, the National Champions. Obviously in the past -- not that you were on
the team -- but you had success against Villanova in the Tournament, but
getting them right off the bat.  
JORDAN HUNTER: There's no bad teams in this tournament. We were ready for
whoever they threw at us and were excited to play a great program, two out of
last three National Champs. We couldn't want it any other way.  
  
Q. Malik, you played prep ball at Brewster. I talked to Coach Smith
earlier this week. He speaks quite highly of you and was very excited to see
you this weekend. How did your time at brewster prepare you to become a top
scorer for a team like St. Mary's.  
MALIK FITTS: I always say -- you know, it was college-like, there were
20-minute halves. I would say just like the intensity, like the guys you were
playing against. I played against a lot of really good guys. I just think it
got me prepared by -- you know, mentally and physically. I would say that when
I graduated -- before I did my prep year, I would say I wasn't ready for
college yet, so that year helped me get a better experience. It helped me to
get stronger, and also just to prepare for moments like this, and then just to
get ready for the big stage.  
  
Q. You've been very solid defensively, particularly I think seven of the
last eight games you really shut teams down. You are really good at shutting
down three-point shooters. Why has that been? Obviously you are going up
against Villanova who likes to shoot the three a lot.  
JORDAN HUNTER: We took it pretty bad after Gonzaga a few weeks back, and we
got in the film room and on the court as well, and it was a real conscientious
effort to just lift intensity. A lot of the defensive end for us, it's just
effort-based, so we had to switch on and lock in. And we were able to
translate that to games down the stretch run.  
  
MALIK FITTS: To go off what he said, at the start of the year, we were in
pretty well defensively. Like he said, I would say after the Gonzaga game --
they got us pretty well. I would say, after that, a lot of guys went back into
the film room. Practice was heavy defense. A lot of guys locked in, everyone
was locked in, and then the hard work paid off. I would say that it paid off
at the right time. A lot of guys started defending well. And, like he said,
we've been holding teams to a really low percentage on the three-point
percentage, on the three-point line. Sorry about that.  
  
Q. 21 percent?  
MALIK FITTS: Huh-uh.  
  
JORDAN FORD: Yeah, our team has a lot of pride. Our team is full of
competitors. We weren't okay with losing by 48 to Gonzaga. We took it very
seriously to get better on the defensive end, and it's really paid off for us.  
  
Q. How have you guys been acclimating to the time change?  
JORDAN FORD: I got a good nap on the plane, so I'm doing all right. But we
just try to get to sleep early, and try to hydrate ourselves as best we can
and I think we're getting acclimated pretty well.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about, did you think the NCAA fans will be
watching you in a different way now after you beat Gonzaga in the championship
game, and what is it like being in their shadow. I don't know how you perceive
that. Can you address that?  
JORDAN HUNTER: We're still going with that underdog mentality. Gonzaga is a
great program. We have no shame being in their league with their dominance. So
we're coming into this tournament. People think we're the fluke, us beating
Gonzaga. We have to prove that we're capable of just more than one great win.  
  
MALIK FITTS: Like he said, that was a great win for us. I don't -- I know me
personally and a lot of these guys really aren't satisfied for that win. It
was a great win and now it's time to, I would say, turn it up a notch. We
can't like let -- we, everyone on our coaching staff, you know, we don't -- we
don't really, what do you call it, listen to the gas, as they would say. So we
know that's in the past now, but we play tomorrow, so the only thing we can
focus on is just tomorrow.  
  
JORDAN FORD: Yeah. I don't think we're living in anybody's shadows. We're just
going to try to go out there and play the best game we can and compete against
Villanova and hopefully come out with a win.  
  
Q. Malik, who has the best facial hair on the team?  
MALIK FITTS: Come on now, you're looking at him.  
  
I don't know.  
  
JORDAN FORD: Come on, man.  
  
MALIK FITTS: I would say one of them isn't here right now, but probably our
big man, Jock Perry. Between everyone. He has a nice little facial hair going
on. Don't sleep on me. I'm coming up. Don't worry.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any facial hair responses by any of the Jordans?  
  
JORDAN HUNTER: He's just being a bit ignorant. The lights are on and he's just
panicking.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about what it's like to play for Coach
Bennett, and kind of what I just asked a minute ago about reputation and
everything. Do you think he's well known at all nationally? Do you think
people give him respect for what he's accomplished?  
JORDAN HUNTER: Coach has a fantastic basketball mind. He expects and demands
the best out of us, and he brings the best effort out of us every game. And
whether he's nationally recognized or not, I don't think that's his concern,
but we're just doing our part over in little Moraga making sure we're winning
games. If it's on the big stage, we're ready.  
  
MALIK FITTS: If he doesn't have the recognition, I believe he should. I mean,
he's one of the best coaches. As far as I remember, he's one of the top ten
coaches or one of the coaches with like 400 wins or something like that.  
  
No, he's really big on character and a lot of our guys on our team are, you
know, I will say really good about that. And that's what brought us to this
moment right here. Everyone stayed together.  
  
JORDAN FORD: Yeah. Piggybacking off that. The great thing about Coach Bennett,
he's not worried about what other people think about him, he's worried about
what's going on in that locker room with our guys. And like Jordy said, he
demands the best out of us every single night that we step on the floor and
that make sure I bring my best effort which I've gotten better since I came in
as a freshman.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

### [Ryan Cline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36335)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. So since the draw, what have you seen from Old Dominion that would
concern you?  
RYAN CLINE: Well, they obviously have three really good guards. Their one and
two complement each other very well. Obviously, from a guard defensive
standpoint, we are going to have to do a good job tomorrow night.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, just kind of following on what he said, they have some
guards that can do a lot, very versatile with scoring the ball, whether that's
putting it on the floor, catch and shoot, and just kind of getting in the
paint. Just being able to contain the dribble and make it hard for them --
contest their shots is what is most important for us.  
  
Q. Do you know who you'll be defending? Can you say out loud who you'll
be defending?  
RYAN CLINE: I don't know if we can say that for sure.  
  
Q. Can you say it quietly?  
RYAN CLINE: No, I don't think so. Sorry.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Do you want to make just a general comment on what kind of
defense you will need to play to be successful tomorrow?  
  
RYAN CLINE: We're obviously going to have to keep them out of the paint like
Carsen said. They like to get in the paint and feed keep their big guys down
low. As long as we keep them out of the paint and just have them shoot
contested shots, we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Carsen, we were just grilling you in Chicago about your back. How do
you feel now? What's the progress there?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I'm okay. Just taking it day by day, just trying to get
treatment and things like that. I don't want it to be a big deal or anything
like that. I'm fine. I just want to be able to help my team win.  
  
Q. Coach Painter talked earlier this week about how after a few down
years earlier in the decade, you guys started having success when you started
getting Purdue guys into the program. What is the Purdue guy, in your opinion?
What defines a Purdue guy?  
RYAN CLINE: I just feel like, you know, I think Grady Eifert's a really good
example. He's just a blue-collar guy who really had to earn his way throughout
his career at Purdue. They came with a lot of hard work and a lot of
education. I feel like that's what Coach Painter has been recruiting.
Obviously with some shooters, he's done pretty well, too.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I mean, I kind of look at it as just kind of going off
the people I'm around on the team. There's good guys around me that understand
the game well, but then also are good guys off the floor and are smart guys.
Smart guys that know the game, well like I said. And are good dudes off the
floor that are understanding. I feel like that's a Purdue guy in my opinion,
going off the people that I play with and people I'm around.  
  
Q. Yeah, coming into this, you lost two of your last three games. Any
concern about the way you're playing and what can you do to turn it in the
right direction?  
RYAN CLINE: I mean, there's really no particular concern. I feel like we were
in -- those two losses that we had, there were just some things down the
stretch that didn't go our way. I feel like we had some shots -- or we had
some chances in those two games to win. So there are a couple of things that
we needed to clean up. But we just need to get better at the things we are
already good at.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Carsen, anything to add there?  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I guess I can kind of say the same thing Ryan said. I feel
like it's a new season in a way, and just trying to move on and focus on this
game we have at hand tomorrow. But we take those mistakes and learn from them
from the games we've lost. Even the last game we won, we still had mistakes.
We learn from every game, but also we just try to move forward and focus on
this one game we have tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What is it like to get locked on with Nojel in practice or what is it
like to have him locked on you when he's on defense?  
RYAN CLINE: Obviously from an offensive standpoint, when he's guarding you,
it's very tough. He's just such a big guy for a point guard, and he moves like
a point guard, but he's got the body of a forward. So obviously it's
challenging. He's tough to stay in front of. He's quick. He's elusive. He just
know how to play the game the right way especially with his skill set.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I feel like it makes it tough, especially with him longer than
me and a little bigger than me. I feel like it makes it tough. Also he's a
strong dude, moves well. I go at him, too. He's a strong dude. He moves well.
He's athletic. Good build. He's tough. He makes it tough for a lot of people.
Makes us better. Sorry, he makes us better.

Q. Coach Painter talked earlier this week about how after a few down
years earlier in the decade, you guys started having success when you started
getting Purdue guys into the program. What is the Purdue guy, in your opinion?
What defines a Purdue guy?  
RYAN CLINE: I just feel like, you know, I think Grady Eifert's a really good
example. He's just a blue-collar guy who really had to earn his way throughout
his career at Purdue. They came with a lot of hard work and a lot of
education. I feel like that's what Coach Painter has been recruiting.
Obviously with some shooters, he's done pretty well, too.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I mean, I kind of look at it as just kind of going off
the people I'm around on the team. There's good guys around me that understand
the game well, but then also are good guys off the floor and are smart guys.
Smart guys that know the game, well like I said. And are good dudes off the
floor that are understanding. I feel like that's a Purdue guy in my opinion,
going off the people that I play with and people I'm around.  
  
Q. Yeah, coming into this, you lost two of your last three games. Any
concern about the way you're playing and what can you do to turn it in the
right direction?  
RYAN CLINE: I mean, there's really no particular concern. I feel like we were
in -- those two losses that we had, there were just some things down the
stretch that didn't go our way. I feel like we had some shots -- or we had
some chances in those two games to win. So there are a couple of things that
we needed to clean up. But we just need to get better at the things we are
already good at.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Carsen, anything to add there?  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I guess I can kind of say the same thing Ryan said. I feel
like it's a new season in a way, and just trying to move on and focus on this
game we have at hand tomorrow. But we take those mistakes and learn from them
from the games we've lost. Even the last game we won, we still had mistakes.
We learn from every game, but also we just try to move forward and focus on
this one game we have tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What is it like to get locked on with Nojel in practice or what is it
like to have him locked on you when he's on defense?  
RYAN CLINE: Obviously from an offensive standpoint, when he's guarding you,
it's very tough. He's just such a big guy for a point guard, and he moves like
a point guard, but he's got the body of a forward. So obviously it's
challenging. He's tough to stay in front of. He's quick. He's elusive. He just
know how to play the game the right way especially with his skill set.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I feel like it makes it tough, especially with him longer than
me and a little bigger than me. I feel like it makes it tough. Also he's a
strong dude, moves well. I go at him, too. He's a strong dude. He moves well.
He's athletic. Good build. He's tough. He makes it tough for a lot of people.
Makes us better. Sorry, he makes us better.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Phil Cofer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35069)

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Trent, you guys don't play Vermont or many America East teams. What
do you know about them, what are you expecting tomorrow?  
TRENT FORREST: They kind of play different from what we're used to. They kind
of just play a slower type of pace. I mean, they have the Lamb kid who's
pretty good. They play a lot of ball through him. So we just have to stop him
and try to pick up their pace a little bit to what we like to play at.  
  
Q. My question is for Terance. You're a Lowell, Mass. kid. What does it
mean to come back to New England to play in the NCAA Tournament?  
TERANCE MANN: It definitely means a lot for me because it's my last year and I
get to come back and play in front of friends and family for one last time. So
it's a good feeling.  
  
Q. Terance, kind of going off that last question, you prepped at the
Tilton School. What can you say about how playing at Tilton helped develop you
and the type of competition you played in the Prep League?  
TERANCE MANN: It helped develop me a lot. I played a lot of competition in the
NEPSAC, a lot of D1 players on every team we played, night in, night out. It
definitely helped out a lot maturing me for my freshman year.  
  
Q. Phil, coming out of the ACC tournament, you guys were in some pretty
crazy games there. I mean, how much does having that just so recently under
your belt help you against a team that you're very unfamiliar with?  
PHIL COFER: I think the main thing, basically all those three games were dog
fights. We are putting that in the past and looking forward to this game
because it's our next game. I think the main thing is to learn from our
mistakes from what we did and just moving on.  
  
Q. You guys had a great run last year in the NCAAs. I'm wondering what
you take from a run like that that you can bring to the next tournament?  
TERANCE MANN: I think definitely we learned a lot from last year. We learned
how to take it one game at a time and not worry about future games ahead. I
think last year we did a good job of that, we stuck to -- every game plan was
kind of different for us last year and we did a good job of taking one game at
a time. I think we'll carry that over with us this year especially since we've
got a lot of returners on the team from last year's run.  
  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I would kind of say what Terance said, just taking it one
game at a time. I feel like the whole experience last year, it helped us
throughout the season with winning games. That's just going to help us be even
better with this year's tournament.  
  
PHIL COFER: The main thing is kind of not looking in the future, just looking
at what we got ahead. That's what made us have a good run, looking at what
team we had and just mainly just focusing on them. That's what really helped
us have a run last year.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Randy Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18282)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
RANDY BENNETT: Yeah, we're just excited to be playing in this tournament
coming out here and playing in Hartford and playing against the defending
National Champion. So I think that's where we're at. We've had a heck of a run
to get here, and pumped and playing and determined again.  
  
Q. I was wondering, what do you need to do? You just came off a big win
against Gonzaga in the WCC finals. What do you need to do to keep that
momentum going against Villanova?  
RANDY BENNETT: You know, for lack of a lot of time, we have to play well. And
when you go in the NCAA Tournament, anybody you come up against is pretty good
and pretty confident, and been on a run of some sort. So you have to get your
team to kind of relax. They're obviously going to be nervous. But you can't be
nervous long. You have to perform.  
  
So that's what we've been trying to work on. And that's -- going to try and
get used to the court today and go our 40 minutes out there. But we need to
play well early in that game.  
  
Q. You guys really made a turn with the defense after that loss to
Gonzaga. Can you explain how that came about? You guys really have clamped
down on teams as of late.  
RANDY BENNETT: I honestly can't tell you why it turned then. We knew we were
working on it. We knew we were deficient defensively. We knew our numbers had
to be better. And for whatever reason, that game which we weren't good
offensively in at Gonzaga. We turned around after that. Maybe we needed to see
that. Maybe that woke us up a little bit. I don't know. But we've Ben working
on it for a while. You're right. We've put up good defense in numbers. We
totally changed as a defensive team. We went on the road and won three out of
four and really guarded a couple good teams on the road. And that is the
reason we turned it around and finished, I think we won seven of the last
eight. But a lot of those games weren't close. We went down to San Diego and
cleared up 20 right off. CHECK a lot of guys made some changes, that's what
happened with our team. That's why we're playing in the snowstorm tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, when Coach Wright saw the pairing he immediately went back to
2010. I know it's like a million years ago. But what did that win do for your
program winning such a high profile game as an underdog like that?  
RANDY BENNETT: That win was probably the biggest win in St. Mary's program
history. Everybody remembers it back in California. It was -- it kind of came
out of the nowhere. We had a special group of guys, and Omar, Sam Han as our
leader and top scorer. Dell dove have a turned out to be a pretty good player.
Mickey McConnell's a pretty good player. We had a pretty good group. We
remember it. It's a historical moment. I'm sure he thought about that as well,
unfortunately.  
  
Q. Randy, when was the last time your teams played on the east coast and
how are they handling the time change?  
RANDY BENNETT: I don't remember last time. Probably NCAA Tournament, is the
last time we came out to the east coast unless you count Western Kentucky but
that is the time zone. We handled it by getting out here an extra day early. I
think that's the key in trying to get your guys on that. It's a long trip so
you got to get your kids adjusted and get them on the time, get them -- get
their bodies adjusted a little bit. So, other than that, nothing else. So we
played pretty good at Western Kentucky. I think we played well on it last time
when we came out here and played up in Providence.  
  
Q. Randy, you have quite a few Australians and New Zealanders on your
team and the mass shooting from last Friday, what effect do you think that had
on your players as a whole and especially the two from New Zealand?  
RANDY BENNETT: I don't want to seem insensitive, but they didn't have -- our
kids will be concerned on something like that, and would be worried about our
two players from New Zealand. But it wasn't a big topic when it happened for
whatever reason.  
  
So I think our guys are good on that. I talked to our two New Zealanders, and
they were -- it's just a sad, sad event. And in life, you have to deal with
those things and move on. We try and make sure our players are okay on those
situations. I think they are. I can't say, hey, everything's okey-dokey, but
it was -- I think our guys have done a good job with it.  
  
Q. Coach, building on the defensive thing, how much are the challenges
to stop Villanova tomorrow night and have you played any teams similar to them
this year?  
RANDY BENNETT: We played some teams similar to Villanova, as far as what I've
seen on film watching them. The challenges -- obviously, their game is towards
getting threes, hit over ten a game, which is probably the highest. That's the
highest of anybody we've played this year. They're a little bit like Gonzaga
defensively, how they play, how they switch a lot of ball screens and switch a
lot of things. They're a little bit like them and a little like San Diego in
terms of how they attack you to get threes. They're more than threes. They'll
take the hole and have some really good players scoring inside the paint.  
  
But the big part of their deal is they're going to make you help and kick out
and have some really good shooters and they put five guys out there that shoot
the three. At the same time, they really don't -- I guess their back-up center
is a true center, but that's the only guy on the team that's a true center.
They always put you in a position where you have to decide where you're going
to get help from on the penetration. And from there, they'll find that and
play off that and get open threes or turn it into a second penetration and get
another three.  
  
So, they just kind of wear you down with that game. I'm familiar with it, like
we see that a lot out west. Maybe not with the same caliber players that
Villanova is playing with.  
  
Q. Obviously, this isn't your first NCAA appearance. You've had a lot of
20-win seasons, you've won 400 games. People who are avid college basketball
fans know about St. Mary's. But if you could tell -- what would you like
people to learn about your program as a result of this particular appearance
right after beating the number one team in the country.  
RANDY BENNETT: I think you kind of said it, like we've been consistent. I
think we pride ourselves on being efficient. And that's in player development,
recruiting, the whole deal. But I think we get good players that are high
character kids, and they are trying to be part of a program or part of a thing
that's bigger than them. It's hard to find guys like that. We really try. We
try and coach them that way. So, I think we've been efficient. We've been
really efficient for the last 12 years, and even longer than that.  
  
But for the last 12 years, had a really good run, and this year was -- this
year, I take a lot of pride in this year's team. Because we basically started
from scratch. We had two guys return that played a lot for us last year and
that was Tanner Krebs and Jordan Ford. But neither of those guys were our go-
to guys last year. So every guy -- that's what is happening with our team,
every guy has had to make a move and improve and take on a new role.  
  
A guy like Kuhse, he wasn't playing for us for seven games. Moved in the
lineup. He's grown into a pretty good player. Matthias Tass was a freshman,
earlier he wasn't playing, now he's become a good third inside guy for us, and
Jordan Hunter came off back surgery. He was out four, five months, and for him
to step in and continue to improve. I think he first started playing again
late September, first started being able to go five on five. For him to make
that -- have this kind of year -- and he's really come on down the stretch.  
  
Those are things that they had to happen if we're going to be good. And so,
for these guys to get -- we're not really only a one-shot wonder. We could
have got in the tournament if we didn't win the conference tournament. We
might have. I'm sure glad we didn't have to go through that again, though. But
these guys turned themselves into another good team. I'm really proud of them
to do that. They would have easily -- they could have easily gone a lot of
different directions. I tell them they're pretty tough. They're really
resilient, so I think they're 13-9, 4-3 at one point. And they hung in there.
They stayed together. You couldn't get them to go sideways.  
  
We came down the stretch, fortunately and had a huge win to get to this
tournament. That's what I'm most proud of. All of these groups of guys over
the years have been pretty consistent, pretty efficient and really high
character kids.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
HARTFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+HARTFORD)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [John Becker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23477)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah, exciting to be home in Connecticut, the opportunity to play
an Tournament game in Hartford. We're looking forward to tomorrow afternoon
against a really good Florida State team, hopefully get a good turnout from
our Catamount fans and New England basketball fans. We're really looking
forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, playing against Louisville and Kansas, what did that do, that
experience, especially the success a couple of your guys really had in those
games. What does that do going into a game like this?  
JOHN BECKER: I think it's going to help us out tremendously. We put together a
really challenging nonconference schedule that included at Louisville and at
Kansas. So, hopefully, that will pay benefits tomorrow. I think this will be
the most athletic and longest team we play all year. I think it will be an
adjustment getting used to the size and athleticism. Hopefully once the game
starts and we get a feel for that, we'll settle of in.  
  
Q. Coach, you've obviously been back here plenty of times at least in
the area. When is the last time you played in this building or coached in this
building? Is it nice to be back and see some friendly tastes?  
JOHN BECKER: It's really exciting for me and my family to have this
opportunity. Last time I was in this building, I think I took my daughter to
see the Eagles here a couple years ago. But the last time for a basketball
game was their National Championship year Kemba Walker and those guys, and it
was pretty neat, Ryen Russillo gave the pregame talk. Mike Lonergan was a head
coach, I was assistant and we were up three at the half, and things changed in
the second half unfortunately.  
  
But they went on to win the National Championship. Napier was a freshman and
Kemba, pretty good back court they had there. Yeah, it will be really, really
neat tomorrow to be able to coach out here and be the head coach in a NCAA
Tournament game in my home state.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at Florida State, you put together your game
plan, is it three thing, five things? What do you focus on going into a game
against them?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty simple game plan and offensively,
we're going to have to make a lot of shots, shoot a lot of threes just because
of their size in and around the basket. And offensively, rebound is important.
We're a really good defensive team, but we haven't played the likes of this
size before. So we're going to have to really clean up the glass and box out
and get rebounds.  
  
If we can do that, we can get out and play in transition and hopefully attack
them early before they can get their defense set. So, you know, there's a lot
of similarities to our recent games, as far as the game plan goes, and, we'll
see.  
  
Q. Two quick ones for you, first one, what can you say about Anthony's
maturation this season and how much will the team rely on him today -- I mean,
tomorrow and how can the team continue to stay as dialed in as they were in
the conference tournament?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah. Anthony's been amazing this year. You know, his growth as a
player, he's really -- his perimeter skills have really improved in three-
point shot, it really made him a hard cover. But most importantly, as a
leader, he's been tremendous, and he's become -- along with Ernie Duncan,
become the leader of this team. He's been there every day for us and every
night. He shoots 35 percent of our shots which is very different than how most
Vermont teams play, where it's much more balanced scoring. We've really relied
on Anthony, night in and night out. And he's delivered.  
  
And the other piece of him offensively, has really become a complete player
and really passed the ball when he double- and triple-teamed, was an all-
defensive player this year, which I'm really proud of. He's become a two-way
player. So, that's -- he's going to be important for us, obviously, again,
tomorrow.  
  
And what was the second part of your question?  
  
Q. How can you keep your teams focused?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, we've been really, really focused. For a young team,
that's been really important for us, and we've gotten better as the year has
gone on. And I thought our conference tournament was the best we've done all
year of executing our system and executing the game plan, and, you know, for a
full 40 minutes. Our guys did a really good job with that, and, you know,
there will be excitement early in the game around being in a NCAA Tournament,
but hopefully we can calm down early in the game and settle in, get a feel for
their athleticism and go out there and play to win.  
  
Q. John, I'm wondering, your experience coaching at Gallaudet, how that
shaped your career, unique experience, has it made you become a different
coach in some ways?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah. I learned a lot from that experience as a young coach. The
first and probably most important is the value of communication and where I
had to teach myself sign language to communicate with my players and other
coaches. And I took that really seriously, and, you know, really proud that,
was able to communicate there. And, we take for granted the communication
piece. And I never have since then, and we overcommunicate in our program
here, and understand the importance of that and the value of that and how easy
it is for us. And the friendships I made there, and just to be part of that
culture and part of that community, gave me a great appreciation for a lot of
things that I have and that we have. You know, I stay hopefully a little bit a
part of that community I bring forward with me, and it's made me a better
coach for your.  
  
Q. What UMBC did last year, was that relevant at all for the conference?
I know this isn't a 160 match-up.  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, we're really proud as a conference member, we're really
proud what UMBC was able to conference this year. So, I think as a conference,
we have confidence and we want to be competitive and we want to win games in
the tournament. We can see what that does for us, and they helped give us
confidence. We've won some NCAA tournament games, obviously Syracuse game and
Lamar in the First Four in 2012. So as a conference, we really pride ourselves
as being a little underappreciated and undervalued.  
  
So this is our opportunity to show the country just how good of a conference
we are. So we're here representing our conference and we expect to -- we
expect to advance.  
  
Q. John, can you talk a little about the preparation to play Florida
State with your reserves, because they're not quite the same length and same
athleticism. How did you prepare and how did those guys prepare for their role
in getting your starters ready?  
JOHN BECKER: Yeah. I think our -- our bench is going to have to play well
tomorrow. I mean, just with how hard Florida State plays. They play 11 guys,
and, you know, to play the full 40 minutes, we're going to have to trust the
bench. They're going it have to be productive. We're going to have to keep
rotating guys so that we can play the whole game, so to speak, and so, our
bench has been inconsistent all year, has been much better. You know, we -- I
tinkered with the starting lineup more than we ever had this year as recently
as the conference playoffs. Our bench is constantly evolving. I like where our
starters and who we have coming off the bench and how they complement each
other. We will need them to play well.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [Fletcher Magee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36915)

### [Matthew Pegram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36917)

### [Nathan Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37005)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 62, Wofford - 56.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could just give us some of your opening thoughts
after this one today.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: I'm struggling here, pardon me. I applaud Coach Calipari and the
Wildcats. They fought, and they were incredibly well prepared. Needless to
say, they have very, very good players. I see some of the things we led for 18
minutes, they led for 16. We had 56 shots, they had 52. We've been so
fortunate in a number of situations, we've made our good fortune in a lot of
cases. We couldn't get one break today to get us over the hump. But I do, I
applaud a really fine Kentucky team.  
  
Q. Fletcher, just how disappointing to go 0 for 12 from three-point
range?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I mean, it's incredibly disappointing. I feel like if I
make three of those shots, we win the game. You know, a lot of them were good
shots, and just -- they didn't go in.  
  
Q. Can you put into perspective for us in terms of when was the last
time you went an entire game missing a three-pointer?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I think I've done it a couple times this year. You know,
sometimes you shoot the ball just how you think you're going to shoot it and
it feels good and looks good and just doesn't go in. Just one of those days.  
  
Q. Fletcher, can you talk to us about what Kentucky did defensively
against you? Did they play you differently than the teams that see you all the
time in the Southern Conference? What did they do defensively that caused you
to go 0 for 12?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, they played pretty good defense as far as topping me and
trying to deny me the ball and not come off screens and stuff. But a lot of
schools have done that. A lot of teams have done that to me before, and we've
found ways to get around it. Today we -- I feel like we got a decent amount of
quality looks, and we didn't knock them down. I think some of it definitely
was their good defense, and mainly a lot of it was just me being off my shot.  
  
Q. Nathan and Matt, the idea that Fletcher is not having a good night,
what were you guys doing that kept you in the game and made you think that you
could have a chance to pull it out?  
NATHAN HOOVER: I mean, we have such a great team and such great players. If
there's a night -- everybody knows there's nights where one person can't make
shots. But that doesn't mean we're going to drop our heads because what we can
do every night is defend and rebound and play as hard as we can, and we did a
good job with that, just sometimes -- it wasn't enough sometimes, but even
though he wasn't making some of his shots, we still had the utmost confidence
that he would make the next one because we've seen him do it all year, but
sometimes it just doesn't work out.  
  
Q. Coach, we spoke a little bit yesterday about the small-school
narrative that they have going with you guys. What do you think this type of
match-up does for the overall brand of Wofford moving forward? Do people know
who you guys are now?  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah, you know, we have been fortunate to be here five of the last
10 years, and that's been remarkable. But to come down here this year with
really a special team, with great internal leadership and really good players
and to beat a very fine Seton Hall team, and then to come back, come back on
Saturday and do it again against Kentucky, and we knew it. We knew it. And I
think Coach knew it. We knew coming in that we had the look. We had what it
took to find a way to win the game. That was the approach. It was always the
approach.  
  
Didn't happen for us today, but certainly this group, this team has done
enormous things, great things for not only our basketball program but for our
great college and for the wonderful city of Spartanburg. This has been all-
timers, all-timers and such a treat to have been a part of it.  
  
Q. This is for any of you. What is the biggest takeaway for you all from
this match-up?  
MATTHEW PEGRAM: I think we fought the whole game. Kentucky played a great
game. We fought the whole time. We never gave up until the very end, just came
up a little short.  
  
Q. Fletcher, you and Tyler guarded each other most of the day, both of
you played pretty good defense. What was that match-up like? How intense --
looked like you guys were even talking a little bit much trash here and
there?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I think it was definitely a good match-up. I mean, both
of us didn't play particularly well on offense, but we were going to compete,
and I'm sure were motivated to not let the other one score. So yeah, I mean,
it was fun going against him, but I just wish I could have played a little bit
better?  
  
Q. What kinds of things were said back and forth?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: I don't know. I don't remember.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Darryl Morsell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36986)

### [Anthony Cowan Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36902)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
LSU - 69, Maryland - 67  
  
MARK TURGEON: First of all, give LSU credit. They made two big-time plays. The
three they hit and then the layup. We weren't very good for 25 minutes. Shot
selection, defensively. We just weren't very good. I think we got down 16. And
we switched to zone, and we got some confidence, took their confidence, and
then we were better offensively. Not great, but we were better.  
  
It's a crazy game. You know, I'm really proud of my group. We didn't quit, and
we never quit all year. We've played hard. We played a really good basketball
team. It was hard to score against them. But basketball is crazy.  
  
So we run great offense, score tied, we get a wide open three for Eric Ayala,
just missed it. They come down, and the guy just shoots a three and makes it,
early in the shot clock. It's basketball.  
  
So that's the way it worked. That said, Stix stepped up and Anthony made a
great play, executed a great play after a time-out and made a three and ended
up winning. But proud of my guys. We were gutting it out. We weren't really
deep today. Couldn't really sub. Guys gave everything they had. I just feel
bad for my team because people are so critical of me and my team, and we're
the fourth youngest team in the country and we battled. We gave it everything
we had. They deserve better. They deserved better today. That's why I'm
disappointed.  
  
Q. Mark, did you come out of the halftime in the zone, or was it later
than that?  
MARK TURGEON: After my technical, so you can look it up.  
  
Q. That's when -- do you think the turnaround was more due to the zone
or did they kind of see that technical and respond to that situation and use
it to their advantage to get a little bit more motivated after that?  
MARK TURGEON: I think both, because we scored and hit a three, and then we got
a steal and a layup. So it was a little bit of both, to be honest with you.
But I think our zone slowed them down, kept the little guy out of the paint a
lot until the end, and then I thought Bruno and Stix did a phenomenal job
protecting the rim. We just didn't rebound well enough a few times. We gave
them too many shots. But we rebounded better, and they're a heck of a
rebounding team, and I think we out-rebounded them by eight. But the zone
definitely helped us.  
  
Q. In that last time-out, do you feel like Tremont was going to take it
there? Jalen obviously took it very hard. How do you prop him up after that?  
MARK TURGEON: Oh, Jalen was terrific. What a great game he had. What a great
year he's had. No, we showed them exactly what was going to happen. We showed
them middle ball screen for him. Kid just made a heck of a play. I wish we
would have -- wouldn't have got around Jalen, and I wish if he did get around
Jalen, Bruno would have pinned it on the glass, but it didn't happen that way.
And they scored. But the players knew exactly what was coming. We all knew
what was coming, it was whether we were going to be able to stop it or not.  
  
Q. Anthony and Darryl, what do you think you can take away from this
run? You're such a young team. What do you think you bring from this into next
year?  
DARRYL MORSELL: This is my first year here as a sophomore, so it was just a
great experience to see, a great experience to be a part of. As a kid, I
always grew up watching these type of games, these big-time games, so just to
be able to be in it, it's a great feeling, and just to have all these young
guys coming back and stuff, it's just going to make us hungrier.  
  
Q. Coach, two, three times this year or maybe a little bit more, you
went to the zone and it seemed to be really working. I know you're a man-to-
man guy. Is your mind maybe changing a little bit?  
MARK TURGEON: No, it's all stat driven. They shoot 31 percent from three as a
team. That's low. So everything told us to guard that way. We weren't going to
guard Belmont that way, obviously. And so we told the guys yesterday morning
when they woke up, we're going to zone, don't know when, but we're going to
zone. I would have loved to have done it earlier. I just kind of felt like we
weren't putting any pressure -- our offense just wasn't good enough. But no,
they knew we were going to do it. Guys like it. It helped us, but it's got to
be the right situation.  
  
Q. What was the message as you were falling behind and just could not
get over the hump?  
MARK TURGEON: What was my message?  
  
Q. Yeah, was there --  
MARK TURGEON: It was just like, come on, guys, we've got to play better. I was
on them. Shot selection wasn't great at times. We were really searching in the
first half. We went small right before half. Wiggins made some shots to keep
it halfway decent. But I think once we cut it to five real quickly, we all
thought we were going to win the game. We went up three. We all thought we
were going to win the game. I never thought we were going to lose until the
kid made the lay-up, to be honest with you.  
  
I can't fault anything that we tried to do. Offensively we tried to go through
Bruno, tried to go through Anthony, tried to go through Stix. We threw a lot
at them. One thing I would like to change is maybe our free-throw shooting. We
missed seven free throws. Front end a one-and-one, I believe, too, so that
would have helped us. They were 14 for 16. If we would have shot 21 for 23 we
would have won the game, but we didn't; we were 16 for 23.  
  
Q. How to do in the moments after a loss, but if you can step back and
think about where the program is in March of 2019 as opposed to the fall, how
do you feel about it?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, I feel great. You know, the hardest part about today is I
love coaching these guys. You know, we started at the summer, we went on a
trip and we stuck together, and it was a grind. Our schedule was ridiculous,
okay. We had eight of 11 on the road. It was a grind. And these guys, they
kept trying for me, and we really pushed for this weekend. We really felt like
-- I really pushed them for this weekend. I knew we were going to play good
basketball this weekend because I pushed them in practice towards this
weekend.  
  
I just feel bad for them because they go through a lot, and they deserve
better. I don't know how many shots rolled all the way in and rolled -- I
mean, come on.  
  
I never think my program is in bad shape. That's just my opinion. I always
think we're in good shape. I always think we're going to win the next game,
I'm going to get the next player. We've done some pretty good things. We'd
like to do better, but I think we're in great shape.  
  
Seven of our top eight were freshmen and sophomores, and we've recruited
pretty well, some things will happen in the spring I'm sure that will add some
pieces. You know, and we'll get even better. So I'm looking forward to
coaching this group again next year.  
  
Q. Mark, you said that LSU was the most athletic team in the country.
Did you feel like your guys needed a little bit of time to adjust to that
early in the game?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, it looked that way, especially around the rim. You know,
and they had a good game plan against Bruno, and we only made them pay one
time. Anthony hit the shot in the corner and I was begging our guys to do it
for a long time. But I did think we got used to it. We got two pretty good
athletes, too, in there. And we were able to get their guys in foul trouble
throughout the game. We just didn't make enough jump shots. We had some open
looks and some open free throws and Bruno had some lay-ups go out. Darryl had
a three-point play I think that rolled out or somebody's lay-up went all the
way in and went out. It was one of those days, and maybe we could have
separated ourselves a little bit more, five or six, but yeah, they're big-time
athletes, crazy athletes, and the point guard is terrific.  
  
Q. Did you kind of have a feeling in your mind going into the last play
that waters was going to be the guy that was going to try to do something,
more likely penetration because you also got the chance of drawing a foul?  
MARK TURGEON: Do I have to answer it again or can he look it up? I've answered
it so somebody has got it.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 62, Wofford - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening thoughts about this fantastic basketball
game today.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, you know, I've got to give Wofford -- they've just
played, and they knew they were going to run down that shot clock and they
knew we had a bunch of freshmen and one of them would break down, which is
what happened at the beginning of the game. Every last five seconds, one guy
broke down. Hard for young kids to do that and play this way.  
  
We got it going at half, and then they never went away. I thought there were
chances, we got up eight, we just couldn't get the lead any more. The way they
shoot threes, they're just dangerous, and they change how you have to play
defensively. And I thought our bigs did a great job. I thought Nick was
unbelievable in what he did today. And even EJ did well, where we really
helped those guards and played the way we had to.  
  
Q. Ashton, the job you and Tyler did on Fletcher Magee, can you talk
about the challenge he presented and how well you played on him?  
ASHTON HAGANS: We knew coming into this game he was a great shooter, so the
game plan was just make him make a basketball play, put it on the floor.
That's what we was trying to do. Tyler did a great job of talking to me when
he wanted to switch, but you know, for us to be at our best, we've just got to
talk and be for one another.  
  
Q. Ashton, down the stretch you put the ball on the floor and penetrated
and made some big finishes. Talk about that and your poise down the stretch.  
ASHTON HAGANS: You know, when I was driving in the lane, they wasn't
collapsing on me, so I just had a wide-open lane, so I took that. But even if
they was, I would just kick it out and give my teammates the ball, and if I
was getting to the line I was knocking down some big time free throws. EJ did
the same, as well, and Jemarl make some big-time baskets and we just came out
with the win.  
  
Q. Just the defense on Fletcher --  
JOHN CALIPARI: First of all, let me talk, you guys haven't asked Jemarl Baker
a question, but let me just tell you, I said it after the game, we coach every
kid like they're a starter. That's how they're trained, every one of these
kids. And I keep saying, we don't know who's going to be a star. What he did
today defensively, he made a basket or two and we needed them. What he did
defensively meant he was prepared for this moment. Immanuel didn't play as
well and he had been playing really well, but you know what, this happens.
Today Keldon didn't play as well so we had to go and say, are you ready, and
he's like, I'm ready. And so I'm proud of that, and it's hard.  
  
I mean, these kids, I told you before, what they go through, what they hear,
what's thrown at them, and staying the course, I just appreciate the kind of
kids we have and the kind of families they come from.  
  
I don't know what you asked me, but go ahead.  
  
Q. Defense on Fletcher Magee.  
JOHN CALIPARI: What we did was we were never going to go under any screen. The
bigs were going to help as long as they had to. We hoped our length would
bother them. But we also knew we were just as afraid of Hoover, and he goes 6
for 9, 4 for 5 from the three. We talked about one, but we said the other one
is an assassin, too. He just throws darts out there.  
  
Again, but it was the effort and energy, and my hope is they got a little worn
down because these guys did not stop. They just chased, and they knew they
couldn't let up in this game or they were going to score baskets because it's
how they play.  
  
Q. Cal, any relief in getting to the Sweet 16? That's what you're
supposed to do.  
JOHN CALIPARI: Who told you that? (Laughter).  
  
No, here's what I would say to you: In this profession I'm in, if winning is a
relief, it's time to retire. Now, I may not be showing it right now, but I
danced in that locker room. I am ecstatic when my team wins, and when we
didn't finish the game off like we normally have, maybe it's because PJ is not
playing, but no, there's no -- I don't think that way, and I don't -- I just
want my team in the hunt. I want them playing at their best. What I told them
prior to the game, roll to your training, then you don't have to think about
the moment, the other team, the NCAA -- just you know how we're training you,
just play to the training, 40 minutes of unbelievable energy. If you're not
there, sub yourself. I said, I know if you get subbed you think you're not
going back in. We've only got eight guys. We can't even practice. So if you
take yourself out, you're going to go back in. We don't have enough guys.  
  
But it's hard because they don't -- if I'm on the floor, I may get another
shot. We're just a bunch of young guys coming together. I do believe they're
still getting better. I do believe that. Tyler didn't make shots today, and we
still win.  
  
What happened to us in the first half, there were no willing passers on my
team. No one was a willing passer. An extra bounce, they would collapse
defensively, they'd tried to shoot it anyway. They'd collapse and I'd go an
extra bounce so now it made it hard. The pass is thrown to me, the guy is in
the corner, I shoot it anyway. He's open. That was our whole first half. So
hopefully we'll be able to break down the tape and say, going forward, this
can't be you. I mean, they made us play the way they played. Give them credit.
And if they hit a normal amount of threes, they'd probably beat us. Thank
goodness they didn't.  
  
Q. Coach, I know we mentioned PJ was out; how impressed were you with
the young guys stepping up? Got off to a slow start offensively but they
rallied back and fought hard.  
JOHN CALIPARI: I was really impressed but I was happy for Nick. Every player
you have, you know how hard they're working. You know what a good person they
are, so you want them to do well, but you can't do it for them, and you can
wish all you want, but at the end of the day, they've got to go in and
perform. I can't build their confidence. They have to build their own
confidence. Well, you take them out. Well, if they're not playing hard and
they're not playing with great energy, then yeah, I will take them out. It's
not about missed shots. You're going to have some turnovers, but if you're not
competing, if you don't come up -- I had to take EJ out. There was a rebound
late. That could have cost us the game. He let the guy run -- you're out.
Well, you take me out. I'm trying to win the game. Get that ball, and we win
this game. So there's things like that that I'm not going to budge on.  
  
But happy for them.  
  
I thought Ashton just has a will to win, and I come back, you see him make
every free throw, and then you say to yourself, he should probably shoot
perimeter shots better. Again, it's mental. Get in the gym more, build your
own confidence, make a couple in the game, which he has this year. Last couple
he's not made shots. He's got to get in this week and get ready for this
weekend.  
  
Q. I missed what you said at the beginning about Baker, but Hero and
Baker, two guys you recruited, known coming in as shooters. Both played
excellent defense today. Can you talk about their defense?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, and I worried about putting Tyler on Magee, and I worried
about it because I didn't want to wear him out because we need his offense
because PJ is not playing. So we need to go to him and get him to make some
baskets. But if he's running around with Magee, running in circles, running
out, dribble hand-off, get being bumped, screen down, we'll do that, like
every possession, do it 12 straight possessions. It's like being an offensive
lineman in football. And so I worried about it, but he said, Coach, I'll be
fine. Well, obviously probably took away from his shots and he missed some
shots that we've all seen him make. But I've never been afraid to put Jemarl
in because of his defense. Even his rebounding, he'll go after balls, just got
make some shots. He or Immanuel, if they are making shots, like Immanuel is
kind of taking a step back this weekend, we'll take a step up next weekend.
You're going to get your chance. Get ready, get yourself mentally ready and go
play. But our guard play was good defensively, shaky offensively.  
  
Q. How did you have to adjust for the way Wofford was attacking you on
the offensive and defensive glass?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, you know, what happened on a couple is that our bigs
helped and we didn't crack down and they got some offensive rebounds. I
believe we out-rebounded them 30 to -- yeah, we out-rebounded them by six, and
we're a pretty good rebounding team. But offensively we were trying to get to
the glass to get some tip-ins because we thought we could, and defensively
you've got to fight like crazy because all of them from Jackson and all their
other big guys, they attacked that glass.  
  
Q. How important was it to have a guy like Reid Travis with his
experience, with a stable presence at both ends of the floor? He's had a long
career to this moment.  
JOHN CALIPARI: He trained his whole life for this. Before the last game, I
just told him, you've been waiting for this your whole life, and yesterday he
was unbelievable, had eight of nine or whatever he did, 18 points, and today
he did well again, and every time we needed a basket to separate, we were
throwing it to him. And just once he didn't get something. Every other one was
either a basket or a pass-out.  
  
But let me say this, what a pleasure it's been to coach him. He is truly
professional in how he deals with everything, from training to weight training
to keeping his body right to being where he's supposed to on time. People that
have come in my gym and watched us coach said that kid never takes his eyes
off you. He is totally engaged with what you're saying. And I get on him, now.
Like I'm on him like I am these young kids. I just don't have to as much
because his is never effort. Theirs is always effort. His is never effort.
It's like some other things he may do, and basically it's revert back some.  
  
But it's been -- I've loved it, and I would say that what's -- he's helped us,
but he's helped himself in this. He's really put himself in a great position.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

### [Tony Benford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36821)

### [Tremont Waters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34356)

### [Skylar Mays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32814)

### [Naz Reid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36822)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
LSU - 69, Maryland - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you're heading to the Sweet 16.  
  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, I'll tell you what, I'm really proud of my guys. Really
came out and executed our game plan. I thought Coach Bill Armstrong who had
the scout did a great job. But these guys took the game plan to the floor. We
knew it was going to be a paint game. We wanted to attack the paint and
protect the paint and the I thought we did that in the first half. We did a
good job pushing it in transition, Tre did and Sky. We played inside-outside,
but second half got a little stagnant, I give credit to Mark, he made a good
adjustment there but my guys, these guys made big plays. Great players make
great plays and they made plays and that's why we're moving on.  
  
Q. Tremont, just describe the last play. Was it designed to do exactly
the way it happened?  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, we wanted to pretty much hold the ball, take the last
shot and not shoot the ball too quick so they wouldn't have a chance to clear
on the other end and put up a shot. So Coach Benford and the coaching staff
and actually my teammates said they wanted me to take the shot, so we just
held the ball out, Naz came and set a screen and I made a play.  
  
Q. Tremont, can you just describe the feeling of being able to do that
in that moment, and where exactly were you on the dog pile near the bench
afterwards, and just what that feels like? You don't see a whole lot of dog
piles in basketball.  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, well, I was in the bottom of the dog pile, and just the
feeling, it feels amazing. To have a great support system behind me and my
teammates, my coaching staff, and all the fans that were here, to give me the
confidence to go out and make a play like that is a very humbling feeling, and
I'm going to continue to do everything I can to help this team win and just
keep pushing for my guys.  
  
Q. Tony, what went into the choice of having Tre being the guy on that
last possession there?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, it was a play that we run. We've run it a few times during
the year. We knew against man and zone, especially against that three-two, we
had to do a great job of screening that top guy, the three-two, and we told
Naz, whoever is up there if they're in the zone, just screen that guy and put
a body on him, and Naz did a great job and Tre -- and great players make great
plays, and he made a great play.  
  
Q. Naz, can you talk about your battle today with Fernando and Stix and
what your relationship is with those guys off the court?  
NAZ REID: Fernando, he's huge. The game plan was really good. Try to get him
off the glass. If I don't get the rebound, at least one of my teammates will,
and I mean, he's one big guy. It was really, really hard. And Stix, he's a
tremendous player. We've played together, played against each other since
seventh grade, so I've known him for a while. He played a great battle today,
and I give props to both of them.  
  
Q. With everything this team has been through, can you talk a little bit
about what this means for you personally and for the team to get to a Sweet 16
after all this?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, it's huge for these guys. They're the ones that paid the
price. They've been through a lot. We know the story of adversity these guys
have gone through, losing obviously Wade at the beginning of the year. We
started and then obviously with Coach not being here with us. I give it to
these guys. They have taken ownership of this team. It's about these guys.
These threes guys here and the rest of those guys, they trust each other and
respect each other, they love each other, and when you have a team like that,
you have a chance to win games, and that's why we're able to keep moving on.  
  
Q. Coach Calipari was mentioning the reason why the SEC got so many
teams in and was doing so well is because of the number of close games
everybody seemed to be involved in. You guys had seven overtime games this
year, you had this game. Is there any end of game situation or any second half
situation at this point that you guys feel like you can't handle?  
SKYLAR MAYS: No, I won't say so. We prepare for it. The coaches do a great job
of putting us in adverse situations in practice with the six-minute games that
we do and we'll start the six minutes down seven, and usually when it applies
to the game we're not in that type of situation where it's not as bad so we
feel like we're prepared for it and we can figure out a way to win, and we've
been able to do that this year.  
  
Q. Naz, all the highlights, when this tournament is over and they play
the One Shining Moment, it's probably going to show the move Tremont made to
the basket to win the game. May not necessarily remember that Skylar made two
free throws and knocked down a three, and he is the guy I hear is sort of the
calming guy on this team. Can you talk about the five points he scored, the
two free throws plus the three ball that kind of set the tone for what
happened at the end?  
NAZ REID: I mean, Sky makes plays like that per usual, so for us, it was like
something we've seen every day. He's very good at it, and just keeping calm is
something he does -- he keeps the coaching staff calm, the players calm. He's
a calm player who can get through adversity and do anything he can do at any
moment by doing that.  
  
Q. Coach Benford, the first half it seemed like you guys were totally in
control offensively, all of your plays and sets were going through. In the
second half they threw the zone at you. How difficult was that to keep your
guys' composure and take good shots down the stretch?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, I thought we did execute. These guys did a great job of --
like I said, Coach Bill Armstrong had the scout and he did a great job of
preparing those guys with the scouting report and we wanted to attack the
paint, like I said earlier, and we wanted to push them in transition. The
problem with pushing in transition is that we had to get rebounds and those
guys are pretty tough to keep off the glass. But we were able to do that, Tre
was able to get a great push, and we were able to get some easy baskets in
transition so we were able to extend the lead. But I give Mark -- he made a
great adjustment. We knew they were going to run the three-two and we had
worked on it, but when you don't have but a day to prepare, it's tough. You've
got to make shots. At the end of the day, I don't care what zone, you got to
make shots, but we made a couple adjustments and Skylar made some plays for
us.  
  
Q. Tony, when they called the tech on Mark and you get two foul shots,
you go up 15 and I guess a team can go in two ways, but Maryland seemed to
make that a turning point for them. Is it interesting how that can work?  
TONY BENFORD: No, I've been doing this 28 years at this level. I've seen it
work. They did a good job of -- again, he changed his defense because they
couldn't guard us in man. My guys were really executing. But I thought when
they made the change, we got stagnant, didn't make shots, and they made shots
and did a good job. So I give Maryland credit.  
  
Q. When they went to that zone, you had a pretty good stretch there
where you guys were just settling for deep balls there and there were a couple
of time-outs in that stretch. Are you trying to hammer home in that --  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, good question, because the thing I told our guys, even man
or zone, because we knew we talked about it before the game, that they run --
I don't care if it's man or zone or three-two, we've still want to attack the
paint. And I thought we got away from it. Our movement wasn't very good. We
called a couple plays out of the time-out and scored, but then I thought
sometimes we settled too much. But at the end of the day, you've got to make
shots, and we made the big one at the end.  
  
Q. I think you only had six in the second half, but overall you
outscored them 26-13 off the bench. Talk about the advantage that your bench
gave you today?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, we have eight starters. I think we have the best eight
players in the country when you watch us play. We have eight starters. All
those guys have been in the starting lineup all year. They've all made plays
and really contributed. Bring Emmitt Williams off the -- he can start for
anybody in the country. Darius Days, he can start for anybody in the country,
Javonte Smart -- so we got eight starters and all those guys can make plays.  
  
I knew Darius would play well. He didn't play -- we didn't play him -- it was
our fault we didn't play him as much. We should have played him more and I
told him to be ready and being here in Florida, he did a great job here in
front of his family.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the personalities on this team? Obviously two
big closers you saw there down the stretch with Skylar before that and Tremont
now?  
TONY BENFORD: I tell you what, I think Skylar Mays is one of the most
underrated players in the country. We know what he does in the classroom, 4.0
student, scholar-athlete, but anyway, he's a heck of a player, too. I think
because he's so smart, people forget how good of a basketball player he is.
But he made some huge plays, and to do that -- Wayde Sims was like a brother
to him. Those guys grew up, and he's -- I know Wade is watching over us. But
then Tremont is just a player. I mean, he's a guy that makes plays, and I
don't know how he got through that shot with all those big guys in there, and
he made it, but the basketball gods were watches over us today.  
  
Q. 5 and 2 in overtime games and two of the victories were against
tournament teams, one of the losses, you split with Florida, which is a
tournament team, and FSU, who's a tournament team. What makes these kids tough
at the end of the game?  
TONY BENFORD: That's a great question. We went 5-1 in the league and we played
six overtimes in the SEC, the best league in the country in my opinion. I
think what it is, it's the closeness of this group. They're not afraid of the
moment. We sit there in the huddle, we do a three-minute game, we weren't
playing as well as we needed to, and Skylar just said, Coach, Coach, we're
going to be okay, we're going to win this game.  
  
And so I just think that these guys -- we got multiple guys that can make
plays off the bounce, then you've got Naz that can score inside, so when
you've got guys that can make plays and believe they can go make a play any
time regardless of the situation, it makes the job easier as a coach and you
have a chance to win close games.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [Fletcher Magee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36915)

### [Cameron Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36916)

### [Matthew Pegram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36917)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. Being that you guys are a small school like Wofford, what mentality
are you guys adapting, taking on a powerhouse like Kentucky heading into this
match-up?  
MATTHEW PEGRAM: I would say that our non-conference prepared us for that every
year. We play a pretty hard non-conference. We play against a lot of big
schools. Go into it like any other game: Get the game plan from the coaches,
go out, play as hard as we can, see what happens.  
  
Q. Fletcher or Cameron, for people who don't know Wofford, where it is,
what kind of school it is, I guess we can look on Wikipedia and see it's not
exactly a huge enrollment, probably the smallest school in the tournament, to
a national audience what would you say about Wofford, and is this kind of
match-up intriguing to you guys? Obviously Kentucky is kind of on this whole
different level as the elite of college basketball, and just getting a chance
to go against them?  
CAMERON JACKSON: I mean, Wofford College is a special place. It's a small,
tight-knit community where you know everybody. We have professors here that
will greet us after the games in the hotel. That just shows the type of game
that we go to school at.  
  
And as far as it being us playing a powerhouse school like Kentucky, we are
excited about doing that. I mean, it doesn't get much better than playing
teams like Kentucky. You dream of that as a kid, being on that team, being on
a smaller school, playing against that team. So all of this is just a dream
come true.  
  
Q. Following that up, before you were recruited by Wofford, how many of
you did not know where Wofford was? And then also, when you tell people you
play for Wofford, do you still have to tell them where it is?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I did not know exactly where Wofford was until I went up
and visited it. But I can say that it actually is a great place. It's like one
of the best kept secrets. You don't know what it is, and when you get there,
it's awesome.  
  
CAMERON JACKSON: Yeah, I hadn't heard of it, either. I'm from Virginia, and
didn't really know much about schools in South Carolina, especially not the
smaller schools in South Carolina, but it's become home for me.  
  
MATTHEW PEGRAM: I'm the oddball out, I grew up in South Carolina and had a lot
of connections to Wofford, so I knew all about it my whole career, so that was
actually an offer I was really excited to get, and it all worked out.  
  
Q. Fletcher and all you guys, do you ever think you're playing against
this Kentucky team with all these NBA prospects and stuff that if you play
well or beat them that you could help yourself in the eyes of NBA scouts and
stuff like that?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I think that that's something that you try to block out
and ignore as much as you can. Getting the chance to go against great
competition is always a great chance for you to prove yourself, but to think
about -- you don't want to get out of character and try to do things that you
can't do or do things that you're uncomfortable doing just to try to show that
you can do something. We want to stay within ourselves, play our game, and we
feel that if we do that, we can be right there and we can compete with them.  
  
Q. Fletcher, how much do you really pay attention to the economy of your
shooting, meaning that taking -- even though some people might perceive some
of the shots you take as low-percentage shots but you do work on them, how
much do you pay attention to the fact that you're scoring well above one point
for every shot and free throw above what you've attempted in your career? And
as a follow-up, does it really bother you that much that your younger brother
is taller than you?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: To the first part of the question, absolutely. He's only 14,
and he's probably two inches taller than me, so I wish I had two those inches
on me.  
  
But to the second part, it's something that I've gotten used to, just as far
as like a lot of people thinking that it's a bad shot or an inefficient shot.
But you know, like you said, when you look at the points per possession or
percentages and getting to the numbers, analytics, you can see that I make
them at an efficient enough rate for it to be good shot for our team. So I
think when you look at it that way, it all works out and it's not a bad shot.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, you were probably 14, 13 years old when Jimmer
Fredette of BYU was really lighting it up nationally. Did you pay much
attention to his game, and is there any approach from you that even resembles
anything of what he did?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: I actually didn't pay attention too much to him. I do remember
when they played Florida in the NCAA Tournament, just growing up in Florida. I
was watching that, and I remember he had a great game against them and pulled
up from deep probably three or four times and made it on them. So I knew that
he was a great player and a great shooter.  
  
Just him being out west and at BYU, I didn't really get the chance to watch a
lot of his games and that kind of stuff, though.  
  
Q. How would you guys describe the style of offense you guys play, how
much of a green light you have, how much dependence on three-point shooting?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: I think that we're actually a very balanced offense. Cam,
Matt, Keve, a lot of our bigs are really good back-to-the-basket post scorers.
A lot of people like to talk about all the threes that we shoot and stuff, but
if it wasn't for them drawing in the defense, a lot of times we wouldn't be
open for those threes. Playing inside out can definitely open it up. I think
that we're pretty balanced because we can shoot the ball really well, but we
can also pound it inside with our bigs and have them go to work.  
  
I feel like it's a good balance between that.  
  
Q. Fletcher, you broke the record last night; how big was that moment
for you and for your career and for everything that you've done? And the
second question is you take a high degree of difficulty of shots; how is your
practice regimen with those?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: To the first question, I think I've said this before. I think
when I look back on it when I'm older, I'll definitely think about that game
and how special and everything it was. But in the moment, just trying to --
just do whatever to win, to think about winning an NCAA Tournament game, that
was just the main goal, and that was what was on my mind.  
  
But to the second part, I think that the practice regimen, I think that you
try to practice shots that you know you're going to shoot in games, so if I
know that I'm going to shoot an off-balance shot going this way or off-balance
shot going that way, I'm going to practice those type of shots so I can get a
feel for it, and I feel like that's kind of what's enabled me to shoot those
kind of shots.  
  
Q. Fletcher already talked about the play on the bigs, so I want to ask
Cameron and Matthew. Kentucky feels pretty good about their size advantage.
How do you kind of prove that they're wrong to think that way tomorrow?  
CAMERON JACKSON: I think we just take care of what we can take care of. It's
not really about proving them wrong. It's about doing what we're comfortable
doing and making the impact on the game that we can, the way that we impact
the game on a daily basis, getting the ball to the shooters, rebounding. But
it's not really about proving them wrong, it's about taking care of what we
can take care of.  
  
MATTHEW PEGRAM: I think he said it best right there.  
  
Q. Cameron, can you talk about what athletic trainer Alyss Hart does on
a daily basis to get you ready to go, what she means to you, and is she right
when she says you're kind of high maintenance?  
CAMERON JACKSON: Me personally or the team? Okay, I don't think that I'm
necessarily high maintenance. I think that might be a little bit of a stretch.
But no, Alyss is the best. She's taken care of me throughout my five years.
I've had a few injuries where I've needed her to just really take care of me
and tell me what I need to do, and she's always very upfront with me about
what's wrong. She tells me if I'm being soft. She tells me -- like she keeps
it really straight with me, so I'm able to know what I can and can't do. She
doesn't sugarcoat anything, and she just tries to just get me ready. She's
meant the world to me over the past five years. I've grown close to her
through the experience.  
  
Q. Cameron, just curious, Fletcher has taken a certain amount of grief
from his family about his haircut. I'm just wondering if you guys have needled
him about not having sort of a defined hair style, like it's a little bit
short of crew cut but not really a crew cut, and then a little bit longer but
not -- doesn't seem to be defined. I'm just wondering if you guys needle him
about that at all?  
CAMERON JACKSON: No, not really. We just let him do his thing. His hair
doesn't really matter when the ball goes in, so I don't carry care how he cuts
it. He could be bald tomorrow and I'll still be happy for him, as long as he's
hitting shots.  
  
Q. Mike, I know your conference is good, but you've also been able to
schedule some Power Five non-conference games over the past few years
especially. You've had some success. How much does that help you for a moment
like tomorrow, and then on the second part of that, with some conferences
moving to 20 and 22-game regular seasons, do you fear that scheduling those
games is going to become more difficult for a school like yours?  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah, I do. I'm not sure that that bigger schedule with the Power
Fives is going to last. They did it for RPI, NET for those ramifications, for
that pop in those numbers, and I don't think those numbers are improving. I
don't. Maybe I'm wrong. Time will tell after a couple of years.  
  
But so much emphasis put now on strength of schedule, I'm not having any
trouble yet in getting those games. May not be the games I want, I'm going to
go to Duke next year, but I do like those games, and I do like challenging our
team in November and December, and I think that pays huge dividends once you
get into league play.  
  
We may get our ears pinned back tomorrow, but it will not be because my team
is intimidated. We went to Phog Allen Fieldhouse. We had North Carolina at
home, Oklahoma, very, very good. You know, there is a method to the madness. I
do -- our non-league schedule is always really hard.  
  
We had the opportunity to -- we had nine non-league games at home, which can
be hard for teams at our level in our league, but yeah, we do that for a
number of reasons.  
  
Q. From the time you've been there, how much sort of less obscure is the
identity of Wofford now than it was when you first got there? And then as a
follow-up, when you're recruiting a kid, assuming it's not in the immediate
Spartanburg area, how often when you say, "I'm the coach at Wofford", do you
basically have to say where Wofford is?  
MIKE YOUNG: I came there in '89, and I can remember vividly a good friend of
mine, also an assistant, I can't tell you how many times -- this is before
answering machines and cell phones, that we'd have to spell our name. I
remember calling a school in Charlotte, like for God's sake, you're an hour
away, you've never heard of Wofford, really? Of course I say that, in '88 I
came down and interviewed for the job, and I had never heard of Wofford.  
  
The NCAA Tournament and this platform has helped our identity, what our
program has accomplished over the last 10 years. We've gotten a lot better,
and especially in the areas that we've recruited really, really hard - the
great state of Minnesota, Chicago, Illinois, Madison, Wisconsin. Our name
recognition has gotten better and better and better, and certainly this
experience will help even more.  
  
I'm still trying -- I had to correct a gentleman out here in the hallway. If I
hear one of you say "Woe-ford", I'm going to come after you. It's Wofford.
Wofford, all right? It's spelled W-o-f-f-o-r-d. It's pronounced W-a-f-f-o-r-d,
isn't it, Todd? We're making great progress, but still, work to be done.  
  
Q. Some of the players spoke also about non-conference kind of molding
them for the match-up tomorrow. Talk about everyone's mentality and the
attitude of the players as a whole right now.  
MIKE YOUNG: It's a different deal tomorrow. We're playing the Wildcats of
Kentucky, and I can't wait. I have such great admiration for Coach Calipari
and what he's done at UMass and Memphis and now here at Kentucky. It'll be a
wonderful day for our team and our players.  
  
I can't imagine a team more confident, and that's earned. We haven't lost
since December 19th, and of the four losses, they're all playing in the NCAA
Tournament this weekend, and I know North Carolina, Oklahoma -- Oklahoma was
up big. I think they all four won their first-round game. And those were all
good games. We were tied or trailed by a couple at the eight-minute mark at
Kansas, and the wheels came off. The wheels can come off and have come off for
a lot of people in that building.  
  
You know, so again, they may whip our tail, but it will not be because my kids
are scared. They'll come out ready to fight.  
  
Q. You mentioned your respect for Coach Calipari. Obviously they have a
bunch of NBA prospects --  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah.  
  
Q. I think they have three guys projected in the current draft, per
ESPN. How much of an opportunity is that for your fellas, if they play well to
impress some NBA scouts, get on the radar, help themselves long-term?  
MIKE YOUNG: They understand. We haven't said anything about it. You think
Fletcher Magee understands that, embraces that? You're darned right. Cameron
Jackson is on a lot of people's radar. Size is not ideal. I do think that
he'll make a lot of money in Europe, if he chooses to do that, and I think he
will.  
  
You know, again, I've said before, this is the NCAA Tournament. This is the
greatest tournament on earth, and to perform and play against PJ Washington -
I hope - Reid Travis, play well and play a good ball game certainly would help
those guys immensely.  
  
Q. You talked about playing some of these other big programs. How much
of the mystique does it kind of take out of tomorrow's game having to face a
blue blood like Kentucky?  
MIKE YOUNG: You know what, I don't know the answer to that. I don't know the
answer to that. I know this, it doesn't take any mystique away from my
feelings going into it. Way back, I remember sitting and listening to that AM
radio station through the Carolinas and Virginia and Kentucky, West Virginia
and listening to Cawood Ledford and that '78 team, and those were great, great
-- are great, great memories. To strap it on tomorrow and walk out there and
face UK, I mean, that's a highlight. That will be a highlight for my team.
That'll be something they'll never forget.  
  
Q. For the people who haven't seen your team play or seen them play a
little bit and think you're just a bunch of little guys who fire up three-
point shots, what can you say about your team in terms of why they're here
today?  
MIKE YOUNG: I've said it a thousand times, and I believe it with every fiber
of my body, we've got a really, really good team. We do have a lot of guys
that can crank it. We also have a young man in the post in Cameron Jackson
that can score on a lot of people, and he's done it repeatedly throughout his
career. We had a kid that's kind of come into his own this year. He's not
going to score a lot, but he's going to block a shot, he's going to rebound
the ball in Keve Aluma, came off the bench with a couple of kids that have
helped us win a number of games.  
  
You know, I hate to get into all this, but we are ranked nationally for a
purpose. That NET, that evaluation tool, whatever, that we were 13th or 12th
in the country, you know, so that's not you guys just throwing numbers out
there. I mean, that's where it is. Our analytics and metrics and all that
stuff are really, really good.  
  
Q. I get the feeling that you don't really embrace the small school
versus big school --  
MIKE YOUNG: I hate it.  
  
Q. That enrollment has nothing to do with the roster. What are your
thoughts on that?  
MIKE YOUNG: What's UK have, 35,000 undergraduate students? We've got 1,600.
So? We've got really good players. Kentucky has got really good players. Let's
go play.  
  
I tire of the mid-major and the little guy and all this stuff. Come on, man.
You know, we have good players that are serious and love competing. They're
all going to graduate, and they're all going to be productive citizens. That
wears on me a little bit. Could you tell?  
  
Q. One of the coaches that came through Rupp Arena this year, I believe
it may have been North Dakota, said he went to Lowe's and bought snow shovels
to replicate the length of Kentucky. How unique is that compared to other
challenges you're going to face?  
MIKE YOUNG: I was just in awe when I saw them yesterday. I made the mistake
before our game, I went out and watched them play Abilene Christian a little
bit. I wished I hadn't have done that. Goodness gracious, they're just
enormous.  
  
They're not going to do anything different. We played North Carolina the last
two years, and, you know, it's who you're competing against. We can't do
anything differently offensively. We are who we are. We're not going to do
anything offensively or defensively. We're pretty locked into what we hope to
do. It's certainly more challenging with their size and 3's size on the
perimeter is impressive and Herro is a 2 guard at 6'5", Hagans is a nice
looking young man who's a lead guard.  
  
I was concerned about Powell and Cale. Those guys last night looked like
boxers. But they'll figure it out. Let it rip.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Darryl Morsell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36986)

### [Eric Ayala](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36987)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Give us a review of yesterday, looking at how that game went
yesterday. What did you take away and what can you do moving forward after
practice today to get ready for this game tomorrow? What's the biggest
takeaway from that game for you guys?  
  
ERIC AYALA: You know, just staying resilient throughout a game. There's a lot
of ups and downs in March Madness, teams go on runs, and just knowing that,
sticking with the game plan and not giving up throughout the game.  
  
Q. Darryl, you hit some big shots down the stretch; how was it important
for the team and for your confidence moving forward in the tournament?  
DARRYL MORSELL: It was big. It helped my confidence moving forward, but these
guys also gave me confidence throughout the game. At the beginning of the game
I was missing some layups and stuff. Defensively I was struggling against the
kid on Belmont, but these guys kept me confident, and it helped me, and that's
why I had success in the later parts of the game.  
  
Q. Darryl and Eric, you're big men, you two guys will match up against
Naz and Kavell for them --  
ERIC AYALA: It's definitely going to be a battle in the paint. I think our
guys are ready for the challenge. I don't think maybe we've faced a team with
that kind of interior presence this year. It's going to be a fun being able to
see how well our big men match up against theirs, and the best shall prevail
to the end.  
  
Q. Darryl, in terms of finding a comfort zone and finding your role this
year, how hard is that to do when you don't necessarily have a designated
position?  
DARRYL MORSELL: I really don't think it's that hard. At the end of the day,
it's basketball, something I've been playing my entire life. So whether I have
to play point guard for a possession or if I have to play power forward or
whatever I've got to do to help the team win, that's kind of my role. My role
is to be that guy who can play multiple positions, guard multiple positions,
score and stuff like that just to help the team win.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, you had a meeting beginning of the year with the
coach, I think after the first game, and you had a normal conversation with
him later in the year talking about turnovers, and since then I think you've
committed one turnover in like four games. I don't know if the timing of it is
exactly that, but what do those meetings with Coach do for you in terms of how
you can sort of refocus and get an understanding of what is expected?  
DARRYL MORSELL: Coach kind of talked to me about being a leader. We've got a
young team. I'm a sophomore, but I'm one of the older guys on the court most
of the time. So rather than just leading with my voice, he wanted me to lead
more by example, which I kind of focus in on protecting the ball, trying to
defend as best I can, and just stop trying to make like the home run play and
stuff like that, and just have confidence in my guys. I'm just trying to lead
by example and just help the younger guys throughout this process.  
  
Q. LSU is a team that wants to turn you over, get out in transition. You
all have been doing better with turnovers recently coming off a season low.
How do you keep that up and keep the ball in the half court?  
DARRYL MORSELL: Just continue to do what we're doing. Slow down, let the game
come to us. We've improved in the double-team in the post. Our guards, we're
getting older, we're getting more experience. We done seen pretty much every
defense throughout the year, so just with this experience and just improving
in the double-team and stuff, that's why I feel like we've found our success,
and we've got to continue that.  
  
Q. Eric, talk about Darryl and -- he talked about his toughness, and how
does that translate to guys like Stix, who sometimes can be passive, and just
sort of giving the team more of an identity that way?  
ERIC AYALA: Of course Stix and Darryl have played together throughout high
school, and I'm pretty sure they look to each other as far as like
comfortability out there on the court, just being around each other and
knowing that they've got each other's backs. But Darryl is somebody I look to
as far as being that tough guy out there. He carries that mentality on and off
the court, and it spreads throughout the team. When we need it, it's brought,
and it's a key thing for us.  
  
Q. Darryl, you and Bruno came in as a much smaller freshman class and
are now the leaders. What did you guys learn that year and how have you guys
helped lead this younger group?  
DARRYL MORSELL: Last year me and Bruno played a lot as freshmen, so we seen
everything. We seen tough environments, like in road games. We seen great
teams. We played against a lot of great teams last year. Just through that, we
just learned. We just learned, gained knowledge. So coming into this year,
we've prepared for everything. We knew what to expect. We knew how to approach
the off-season and stuff like that. And just our approach rubbed off on the
younger guys. These guys came in hungry, every single one of them, and they've
done well, and I just hope they continue their success.  
  
MARK TURGEON: Obviously we're excited. We were excited yesterday sitting up on
this stage to win a game, and just to be a part of a game like that yesterday
where the atmosphere is terrific, game is back and forth, two really good
teams that I thought played well, took care of the ball, executed at a high
level, and that was terrific. And for my young team, seven of our top eight
players being freshmen and sophomores, it was not only good to help us have
confidence tomorrow but as those kids grow older and hopefully be a part of
more NCAA tournaments down the road.  
  
That said, got a heck of a challenge tomorrow playing I think the most
athletic team in the country, and one through eight, they're really athletic.
Their point guard is terrific, one of the best if not the best in the country
because he can score it and he can really pass it. So it's a tough challenge
for us, but one that we're looking forward to and happy to be a part of.  
  
Q. Tony Benford was in here earlier and he said that he felt the matchup
is in the paint. That's the key match-up. Do you look at that the same, and
what do you see from LSU's big men?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, they're terrific. Got great length. Naz, we recruited him
a little bit. Obviously he's a great player and a great kid, can score a lot
of ways. He can also shoot the three, shoots it well.  
  
I think he's talking about the way Bruno can score for us, Stix around the
basket, the way they can score around the basket and the way both teams can
rebound. I think that's really what he's talking about. There's also some
really good guards on the court tomorrow, too. It's a high-level game. It's a
high-level game with a lot of talent, and should be a fun game to coach in, a
fun game to be a part of.  
  
Q. You mentioned Stix yesterday, I think, and kind of his confidence.
You can almost see which way he's going to go early in a game. How have you
tried to mitigate that and manage that, and do you think he can start piling
up games in a row based on how confidently he played yesterday?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, you'd like to think because if you don't, the season is
over. I think what happened yesterday is sometimes you're in the middle of a
grind of the season, especially when you play in a league like the Big Ten
that was so tough this year, you might hang your head a little bit. Well, you
don't have time to hang your head in this tournament. So if a play didn't go
well, we were really encouraging guys to go on to the next play, and I think
our guys did that yesterday, so I think Stix did it.  
  
Got in foul trouble, bounced back, played through foul trouble, which was
great to see. But he's a terrific player, and we need him to play well.
Doesn't have to play great, but we need him to play well, and I was just
really happy for him yesterday. He came through.  
  
Q. You've talked in the press conferences back in College Park about how
young your team was when they went to Purdue, some of those early games. You
talk about how your relationship has grown with the freshmen and how your team
has aged through the season and are they where you expected them to be?  
MARK TURGEON: Yes. We've gotten a lot better. You throw that tape in right
now, we don't even look the same. And neither does Purdue, obviously.  
  
But we've gotten a lot better. I think what's happened is Bruno, Darryl and
Anthony have really grown, too, as players, and then the young guys in their
own way have come and gone a little bit, whether it's Eric Ayala, who's been
terrific most of the time, Stix has been really good a lot of the time, and
Aaron Wiggins, who's been good a lot of time, too. So they've all grown.  
  
And then guys figured out kind of what their roles are and how they can help
us. A guy like Ricky Lindo just goes in to defend and rebound. He knows that.
If he can get an offensive rebound from a basket, that's big for us.  
  
We've watched them grow. I think they're all comfortable. We never looked at
them as freshmen. I just kept saying how young we were so people could
appreciate what this team is doing, because sometimes you don't do that
because you're so caught up in everything that's going on. But we don't think
we're young anymore. There will be a lot of young guys on the floor tomorrow
for both teams.  
  
But none of them think that way. They've grown. But our sophomore and our
junior, they've grown quite a bit, too.  
  
Q. Anthony yesterday said that he felt like it was a little bit of a
weight off of his shoulders getting that win. Do you hope maybe with that off
of him he can get some shots to start falling?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, you never know, but what I was proud of Anthony is he had
six assists, one turnover, and he did a heck of a job guarding that kid. It
was a heck of a tough match-up, coming off those ball screens all day and
having to get over him.  
  
The good thing is that Anthony got a lot of wide-open shots. That's the great
thing for me as a coach. If he's shooting contested, late shot clock going
down over a hand, we probably don't win that game. He got a lot of really
looks. It's really good for us Anthony was 3 for 18. We scored 79 points.
That's a good sign for us moving forward.  
  
I just hope for him he makes a few shots, but if he doesn't, we'll just have
to try to overcome it again.  
  
Q. Kind of going off that, for you and the team as a whole, do you feel
like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders getting that first win,
getting on the board, ending a bit of a drought and now you can just go
play?  
MARK TURGEON: We don't feel like we're in a drought because it's just this
team. Everybody just wants to make it a drought about what we've done the last
couple years. We don't think that way. Now, unfortunately guys read social
media and it gets in their head a little bit. I don't, as you guys know, so it
doesn't get in my head. But yesterday was huge for us, to get the deflection
and get the steal, one-possession game, goes the other way, we'd have to
answer all those questions all next March. So now we don't have to answer
them, okay.  
  
When you have seven of your eight freshmen and sophomores, I said it early,
it's going to help us moving forward for tomorrow and it's going to help us
down the road. That's what was huge about yesterday.  
  
And then for our young guys to play in a game like that, that was an
incredible college basketball game and a great environment, and it moves quick
out there. For them to be a part of that and just -- so like we lost to
Michigan late in the year, and just late in the game they were better than
they were, because they know what the reward is. Those players have been to a
National Championship game. They've had success. We don't know what the reward
is. Now the guys are starting to, "Oh, wow, that was pretty cool."  
  
So that was a great reward, and so now next year when these young guys are
back and we're fighting to get to the tournament or win a conference
championship, they know what the reward is. We didn't know it. We didn't know
it. So that's what was big about yesterday.  
  
Q. With all the improprieties that's going on in college basketball
right now, I can imagine it can be very, very difficult to be a college
basketball coach. You've been doing this a while. Do you find that there's
more camaraderie now among the coaching fraternity? Have you spoken to Coach
Benford at all about what's going on down there, given him any encouragement?
What's your feeling on the mindset now?  
MARK TURGEON: We are a close-knit group, okay. Have I talked to Tony, no. I
just bumped into him when he was leaving the building, but I've known Tony for
a long time. So he's doing a terrific job under the circumstances.  
  
So we are a close-knit group, and that's really what's important. Like it was
such an honor for me yesterday to coach against Rick Byrd. Do you know how
cool that was for me? And I've been doing it a long time. The guy has won 800
games. That was a real honor for me yesterday.  
  
We are close. We all talk. We encourage each other. We really know how hard it
is. Like when I talk to Gary Williams during the season, that's a really good
thing for me because he knows what it's like to be in my shoes. It's hard.
It's a hard business. It's a great business. We love -- that's why we do it,
and we love being in it.  
  
We are a close-knit fraternity, if that answers your question.  
  
Q. You've had a couple of meetings with Darryl over the course of the
season, one early in the year after the opener and I guess he got benched for
one game, and then more recently talking about turnovers. What has he done to
sort of get to where he is right now the last few games, where he's not
turning the ball over, scoring more and still playing really good defense?  
MARK TURGEON: Two things happened: One is total buy-in, okay. So if you don't
totally buy in, and lucky for him, we are a young team. So he was able to keep
his spot through a lot of those mistakes he was making. But he had total buy-
in after the Penn State game. Threw it right to them the first two plays of
the game, they get six points, live ball turnovers. Since then, I don't know
what his assist-turnover was yesterday? 14-1 now in the last four games. So
that's total buy-in.  
  
And I can't remember what game it was, I think it was leading into the
Michigan game, so it was probably that same time, I said Darryl Morsell is
going to guard the best player on the other team. He's our best defender. We
need him to do that. We don't need Darryl to score a lot of points for us,
even though he did yesterday, but he has to defend. So I told him in front of
the whole team. Now, I thought he did a great job on that kid yesterday and he
had 35 or whatever.  
  
So I think that was a big moment for Darryl as far as growing up and maturing,
and just total buy-in. Total buy-in is very important for young people. If
they do that, they usually succeed.  
  
Q. One of the guys on LSU, talking about your team, said that Darryl is
the X factor. Do you agree with that?  
MARK TURGEON: What's that mean? Well, yeah, we'll give him that. We'll call
him the X Man, the X Factor. Yeah, he does all the little things, the dirty
things. He is a big X factor for us. So is Eric Ayala, does a lot of things
for us, really steady.  
  
Yeah, I think it's important. Basically what they're staying is he's not a
superstar but he really helps our team go. Yeah, he's been -- Darryl has been
good. I'm really proud of him the last four games. It's total buy-in on his
part.  
  
Q. I think you mentioned yesterday that your team was feeding off of
people around the country picking Belmont. Is that over? Can you still beat
that drum? Can you still use that as motivation going forward?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, are they picking LSU? I haven't been paying attention, so
hopefully they are and we'll use it.  
  
This time of year you use any motivation you can. Obviously the players are
highly motivated at this time, but there's an edge you've got to get certain
ways. So as a coach you love it when they pick the other team. A lot of guys
picked the other team. That's good for us. But in the end you've got to win
the game. And you've got to play well to win it. We'll see. It's still early.
I don't know what's being said out there, and the game is so early tomorrow,
you're going to wake up and you're going to show up and you're going to play
the game.  
  
Q. I've heard that you are a rather superstitious person. How is that
part of your personality affected by the different schedules and craziness of
the NCAA Tournament?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, it's crazy. I've gotten better, but my sons wanted to come
to shoot-around. I asked them if they came when we beat Hawaii two years ago
and went to a Sweet 16, and they said they were there, so they're here again
today. So a little superstition there.  
  
It is what it is. I've gotten a little bit better with it as time goes on.
I've always been that way since I was a little three- or four- or five-year-
old kid watching my Chiefs or my Royals or my Jayhawks. I was really
superstitious. I had to listen-to-it-on-the-radio-a-certain-way type thing
when I was growing up. It's who I am, I guess.  
  
Q. How does your time as a big-time college point guard affect your
relationship with your guards? What can you tell them about your experiences
that translates to what they see tomorrow?  
MARK TURGEON: I try really hard not to talk about myself. One, I don't think
I'm as good as the point guards that I'm coaching. But I just try to coach
them. When you have such a young team, it's really more about positivity. I've
been more positive this year than I've ever been. I don't know if the players
feel that way or not. But I've had to bite my lip a lot, let some things go,
but I've just really tried with this group to be positive because I knew how
hard our schedule was and how good the league was and how young we were, but
I'd like to think that we've done a good job with our point guards.  
  
I know Eric Ayala likes to hear my voice. It's very important to him. He wants
to relay what I'm saying. I think Matt Brady has been really good for Anthony.
I know Anthony hasn't shot the ball great but Anthony has become a better
basketball player. I think Matt Brady has been good for him. He's really
helped him become a better player.  
  
Q. You mentioned speaking with Gary before, having been in your shoes.
How often do you speak with him? What has your relationship been like since
you've been there? Obviously you've been there a long time, and has it changed
since you first got there?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, it's changed a lot. We've become much better friends. We
probably hang out more in the summer than we do during the season. Gary is a
hands-off guy. He's never going to call me and give me his opinion. If we're
going to talk, it's because I reach out to him.  
  
But he's been around a little bit. This year we had the 100 years of Maryland
basketball, so he's been around a little bit more, so it's always great. I
love when he's around. Early this year he came to a couple practices, helped
us with some things. We had a staff meeting at my house. He came, spent a few
hours with us. It was really cool to see. Just to get him back around it.  
  
But I look forward to hanging out at the beach with him this summer. Should be
a lot of fun.  
  
Q. You kind of touched upon Coach Benford for a second, but can you kind
of imagine -- it's not what he signed up for, to be pushed in the forefront
like this at a time like this and the pressure of winning in the postseason,
can you put yourself in his shoes and what that's like to go through?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, because I've been a head coach for 21 years and every time
you step out in an NCAA Tournament game it's a lot. He's handled it great.
He's been a head coach before. He's been around a long time. He's been around
a lot of great coaches. He's doing a terrific job. He's got a really, really
good team, and they really look like they're together and sticking together
and playing well together.  
  
I thought he did a great job yesterday. That was a tough game. Yale was
really, really good, and I thought he did a great job preparing them, and
he'll do the same for tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. In terms of Anthony taking his shots, last night it looked like he
took good shots, they just weren't falling. You said similar things about Melo
during his team where if he has a tough shooting night, you thought the next
one was going to go in. Is there a difference now with the team that you have
and especially this year's team, when you have such potentially dominant
players inside, which you didn't necessarily have for most of Melo's time
there, with Anthony, and whether it's an open shot, do you still want him to
take a look inside first?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, I think we play inside out. They were just doubling Bruno
all night, so it made it tough, but Bruno still had a double-double, I
believe. And we made the right reads. The key thing is that Anthony took good
shots. He had to rush a couple late shot clock, you know, but he missed three
or four lay-ups, missed five wide-open threes. Those are great shots. I mean,
for a heck of a player.  
  
For him personally, I just want him to make a few, okay. But the great thing
is it didn't affect his game yesterday. He was terrific.  
  
We share it. We went to Stix. We went to Bruno. We tried to get Aaron Wiggins
involved. We ran plays for Eric Ayala yesterday to get him going. So we're
sharing the wealth. But a lot of times the ball gravitates back to your best
players late in the shot clock, and it does, but we overcame it, and it was a
big relief for all of us.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: First impressions of this Wofford team? Did you guys watch the
game yesterday, and what do you think of the Terriers?  
  
JEMARL BAKER JR.: I mean, I didn't watch the game but I know they can shoot
the ball really well, and I just know we have to guard the three in order to
win the game.  
  
IMMANUEL QUICKLEY: Yeah, I watched a little bit of the end of the game
yesterday. From what we know, they're a really good three-point shooting team,
so that's probably going to be the main focus of what we do.  
  
Q. Nick, I've got a nice easy question for you: Coach Cal has obviously
recruited New Jersey really well in recent years, you, Karl Towns, Isaiah,
he's got Kahlil Whitney coming next year. What does that say about the talent
level in New Jersey? And have you given Kahlil any kind of words of wisdom
about coming to Kentucky?  
NICK RICHARDS: I mean, I played with Kahlil in high school. I played against
him a couple times. He's pretty athletic, pretty aggressive dude. New Jersey
overall in basketball is kind of taken over from the tri-state area. You can
probably say the high school league from the tri-state area is New Jersey
basketball. That's where all the best teams are. That's where all the best
athletes are.  
  
Q. Talk about Cal getting the best players out of New Jersey.  
NICK RICHARDS: Honestly, I think just overall recruiting that Coach Cal has
done throughout the whole entire country, not just New Jersey, has been really
great. He knows what he wants. He recruits good players, and he gets the
players that he wants.  
  
Q. Immanuel, you were a five-star recruit. How different is this stage
playing in the tournament? Is it more pressure for you? How are you taking
it?  
IMMANUEL QUICKLEY: I don't really see it as pressure. I played in some pretty
big games throughout any whole life. McDonald's game was pretty big, state
championships. NCAA Tournament doesn't compare like a state championship, but
I've been preparing for this my whole life, and it's been a great time being a
part of this.  
  
Q. When the bracket was released on Sunday and you saw that Wofford was
a potential round-of-32 match-up, what was your reaction when you saw it?  
JEMARL BAKER JR.: I didn't really have a reaction. It's our job to get out on
the floor and play as hard as we can and win, no matter who we come up
against, and that's what you have to do to win a National Championship. The
teams that we saw, that didn't really matter to me.  
  
Q. What limited film you may have watched so far on Wofford, just wanted
to get your impressions of Fletcher Magee and whether you've seen a three-
point shooter who seems to be so willing to contort his body to get tough
shots in the smallest of openings and make them with really an uncommon
regularity, what your thoughts are when you see him?  
IMMANUEL QUICKLEY: I think what makes him such a good shooter is he has a lot
of confidence. He also has a really green light, so when you've got that green
light, you know you're going to make some and you're going to miss some. He
lives with it, he's a really good player, and we've just got to be ready for
all that.  
  
Q. Early on in the year, the three-point defense was not one of your
best things that you guys had. Was there a moment this year where the defense
really started to click because Cal was really tough on you guys the first
month or so?  
JEMARL BAKER JR.: I think throughout the year we just have to focus on the
little details of like getting through screens and things like that and they
emphasized defending the three the whole year. In order to -- they just taught
us in order to win games you're going to have to really buckle down and be
able to defend the three, because there's a lot of teams that can shoot the
three.  
  
Q. Immanuel and Nick, you guys, ever since Jemarl showed up on campus,
we've been told he's one of the greatest shooters in the history of mankind.
Can you describe to us how great he is?  
IMMANUEL QUICKLEY: Great question. Jemarl is a great player, not only as a
shooter, he locks up on defense. He's a really good teammate. He's my
roommate, so he's even a better person. But what he does for our team is
great, and he's going to continue to do great things for our team.  
  
Q. Nick, Wofford doesn't start anyone that's taller than 6'9 ". How big
of an advantage is that for you, EJ and Reid?  
NICK RICHARDS: It's a really good advantage for us. They're not really as
athletic as all three of us. Their bigs are really skilled around the basket,
they know how to move on the floor, but we're just better than them overall, I
think, so the advantage is our way, in my opinion.  
  
Q. The SEC went 4-0 yesterday. Tennessee looks like it's going to win
right now. The only loss right now is Ole Miss and Mississippi State is
playing tonight --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Did Ole Miss lose? What was the score?  
  
Q. Not real good, but the SEC has won five out of six games so far.
Could you comment on the state of the conference in this tournament so far?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, we had so many close games in our league, games that were
down to the last two minutes. And you know, it just toughened every team up.
So like you're looking at a bunch of teams that have walked in, and they're
good. Our league is really good. We got seven teams, probably should have had
eight. When you see it -- and I'm disappointed for Mississippi because they
had a heck of a year. I mean, they literally had a heck of a year, and I don't
know why that would have happened. I mean, terrific guards and athletes, and
then Mississippi State is going to play tonight. Who do they play?  
  
Q. Liberty.  
JOHN CALIPARI: Hmm, they're good, too.  
  
Q. As you watch film on Wofford last night, not just about their three-
point shooting overall as a team but Fletcher Magee in particular, could you
talk a little bit about how he seems to not even be fazed about contorting his
body to take shots that other players wouldn't be comfortable taking? And is
there anybody he reminds you of in any way?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, first of all, you've got to give it to Coach Young who
says, you have the green light, now respect it, and I'm going to take some of
these because I know you're going to make some. Then I heard that he is
absolutely in the gym hours on end shooting those shots that you're talking
about, that he's in that gym, which is why the coach says, all the time you're
in there, and that's the shots you're taking, you deserve to be able to do it
in a game.  
  
You try to tell a young team like mine, this isn't football. It's not a
touchdown, so don't foul. Make it hard. He's still going to make some of them.
Make it difficult for 40 minutes. He's still going to make some of them. When
I watched the tape last night, the tapes, and this morning, just a well-
coached -- offensively they do what they need to do to win and they play in a
way that they have to play, their dribble hand-offs. I mean, Jackson from -- I
watched the game early in the year, and then I watch them now, so much better.
They said Nick was in there saying that our bigs are quicker -- what are you
doing, Nick? But that's okay, because like if you speak, now what? You back it
up. So I love his confidence. Now I want to watch you do it. Now get out there
and do it, if you think that.  
  
And I want Nick to be more confident. Not like that, but on the court, more
confident.  
  
Q. The follow-up, does Fletcher Magee remind you of any other three-
point type of shooter?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You know who I saw in him and how he played? I thought -- and
the closest I could get to him is how I used to play (laughter), which is I
just used to shoot every ball like that. And I thought, you know, I saw myself
doing those kind of things, and I know I was rated 41st -- there were 40
college coaches better than me as -- I'll go one-on-one right now; let's go.
You've got guys older than me that said they were better -- come on. I'm just
kidding. Come on.  
  
Q. Reid Travis had 18 points, nine rebounds yesterday. We talked about
Nick came off the bench, eight points, four rebounds. How big are those two
guys going to be?  
JOHN CALIPARI: How about EJ had 11 rebounds? I mean, he played well. And it's
another game that we're going to have to do that. But look, they've got
athletes at the 4 position, and that's if I'm calling Jackson a 5, which I
don't know if he is, that really are long and active and go after it.  
  
They've got their four or five guards who are 1s, 2s and 3s and they've got
five of them that score, a couple of them drive a little bit better, a couple
of them shoot. But they're going to take 25, 26 threes in this game. I don't
care what we do, they're going to take them, and if they're spinning in the
air and they're going in, it's a tough night. I just don't want us to foul
them. And so contest.  
  
Now, the one thing that we do have is we're long, so we can contest without
fouling because of our length. But again, the year -- I called this, I knew
we'd be playing this team, and my team knew, because I told them before, we
would be playing Wofford because you and I know how hard this game will be,
especially with PJ out, how hard a game it'll be for us.  
  
I don't think there's any, like we're a favorite. Come on now, this team is
legitimate in every form and fashion, including defense, including toughness,
including veteran play. Yesterday we started four freshmen. So...  
  
Q. You said PJ out there; is that a official, and do you have any other
update on him?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, I just can't -- what they're going to do at some point is
cut the cast off and say how -- they just thought it would heal faster. I know
there's all this, it's a conspiracy. I'm telling you, it was negative in every
X-ray, MRI. We even did an RIM. It's sprained. But we just -- and you guys
that know me know that I'm overly cautious because it's these kids' careers,
and I get it. I know this, he really wants to play, but I also want to feel
comfortable that if he gets on the court that there's nothing he can do to
himself, and the doctors have pretty much said that. So it's just, okay, when
is it healed enough that he can go.  
  
Q. Obviously your biggest priority here is Wofford, but you also put a
lot of guys in the NBA and you've made that a priority. How much can guys like
Keldon and Tyler help themselves going forward by playing well in this
tournament? And have you ever had a guy really kind of help his stock with a
big NCAA Tournament?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, I've had a bunch of guys do that. But it's not just our
guys, it's everybody. These kids are all being evaluated this three-week
period. Believe me when I tell you, it overrides anything that's happened all
summer. I can remember the kid -- I think it was -- he played for Gary
Williams at Maryland, and he wasn't thought of as a player that was going pro,
and he went on an unbelievable run in -- I'm forgetting his name right now, in
the NCAA Tournament, and he ends up being a top-10 pick, and he wasn't a guy
that was even on the board that they were thinking about.  
  
And I just say this for all these kids, and that's why I respect these kids,
because not only is the tournament there, the National Championship there,
their own being and their own family and all this stuff that these 19 -- my
guys are 19-year-olds, have to deal with. I tell my guys, I tell them all the
time, I respect you guys so much, and then you have like social media and you
have the clutter and you have the lists and you have all the other stuff, and
they've got to block all that out and play. It's not for funsies. It's for
real.  
  
So that's why this tournament is what it is. You just don't know. We want to
say, well, we know that team is -- you don't know. This is hard for these
kids.  
  
Q. You didn't complain quite as much this year when the brackets first
came out, and now CBS has given you two relatively decent start times. Do you
think that the paranoia of the world against John Calipari may have been
ratcheted down a little bit this year?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'd just say is it paranoia if you turn around and a guy is
chasing you and you can see the knife? I'm not sure that's paranoia. You just
run like hell.  
  
I'm not -- I've never -- that's not true. (Laughter).  
  
Yeah, I'm not worried about it. I think as I get older, I could care less. My
give-a meter is I just don't care. We go on and do what we do. The crazy thing
it's never really had an effect on me, on my programs. It just hasn't. And
maybe they've figured out, "Eh, forget about him, we're not hurting him, let's
go hurt somebody else." I don't know, but -- pretty dumb question, though,
John. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Yesterday you were talking about dealing with injuries and especially
a short bench, and with the game in such quick turnaround like it is now, you
mentioned conditioning and how important that is, how much of an advantage do
you think that is for your team, especially in a game with such a short
turnaround?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Any time you're trying to play eight guys it's really
dangerous. Anything that happens, you're down to seven. Another thing happens,
you're down to six. What if the six are not the right six? So it's really
dangerous what we're doing and it could come back to bite us, but guess what,
we have no choice. I tried to trade for some guys but we just couldn't get
anybody, so this is who we have.  
  
Like today, we went pretty hard and really got them to focus, and I was on
some guys because I thought they weren't -- the energy they needed, they
didn't have, and the reason is because you've got to fall back on your
training. You play to your training, and if you've trained right, you can do
that for 40 minutes, and this thing is about playing for 40 minutes, staying
focused, staying engaged for 40 minutes of basketball when the other team is
trying to do the same thing.  
  
And then you may play a team that shoots 25 threes and shoots some of the
worst threes and they go in. That could demoralize you. And then all of a
sudden you're looking and they're back-cutting and they're coming off dribble
hand-offs, and they're making -- it is what it is. I mean, at this time how
can you stay focused on us.  
  
I know how good Wofford is. I know. I've watched them, and I know their league
-- their top 4 teams in that league, I hate to tell you, all four should have
been in the NCAA Tournament when you think about who was in their league. But
Coach Young, the job he's done with this team, he's been there 17 years, and
to put this together and he's a 7 seed. And to come from outside the Power
Five and be a 7 seed, that's a big deal. It's a big, big deal.  
  
Q. Just in terms of recruiting, had you ever heard or seen of Ja Morant
on the summer circuit or anything? And when is the first time you kind of
became aware of him because he kind of snuck through the cracks there.  
JOHN CALIPARI: I hadn't, but I'm not like I was as an assistant where I knew
every player. I don't. I know who we're recruiting. So no, I didn't, but what
a run he's having, and how good is that for Murray. And I don't know if you
know the story, that he committed to Murray, and when everybody figured out
how good he was, some other Power Fives tried to jump in there and say, we're
offering you a scholarship, and he says, nope, I'm going right to these
people. They were there, they've been there from the beginning, and what a
great story, and what a great thing for Murray.  
  
He's a terrific player now. Oof!  
  
Q. You mentioned a team could take a lot of the worst threes you've ever
seen and they go in and it demoralizes --  
JOHN CALIPARI: If they take 25 there will be about four of those, maybe five,
that you say, wow. And then I hear he practices them. He does. So how bad is
it if it's a practiced shot? I had Jamal Murray who used to shoot left-handed,
falling down. Why would you do that? "Because I can make it." And I think this
kid is exactly the same way. Why did you take that? "Because I thought it was
going in."  
  
I mean, I don't think he shoots one shot that he doesn't think he's making. Is
it a bad shot? Maybe you think so, but in his mind, he doesn't, and you know
who else doesn't think it's a bad shot? His coach. Where was he when I was
playing? (Laughter).  
  
Q. One of the reasons we love you so much is because of all the --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, you just love me.  
  
Q. All the buzzwords --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Everybody here love me?  
  
Q. All the buzzwords and the catchphrases that you throw out to us
during the course of the year. One I've really been intrigued by is the idea
of the players conquering themselves. That almost sounds spiritual. Where does
that come from, and how do you think the players have done in terms of
conquering themselves this year?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Before you can conquer someone else, you've got to conquer
yourself, and I say it all the time, a lot of it means conditioning, a lot of
it means pushing through comfort. A lot of it means don't drink that poison
when you're flattered. "You're so good, you should be taking more shots.
You're better than so and so, why aren't you shooting -- when he shoots, he's
fine, when you shoot, you come out if you miss." Do you drink that poison?
Because if you drink that poison, you can never conquer yourself because you
already have built-in excuses.  
  
And so for these kids to conquer themselves, to be in the best physical and
mental condition in their lives, to master their craft -- are you in the gym?
Are you mastering your craft? "Well, I should be able to miss five straight
shots." No, you shouldn't. Especially if they're open. They just talked about
Villanova making 7 of 8 uncontested shots. That's why they won. They were
uncontested. Well, when we're uncontested we think we should be able to --
well, I don't have to make every one. Well, how about making almost all of the
uncontested ones and missing some others.  
  
All that conquering you, knowing that you're responsible for yourself, knowing
you own your performance. You own that. That's conquering yourself. And if you
can't conquer yourself, you're not conquering anybody else.  
  
And we as a young team all the time, that's -- you've got to be able to
understand you're not in great shape. You're not focused right now, you're not
engaged right now because it's really hard to be that guy. But that's where
you conquer yourself. So yes, we're -- there's a lot of stuff that we have to
give these kids to think about because it moves pretty fast around here.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. Tre, did you guys take a lot of satisfaction, people thought you guys
were falling apart with the coaching situation? Did you take a lot of
satisfaction in the way you guys performed and basically leading wire to wire
in that game?  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, I feel like our team is definitely gelling with
everything that's going on. I feel like we're getting a lot closer together,
and we're just going to take it one day at a time, like we've been doing. That
game is behind us now and we've got to move forward to Maryland, and know we
have to take it one day at a time, one play at a time and just do what we've
been doing.  
  
Q. Until you actually play somebody else from the SEC, did you take note
of the fact that the SEC actually went 4-0 yesterday? Florida was a 10 seed
and won. Are you rooting for the other teams, if you're not playing them, in
the conference?  
SKYLAR MAYS: I think we as players who went through the conference understand
how tough the conference is, and I think it's good to see all these other
teams do well and survive and advance, and I think it just shows how tough the
SEC is. You know, we want the best for the league.  
  
Q. Skylar, maybe you could address how has the transition coaching-wise
worked in games? Are you hearing different voices? Do all the assistants have
a ton of input? Logistically how is it working, how is it different?  
SKYLAR MAYS: It's definitely different just hearing a different voice as the
head guy, but I think Coach Wade gave all the assistant coaches somewhat of
freedom throughout the year, so it's not foreign for us to hear Coach Heiar or
Coach Armstrong outside of Coach Benford. I think these guys do a great job of
listening to everybody and taking the big takeaway and applying it on the
court.  
  
Q. Kavell, Maryland has got a couple of big guys, almost two of them
twin guys. How difficult do they look on tape to match up with?  
KAVELL BIGBY-WILLIAMS: It's going to be a pretty good match-up. Obviously
they're great players, and like I said, I'm looking forward to the match-up. I
know they're physical, big, long, athletic, so it's going to be a good match-
up, but I feel like me and Naz, we're going to be prepared for them.  
  
Q. Tremont, when Will was coaching, he seemed to signal a lot of plays
during the game and communicating with you a lot. Just from watching the last
couple games, doesn't seem like anybody is doing that from the coaches. Are
you doing a lot of the offense kind of on your own, what y'all have done all
year? You're basically calling it?  
TREMONT WATERS: Yes, obviously in the huddle Coach Benford and the coaching
staff are giving us plays to run and just basically on the fly, either I'll
call the play or Skylar will call a set just based on what we see. It's just a
read that we make pretty much throughout the game, and if things break down,
Coach Benford calls a play.  
  
Q. Is that working well?  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, as long as we keep winning, it's definitely working.  
  
Q. Kavell, who did you think was the biggest, most physical SEC team
that you guys went against this year? And is it going to be a similar
experience to playing Maryland?  
KAVELL BIGBY-WILLIAMS: I feel teams like Alabama, Florida are pretty physical,
Mississippi State with all the big guys on there. There's a variety of teams
that are pretty physical, but those teams were probably the ones that stood
out the most to me.  
  
Q. Tre, you had seven assists yesterday, you did a good job being a
floor general. How important is it for you to lead the team and not turn the
ball over?  
TREMONT WATERS: Well, as a point guard I feel like that's my job. When we
first started the season Coach Wade pretty much said that the ball is like the
state of Louisiana, and if I turn the ball over, then it's not good for the
state and obviously for our basketball program as a whole. That just goes to
show that like we have to take care of the ball, obviously, if we want to win.
So that's just my job. I believe I live up to it, and I'm going to continue to
do that for my team because they deserve it and we deserve it.  
  
Q. Back to Tre, you were talking about how you've taken over a little
bit of the play-calling, but is it new that after a time-out that you break
the huddle and then have your own little huddle as a team? Is that something
new or is that something you've done all year?  
TREMONT WATERS: No, we've pretty much done that all year. We pretty much go
out after we hear the play called and the defensive schemes and everything and
based off what Coach is saying, we go out and just say it again, so we keep it
fresh in our minds, so we know what we're doing when the play starts.  
  
Q. You guys shot a lot of threes. I know you're not playing Wofford, but
have you seen Fletcher Magee shoot? And I wonder if you're envious of the
freedom he has to shoot threes all day long.  
SKYLAR MAYS: Wofford was actually the first team I played in my college
career, so I'm very familiar with Fletcher Magee. And he's having an
unbelievable season and accomplishing great things. I watched them yesterday,
they beat Seton Hall, so he's a terrific player.  
  
Q. Skylar, have there been points in games like this last game where
y'all's lead went down a little bit and then Florida where you lost the lead
where you were thinking, I wonder what Coach Wade would do at this moment or
what he would do at that time?  
SKYLAR MAYS: I think all the way throughout the game, I try to think what
would Coach Wade do, not just when things get a little hectic. But there's not
really a game that I can remember where we had a big lead and we got back
close and we were able to pull it out. I think the Florida game we had a good
lead and it got away from us.  
  
But that's something that we definitely have to do a better job. The great
thing about us is that we're able to get a big lead in the beginning and now
we just have to work on sustaining it.  
  
Q. Kavell, the match-up with the front court is going to bring a lot of
attention. What have you seen out of the two bigs, and then how important is
it for you guys to get quality minutes out of Emmitt and Darius in a match-up
like this?  
KAVELL BIGBY-WILLIAMS: It's important because they're physical bigs, well
skilled. They can post-up and make plays inside the post and also on the
perimeter. Having those other guys come in to bring minutes is going to help
us a lot.  
  
Q. Tremont, you had a great first half and then kind of in the second
half it tailed off a little bit. What changed, and how do you put together a
full 40-minute quality game?  
TREMONT WATERS: Well, yeah, obviously going into the game we had a great game
plan, and as the game went on, we kind of slowed down in transition, and I
feel like that was our biggest letdown. For me I wasn't pushing the ball as
much as I should have in the second half, and I feel like shots just weren't
falling, so that was it.  
  
Q. Coach, the SEC went 4-0 yesterday. Five years ago, four years ago
they only got three teams in the tournament; last year eight; this year seven.
Yesterday's games 4-0. What would you say the state of this conference in
basketball is right now?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, it's a tremendous league. I think that's a testament to it
right there, going 4-0. I've been coaching a long time and been in some great
leagues. I was in the Big East when they sent 11 teams to the tournament that
one year where UConn won it. I think our league is comparable to any league in
the country and similar to that league back in the day, where every night you
have to come out and play great basketball.  
  
I attribute it to great coaches, got great players and got great environments.
Every gym, every arena you go to, you're going to play in front of a sellout
house. So I think it's just a tribute to the great players and great coaches
and great fans in the SEC.  
  
Q. Just got out of the locker room, and Skylar pointed out it doesn't
show up in the stats sheet, but when Emmitt dove into the media row in the
front row, he just gave his entire body; didn't care. He didn't get the ball,
but it almost said it kind of fired up the team, Skylar said. What do you see
from Emmitt and also the team that they'll give everything, break a body bone,
whatever it takes for LSU?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, Emmitt brings a toughness to us. You talked to him, he
never shuts up. But no, he's got a great personality, and that's his game.
That's his role on this team. He's going to do all the intangibles, and he's
going to get all the 50/50 balls. He's going to take charges and he can finish
at the rim. He's just a great teammate for these guys. He's great to coach. I
love coaching him, and he's always got a smile on his face, and we're very
fortunate to have him.  
  
He needs to play well tomorrow because he's going against some grown men
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tony, you've been in this game most of your life. You're sitting in
the chair you are now because your boss was accused of paying a player
potentially. Do you believe that college basketball players should be paid?  
TONY BENFORD: That's a good question. I mean, I think this thing is --
changing rules have made a lot of changes to try to help them as far as giving
them different stipends and things, to try to help the athletes because some
of them come from tough environments. I mean, I'm kind of on the fence on
that. I'm not leaning one way or the other, but I want to make sure we take
care of the athletes. I think you have to make sure they have everything they
need to be successful, and I think we're trying to do that through the
different stipends that they're getting right now.  
  
Q. The team had its doubters coming into the tournament. Did you sense
that that motivated your players, and did you feed into that at all to keep
them motivated?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, the thing I really preached to these guys is they know we
can only control what we can control, and that's just getting better every day
with our preparation, our focus. There's no doubt they had an edge to them
because obviously they know the noise is out there, but I've tried to -- just
got to keep blinders on and have tunnel vision and focus on the task at hand
and that's to prepare like we were preparing for Yale, that's the task to
prepare for Maryland, a very quality Maryland team.  
  
That's what we try to do, just try to stay in the moment right now.  
  
Q. What particular challenges does Maryland pose for you tomorrow?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, first of all, I think Mark is a great coach. He does a
tremendous job. When you look at their numbers, especially on the defensive
side, they do a great job. They're one of the top teams as far as scoring
defense and field-goal-percentage defense and one of the best rebounding teams
in the country. You look at Bruno, I think he scares you once you look at him.
He's really good, a good player. Then Smith is playing really well, and
Anthony got a great quality point guard.  
  
But what it's going to come down to I think it's very simple: It's going to be
who wins the paint and who wins the rebounding battle. I think it's going to
be that simple. They're really strong in the paint and we're pretty strong in
the paint, and we're good on the glass and they're good on the glass. I think
the point guard play is going to be huge. Tremont and Anthony, that's a great
match-up. So I think it's going to come down to that, paint and rebound, who
plays best at the point guard position.  
  
Q. I know you've said a few times that all the assistant coaches and you
are helping a lot. Which coach would you say during the game is working most
with the offense and with Tremont?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, I pretty much cover, do most of the offense, okay. Coach
Heiar really concentrates on the defensive end, and then Coach Armstrong he'll
handle our substitution. It depends on the game. Like tomorrow's game against
Maryland, it is Coach Armstrong's scout, so he'll do a lot of defensive stuff
for them and then handle the substitutions, too, and Coach Heiar will help him
with that.  
  
So we kind of do it by committee. One thing with Coach Wade, he delegated
that, too, even when he was here, we split our scouting reports for different
opponents and whoever had that scout had a lot of input on the game plan, on
what we're to run offensively and what we do defensively.  
  
Q. But Tremont is doing more himself, right, than when Coach Wade was
here?  
TONY BENFORD: I would say probably a little bit more because Tremont -- we
trust Tremont because he knows -- not only Tremont but Skylar, too, with those
guys as far as they have a feel sometimes on what to run. I'll may make a call
to run this, and if he sees something else, he can change the call. I have no
problem with that because we trust him with the ball.  
  
Q. Follow-up to that, how does your prep change now that you have three
coaches working on it instead of four?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, that's a good question. We have not changed a whole lot,
okay. One of the things we tell our players is to narrow our focus. We have to
really concentrate. What we've done again as far as our scouts, Coach Heiar
had Yale, Coach Armstrong has got Maryland, so he'll lock in on that, and then
myself, like we all look at tape regardless of who we play, the upcoming
opponent, the coaches, we all evaluate tape. So I've looked at Maryland about
four or five games and I have a pretty good feel for what they do offensively
and defensively and different tendencies and stuff like that, so we're doing
it by committee.  
  
Q. Tre had a great first half and then kind of tailed off in the second.
How do you bring out a full 40 minutes from him of quality basketball, and is
that something you stress to him going into tomorrow night against a tough
point guard like Cowan?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, good question. I think with Tre, I really thought he was
focused. Not only Tre but I thought all our guys were in the first half
yesterday. We talked about it as a staff and we talked to Tre about it. I
think going on out in the second half, we've just got to kind of stay
aggressive. I thought he was a little bit passive in the second half. We want
him to stay in that attack mode, and that's what he's got to do. I thought he
pushed the ball in transition. He was very aggressive in transition in the
first half. The second half I didn't think he was as aggressive, and we wanted
to be more aggressive. And we may try to run some different plays for him to
try to get him going.  
  
Q. Picking on a couple of questions ago, how did the division of labor
change without Will? How much does each guy have to do more of to make up for
it?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, well, I think the one thing is -- one thing with our
staff, we've all got a great relationship with our players and we spend a lot
of time with them as far as that. Spend a lot of time with them as far as the
responsibilities of the scouting reports, like we say, and preparing for the
next opponent, we're all doing that. One guy may have the opponent and then I
-- we all are doing that.  
  
As far as going back to the game plan, as a head coach I'll try to prepare
that game plan and be more detailed in exactly what we have to do, and I try
to do that as a head coach.  
  
Q. I just want to know, how well do you think the team is adjusting to
your system currently?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, it's not my system. I haven't changed a whole lot. That's
the one thing I learned when I became the interim, keep it the same, keep it
the same because there's no reason to change it. We went 16-2 winning the SEC,
so there's no reason to come in here and say, hey, I'm going to run my offense
and stick my chest out. It's all about these players, so I've kept everything
the same.  
  
We have the same playbook. Everything is the same as far as what we've doing
and as far as sets what we're running offensively and what we're doing
defensively. And like I say, Coach kind of delegated a lot of stuff to our
guys, so the other coaches are really helping in that preparation, too.  
  
Q. You talked about the paint match-up being key; can you just give us a
little bit more on Kavell and Naz and what kind of players they are and
whether they're ready for it?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, that's a good question. There's no doubt I think Kavell is
our most experienced player obviously, and he's had a great year. I mean, he
has improved a lot. He sat out last year. Transferred from Oregon and stood
out. He's gotten bigger and stronger and he's one of the best shot blockers in
the country and he's gotten better offensively. You saw last night he made a
great play against Yale where he blocked a shot, he ran, got a lay-up on the
other end. And that's what he's got to bring, that energy that rim protection
he's going to really have to bring it tomorrow and really defend his position
and hold his ground, especially against Smith and Bruno.  
  
And then Naz has been great to coach, guys. I mean, like I say, he's in great
shape. He's smart, very smart player. He's got a great skill set, play inside,
outside, and he can rebound the basketball. So he's got to do a great job
defensively on Bruno or Smith and then we've got to have him score in the
paint and also be able to make some jump shots for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Does he have a green light to shoot?  
TONY BENFORD: Pretty much. We'd like to corral that. I like him to shoot close
to the basket sometimes, a lot more, so we talked about that.  
  
Q. How much harder would this be if you didn't have a point guard as
mature and trustworthy as Tremont?  
TONY BENFORD: That's a really good question. It would be a lot more difficult.
Because the thing with Tremont, guys, is as a coach sometimes you get in your
players' way, and some coaches do that. I think when you have a guy -- the
better your players, the less sets you have to run offensively.  
  
You've got to trust him because he can go make plays. Sometimes he throws the
ball somewhere you didn't want it to go, but he's going to be aggressive and
he's going to make the right decision the majority of the time, so he makes it
a lot easier.  
  
Q. For guys like Naz and Kavell, this match-up, how much is on the line
for them to really show out on a huge stage against two talented front court
guys like this?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, they've played against some quality big guys in the SEC.
PJ Washington is pretty good. He's a pretty good player. Grant Williams,
Schofield, those guys are good players. But it's important because if we don't
win, we go home. So this is the most important game of the year for us, and
they understand that. There's no more tomorrows. We've got to play well
tomorrow or we go home. But I think our guys will be ready to play, and we're
looking forward to the challenge.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Maryland - 79, Belmont - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, just opening comments about what turned
out to be a fantastic basketball game today.  
  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, it was a terrific game. I'm just really proud of my team.
We were unbelievably resilient. We didn't shoot the ball well in the first
half. They made some shots. They're a heck of a team. We beat a really good
team today. And then we were really good to finish the half and really good to
start the half, and then Windler went crazy making some really tough shots.  
  
I think obviously they're extremely well coached. But we got down four, Darryl
hit a big three in the corner, cut it to one, and I felt pretty good about
things.  
  
You know, we've really been working on turnovers; we had five turnovers for
the game. We had two against the press in the first half, and so we only had
two in the second half, so we really did a terrific job there.  
  
There's a reason they're the second-highest scoring team in the country.
They're almost impossible to guard. Fortunately for us, we got the big man, I
won't even try to say his last name, in foul trouble, and I think that helped
us guard them a little better during certain stretches. But I thought Bruno
was great against the double-team, I thought Darryl was terrific all night,
Eric hit some good shots, and Stix (Smith) just wouldn't be denied, he just
kept getting offensive rebounds. We had a size advantage there and we took
advantage of it, and just a great win.  
  
I told the guys, just an honor and a privilege to be a part of a game like
that this time of a year, and to come out on top makes it real special.  
  
Q. Darryl, you had several huge plays down the stretch, put Maryland on
top. How were you able to come through this, especially after Belmont had
rallied back? How were you able to keep things going the last couple
minutes?  
DARRYL MORSELL: Just mental toughness. It's something we harp on all the time
as a team. We've got to be mentally tough to win these type games.  
  
Q. What did you see on the last steal with two seconds to go?  
DARRYL MORSELL: Coaches were screaming, "Back door!" I kind of knew it was
coming, but Eric was right here, he got his hand on the ball, which helped me
a lot, and I got the steal.  
  
Q. Darryl, did you miss that on purpose to set up the long shot, or did
you not hit the free throw?  
DARRYL MORSELL: No, I just missed that. I didn't miss it on purpose. They iced
me.  
  
Q. It's the first game you all played in the tournament; what was the
environment like? How was it getting adjusted to it, and when did you guys
really feel like this was your time?  
BRUNO FERNANDO: It felt great to be out there, just to be able to play, like
we say all the time, we've got to be happy and excited. This time of year not
a lot of teams get to play and be here today. We just got a win and we passed
to the next round.  
  
So it felt great to be out there and just play as a team. I think we did a lot
of great things on the court like Coach already mentioned and just had fun. I
think we had a lot of fun out there tonight on the floor and just helped each
other win.  
  
Q. Bruno, you seemed to have great awareness of the double-teams coming;
how much preparation did you do, and how did you hear them coming so
quickly?  
BRUNO FERNANDO: The past two days when we practiced, every time all year we've
been doing a lot of double-teams in our practice, so I got used to it. Their
double-team was a lot different today. They came like, the pass wasn't here
and right there was the double-team. So I have to make sure I'm patient and I
see the double-team coming and find the open guy every time.  
  
Q. Darryl, how difficult was it to stay in front of Windler? Some of the
shots he hit were step-back threes from 30 feet. What is it like when you play
against a guy like that? And also did that make you aggressive on offense? You
seemed to really want to go back at him.  
DARRYL MORSELL: Dylan Windler is a phenomenal player. He can score at all
three levels. Today he found his rhythm early. He was hitting some big shots,
some step-backs, some fadeaways. But I just stuck with it. My teammates,
Bruno, Eric, Anthony, all them kept picking me up going, telling me, "Keep
guarding, keep guarding, we're going to find a way to win this game."  
  
And offensively I just tried to find ways to impact the game. I seen them
double-teaming Bruno. That gave me opportunities to cut in the lane. Was
getting stops defensively, which allowed me to get out in transition and
stuff. It's just a credit to my teammates for all the success I had.  
  
Q. Darryl, what do you think of the match-up with LSU? Have you seen
them play or know any of their players?  
DARRYL MORSELL: We watched a little bit of them before we came over here. I
know they did real well in the SEC. Right now we're just going to enjoy this
win. We'll talk with Coach Turgeon and the coaches later tonight about LSU,
but right now, us guys, this is our first postseason win, so we're going to
enjoy this.  
  
Q. Eric, early in the game when Maryland was trailing, you got a lot of
the offensive load. Is that something that you're used to taking? There were a
lot of hard takes to the basket. And then playing the primary point guard, you
had some very balanced scoring. Can you talk about your first-half takes to
the basket and how you distributed the ball in the second half?  
ERIC AYALA: Just playing a well-rounded game, just letting the game come to
me. My teammates and my coaches trust me to go out there, do what I'm capable
of, and whatever I can do to help us win, winning is at the forefront for me,
so whether that's rebounding, passing, defending, I'll do whatever to help us
win.  
  
Q. Mark, I wonder personally how much pressure you might feel in such a
game that comes down to essentially a possession?  
MARK TURGEON: Pressure because the game is close?  
  
Q. The tournament --  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, you get second-guessed pretty good this time of year, so
you want to do all the right things. But no, I'll tell you what, I feel so
lucky just to be a part of a game like that. You work your whole life to be a
part of it. Any game you can win in this tournament is great, and just -- I'm
just so proud of my group. We gutted it out. We just kept battling, we kept
battling, we kept battling. We played with great poise offensively.
Defensively down the stretch we were just good enough.  
  
Yeah, is my heart rate like I'm sleeping? No. But I just love it. I just love
it. It's so much fun.  
  
Q. Talk about Jalen's second half playing with fouls and also sort of
basically taking over inside, which we haven't seen a lot this year in some
games, but on this kind of stage, how big was that for him and obviously how
did it translate to the end of the game?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, so you're from Baltimore, you can write a heck of an
article: Our B-more guys stepped up today. They were terrific.  
  
You know, we tried to get Stix going early, which he did. He got out on the
break, we ran a couple plays for him. He had a huge size advantage, and then
you add the length of his arms, and he probably had a foot advantage on that
kid. He just wouldn't be denied. We were able to break them down with
penetration. We got in the lane a lot tonight, whether it was through the post
or through whatever.  
  
And they're a great box-out team, one of the best things they do is box out,
limit second-chance points, and Stix just wouldn't be denied. He was terrific,
and finished and played with strength. We've been beating on Stix for eight
weeks trying to make him tougher. He got extra weight -- right before he left
town he got an extra weight workout, and it showed up today. It takes time
when your nickname is Stix, but he played with great toughness.  
  
Q. It took until about I think the under-eight time-out for you guys to
get kick-started a little bit. What were some adjustments you really had to
take from that point on in the first half?  
MARK TURGEON: You're talking about the first half? Yeah, we couldn't make a
shot, and it's the way it's been for us. You know, we missed five lay-ups and
probably six wide-open threes, okay, maybe eight wide-open threes.  
  
Early in the year that might have affected our defense. It didn't affect our
defense. That team is too good for us to let down defensively. So we kept
trying to guard. We knew it was going to come, and we made some plays right
before half. I think that gave us confidence going into halftime, and then we
started the second half terrific, which we've done a lot this year.  
  
It is what it is. You know, I watched their game against Temple; it was back
and forth, one team would go on a run, another team would go on a run. It was
a little bit like that today. It's college basketball. But my guys were
resilient and really dialed in. We played well. We played well to win. Don't
think that we didn't play well. No, we played really well to win this game.  
  
Q. Most of this team had never been in a tournament game. How do you get
them prepared for that, and how do you get them ready to go through this type
of battle?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, obviously we didn't play well in our last game, so we've
been pretty motivated practice-wise, and then everybody was predicting that we
would lose, and that motivates you a little bit. It's not fair to Belmont that
people don't know a lot about basketball are picking them to beat us. So we
were highly motivated, and this time of year, you lose, you go home, so you
stick together. We stuck together. Our leadership, for such a young team, our
communication and belief throughout the game was tremendous.  
  
Q. To win a game when Anthony shoots 3 of 18, what does that say about
the team? And what other things did Anthony do that helped?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, so Anthony I think had five assists, one turnover, if I'm
correct. Yeah, six assists, one turnover, so he helped there. He really
defended McClain. I don't know what McClain ended up with, 19 points. But man,
he had to earn it. He got seven at the line, okay.  
  
So Anthony was terrific, and we all believe in Anthony. We think he's going to
make his next one. He made a three, he ran a play for him, got another wide
open three and he missed it. That's how much I believe in him, even though at
the time he was probably 3 for 16. So it does mean a lot when he plays like
that and we still beat a really good team. It should give us confidence for
the next one.

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Wofford - 84, Seton Hall - 68  
  
Q. Kevin, I know you've talked all year long about how proud you are of
these young men, and I know that doesn't change. What do you think went wrong
tonight, but also what will you take away from this year when the
disappointment finally ebbs a little bit?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I just think that's a heck of a basketball team we played. When
you have a senior-laden team like they do, who's extremely well-coached,
you're going to have to play really good to beat them. And we just turned the
ball over in the first half. That really kind of put us behind the 8-ball and
gave them too many opportunities.  
  
But these guys have left it on the floor all year long. I love the way they've
battled. Couldn't be more proud of the season we've had, and couldn't be more
proud of them as individuals. It's always tough to lose, but that was a good
basketball team that played really well.  
  
Q. Mike, I saw you the start of the second half, you sort of commanded
the huddle there. This was obviously your last game. What's the emotions going
through your mind right now?  
MICHAEL NZEI: I mean, I never wanted this to come to an end, but you always
make plans, and sometimes it doesn't happen. But I'm just thankful for my
teammates for fighting with me throughout this journey and like sticking by my
side. I feel like we came out today, we gave all we could, and it didn't go
our way, but we've just got to keep our head up. There's always more road on
this journey. So I'm really happy for these guys. I know they'll have a bright
future, and I can't wait to see what they're all going to achieve.  
  
Q. Myles, what will you take from Mike, playing with him for three years
and just learning from him, the player he is on the court and the person he is
off the court? What are you going to take away from that?  
MYLES POWELL: Mike is a great guy. Our journey goes on past just these three
years. When Mike came over here, we played AAU together for New Jersey
players. This is my blood brother right here, we're not just teammates. We're
still going to talk. He's still going to help me lead this team from afar.
Just because he's not here, I know the person Mike is. He's still going to be
with us. When you let a guy like this go, it hurts, but like I said, I know
Mike is still going to be with us.  
  
Q. Mike, what do you think of this team, this group's potential next
year? And what kind of legacy do you want to leave them with?  
MICHAEL NZEI: I mean, we could start from the point of expectations people had
for this team. Everyone thought it was a group of young guys, but these young
guys showed they got heart and they showed they could fight. I look at them
and I know the ceiling is so high, and I feel like this year for them is just
a building and a learning year, and as time goes for next year, I believe a
lot of the potential is going to come out fully, and I feel like from this
point you're going to see a team of mature guys, and I believe they're going
to keep fighting as time goes on and they're developing.  
  
Q. Myles, this game was pretty similar individually for you in a lot of
ways, slow first half and then you come alive in the second half. When you got
going in the second half, does it feel a little like déjà vu, kind of the way
you've been willing the team in the past couple games, that this was going to
be the start of it again when you guys took the lead there?  
MYLES POWELL: I mean, we've been in this situation all year, backs been
against the wall. Our coaching staff did a great job just telling me to relax
and telling me that the game was going to come to me. My teammates had my
back, my coaching staff had my back, and it's been like this all year. So when
you have a group of guys like that, that's always picking you up, it's kind of
hard to lack confidence. I love this group.  
  
Q. Myles, just to continue with that, how hard did Wofford make it on
you? You've seen it all year, but how much did they make you work for what you
had tonight?  
MYLES POWELL: Like you said, I've been seeing this all year, but they did a
good job. They're well-coached over there. They have a group of seniors. They
know what they wanted to do. It seemed like every time I drove the ball they
were collapsing or if I was coming off pick-and-rolls they was double-teaming.
They made it hard for me tonight, and yeah.  
  
Q. Kevin, what can your underclassmen learn from this?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I mean, the biggest thing is what I just talked to them
about was seeding. Seeding really matters. You know, when I watched them on
film, I knew this was probably going to be the best team we played all year,
to be honest with you, just because they were so balanced inside and out, they
run good stuff, they're much better defensively than they look.  
  
So I think the biggest thing going forward is we've got to make sure we don't
hurt ourselves and take advantage of opportunities, and try to get better
seeding because after three -- the last three weeks has been an emotional
roller coaster, knowing that we've had to win games, playing three tough,
hard-nosed games in the Big East Tournament. You get a 10 seed, you're going
to play against a really, really good team, and that's a really good team.  
  
Q. Defensively how much of that was Wofford being great, how much of it
was something you would have liked to have seen you guys do differently on the
perimeter?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I mean, they're going to make shots. They just are. My biggest
fear came true, was that Jackson was going to take over the game, and I
thought the biggest difference in the game was obviously, A, we turned the
ball over. But B, early in the game, he settled them down. He got them going,
and that was my biggest fear going into this game was that he's a guy that
doesn't get talked a whole lot about, but he's a guy, you look at the
plus/minus, and he was plus 27. He kind of got them going and made some big
buckets, got an and-one, and I really thought he was the difference in the
game, believe it or not.  
  
They made some threes during their run, but we were shot. But he was the
difference in the first half, and I thought he was really a difference in the
game.  
  
Q. Kevin, you said before we got here that you thought the country knew
about Myles, but you expected them to get a bigger taste of it when we got
here. Seeing what he did in the second half, about what he's done the past
couple weeks, I guess, how impressed are you just in big moments with what
he's been able to do?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, again, I think I've said this a thousand times. I'm not
that impressed at all, to be honest with you because I've seen it so much.
It's the way he plays in practice, it's the way he works in individual
instruction. I thought he took a huge jump this year in his game from a
standpoint of being a main guy. But nothing that he does out there ever kind
of -- I sit there and go, oh, geez. It's what he does all the time. I guess
that's my answer.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [James Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16256)

### [Alex Copeland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36893)

### [Blake Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36895)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
LSU - 79, Yale - 74  
  
JAMES JONES: I thought that our kids did a great job at fighting the entire 40
minutes. We obviously didn't shoot the ball as well as we'd like to or as well
as we have in the past, but the energy and effort was there, and you've got to
tip your hat to LSU for holding onto a lead and knocking down their free
throws. But I was very proud of our young men. I told them such in the locker
room, and it's been a great season for Yale basketball, and as I said, I
couldn't be prouder of my group.  
  
Q. Alex, what's the feeling with the team down 18 early in the second
half? You guys obviously made the comeback. What's the feeling there, and what
did you do to get back in the game?  
ALEX COPELAND: I'm so proud of this group and just the fight that we showed.
We were in the locker room at halftime, and I think we were a little down for
a moment, but we all kind of came together and told each other, look, we can
do this. We can fight back. We've been down before, and to come out and battle
back like that and put on a show for our fans that were here and that were
watching us across the country feels amazing. I think it's just a testament to
the guys we have in this locker room.  
  
Q. Obviously Miye had a tough day out there defensively. Do you think
that had more to do with their defense, and how were you able to keep it so
close with him having only five points?  
BLAKE REYNOLDS: Well, I mean, I said this yesterday in our press conference,
but I think we have a lot of weapons on our team that can contribute on any
given night. So on a night when one guy, like tonight maybe Miye maybe
struggled a little bit from the floor, his teammates were there to pick him up
and help our team score points.  
  
Any given night anyone on our team can hurt you, and I think that's what made
our team so special this year.  
  
Q. Blake, I'm sure you knew what to expect from LSU, but was there
anything about their size and athleticism that maybe took you aback at the
start of the game or was it more or less what you expected in terms of their
overall talent?  
BLAKE REYNOLDS: Yeah, you know, coming from playing in our league to playing
an SEC team definitely very athletic and very strong inside. We knew they were
going to be relentless on the glass tonight, and they were. And I think we did
a fairly good job of battling them on the boards. But yeah, definitely real
big and strong down there, but I thought we fought hard.  
  
Q. Blake, you made a basket with just over eight minutes left to cut
LSU's lead to seven and over the next five and a half minutes you guys only
cut their lead to two. They didn't score much. Do you think looking back
that's a part that's going to frustrate you, that y'all had a chance in that
period, that part of the game and couldn't really make it a one or two-point
game?  
BLAKE REYNOLDS: Right, yeah. Through that stretch we were really doing a good
job on defense. We were switching the ball screens and I think that kind of
frustrated them. Yeah, that's a portion of the game that I'm going to think
about a lot, looking back on it, that we couldn't quite take the lead or quite
get over the hump there.  
  
But you know, hats off to LSU; they played solid defense, and they held us
limited on offense there during that stretch.  
  
Q. Bigby-Williams, he's not always the one people focus on, but LSU is
undefeated when he has a double-double, and he had four blocks, and changes
shots. What were the problems he created for you, No. 11?  
JAMES JONES: Well, he's a big long center and obviously he's going to clog up
the paint a little bit, made it hard for us to get at the rim, and he was able
to score and we fouled him a little bit, as well. Any time you get a guy that
goes for a double-double that's going to put a bite in the works in terms of
what you're able to do to be successful, and he had a nice game for them, and
so you've got to tip your hat.  
  
Q. James, with Miye, what do you think it was with him today? Obviously
LSU did a good job on him, but he just never seemed to get on track, and how
hard is it to win a game without him having a big game?  
JAMES JONES: Yeah, my son is 13, and he's a big James Harden fan, and every
time James Harden plays, it would be the first quarter, and James Harden will
be 1 for 9, and he'll be like, "James Harden sucks. He stinks. He can't play."  
  
So you're going to have games where you knock the ball in and you don't. You
guys all watch the game, like Miye had open shots that just didn't go down.
And he's hit tougher shots than he had tonight that he missed.  
  
Did they do a good job on him defensively? Certainly they worked hard to try
to limit him. But he's good enough to get good shots, and I thought we thought
we got good shots for him, and they just didn't fall down tonight, so
sometimes that's going to happen to you, and you've just got to live with it.

### [Nathan Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37005)

### [Cameron Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36916)

### [Fletcher Magee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36915)

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Wofford - 84, Seton Hall - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could give us your thoughts about the big win
tonight in round 1.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: How does our commissioner feel right now?  
  
JOHN IAMARINO: Pretty damned good!  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah, just hats off to a really fine and exceptionally well-
coached Seton Hall team. I knew that they were going to keep coming and keep
coming. Myles is awesome. I did think we did a pretty good job on him as a
team.  
  
Proud of my boys. Look forward to coming back over tomorrow and practicing
with this team, I can't tell you how enjoyable that has been for me, and the
thought of Wofford coming back on Saturday to face off against one of the
great programs in our country in the Kentucky Wildcats, that's pretty cool
stuff. We look forward to it.  
  
Q. Fletcher, could you talk about when you guys got on the -- after
Nathan made two threes and then you followed it in the corner from the same
spot that you had hit your two previous threes, were you just kind of feeling
it there? Because you had a decent lead, you didn't let much shot clock
expire. Was that more of a feeling-it type thing?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I think so. I knew that we had a lot of momentum going
for us, and me and Nate were kind of feeding off each other at that point. We
ran the same play to get it over there, and I felt like I was pretty open, so
I decided to let it go.  
  
Q. Follow-up for Cameron: Could you give me what you feel is the
distance that Fletcher will not go much beyond that to take a shot, like 26,
27? What number would you put on it that, OK, that's a little bit much?  
CAMERON JACKSON: I don't know. The kid can shoot it, so when he's open, I'm
happy when he shoots it. I don't want to cap him. Whenever he wants to stop,
he can stop, but I'm going to let him do his job and just hit threes.  
  
Q. Fletcher, can you just describe the moment when you hit the three
that broke the record? Everyone was already standing on their feet before you
even made the basket, right when you want to shoot it. I was wondering if you
were aware of the crowd and if you could describe your emotions?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I was aware of it just from the media and everyone
texting me and stuff, and saying I had three more. So when I hit it, I
definitely noticed the crowd was louder than just the normal three in the
second half.  
  
But I feel like I didn't caught too caught up in it. It was a close game. I
was just focused on doing whatever I could to help us continue to stretch our
lead and win down the stretch. I feel like I was aware of it, but I just kind
of blocked it out and tried to focus on winning.  
  
Q. For the three players, what does it mean to be part of the first
tournament victory in school history?  
NATHAN HOOVER: Oh, it means a lot to all of us, but we know we can't get
caught up in the moment. We can enjoy it right now, but we know we have a lot
of preparation to do and we're going to have a very tough game today. We know
we came here to win and we came here to make it as far as we can, so we're
just going to get ready for Saturday.  
  
Q. Fletcher, could you just talk a little bit about how tough Seton
Hall's defenders really made it for you, particularly Myles Cale, No. 22, and
you didn't seem to be forcing the issue very much in terms of getting
frustrated and forcing up a shot.  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, they did a good job, especially in the first half, of
just topping me and kind of making it hard to get the ball. But that's when
Cam was playing amazing in the first half. Everyone else on our team was
stepping up and doing a lot of things, so I knew that there was no need to
rush it or take bad shots. We were still controlling the game.  
  
In the second half they went more to the match-up zone and there was some more
open looks in the second half.  
  
Q. For all the players, have you guys watched Kentucky on TV this year?
What are your impressions and what do you expect from them Saturday?  
CAMERON JACKSON: We've definitely watched Kentucky. They're on TV all the
time. They're a very talented team. They've got a lot of guys that can score
the ball. They're very athletic. So it's going to be a tough game. But we're
welcoming the challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, how gratifying was it for you in the first half to watch your
team go on a 13-0 run and not have Fletcher score at all?  
MIKE YOUNG: I didn't know that, but we've seen that so many times. We didn't
play our second bunch as much as we typically do. But we've got a really
talented team and a number of guys that can score. The big guy down there --
any time you can surround a person like Cameron with a number of guys that can
crank it, and we've got a bunch of those, you'll be hard to guard.  
  
But I wasn't aware of that. Can't say I was surprised, but gratifying, yeah.
On that stage, that's a big deal. Enjoyable.  
  
Q. This is for Coach, Fletch and Nate: The team seems to react
differently to Cameron being the senior leader. What is it like having him on
the floor, calming everyone down in those moments of chaos and stress and
having that kind of leadership on the floor?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I think it's great. Cam definitely settles us down in
tough times, and we know we can throw the ball in to him. He's going to either
get a great shot for us or pass -- he's going to get a great shot for himself
or pass it out. And then in the huddles, just talking, communicating the
important things, I feel like he does a great job of just making sure that
we're calm and ready for the next play.  
  
Q. Mike, what is it about your team that you guys finished the game on a
big run? It seems like you never get rattled and frazzled at the end.  
MIKE YOUNG: No, man, I've seen it. We haven't had a lot of close games. But I
think back to Greensboro, Sanford down six with 50 seconds to play. They never
have that look about them like we've got a problem. You know, Seton Hall takes
a stab at us, take the lead, was never an air of panic, never an air of, oh,
my God, we've got a problem. Next possession, next best action. Figure it out.
And they've done it time and time and time again.  
  
So comforting as a coach to be able to just manage the team. You're not trying
to encourage them. You're not trying to lift their spirits. You're coaching
the team, what's next, what are we looking at. That's a big deal.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously we knew that the record was going to come at some
point tonight for Fletcher, but to have it come in a tournament game, how
gratifying is that for you as a coach to have that all wrapped up into one
special night?  
MIKE YOUNG: Really, really neat. Really neat. And what you don't see, what you
don't have a pulse of is how uncommon he is and how hard he's worked time and
time and time again in that gym. I go over often to watch film. I enjoy it, no
phones, and I can't tell you how many times I walk in that gorgeous building
of ours and there's a ball bouncing, and I know it's him. 9:00 at night, 10:00
at night, and he's not messing around. He's going at it, getting better.  
  
So proud of him, and I can't begin to tell you what a pleasure he has been to
coach and be a part of our program.  
  
Q. Fletcher, being two hours from home, what was the final head count
for friends and family members who showed up?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: It was definitely a lot. I'd say probably around like 50
people or so.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: More than that.  
  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Maybe 75 people. I don't know, I had a lot of some of my high
school friends and teammates came, pretty much all my family that lives in
Orlando, and just a lot of people that I've grown up with and seen along the
way, they all came here to support me. So it was really cool to have everyone
come and for us to get the win like we did.  
  
Q. Did you think it was even cooler to put on a show for them?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: That definitely didn't hurt, either.  
  
Q. This is also for Fletcher but a little different: Obviously your
teammates set good screens for you and all that and you're the most prolific
three-point shooter, so you know how hard it is to work to get open. Did you
feel defensively you guys made it hard for Powell to do his thing? It took him
25 shots to get his points.  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, absolutely. Our game plan was to load over and to really
make it tough on him and frustrate him. I feel like we did a decent job as a
team. I know he ended up getting 27 on us, but we did a decent job as a team
of making his points hard. He hit a lot of tough shots on us.  
  
When the guards got beat off the dribble, the bigs are coming up and helping
over. So it was definitely a collective effort by everyone on the team to
limit his points or at least make it as hard as we could.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Joe Golding](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36896)

### [Jaylen Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36897)

### [Jaren Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36898)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 79, Abilene Christian - 44  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, just some opening thoughts about this game
tonight here in Jacksonville.  
  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, Kentucky is all that. They're really, really good, the best
team we've played this year, them and Texas Tech. We wish them the best of
luck.  
  
I'm proud of our guys. They didn't quit. They represented our university and
our city in a first-class manner tonight and they've done that all year, so
I'm extremely proud of them.  
  
Q. Jaylen and Jaren, how tough was it kind of adjusting to what Kentucky
has personnel-wise?  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: It was pretty tough. We just couldn't make shots, shot 19
percent in the first half, and then the second half we pretty much shot 45 --
45? Yeah, I guess. And just the first half, turning the ball over first half
really hurt us.  
  
JAREN LEWIS: Yeah, it's tough adjusting to all the length at the rim, and we
knew what we had to do, it was just a tough challenge for us getting on the
glass. But yeah, the turnovers killed us, and then we just couldn't see
anything fall in the first half, so it was tough.  
  
Q. Result notwithstanding, what was it like being out there and just
kind of experiencing that and in this setting and this time of year?  
JAREN LEWIS: I mean, it was a great experience being out there for March
Madness and everything. It was great knowing it was the first time in our
school's history, but at the end of the day, it stings losing like that and
being me, Jaylen and Hayden's last game, it hurts, but it was a great
experience, probably something we'll never forget.  
  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: Going off what Jaren said, it was a great experience.
Something we'll never forget. Just knowing we were out there with Kentucky,
one of the biggest schools in the nation and we were just out there competing.  
  
Q. Kind of off what the guys said, not the start you guys would have
wanted, but just what was it like watching this group of guys get to
experience what they did tonight?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, we couldn't score the basketball. I mean, that was the key.
I thought we ran some good stuff there for a while, we just couldn't finish
and we couldn't score. Honestly watching tape, I thought we could score if
they didn't switch us 1 through 5, but Coach Cal knows what he's doing. It's
obvious. He's got really good players, and he's won a ton of games. They
switched 1 through 5 and we couldn't see the rim.  
  
That was the frustrating part, I think, but when you look overall at the game,
I was really proud of our guys and the way they competed in the second half.
It'd been real easy to lay down. Kentucky doesn't have their bench, with guys
hurt. They're continuing to play the same dudes that played the whole game. I
thought we did much better in the second half of competing, and we seen the
ball go gown. So I was proud of them the way they finished.  
  
Listen, these two and Farquhar, these three seniors, they're going to be
celebrated at Abilene Christian for the rest of their lives. They're first
ones to ever do it. There will be second, there will be a third, but there'll
never be a first. We're going to celebrate these guys and we're going to have
a lot of fun celebrating when we get back to Abilene.  
  
It meant a lot. When I looked up there, we had more people in Jacksonville,
Florida than at our game back home. I'm telling you we had more people tonight
and that meant the world to me. Abilene Christian and March Madness filling up
a whole section. If you know where our program came from, that's really,
really awesome.  
  
Q. Nearly a thousand dollars have been raised on a GoFundMe page for
those ripped pants. What are your thoughts on that?  
JOE GOLDING: Well, the suit is done. We are going to retire it. It wasn't very
good luck tonight, man. It's been a heck of a run with it all year.  
  
We are going to do something fun with that money. I'm obviously not going to
spend that money on a suit. I'm going to find a charity or something out there
and we'll figure it out.  
  
Q. This has been one of the best seasons AC has ever had. I'm emotional
because I'm going to be leaving you as a senior and I'm glad you waited until
this year to do it. I've been enjoying covering it. But just talk about this
season overall. You've broken a lot of records, a lot of firsts. Just talk
about the emotions of this season.  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, it's the second year we've been eligible for postseason
play. This is just beginning. This is the beginning, man, it happened really
fast. I'm really glad our university can experience this. I'm glad our players
can. It's going to help our program. It's going to help recruiting and going
to help our university exposure from it. We're going to celebrate it.  
  
But I think it was the best season in ACU history. I don't think it was one of
the best, I think it was the best season in school history, and we're going to
celebrate those three seniors and this team like it was the best because they
deserve it.  
  
Q. Not to close the book too quickly on this year, but what does this do
for you next year and down the road to bring back a group of guys that got to
experience this?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, I mean, time will tell with that, but we have a bunch of
young kids back. We're also losing three really good seniors, but we've got
some good young kids back. We've got to recruit, losing those two four, five
weeks ago made recruiting a little bit different now. We've got to go sign
four guys, we thought we were just signing two.  
  
We've built this on high school kids and a culture and really developing,
evaluating talent and trying to develop, and so we might have to get creative
in recruiting here through grad transfers, JuCo or something, but we're not
going to change who we are, and I think our program is going to move forward
just like our university is going to move forward.  
  
I think our president and board, they had a plan. They wanted to put ACU on
the national map and for the last 48 hours we were, and a lot of that is due
to the University of Kentucky. We owe the University of Kentucky a lot, for
being able to have the opportunity to compete with them, and when they talked
about Kentucky, they learned about Abilene Christian, and that's what I'm most
excited about.  
  
We've got a university that we're really proud of. It's good people there.
It's a good school. It's good academics, it's a great town, and I'm glad it
was celebrated the last three days.  
  
Q. Just again to clarify on the suit, this is the suit you're wearing,
the one that was ripped, and did you get that repaired or managed your way
through it, keeping it hidden from everybody?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, I just wore the jacket tonight. If you knew me well, I
don't usually wear the jacket very long but I kept it on today. But yeah,
there is a hole in there. There's no question about that. Obviously it got a
lot of sound bite, and I'm glad it brought some attention to our university,
but I want to make sure moving forward that this team is celebrated. It's not
my hole in my pants, it's our team, and it's our university because they
deserve it, man. These guys have been incredible, man. I'm fortunate to coach
them. They took me on a hell of a ride, one that I'll never forget the rest of
my life. And you know, and again on the pants, we'll do something with it.
We'll have a little bit of fun and hopefully we can raise some money for a
charity or something down the road.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Tyler Herro](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36361)

### [Keldon Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36360)

### [Reid Travis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32014)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 79, Abilene Christian - 44  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: You know, our defense made it difficult. I told Coach Joe, what
a year they had, winning their tournament, winning their league. That is so
hard, especially when everything rides on that one game. And he's done a --
just turned it around.  
  
But I'll tell you what was special: I went to get a pizza today. You won't
believe that. And a guy comes up to me and said, "I used to coach at Abilene
Christian, and Coach asked me to come on the trip." And he's an older
gentleman. I apologize, I didn't catch the name. But I told Joe before, I
said, that's more impressive to me than anything. I said, too many in our
profession forget where this all started, and the guys that came before us who
made the path for our families to be able to do what we're doing and be paid
obscenely, and it's been guys like that.  
  
So I told Joe that of all that's happened, that impressed me more.  
  
Q. Reid, you waited five years for this moment. I'm curious what it felt
like.  
REID TRAVIS: It felt good. Like you said, it's been a long time. This has
always been a dream of mine playing college basketball, is to be in the
tournament and advance deep in it. This is the first step. I'm just glad I can
enjoy it with my teammates.  
  
Q. I'm curious, Tyler, since you have a potential match-up on Saturday,
certainly not a given, with Wofford, have you heard much about Fletcher Magee
just because of his shooting prowess? 500 threes over a career is just
obscene.  
TYLER HERRO: Yeah, I've watched his highlights. I've heard he's a very good
shooter, so I think it would be a good match-up. Both teams that we'll
potentially play are really good. So we're going to have to prepare for how we
play.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that, how do you feel like your team does when you
have the occasion to defend somebody who's really proficient from three-point
range?  
TYLER HERRO: I think if we just stick to our assignments and whatever the game
plan that the coaches give us, as long as we stick to our assignments, I think
we should be fine.  
  
Q. In a game like this, what keeps you guys motivated to keep the
pressure on throughout the entire time, maybe Keldon talk about that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Can I say something? He didn't keep the pressure on. He can
tell why the rest of the guys did, but he didn't quite --  
  
KELDON JOHNSON: Just knowing Coach Cal is going to stay on us regardless.
Regardless of the score, if we're up 20, 30, or even if it's a close game, if
we miss an assignment he's going to be all over us.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Not missed shot, how about you break down defensively, don't
grab a rebound, throw the ball to the wrong guy on the other team. Yes, I'm
going to -- you missed plenty of shots and I don't say anything, so don't say
that.  
  
Q. He did say "missed assignments".  
JOHN CALIPARI: Oh, you're right. I thought he said missed a shot.  
  
Q. Reid, what was it like not having PJ in there today?  
REID TRAVIS: Obviously it's tough not having PJ with us. He makes our team
better all season. We feel like we play off of each other really well, but I
feel like with my injury a couple weeks back, guys had to step up and fit into
different roles and really just build their confidence.  
  
Unfortunately he's out and we're happy to have him back when he gets healthy
and all that, but we had guys build their confidence over the last couple of
weeks with me being out, but I thought it was good. Guys stepped up and we
were able to play good minutes.  
  
Q. Tyler, coming into the season there were concerns about like your
defense and stuff, but since then you've made major strides throughout the
season. What have you done to improve that? And what's the next step in your
development?  
TYLER HERRO: I think the coaches have been on me since day one, just in
practice every day. My teammates push me to be better defensively, so just
continue to get better every day.  
  
Q. John, can you elaborate a little on PJ's condition and availability
going forward?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, first of all, the option was a boot or the cast. The cast
would speed up the healing, so we said, put the cast on. Whether they'll take
it off tomorrow to check it, I don't know. If they don't, he won't play
Saturday, and then they'll probably try to take it off Tuesday or Wednesday of
next week to see how his foot feels.  
  
Everything was negative as far as the X-rays, but they just want -- it was a
sprained foot, so they just want to keep it calm, so that's what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, before the game you talked about ACU being a good three-point-
shooting team, 40 percent. Tonight you hold them to about 22 percent. Is that
a victory in your game plan tonight?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, the one that we were worried about, the two guys were 5
and 15, and when you look, my man pulled up, he went 1 for 9, and there were a
couple open. After we really guarded he took some tough ones, he missed ones
that you all said, "He never misses that." But it's hard when you've got long
players.  
  
And then their center, Hayden, went 2 for 6, and we left him like twice, and
he missed a couple open ones. But we're a team that tries to get you to drive
because we can block shots. We want you to come to the rim. We don't want you
just shooting threes.  
  
Q. John, you're down one big already; what goes through your mind when
you see Nick get undercut and go down?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, the two practices we had including the practice down
here, very little contact, mainly because if we get another guy hurt, our
staff is going to have to start playing. So you just say, we've got to do
conditioning, we've got to do individuals, we've got to script five-on-0, but
you can't really go at it. So when Nick went down, that's why I said, "Move
your arm around." He did. "You're all right, rub some dirt in it. Let's get
going. Let's go."  
  
But yeah, we're down to seven, eight guys, and it makes it hard.  
  
Q. You guys win the battle of the glass tonight 44 to 17. How happy were
you with that stat line?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, we talked about it. We thought we had an advantage there
mainly because of our size, and Reid's strength, and it was one of the things
we said, if we're going to beat these guys, our rebounding has got to be
really -- we've got to separate from them in that, so I thought we did it.  
  
Q. Coach, just in a game like this, how important was your start to
never really let ACU feel like they were in it and to kind of get on them
early?  
JOHN CALIPARI: In this tournament, it's really important. What happens when
teams are desperate, they'll do stuff they don't usually do, and if you let a
team hang around, something stupid, crazy, like what just happened, can
happen.  
  
But I'll tell you, after the first game, you know, every -- somebody told me
almost every game today was like a hard-fought game. I don't really watch the
games. And I expected this to be some of that unless we got to a good start,
which we did, and we got out of the gate really guarding and blocking shots
and did a pretty good job and shot a high percentage.  
  
Q. Seton Hall and Wofford are playing right now, so what do you feel
about a potential rematch about Seton Hall, and what will you and your team do
differently to get a different outcome this time?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, if PJ doesn't play, we'll have work to do with either
team, and let me tell you, there's no given that the Seton Hall, Wofford,
they're both like -- Seton Hall already beat us. You talk about a well-coached
team of veterans that just march through that league, and that league, when
you talk about Greensboro, we played Greensboro. You know, they had like four
teams in that league that could beat anybody in the country, and so we know
how good that team is, too.  
  
I'll go back and watch this game tape, and I'll wait to see who's going to
win, and then I'll start watching tape on that team.

### [Rick Byrd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18254)

### [Dylan Windler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36879)

### [Kevin McClain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36880)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Maryland - 79, Belmont - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, just start us off with some comments about
this basketball game. Turned out to be a fantastic game, just went the wrong
way for you guys.  
  
RICK BYRD: Thank you. Once again, a lot of credit to Maryland. They made big
plays, big winning plays at the end. I think it's pretty easy to define where
we went wrong, and that was coming out to start the second half and just
letting them run loose on us and go from a deficit to a significant margin.  
  
Now, we're really proud of our guys the way they fought back. You know, if
you're any good, you make a tournament. Unless you win the tournament, you
lose your last game. So totally proud of this team, particularly these two
seniors, for the career they've had, for the season our team has had, and
except for one little deflection, I think we'd be playing Saturday afternoon.  
  
Q. Dylan, totally different game than what you played in Dayton; just
talk about your approach and being more of a scoring weapon in this game and
what it was you did to be able to give them so much trouble.  
DYLAN WINDLER: I wouldn't say I came into this game with any different
approach. I'm always coming into the game with the approach I'm trying to
score and do whatever I can for my team, and tonight I happened to be scoring.
So I got hot early and just continued to stay aggressive and attack and got to
the line a little bit, saw a few shots go and just stayed aggressive.  
  
Q. Rick, you had said that you didn't want to be embarrassed; I'm sure
you're not embarrassed. Just talk about how your team performed on this type
of stage.  
RICK BYRD: Yeah, I guess what I mean by that is any time you're playing a
team, a Big Ten team, a team at this level, you're worried. You're worried
about the difference in athleticism and you're worried about whether you can
score, you're worried about whether you can stop them from scoring, and we had
good reason to worry if we could get the rebound when they didn't score
tonight, and there's just so many ways that they get extra points that we
can't get.  
  
I'm sort of, I guess, preparing for a game, I'm a glass-half-full guy, and I'm
always concerned.  
  
But no, I mean, I would never be embarrassed by the team, just none of us want
to get beat bad. We want to be competitive. There's no question that in this
game that we belonged with a 6 seed from beginning to end. The final score is
going to say that they won and they're going to advance, but once again, we
ran a play, it worked, it was all there, and their kid did a great job of
getting a hand on the pass, or Dylan is shooting a lay-up or dunking it, and
we win or they make some reckless play at the other end and beat us again.  
  
They get the win, we get the loss. That doesn't mean that our performance
wasn't as good as we could ask for.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the mindset going into that last sequence?
Any options you may have had a chance to talk to your team about?  
RICK BYRD: Yeah, we had -- there was a time-out with 59 seconds left, and we
called the play that we ran, a back-door play. Regardless, regardless of what
happened on the other end, we -- if we needed to score quick, we would have
done it sooner. We did exactly the same thing at UCLA that we just did. As it
turned out, something happened that we got the ball inside the shot clock, and
I can't actually tell you what that was, but we ended up with the ball one
down with less than 30 seconds left.  
  
Felt really good about the play. I think our guys felt really good about the
play. When you're playing a team as good as they are and you have a play you
feel really good about, I'd like to think that the odds are on the high side
of 50/50 that it works and you win the game.  
  
You know, there's a lot of people that wouldn't do that, I think. They'd go
ahead and try to get it -- I just didn't have anything I thought was better,
and I thought if we scored it too quick, we'd have a hard time stopping them
from scoring or stopping them from getting the rebound and scoring. I just
felt like the odds were better with us trying to go for one, down one.  
  
Q. For Dylan, can you just take us through that last sequence? Did you
slip because the ball was tipped or did you slip before it was tipped?  
DYLAN WINDLER: Well, obviously I went back door. I thought the pass was a
little short, so yeah, I tried to come back to the ball, slipped trying to get
back to the ball. You know, it was a tough play to make. It was a tight window
for the pass. I would say it's desperation, you have to throw it, so I'm not
blaming anybody on anything. It was, like I said, desperation. He made the
best pass he could. I think it was a little short, so I tried to come back and
get it, and slipped and they got the ball.  
  
RICK BYRD: Yeah, I think the pass would have been there. If the defender on
him didn't get a hand on it, that's a great play by him, but I think it looked
to me like -- I can watch it later. Looked to me like the timing was perfect.
I loved what I saw when Dylan's man bit on the pass fake, and he had good
distance between himself and his man and the kid gets his hand up like he's
supposed to, makes a good play, a winning play.  
  
Q. For Coach Byrd, you mentioned the run coming out after halftime. Did
you notice any adjustments they made that were difficult for you to meet
coming out after halftime?  
RICK BYRD: You know, I think they were going to focus on making us guard them
inside first and foremost, and you know, if you'd have told me that Fernando
was going to be 5 for 10 in the game, I would have been completely happy with
that. But we just -- we've done this, these guys will admit, too often this
year. We've come out of halftime -- in fact, we started coming out earlier,
about two-thirds of the way through the season, to try to get them out there
and going.  
  
We had a lead. We'd played well. But they certainly came out with a far more
aggressive mindset. I think it was way more about that than what they did
different than what they had done in the first half or what we had done
differently. And I think that's to their credit, and it's to our bad.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Tony Benford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36821)

### [Tremont Waters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34356)

### [Skylar Mays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32814)

### [Naz Reid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36822)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
LSU - 79, Yale - 74  
  
TONY BENFORD: First of all, we're excited with obviously being able to survive
and advance. I thought our guys came out and especially in the first half, we
really executed our game plan. We wanted to attack the paint, and I think --
paint points in the first half, we kind of dominated them in the paint. And I
thought we were good defensively in the first half. We did a great job getting
to their shooters, making it tough for those guys to get to the paint.  
  
I thought the second half we came out and gave up some easy baskets, but I
give them all credit. They're a good team. They play with a lot of confidence,
a lot of poise, and they made some big shots when they needed to. But we were
able to make some free throws down the stretch that enabled us to win the
game. We got some stops that we needed down the stretch. But we're really,
really happy to have the win.  
  
Q. Naz, what was it like for you, your NCAA Tournament debut? How did it
live you are to your dreams or expectations coming in?  
NAZ REID: It was a pretty tough, hard-nosed team who didn't let up, and they
were very competitive, and that's something we are going to see throughout the
whole March Madness.  
  
Q. After having such a close game against Florida go the other way, how
nice was it for you to bounce back at crunch time and stave off that late
push?  
TREMONT WATERS: Obviously the Florida game didn't go the way we wanted it to
go, but as a team we were able to grow from it and pretty much learn what we
had to do and made free throws, like Coach said, and everything just fell into
place for us.  
  
Q. Naz, was that game a little closer than you had hoped, and what can
you learn from that game that you can take to move on Saturday and hopefully
going forward?  
NAZ REID: I mean, just controlling the lead, controlling the tempo on both
sides of the floor. As far as the whole team, just playing our best and going
out and playing hard as we can.  
  
Going forward, it's a lot -- no discredit to Yale, but it's going to be a lot
of tougher teams going forward, so we've just got to be able to balance
everything out and do what we do best.  
  
Q. Naz, Kavell Bigby-Williams came up big early in the game with four
blocks. How much easier does he make your job whenever he's on like that?  
NAZ REID: I mean, he's tremendous. He makes my job way easier than it has to
be. You know, if a guy gets by me or baseline, Kavell is right there and he's
able to stop the person with the ball, and he's a big help to all of us.  
  
Q. 45 points in the first half, what was the key to coming out so hot
offensively?  
SKYLAR MAYS: I'd just say we were aggressive and we had a great game plan
getting into the paint and using our size advantage, and Naz did a great job
getting in the paint, Tremont was all over the place, and all these guys did a
great job.  
  
Q. Tremont or anybody else, could you talk a little bit about the factor
for KBW early? Three rejections in the first five and a half minutes; did you
kind of sense that Yale was a little bit altering their shots and making it
really difficult to get those inside points for them, at least early on?  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, going into the game, or the whole time, I just spoke to
Kavell, and that's his role on this team, he does that, and altering shots is
something he's great at. So just going into the game we spoke to him about
that, and he was able to get three or four blocks, and that kind of made Yale
think about going in there a second time, and that's why they started shooting
pull-ups.  
  
Copeland, he's really good at that. And then just making them shoot outside
shots. So having a presence like him down there just makes our job a lot
easier, like Naz said.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about Naz and what he brings to the team
overall and how you felt he played today? Obviously he was the biggest guy on
the court, they didn't have anyone that could really match up?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, Naz has been great to coach. He's fun. He's in tremendous
shape. He's really changed his body. But we wanted to play through him. We
wanted to get paint touches. That's one of our game standards was get 50 or
more paint touches. I thought we did that establishing the paint points early,
and Naz did a great job. Stepped out, I don't know if he made a three, might
have made one, I'm not sure, but we've just got to keep playing through him
moving forward, and we've got to do a great job on the defensive end, as well,
too.  
  
Q. What was your assessment of how things started to kind of slip away a
little bit, when the lead went from 16 down to 8, and Yale wasn't even making
3-point shots at that time but yet -- did you feel like your team got a little
bit unsettled, a little out of rhythm?  
TONY BENFORD: The thing is we're in the NCAA Tournament. I've been to the
tournament as a player, coach for years, a lot of years. There's good teams in
the tournament. They're going to make a run. Basketball is a game of runs.
They made a good run.  
  
I thought there was a couple times where guys that -- I don't know if we were
pointing fingers at one another, we had some defensive breakdowns and I think
guys were challenging their teammates, and we talk about that, taking
ownership and keeping one another accountable. We tried to do that, but I
think they were able to regroup through all that and through adversity to make
some free throws. But Yale is a quality team. They've won a lot of games, beat
some quality opponents and we knew it was going to be a tough game. So I want
to give them some credit, too.  
  
Q. What did you feel you guys did well on defense to hold Miye Oni to
just five points and limit Yale 8 of 37 from three in that game?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, well, the kid Marlon Taylor we have, he's one of the best
athletes in the ACC. Really good defender. Marlon is about 6'5", 6'6". We told
him it's going to be a challenge. Oni is a really good player, he's a pro
prospect, and I thought Marlon did a really good job of really being there on
the catch and making it difficult for him to get to the rim, and I thought he
challenged his three-point shots really well. So I thought Marlon Taylor did a
really good job.  
  
Q. Tony, you guys have been in so many close games during the regular
season. Did you sense anything was different in this game or did you feel it
was a comfort zone with your players, even though Yale is making a run and
they're cutting your lead down? Did you feel like you still had things under
control emotionally?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, I thought that we had to get some stops. That's what I
kept preaching to our guys, hey, we've got to keep our poise and we've got to
make sure we get stops down the stretch, and then finish those defensive
possessions with rebounds. They hit some tough shots, but I thought we were
able to come down and execute in the half court. We got Naz, I think we cut it
-- I forget, about four, six, we ran a play to get Naz an easy baskets, and
then came down and got some stops. But we made our free throws.  
  
You're right, played a lot of close games and were fortunate to pull this one
out today.  
  
Q. What would you say to anybody who maybe pays scant attention to LSU
basketball, just watching it, and they see the news developments the last few
weeks, who would think in any way disparagingly about your program because of
allegedly possibly a rogue decision made by a coach that didn't involve any of
the players except for possibly one on your team?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, bottom line, we're not going to worry about the outside
noise. We've got good character kids, OK, and you've got Skylar Mays, Scholar-
Athlete of the Year in the SEC, and we've got some really good quality kids on
our team. So we're just going to control what we can control and that's
getting better every day, getting ready to prepare for our next opponent.
That's all we can control. Outside noise, we can't worry about that, all we
can control is the inside noise. That's all we're going to worry about.  
  
Q. Kavell obviously had a huge impact on the game defensively, but also
I thought offensively put-backs. Can you talk about how he almost seems like
at times an afterthought with this team but some of the importance he has in
the game?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, Kavell is kind of X factor like Tre said. Should have been
in the SEC All-Defensive Team. Does a great job. First of all, he's smart.
He's got a high IQ, does a great job of communicating to his teammates out
there. And he really absorbs all scouting reports. That's one thing. He takes
it to the court and helps the other guys out, so he's always in great position
because of that. He watches a lot of film on who he's going to defend and
everything.  
  
He's been huge for us this year, like Naz said, he will really covers up for
Naz and those guys. If they make a mistake, they knows he's back there to
protect the rim.  
  
Q. After a blazing hot first half y'all seemed to struggle to find good
looks in the second half. What do you think contributed to that? Was that on
your end or was that an adjustment they made?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, I think a combination of both. Again, Yale, Coach Jones
does a great job. They've got a lot of pride and they got some guys that can
make some shots. They hit some big shots, and I thought we got -- we were kind
of stagnant there in the second half. We didn't execute as well as we needed
to, and we settled too much. I thought we settled for some jumpers when we
should have -- we wanted, again, to continue to attack the paint like we did
in the first half. I didn't think we did that in the second half until we had
to.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [Fletcher Magee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36915)

### [Cameron Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36916)

### [Matthew Pegram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36917)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. Fletcher, I want to go back to the beginning of the recruiting
process. At the time what made you believe that Wofford was the right place
for you? And then the second part of it is what's allowed you to become such a
successful three-point shooter within the offense?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: So the first part of the question, the recruiting process, I
just felt that Wofford really wanted me and really valued me as a recruit. I
felt like one of the main recruits and important. So I went up there and I
visited and I just loved the team, the culture and all the people at Wofford,
so I committed pretty soon after my visit because I just really liked
everything.  
  
And the second part, I think a lot of that is the system that we have, guards
coming off screens a lot, my teammates looking for me a lot. I think those are
two of the main things, and then obviously you have to work on your game and
get in the gym and shoot as much as you can. So I think the combination of
shooting in the gym and getting your confidence in your shot and then having
coaches run plays for you in the offense and having your teammates, good
passers, good screeners get you the ball, I think that combination has allowed
for a lot of success.  
  
Q. Fletcher, having a chance to play the biggest games of your career
essentially in your backyard, what does that mean to you?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I think it's really cool because a lot of my family and
friends can come up from Orlando. Also Cam's freshman year I actually watched
them as a recruit play here against Arkansas, so to come back now as a player
to the same site, I thought that was pretty cool, too.  
  
Q. For Fletcher, closing in on this national record, I also know your
high school career ended against a Jacksonville team in Providence four years
ago. What would it mean to be able to sort of turn the tables in sort of a
career highlight coming in Jacksonville, if you're able to get that win out
here tomorrow?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, that would definitely mean a lot. High school was a long
time ago. I don't really think about that loss to Providence too much. Yeah,
to come here to Jacksonville and to get a win here in the tournament, two
wins, yeah, would be great. Just for all of us, for our team, our program, our
school, I think that coming in here and winning could definitely be something
that we value and will remember for a long time.  
  
Q. Every year when the NCAA Tournament comes around, there's always a
team or a player that captures the country's heart, and Wofford has garnered
some of that hype this year, and Seton Hall to an extent, as well. When you
consider something like that, how do you go about approaching a game and
trying to find a sense of normalcy knowing that people are out there looking
for someone to believe in and someone to follow along throughout this
tournament?  
MATTHEW PEGRAM: We're just going to try to approach it like we would any other
game. The hype is built the past couple months of the season, so we've kind of
gotten used to it in a way, but we're just going to try to approach it just
like any other game.  
  
Q. Cam, can you talk about being back here and the difference from last
time, being back here as a higher seed and your feelings about that?  
CAMERON JACKSON: Being back as a higher seed is not something that I don't
think any of us are really thinking about, nothing I'm thinking about for
sure. But it is cool to get another chance to play here, another chance to win
here at this stage. It's just amazing to have another opportunity like this.  
  
Q. Cameron, having had this opportunity four years ago as a freshman,
coming here against Arkansas, first of all, did you ever feel you'd get
another chance at this, especially on this same stage right here, and what is
the sense of anticipation knowing for you this is one more opportunity, one
more chance to go that one step further that you didn't get to do before?  
CAMERON JACKSON: Yeah, I mean, it's really cool that we're back here, and
Arkansas was a really good game for the team. We lost by three, had two really
good shots at winning the game. Were tied to go into overtime. So it's
definitely really cool to be back here. Always extremely thankful for an
opportunity to play another game, especially in the postseason in a place like
Jacksonville is another great thing that we are able to experience.  
  
Q. Is there anything you've been able to do to maybe help your teammates
adjust to what the atmosphere is going to be like here, what the experience is
like?  
CAMERON JACKSON: We haven't really talked about it a lot yet, honestly, just
trying to enjoy the little bit of time that we've had together here, the
experience that has already come about being in Jacksonville, a part of this
process, just trying to really sit back and enjoy it and really enjoy being
here in the moment right now.  
  
Q. Fletcher, you've garnered obviously a lot of attention over the past
couple months especially, but now that you're on this macro stage where all
these eyes are on you and you know that teams are going to be looking at,
especially for your abilities in particular, does that change your approach at
all and open up any options for your teammates maybe in the process or affect
your game in any way?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: I don't think I'm going to change my approach too much. I
think that teams in our league have played us for a long time and done some
things. I'm sure teams that haven't seen us are looking at what they can do
and strategy-wise and stuff. So I'm just going to continue to do what I do,
and we'll make adjustments from there.  
  
You know, if they're maybe double-teaming off of screens, I think we can
definitely open up some stuff for our teammates, but we'll just kind of see
how the game starts and make reads and adjustments from there.  
  
Q. The New York Post called you Wofford's Steph Curry. When you hear
something like that, what goes through your head?  
FLETCHER MAGEE: Yeah, I know that Steph has done way more great things than I
have and was a better player, but it's definitely high praise. But I don't
want to get too caught up into the comparisons and all that kind of stuff.  
  
Q. Matthew, could you just talk about what it's like to represent
Wofford on this national stage, such a small school that you're coming from?  
MATTHEW PEGRAM: Yeah, getting a chance to remember Wofford on a national stage
is great. It's something we're all very proud to do, something we're all proud
to put the Wofford jersey on on a national scale. To do it in the NCAA
Tournament is the biggest stage, and I think we're all looking really forward
to what's to come.  
  
Q. A Southern Conference championship over a UNCG team that a lot of
people thought were in talks to get an at-large bid, what kind of win, coming
in behind in the second half, what does that do for you momentum-wise moving
into this game?  
CAMERON JACKSON: I think that just any win against a quality opponent is going
to give you a bit of confidence coming into your next game. But at this stage,
everybody here has won at a high rate and is a very good and talented team. So
we're excited to get another opportunity. I don't think we're really thinking
about the past as much. I think we're confident that we can go out and
compete, though.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Pleasure to be back in Jacksonville. We have had a remarkable year
to date, 29-4 I think it is. Went through a really, really good Southern
Conference season with a number of excellent teams, you know, unscathed, which
I'll never understand as long as I live. But it is a treat to be here. We've
been fortunate enough to play in five of these in the last ten years. Three of
them have been in Jacksonville. I love coming down here, and it's a pleasure
to be back.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on Myles Powell? What jumps out at you the
most when you watch film of him?  
MIKE YOUNG: If I watch one more video of Myles, yeah, just an elite scorer and
he's got all the tricks. I think of New York City, New Jersey guys that can
really score the ball, shot fake, get you in the air, get into you, get
fouled, unlimited range. You try to press up and he blows your doors off and
gets into your post players, where he's terrific in getting fouled.  
  
He is just a really, really talented basketball player. I'll tell you
something else that I've been impressed with him, he makes the right play.
He's a good basketball player. You see Marquette and you see Villanova and you
see these others that try to do some things to him to negate his ability to
get shots off. He throws the ball to people when they're open, and I admire
that about him. Myles Powell is terrific. I've enjoyed watching him play. I
don't know that I'll enjoy seeing him play my team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Given what Fletcher Magee does, there's no secret. How has he been
able to be so successful knowing teams are going to focus on his shooting game
after game? And then go back a few years, why was he such an important recruit
for you?  
MIKE YOUNG: You know, the second question first, I don't know that any of us
know coming in that he's going to score 500 threes and 2,500 points. His high
school coach is a great coach, Chris Mayberry, at First Academy, has been
there a long time. If I had a nickel for every time I had a high school coach
tell me kids will be the hardest worker you've ever had, I'd have some money,
and I respectfully internally thought to myself, yeah, I've heard that again;
here we go.  
  
He is the hardest worker I've ever been around. To the point last week, I
thought he was hurting himself. Sometimes you have to save him from himself.
"You need to take a break, all right, relax. Okay, we're practicing for an
hour, hour and a half every day. You're in here at 7:00 to 8:00, you're over
here again at night." Man, I said, "I'm not telling you you have to sit -- you
have to relax, because I know if I do that and you want to do it, you're still
going to do it, but I'm telling you, you need to rest your body."  
  
Of course I saw him later that night. He's down there, and I said, "See, I
told you, that's why I didn't tell you not to do it." He said, "I'm just
shooting foul shots and lay-ups, foul shots and lay-ups, not breaking a
sweat." He's an animal, and in the best way. He is the finest young man. He's
meant a lot to us, but never in a million years did I think he would be this
good. I mean, he is -- and he's gotten bigger and stronger, you know, as they
all do. David Land, our strength coach, has done a great job with him in the
year that he's been with us, and he's better prepared to take a lick, and
he'll take some licks tomorrow now, with Cale and McKnight, those others that
will be matched up with him. But he can get through that contact better now,
and he's really worked on his handling, creating separation and gets to the
edge. He's a really good athlete. He is a much better athlete than most expect
him to be.  
  
Q. It's been since March 12th since you guys figured out that you had
secured the bid to the NCAA Tournament. It'll have been a week since you guys
played. What's been the message to the team throughout the time of indecision
not knowing who you're going to play and keeping the energy up during
practices?  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah, I get the impression that some people see it as a negative
that, gosh, it's been 10 days since you played, will you be rusty. I think
it's the best. I mean, I love it. To have the opportunity to win that, know
you're in, last Monday when we beat Greensboro, you go into the weekend not
knowing who you're going to play, watch friends sweat it out in their league
tournaments, and then you find out where you're going on Sunday.  
  
I think the opportunity to collect your thoughts, decompress, rest up a little
bit, get back and practice and work on Wofford and not be so concerned. It's
so repetitive, preparation, preparation, play, preparation, play, to be able
to take a step back and look at some other things with a critical eye and work
on those I think is very, very beneficial.  
  
Q. I'm not sure how well you know Kevin Willard. I'm just curious what
your impression of the coaching job he's done this year after what he lost
last year and what stands out about him?  
MIKE YOUNG: I don't know Kevin at all. I don't know Seton Hall very well,
honestly. You hear all these projections and they say this school, they say
this school, and then Seton Hall pops up, and it's like, oh, gosh. But I have
thoroughly enjoyed -- he makes you uncomfortable, and I admire that. And
match-up and 2-2-1, back to match-up and man-to-man and switch some things and
not switch some things.  
  
Kevin is -- he's exceptional. I mean, I've seen them play. I don't know how
many times I've seen them play now. But he's an awfully fine basketball coach.
I'm sure the match-up is what his dad employed at Pittsburgh and Holy Cross
and such a great coach. I wish my dad could give me some help. I talked to him
last night, and I said, "Do you have any pointers?" He said, "Yeah, get Magee
and Jackson more shots." Thanks, dad. Appreciate it.  
  
But Kevin is really, really good. There's a lot of things that go -- I
referenced a great coach. A great coach to me is a team that plays really,
really hard, and his team plays really, really hard. Trying to get a better
understanding of Seton Hall and Kevin's team, talked to some people, without
divulging great Big East secrets, every one of them referenced how hard they
play, and they will never stop. They keep coming.  
  
The physicality and toughness is a part of their game that I admire greatly.  
  
Q. You've had two near misses here. What comes to mind when you think
about the past games here, and then coming back as a higher seed?  
MIKE YOUNG: 0 for 4, bad coaching. You know, and here we are again.  
  
I love coming down here. This is three of the five years that we've been a
part of this great tournament been in Jacksonville. I love the city. I love
the arena. You know, and our two closest games were 2010 against Wisconsin, a
tie game with a minute to play, and John Leuer hits a short quarter jumper and
we get beat. And a really good Arkansas team, we were a 12, they were a 5,
Bobby Portis, Michael Qualls, we're right there, led for a lot of that game,
if I recall correctly, 20, 22 minutes of that game and lost 56-53.  
  
You know, there's a lot of things that make it the greatest tournament of them
all, one of which is you know you're going to play somebody really, really
good. And we're the 7 seed. That's a heck of a seed for anyone. I think the
highest seed a Southern Conference team has ever achieved, and lo and behold
you've got to play a Big East team Seton Hall that just went nose to nose with
the defending national champion.  
  
You know, we know what's in front of us. I've got a really good team. You know
that. And we're excited to be here. We're excited to take to the floor
tomorrow and get after it.  
  
Q. You mentioned the games here with Wisconsin and with Arkansas. What
do you feel you were able to learn from those that can help you know what to
tell the team what to be prepared for, what the arena is like, everything from
a preparation standpoint?  
MIKE YOUNG: You know, I wish there was something -- three things that I could
give them. You're going to be faced with this, you've got to be prepared to
handle this. I can't. It's a different -- it's a bit different, all right, it
is the NCAA Tournament. We knew playing Greensboro that we were going to play
again. Wherever that might be, we were going to do it again. Coming over here
tomorrow and playing Seton Hall, there's some things on the line. The media
exposure and the arena and the crowd and all that, you rely on toughness and
you rely on experiences that you've had throughout the year at Furman,
capacity crowd and you find a way to win, at East Tennessee state, huge crowd,
really good team, and you find a way to win. You rely on internal leadership,
and I have three guys in Cameron Jackson, Matt Pegram and Fletcher Magee that
have been through it. I have had some great moments and have had some moments
that haven't been so great.  
  
And all of those experiences culminate here in this tournament, and you know,
you just hope you can play another good ball game.  
  
I think a lot about that. I think, gosh, I hope we play well. We haven't
played poorly in -- we haven't played poorly all year. Now, we got our tail
kicked a couple of times, the wheels came off at Phog Allen Fieldhouse, but
that's a tie game where we are right there with ten to play. It's been a
special team, and we know how well we have to play and the toughness we're
going to have to display and the ball handling that we're going to have to
carry into that thing tomorrow if we expect to win.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. Take us through the late-season push here to get to the tournament,
and now you're finally here. What have the last few days been like coming from
the tournament to now?  
MICHAEL NZEI: At the beginning of the season, we had a goal as a team to try
to get to the dance, so towards the end of the season, we had to give
everything we had, so we had to do everything we could and play as a team and
try to come to the dance. So we did that by winning the last couple of games
and going into the Big East and making a run to the final.  
  
Q. What was the toughest part of the last month or so? What's the most
difficult part?  
MYLES POWELL: Just having our backs against the wall and pretty much everybody
doubting us. We knew what we had to do, and pretty much our season was on the
line and we just had to believe in each other and just keep fighting, and
that's been our story all year, just to keep fighting.  
  
Q. What's this like, how is this different? You've been here before,
especially you two guys, how is this different now that it's your team? What's
changed or what's the feel from past years?  
MYLES POWELL: For me it was easy following the four seniors. They did such a
great job on and off the court of leading this program to the right direction,
so I mean, now the spotlight is on all us three right here and it's different.
But we're definitely ready for it, our coach has prepared us for it, and we've
got each other's back.  
  
Q. Myles, can you talk about that fight a little bit? How much of that
comes from Kevin, and you talked a little bit about his toughness and how that
permeates through the team.  
MYLES POWELL: Just it being the Big East. Big East basketball, that's what
it's all about. That was just a group of kids pretty much fighting for what
they wanted, a championship. We were just out there battling. It was nothing
towards Marquette. I mean, it's all love at the end of the day, we talk to
those guys off the court. But when we step inside those lines, we don't have
friends, and we were just trying to get to a championship.  
  
Q. Kevin Willard, sorry, not Marquette.  
MYLES POWELL: Coach Willard, he's a great guy on and off the court, but he
definitely knows what he wants, and he has to push us to get to where we want
to go. We just follow Coach Willard's lead, and he's been doing a pretty good
job.  
  
Q. You had that stretch about a month ago where you dropped three
straight - to Xavier, to St. John's, to Georgetown, where you're very much
going towards the bubble, if not the wrong side of the bubble. What changed
after that to get you to where you are right now?  
QUINCY McKNIGHT: You know, the Georgetown game was a tough one for us, losing
in double overtime, and I think it was just our fight. We knew our potential,
the games that we have won previous and non-conference. We had a good non-
conference, and just those three games, losing those was tough for us, you
about we knew we could bounce back and we knew we could make a run, and that's
all Coach really pushed for, to make a run. Last year with the four seniors,
we were kind of in the same predicament where we had to win a lot of games to
make it to the tournament, and we just fight. That's what our motto has been
all year, just keep fighting, and that's all we really did was just keep
pushing.  
  
Q. Myles, when we were in New York at the Big East Tournament, you
obviously went on a tear there and you really embraced just everything that
the tournament was, the sell-out crowds and the attention and everything. And
I guess even though you've been to the tournament before, how much more are
you looking forward to this opportunity to really putting your mark on this
event?  
MYLES POWELL: Like I said, the past two years I've been here, I pretty much
had the seniors to lean on, so I was just following Angel's lead. But this
year the guys are leaning on me for the emotional part, and just following my
lead on the court. It's kind of different when everybody is following your
lead.  
  
Q. Obviously the last time out, Villanova you had a very difficult, very
draining kind of game emotionally. How do you come back from that emotionally
going after a stretch where you've just beaten in the last 10-day stretch, you
beat a defending national champion, you beat a top-20 team twice and you lose
by two to a national champion? How do you get back into something, into a
routine where things are a little more -- where you keep the momentum going in
the right direction but you also don't burn out?  
MICHAEL NZEI: I think it's all about preparation. We have a great coaching
staff that's worked with us all summer to get us mentally prepared for the ups
and downs of the season. So the season is a grind, so sometimes you get down,
you have to pick yourself back up, like during the Big East Tournament we had
to play back-to-back nights. So it's just the toughness in us and the support
from our coaches that kept us going.  
  
Q. Q, I wanted to ask you, I know we talked about this during the
season, but what was it like for you to have to change your game coming from
Sacred Heart and sitting out last year? How was that mentally and physically
to change your style to be less of a scorer and more of a distributor?  
QUINCY McKNIGHT: It didn't really change my style. High school, my last year
in prep school, I played point guard a lot, and then I got to Sacred Heart my
freshman year and I played a little bit, but I wasn't coached as well as coach
Willard has. We didn't have as good a coaching staff as we have now. And it's
just preparation like Michael said. The year I sat out, I worked a lot with
Coach Holloway, Coach Willard and everybody just worked with me. And then
Coach Skinn came in this summer, Guys like that, and they just kept working
with me. And Coach Skinn, he's a great point guard. He played professionally,
he's a great point guard, great mentor for me.  
  
And basically just being -- just, I don't know the word to explain it, just
being able to adapt. We've got Myles, a guy who everybody knows can score the
ball, and my guys, they just kept with me and just told me keep pushing and
just fight really, and that's really what it was. I'm a good player and I
think I'm real versatile, so I just focused on being a distributor over the
summer and just working on everything, and I think that's really why I'm
playing the way I am.  
  
Q. It seems like you guys in the Big East haven't gotten a lot of
respect nationally this year. What kind of an opportunity is this for you guys
to change that narrative?  
MICHAEL NZEI: I mean, at this point we as a team, we didn't get a lot of
respect going into the season, but we're only looking at what we have within
us, so we're just out here ready to prove and show people what we can do, so
we're really just worried about ourselves as a team and just trying to get the
job done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Just start us off with some general thoughts about the stretch
run here and being back in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I'm really proud of my team, the way we've played really
since February 9th. We've really been playing aggressively defensively. We've
been playing great together. Myles Powell has been absolutely off the charts.
But I think I've been proud of my sophomores. They've really grown up. Quincy
McKnight has given us such a spark defensively. And our guys coming off the
bench I just think have been so steady. We've gotten such great production,
Shavar Reynolds has given us big minutes, Romaro Gill has really grown up.
Jared Rhoden and Anthony Nelson, my two freshmen, I've been so happy with
their development.  
  
And we had three great games in the Big East Tournament and had a great shot
to win it with the right guy taking it, and just really proud of getting back
to this point four years in a row. It just shows you a lot about the character
of the kids on this team and the leadership of Myles Powell, how much he's
meant to this team and how much he's grown.  
  
Q. You mentioned him when you were running down the roster just now, but
how much have you been impressed and also appreciative of the way Q has kind
of sometimes had to sacrifice his own offense to, number one, play so hard on
the defensive end, always guarding the other team's best guy, and the fact
that he's become so much of a distributor rather than looking to score the
ball himself that often?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I think the most important development for Q is I think
he's found a nice balance about when to score and when to be a facilitator.
And it's hard. He works as hard as anyone I've seen on the defensive end. He
takes a lot of pride in it. He takes up the challenge that he's had to play
against Markus Howard, Phil Booth, the list goes on of the guys he's had to
guard. I love the fact that he accepts those challenges and he looks forward
to it.  
  
Offensively I think he's really grown at the point guard spot, and he's a
major reason why we're here.  
  
Q. Kevin, you mentioned Myles, obviously, and you would have confidence
in him I'm sure no matter what, over three years you've watched him and
obviously this year in a much different role, but to see how he's played down
the stretch carrying you and obviously in the Big East Tournament, I guess how
much better does that make you feel, and I guess how much are you looking
forward to seeing what he can do kind of just embracing the spotlight that's
going to be on him?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, you know, I saw, I think, last year going into the NCAA
Tournament, I really started to see him gain the confidence that you're now
seeing, and I saw it, and I think the older guys last year really kind of
pushed him in the -- I thought he had a great NCAA Tournament last year.  
  
The way he's kind of willed this team over the last two weeks, I mean, we've
had a really stressful last two weeks, the two home games against Marquette
and Nova, and then obviously the three games in the Big East Tournament, the
way he's handled that, his maturity, his leadership has been phenomenal. You
know, it's -- but more than anything, I think he really challenged himself to
play at a high level, and sometimes it's easy to lead and sometimes it's great
to be a guy that can pat someone on the butt and say "great job," but he has
stepped up to the plate and he has played out of this world.  
  
I think the way he has played with his confidence, that has trickled down to
all the other guys, and they feed off him. He just deserves a ton of credit
for the amount of -- as much as he's worked this year and as hard as he's
played, he's just been spectacular.  
  
Q. When you constructed the non-conference schedule, how much of it was
geared toward this moment, and how did you know that your team was ready to
handle that?  
KEVIN WILLARD: You know, scheduling has become really difficult, and I didn't
know about the NET when I did my -- I was going off the RPI when I did our
non-conference schedule, so I wasn't quite sure -- when they changed to the
NET, it kind of threw me for a loop because home losses really hurt you. The
amount scored hurts you. I did a non-conference schedule because I looked at
the league and I knew the league was going to be really good, but I thought it
was going to be exactly the way it was this year. I thought it was going to be
extremely balanced top to bottom. I didn't think we were going to have Nova 1
seed, Xavier 1 seed, Butler -- last year was, I mean, we were packed at the
top. And so when I looked at the league in the non-conference, I really
thought we needed to play some teams that were going to be from leagues that
were going to really help our RPI, and that's kind of -- the way I looked at
the non-conference schedule was I had a young team that I wanted to test, and
I wanted to be Big East ready, and I thought that we needed help through the
RPI with our non-conference schedule, strength of schedule, and that would be
-- that would help get us to this point.  
  
I still think it did. I think our non-conference schedule was phenomenal, and
I think it helped grow this team and make them not only ready for this right
now, but most importantly, for the future. I look at this team going forward,
and I'm excited, just as excited about that as I am being here right now.  
  
Q. Just to follow, do you think you'll continue to do that scheduling in
the future?  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, I --  
  
Q. Do you know if you'll play Kentucky in future years?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I don't -- I really don't want to play Kentucky again.
(Laughter).  
  
No, I'm changing our non-conference schedule. I think just looking at what
seeds happen, where people ended up, it didn't seem like league schedule
mattered as much as some of your losses at home or some of your point spreads.
So I think I'm definitely going back right now and I'm looking at my schedule
to see where I can balance it out a little bit more. I'm still trying to get a
feel for -- because seeding is everything in this tournament. I mean, we're a
10 and Wofford is a 7, and I think they're -- they should be a 5 or a 4,
looking at their schedule and who they've played and how they've played.  
  
So I'm looking at it more or less -- I'm dissecting it. It will not be as
difficult as it was last year. It'll be much more balanced hopefully.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Anthony Cowan Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36902)

### [Bruno Fernando](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36903)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. You guys started 16-3 in the second half, back half of the season.
Take us through that and how you kind of rallied down the stretch to move into
the tournament. How has it been for your team?  
ANTHONY COWAN JR: Yeah, we just pulled it all together. I think in the
beginning, we were still trying to find ourselves a little bit, and then we
kind of went on a little run. I think we went on a six or seven-game winning
streak and then we started winning some games in a row, and then -- I'm pretty
happy about how the season turned out.  
  
Q. The road wins especially, you guys did that.  
ANTHONY COWAN JR: Definitely.  
  
Q. How did that work?  
ANTHONY COWAN JR: We definitely have a young group this year, but like I said,
in the beginning it was kind of rough. Everybody was kind of still trying to
find out their role, and then like I said, we just kind of pulled it all
together.  
  
Q. Bruno, what's the toughest part about going out on the road and
having to get the job done away from College Park?  
BRUNO FERNANDO: I would probably say the environment. You're not playing at
home, you don't have your fans supporting you, and I think just being able to
play and like a lot of the guessing there and knowing the plays and
everything, just hearing the coach and like talking to your teammates, staying
aggressive and keep the communication going throughout the team, I think
that's really the key for us on the road to try to get the wins.  
  
Q. Is there any difference in having to prepare for a team like Belmont
in a situation like this where you didn't know your opponent until last night?
Obviously not a lot of time to prepare for them.  
ANTHONY COWAN JR: We do what we do against any opponent. Obviously Belmont is
a really good team, but I think we're just going to stay with our defensive
principles, do what we do on offense, and then we've just got to treat it like
another game.  
  
BRUNO FERNANDO: I think it gives us a lot more time to prepare and work on
ourselves. Like I said, they're a great team, you've got to respect them, but
at the end of the day, it's about us playing Maryland basketball.  
  
Q. Did you guys watch the game together as a team last night?  
BRUNO FERNANDO: Yeah, we did.  
  
Q. After the end of the season, losing three of the last four, I guess
particularly the Penn State game and the Nebraska game in the Big Ten
Tournament, how do you bounce back from that and try to keep confidence as
high as it can be going into the test of the NCAA Tournament?  
BRUNO FERNANDO: I think we've got to just stay positive. That's the beauty of
sport, and I think there's always a next half, next shot, next game, and we've
got another chance to play another game here. I think just us staying
positive, I think our team is progressing as the game goes on, as the season
goes on. Just like I said, being here, being selected as one of the teams to
play here, it's an opportunity for us to really leave everything else behind
and just focus on what we got in front of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, start us off with some opening thoughts about your team
and how you've gotten into the tournament the last few weeks.  
  
MARK TURGEON: Well, obviously we've extremely excited to be here. It's been
quite a journey for this young team to get to this point. I think we have the
second youngest team in the tournament, fourth youngest overall this year, and
we played a very difficult schedule in a great Big Ten. It's been a great
journey. We're really proud of ourselves and happy to be here, and hopefully
going to be playing our best basketball this weekend.  
  
Excited, guys have been locked in since the Big Ten Tournament, had some
really good practices, and looking forward to playing Belmont. I've known Rick
when I was a head coach at Jacksonville State 21 years ago and kind of watched
him do what he's done over the last 21 years. He's been doing it longer than
that, since I came in his life really happy for his team, and they've got a
really good basketball team, maybe his best team that he's had, and he's had a
lot of great ones.  
  
Q. Expounding a little bit on what you know about Coach Byrd, other than
Mark Few at Gonzaga, there may not be a whole lot of other mid-major programs
you could find that have had the level of consistency that Belmont has had
over the last 21 years. Do you think in some ways, even though Rick is very
much appreciated by the coaches in the industry, that from the outside, there
may be a lot of respect for what he's done but maybe not as much of an
appreciation because resources that mid-majors don't have compared to the
Power Five?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, obviously he's extremely well respected in our profession,
and my relationship started -- we were in the Trans-Atlantic and they were
thinking about joining our league, so we talked a lot when I was at
Jacksonville State 21 years ago, and we talked. So I followed his career. And
then he was at Nashville with Kevin Stallings, who was a friend of mine, and
Kevin I used to get together with him and talk X's and O's, he always bragged
about Rick, and I've always watched Rick's teams play.  
  
You know, guys make choices in life. We all know Rick could have coached at
the highest level of college basketball, and his mind is so great, and his
demeanor is so great he could have coached at the NBA level, I'm sure, if the
opportunity was right. But he chose to be where he's comfortable.  
  
I think what he's done the best is continue to recruit the kids that fit his
style, and obviously he's a terrific evaluator and a terrific developer of
talent. It shows.  
  
We all know his mind offensively. He's terrific. He ran a couple really nice
plays last night after time-outs, so we know he's terrific.  
  
It is tough. They're not on TV as much, all that kind of thing, so nationally
he might not be as well known, but I think the whole country was watching last
night, so I'm sure that changed a few things.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that, the game last night, his leading scorer is 16
points under his normal average, he gets outscored 14-2 in one run in the
first half, gets outscored 21-5 in another stretch, yet still wins the game by
double digits. What does that say about the whole sum of the parts and the
whole -- just being able to weather when you're not kind of at your -- kind of
have some really bad stretches and yet still are able to win?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, I think both teams went through that. But what I was most
impressed about was Windler has two buckets, I believe, had the three early
and then the back-door play late, but he had 14 rebounds. He had three or four
steals, a lot of assists, and he kept himself in the game. He impacted the
game in a great way. So that's why they're really a heck of a team.  
  
But McClain stepped up. I mean, so that's what happens when you have good
teams and good players. They step up. I thought defensively the last 10
minutes of the game they were terrific. I think that was really the
difference. They were able to guard them, guard the ball screen and rebound,
limit them to one shot, and I thought really that was the difference in the
game and why they were able to pull away late.  
  
Q. After the stretch toward the end, you lose to Penn State, you lose to
Nebraska, what are the keys to keeping things on course and making sure that
-- you're trying to prevent that from carrying over to the NCAA Tournament?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, well, we've worked really hard on making this a new
season, and by the way my guys have reacted, I really, truly feel that way.
We've been dialed in in practice. Our enthusiasm level is good. The Penn State
loss really -- the score might be a bad loss, but they did beat Michigan
there, also. They were a heck of a team late in the season.  
  
We just didn't play well in the Big Ten Tournament, and that was the
disappointing part for us. And our other loss was Michigan, who's pretty good.  
  
People tend to overreact. Us in the know and in the middle of it, we won't.
We're disappointing with the way we played our last game, but we're excited to
play well tomorrow, and I believe in my team. I mean, this team has been
through it, guys. We gave up a home game. We had eight out of 11 on the road
during a stretch in late January, early February, and we battled through it. I
believe in my team. Did we get a little bit tired? Maybe. We've been able to
get refreshed and practice a lot, and I expect us to play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've seen enough of Big Ten and ACC basketball to get the
differences, nuances of how the styles are different in any way, but for
somebody who's in a program that has been in both arenas, do you really
recruit any differently whether you're going against the Dukes and North
Carolinas on a regular basis or whether you're going against the Michigan
States and Michigans on a regular basis?  
MARK TURGEON: No, and it's been this way my whole career, whether I was at
Jacksonville State or Maryland, you try to recruit young men that you can
coach and young men that you think fit into your system. I think that's the
way we've all recruited. But no, nothing different between -- we probably
don't come down to the south quite as much, Atlanta, North Carolina, quite as
much as we used to. We still do, but not as much. When it was in the footprint
of the ACC, we'd do it a lot more. You look at the history of some of our
better players and our history of Maryland basketball, Virginia, North
Carolina players, that footprint might change a little bit as we move into the
Big Ten in the future, but no, you just recruit the best players you can that
fit your style.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [James Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16256)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Talk about how your regular season ended to get into the
tournament here, your second time being in the NCAAs, correct?  
  
JAMES JONES: Yes, it is. We're real excited to be here, obviously. We had a
great end to our regular season and our tournament with a couple of wins over
two really good Ivy League basketball teams, and we felt all year that we were
the better team in the league, and I thought we proved it in terms of our non-
conference and our win-loss record, and it was great to be able to prove it on
our home floor and get ourselves down here and into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. James, could you walk us through the recruiting process for Miye and
how he ended up at Yale, and was there ever a time when you wondered maybe if
he would go elsewhere when the recruiting picked up?  
JAMES JONES: Well, I believe it was after his senior year, we got a call from
Robert Icart, who was his AAU. Coach, BTI, I believe, out of Southern
California, and he said he had a kid that we should really take a look at, and
he said there's some film on him. I took a look at the film, and the first
time in my career I ever offered a kid after watching the film, and it wasn't
even a game, it was like a highlight.  
  
But he had done some things in the highlight tape that were just so
exceptional. I was born at night but not last night, and I could figure it
out. So we offered Miye, and he and his father flew out to Yale on their own
dime, and they were supposed to spend like a half a day with us, and they got
mixed up in traffic, and I believe they visited Columbia and Yale and
Dartmouth on the same trip or Princeton, whatever the case, so they only spent
like an hour and a half a Yale. We sat down and talked and I had a good feel
for them and I thought they had a good feel for me.  
  
Shortly thereafter he had gone to Stanford's elite camp and they didn't offer
him an opportunity and after that he committed to Yale. That was somewhere in
April or May of his senior year, and then in July he went out and he played in
Las Vegas in Fab 48, and he played better than anybody I've ever recruited in
a summer tournament. They played against Thon Maker's team from Canada, and it
was Miye and a kid Cohen, who is at Lehigh, were the only Division I players
on their BTI team, and they ended up beating them, and Miye was absolutely
tremendous. Johnny Dawkins came up to me after the tournament or after one of
the games, and he goes, "Guys, you've got a good one, I made a mistake on
him," because he was just that good.  
  
His father is committed to education, and Miye is committed to education, and
although other people came in recruiting him, they had committed to us, and
they kept their commitment because of the people that they are.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about once you had gotten the job, could you talk
about the challenge in the Ivy League? Everybody is very familiar with the
traditions that Princeton has established there, that Penn and Harvard has had
their run. How tough was it to come in and sort of crack that and sort of
become the standard bearer, if you will, for that league?  
JAMES JONES: Well, I was an assistant coach for Dick Kuchen for a couple
years, and while being at Yale, I understood the power of the name and what it
was all about and what a great institution that it is. So I was at Ohio
University as an assistant coach when the job opened up and I interviewed, and
my thought process after talking to people, they were wondering why I would
want to go to Yale. Out of 310 Division I teams, Yale was ranked 308 when I
took over the job.  
  
They would ask me that question, and my answer would be, "Because it's Yale."  
  
I felt like if I couldn't convince young men that we could win and that they
were going to get the best education in the world, then I was probably in the
wrong business. And I felt that Yale was such a great place academically, and
I felt really good about what we were going to do basketball-wise that we
could convince people that we could make special things happen.  
  
And in getting to it, the biggest challenge we had was we had no basketball
history. You walk into our gym, there wasn't 40 banners up of championships.
There wasn't several guys who played in the NBA or whatever the fact may be,
so we had to start our own history, and we have, and we've done a great job
with that, and I've had wonderful assistant coaches who have gone out and
beaten the bushes and found young men of quality academically and athletically
to help us win championships, and we finally got our programs to the point
we're going to be good every year, and I think that's the challenge.  
  
We've been fairly consistent since I've been a head coach at Yale, and this is
my 20th season. We've finished in the top half of the league 19 times, and the
only time we didn't was our first year, when we finished 5-9 and were in fifth
place. That's the worst we've ever done since I've been a head coach, and that
consistency has been pretty good, but we don't want to be consistent; we want
to be great. We want to win the league most every other year, and hopefully we
continue to try to bring in quality student-athletes like Miye, Blake and Alex
and have a chance to win every year.  
  
Q. I don't expect you to get into your game plan here at a press
conference, but you've been known for playing an up-tempo game. This might be
the best collection of athletes you've gone up against but also the slower
tempo has given them trouble this year, teams like Florida. How do you go
about doing that?  
JAMES JONES: Well, certainly LSU is a very athletic team. We did play Duke
this year. They're not bad I heard. So we have seen -- and this collection of
guys that you're talking about, they've had some schedules over their four
years at Yale, so we've seen some players. One of the things I did last night
was I watched our Baylor game, it's on my laptop, and I like to look at it
every now and again to make myself feel better about my life (laughter), and I
watched the game, and we played them straight up. We guarded them man-to-man
in the post, we didn't switch, we didn't double. We did what we normally do.
And we were able to do that because we were good enough.  
  
I think this is a really good team, and offensively we're pretty good
offensive team, as well. We shoot -- I think we're like sixth in the country
with field goal percentage offense. So that being said, we want to play our
basketball game, and if that's good enough, it's going to be good enough. It's
not, it's not. But we want to play our basketball team and we want to be the
team -- we want to be true to who Yale basketball is, and we're going to go
out and try to do that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've got a local kid, Austin Williams, on your team. Doesn't
necessarily get a whole lot of minutes, but whenever you call his number,
seems like he goes out there and produces. What does that say about his
character?  
JAMES JONES: Well, listen, we had a game against Princeton at Princeton, and
we got into a situation where we needed to call his number. I couldn't get
some guys out of the game and both post guys were in the game from the start
until about the 12-minute mark, and we normally have one post sub, and that's
Paul Atkinson off the bench, and if I would have left another guy in, they
would've been in for 10 or 12 straight minutes. That's more than I like to
give them. So we called Austin's number and he proceeded to go in and score a
couple of baskets for us. It speaks volumes to the character of his.  
  
You don't know how hard it is to go to practice every day and not play in a
game and reap the benefits, and sit on the bench and wait for your number to
be called. But what you do is you come to practice every day so when your
number is called you're ready. You know, Austin has done that for us, and he's
been a tremendous kid.  
  
One of the hardest things you do as a coach is to manage expectations because
everybody has expectations. I was better than anybody I ever played against;
just ask me, right. So everybody feels that way. And I have a locker room of
guys that feel the same way, so it's important for us to make sure that
everyone knows they're vested in what we do, and just because you don't go out
and score the points and get the rebounds or make the assists, you still are
really important to Yale basketball and what we do, and I believe that Austin
feels that way, and that's one of the reasons why he's able to go into the
game and having played in like six or eight or ten in a row and able to be
successful because he's worked hard for his opportunity and was just waiting
for it.  
  
Q. You have four different starters all in double figures, obviously
Miye Oni is your leading scorer. For people that don't get a chance to watch
too much of Ivy League basketball, what is Miye like and what is it like to
have four players that might be in double figures every night?  
JAMES JONES: Well, Miye might be the most competitive kid I've ever coached.
He doesn't like to lose at anything, and he'll bite, scratch and claw to get a
win, right, he's one of those kind of kids. So that being said, it's
tremendous to have him in the locker room with us because he keeps you on your
toes. If you're not ready to go, you're going to get hurt one way or the
other. In any event, so it's great to have him as part of it.  
  
And having a well-rounded team of guys who can score -- I have basically seven
starters, like Azar Swain and Paul Atkinson come off the bench but they're
starters. They play starters minutes. They're good enough to start on most
every team in our league, and we're fortunate to have a really good basketball
club and have those guys part of it. And when I say they're all starters,
whenever any of those seven guys are out of the game and on the bench, I'm
trying to find a way to get them back in the game. And we have some other guys
like we talked about Austin Williams and Eric Monroe who come in and help us
from time to time.  
  
But those seven guys are really tremendous, and it's great to have a well-
balanced team are any one of those guys can give you 20 on any night. And as
you look over our last five or six games, Miye has been a consistent scorer
and so has Alex Copeland but we've had other guys lead us in scoring too -
Blake Reynolds and Jordan Bruner have been a huge part of what we do, and Azar
Swain goes out and goes 4 for 5 from the arc against Harvard in the
championship game. So we have a lot of guys that can hurt you. So it's great
to have that kind of balance in your offense so you can win games.  
  
Q. You talked about the Baylor game, do you let the players watch it or
did you show that to them?  
JAMES JONES: No, that's the personal thing with me. I have it on my laptop, I
have it there so I can watch it any time I want. Every now and again I'll just
take some pointers from it. I like to see what we were doing and how we were
successful.  
  
Q. Going back to that, how much do you think just going through that
experience with your three senior starters, Blake and Trey and Alex, how much
do you think that will help them going through it again?  
JAMES JONES: Well, I think that once you go and you win it and you break that
lid, you kind of believe. It's hard to achieve if you don't believe. So I
think our guys in the locker room are confident about who they are and about
the guys that are sitting next to them. So if you have a belief that you can
win, it's got to start there. So there's no fear in the guys' eyes, and we
watch some tape of LSU play yesterday and I saw some guys twitching a little
bit when they saw a lob dunk or Naz going up and tipping it back in, or Skylar
hammering it on somebody's head. Again, we've got some pretty good highlights
from our club as well. I think there is a lot of confidence in the room and it
is derived from wins that you've had in the past.  
  
Q. Bobby Phills was quite a legend at Southern University there in Baton
Rouge, the teams he played on and everything. What's it like to coach his son,
and what are some things you can share about his son to those watching back in
Baton Rouge?  
JAMES JONES: Yeah, Trey Phills is perhaps one of the better people on this
planet. He's the kind of guy you want your daughter to marry. I don't know if
you have any daughters, but if you do, try to get his number. You'd be happy
to have him as a son in law. Tremendous person, tremendous kid, tremendous
basketball player, tremendous athlete, and is just -- he's kind of the glue of
who we are. What I mean by that, his task every single game is to guard the
team's best player, and whether that be the 1, 2 or the 3, Trey has got him,
and everybody knows it.  
  
To be that selfless person, to go out and just to defend, because after every
single game that every kid has ever played, the first question they're asked,
how many points did you score. Not who did you stop, not how many rebounds you
got, not how many assists; how many points did you score. So knowing that's
going to be the case and knowing that he's not the kid that's going to score
the most points every night, it takes a very selfless person to be able to go
out and do that, and he's one of the most selfless, hardest working kids that
I've ever coached, and it's been a joy.  
  
And lastly here, I have four seniors, and I've taken some time here, most
every single practice over the last -- we've had like 100 practices so far
this year. Over the last I'd say 30 to 35, I made a point to try to grab a
smile with each one of my seniors for some reason or another, just to talk to
them individually because they're going to be gone in a year.  
  
And sometimes you get addition by subtraction. That's not the case with these
guys. It's going to be subtraction by subtraction. We will be lesser of a team
when they graduate, and Trey Phills is a big part of that.

JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Joe Golding](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36896)

### [Jaylen Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36897)

### [Jaren Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36898)

### [Hayden Farquhar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36899)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. What has the dynamic of the team been like since you guys have seen
Jalone and B.J. leave and now you guys have Damien Daniels and Joe Pleasant
stepping up? How has that changed the dynamic of the team and helped you guys
to get to this point?  
JAREN LEWIS: Really just what we've been preaching all year, just next-guy-up
mentality, just being ready for your moment. The young guys have done a great
job, just staying prepared, staying in the gym. It was really nothing new to
us. We knew they could step up. We knew the talent they had. We knew they
could contribute. So it wasn't really surprising to us. The dynamic hasn't
changed so much, it was just younger players stepping up and doing what we
knew they could do.  
  
Q. Hayden, it's good to see you on the corner there; question for you:
Obviously there's been some transition towards the second half of the season.
Did you ever think you would be on this platform, small town, Throckmorton,
all of a sudden on a big stage in front of all of us? Did you ever imagine
this?  
HAYDEN FARQUHAR: No, I never imagined it but I dreamed about it. But yeah,
it's truly amazing just being from a small town, just coming from a town with
700 people and coming to Abilene where there's 100,000 people, that was a big
change, and now coming to Jacksonville, Florida, to play on the biggest stage
in college basketball is truly amazing.  
  
Q. When you came to Abilene, you knew the AC would be ineligible to be
in the postseason for the first two years, and now you're in the tournament as
seniors. Just explain the emotions and what it's like finally being here.  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: I mean, it feels amazing. This was always a dream come true.
We've preached about this for our senior year over the summers, so like we
want to go to the NCAA Tournament, we want to go play at the biggest stage.
We're here now, and we've just got to make some noise.  
  
Q. When you look at the Kentucky team, what is it that stands out about
those guys, and what do you guys have to do tomorrow night?  
HAYDEN FARQUHAR: They're big. They're athletic. We've just got to block out
and just play team defense, and we've just got to hone in on the defensive
side, and they're really big and they're really tall, they're really athletic,
and we've just got to stay together as a team and just push through.  
  
JAREN LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, obviously they're really talented, a lot of guys
with great skill levels, athleticism is really the big thing we look at, and
they have that at all five positions. Really boxing out is going to be
important. We've got to take care of the ball, and we just know we have to
stay focused and locked into our game plan.  
  
Q. A lot of talk about dreams come true after the Southland Tournament.
Have you guys woken up, or is this still kind of dreamland for you guys?  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: I mean, we done woken up. After the Southland Conference
Tournament I couldn't really sleep. I slept with the trophy in my hand that
same night. But we're woken up and now it's time for us to get to business and
have some fun and play with confidence.  
  
Q. Jaren, you played with Joel Berry, J Frank you played with Malik Monk
and KeVaughn Allen growing up. Does the fact that you did that take a little
bit of the mystique away from, oh, my gosh, it's Kentucky? You've played with
some of the best guys in the world.  
JAREN LEWIS: Yeah, I would say so. It's nothing new really, it's just
basketball. At the end of the day, that's what it is. I don't really have like
a mystique or anything, no nerves. It's just going out there, we're hooping.
It's not really a huge deal. Yeah, I mean, it's a big stage, NCAA Tournament
is what we've been working for, but at the end of the day, it's no pressure
for us, it's just playing basketball, doing what we love, doing what we've
been doing for years now.  
  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: Following on what Jaren said, we're just here to play
basketball. I mean, I played with those guys, and they taught me a lot, you
know. They're just here to have fun, I guess.  
  
Q. Have you heard from either of those guys?  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: Yeah, I heard from KeVaughn. I called him right after the
Selection Show. He was like, "Hey, man, you've got Kentucky. Dream come true."
I said, "I know, I know, I know. I've just got to get to work, man."  
  
Q. For Hayden, you mentioned coming from a small-town background; what
was your first impression of coming into this arena knowing this is the big
stage here?  
HAYDEN FARQUHAR: It was awesome. Just like you said, coming from a small town,
just not getting out there -- we don't even have like fast food restaurants or
anything, but just coming into this arena and looking at the atmosphere it's
going to bring during the game is going to be truly awesome.  
  
Q. Obviously for Abilene Christian, this being the first time in the
tournament, then you have such a storied program like Kentucky, and even
Jaylen, you mentioned just a couple answers ago this being a dream come true.
How does the difference between the two programs play into your mindset going
into this game tomorrow? And Jaylen kind of specifically, why is this a dream
come true for you?  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: It's a dream come true because you always want to play
against higher-ranked schools, you know, and this is up there. Kentucky is a
great team, great program, great players and great coaching staff. I used to
grow up watching them and just being out there -- not being out there, but
just watching them and dreaming about going to Kentucky. But this is truly a
dream come true. I'm just going to embrace this moment.  
  
Q. Jaren, for you, this is kind of a homecoming in a sense, being from
Orlando and being back in your home state. What's it been like since you've
been here? Have you been able to see family? Are you getting acclimated with
the humidity a little bit more? Does it feel good to be back?  
JAREN LEWIS: Yeah, it feels great being back. Everyone has been giving me a
hard time because it was cold when we got in yesterday, and all they say is
that I complain about Texas being cold all the time, and this is not much of a
difference. I'm just like, all right, give it some time.  
  
It's been great being back. I haven't got to see any family or friends yet
because we've been here for a day but I have a lot of people coming out to the
game tomorrow, so that should be good. Having a lot of people who haven't seen
me play in a while coming out to the game. It just feels great being back.
We're hoping for warmer weather, but we're just going to enjoy the moment and
have fun while we're here.  
  
Q. This goes to all three of you guys: You guys all play outside the
perimeter, you shoot close to 40 percent there. Kentucky knows that. This
arena is going to play somewhat of a role, it seems, obviously the seats are
further back and perception may be a little bit different when you guys go out
to the court for the first time. What's that going to be like for you guys to
have to adjust to this arena?  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: I mean, we ain't really going to have to adjust. We're just
going to go out there and have fun and play our game. If we're wide open,
knock the shot down. Like I tell these guys all the time, if you're open,
shoot the ball. Farquhar is a great shooter, Jaren is a great shooter. My
whole team are great shooters. Just go out there, shoot the ball, have fun,
have confidence.  
  
HAYDEN FARQUHAR: J. Frank said it, you just have to have confidence.
Confidence is key in this game. Just whenever you have an open shot, take it,
and have confidence that it's going to go in. Like you said, the depth
perception is going to be off a little bit. That's why this shoot-around is
going to be very important for us just to go out there and get shots up. So
yeah.  
  
Q. Jaren or any of you guys, what was different about the team this
year? You guys improved so much to win as many games as you did. Why this
year?  
JAREN LEWIS: I think why it happened this year is because everything we went
through, especially last year we kind of stumbled towards the end in late
February and March, we didn't finish how we wanted, and the season definitely
didn't end out the way we wanted to, and I think that definitely made us
hungry. We thought about that all off-season, all summer during workouts and
practices. That was the thing that was pushing us. That was a huge motivator
for us. So I really just think the struggles and all the lessons we learned
from the past couple years, specifically last year during the stretch is what
led to us making it all come together this year.  
  
Q. You guys are now a part of a lot of firsts in those AC uniforms. Is
that something you think about now, or do you guys focus on the task at hand
and kind of that will be something that you guys think about later and
recognize when all this is over?  
JAYLEN FRANKLIN: I mean, we've thought about it all year. Coach has preached
about it, about making history and just being there and just having fun and
play a basketball game. But right now, we've just got to look at the next task
and just be ready to lock in and play basketball, you know.  
  
Q. Coach, when you had that switch in February with the excusing of
Jalone and B.J. and you see Damien and Joe stepping up as freshmen to kind of
take a little bit of that load and help this team along, first things first;
what was it like when you told the team, and how has the transition moved into
seeing those guys really step up?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, one of the emotional meetings I've ever been a part of in
coaching. It was a lot of tears shed. Those guys were brothers to these guys,
and so we played Southeastern I think it was 48 hours later and just got
drilled. We got beat really bad at home, and that hasn't happened very often
this year. I think it happened twice. I don't think we'd beat anybody in our
league that day. There was just too much going on.  
  
But I think people that have been around college athletics, professional
athletics, anything, I think in a six-month season, adversity always comes
into play. Something is going to happen, whether it's suspensions, whether
it's dismissals, whether it's injuries, adversity plays a big part in
everybody's season.  
  
So when you have three seniors that you guys just talked to and a bunch of
upperclassmen and some juniors that have been in this program a long time, one
of our mottos is trust the process, get better every day. You guys have heard
that. And the last one is finish the fight. We wanted to finish the fight for
these guys, and they did an incredible job, maybe better than any team I've
ever been around of handling adversity.  
  
Q. Coach, we had talked a little bit about building your brand, and just
coming here now and starting to see this unfold already, what has it been like
for you just to hear people start to recognize what ACU is and learn about you
guys? What is that like for you to be a part of this and be the lead of
this?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, this looks a little bit different than our media room back
home, huh? Here's the deal, man, we couldn't have got a better draw. We're
playing the University of Kentucky. I mean, one of the most historic blue
bloods, maybe the most historic blue-blood college basketball program in the
country. You're playing five-star recruits. You're playing a Hall-of-Fame
coach, the best fan base in the country. So any time anybody the next 48 hours
is going to talk about the University of Kentucky, they're going to mention
Abilene Christian.  
  
So it's an incredible way for us to share our story of our university. This
was the dream. This was the vision. This is what President Schubert and the
board of regents wanted to do. They wanted to go Division I so we could share
our story of our University. My job as being the head basketball coach was to
get us to this point. That's my job. That's what I did.  
  
I have an incredible group of players that believed in a vision and dream, and
we're here, and I want them to enjoy the ride. I want them to live it every
minute, and we're going to share the story of our wonderful university and
we're honored. It's a privilege to play the University of Kentucky. It's an
incredible moment for our university to be paired up with them.  
  
Q. It was always your dream, you told me a few weeks ago, to coach in
the NCAA Tournament, and you sort of did that at Little Rock, Arkansas. You
played in a first four game, got beat out. Now as a head coach you're here as
a 15 seed. Describe the emotions of achieving that dream finally.  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, it's been a wild ride. I think you have to find things in
this business that motivate you, what motivates you to keep on. This is a
grind. This is a hard business, especially at our level, but any level it's
tough. I just haven't been fortunate enough to get any higher than this level,
not as a player or a coach. So I don't know how that other level is.  
  
But it's been an incredible run. As a player I wasn't good enough to play
Division I. I thought I was good enough but nobody would recruit me, so I was
a Division II player but I always wanted to be a part of March Madness. I
remember my dad, as a little kid letting me skip school and we'd sit at home
and we'd watch games on Thursdays and Fridays. It was just something we did as
a family and it was a lot of fun.  
  
So then I got the opportunity from Steve Shields at Arkansas-Little Rock to be
an assistant coach. I owe a lot to him. He gave me a huge break in the
business, and I was able to go there and we were able to experience it. As an
assistant coach it was a lot of fun. We went to Dayton, which was great. I
love the city of Dayton. We got beat but here is the funny story, we were back
home. I think we played on Tuesday night, I think UNC Asheville beat us.
Really good game, beat us, and we were back home Wednesday before a lot of my
buddies in the business had even left to go play their game, and the
tournament was already over for us.  
  
This has been great being a head coach, being able to lead my alma mater to
the NCAA Tournament, being able to play the University of Kentucky and being
able to experience it and really be a part of March Madness tomorrow night,
it's an incredible opportunity for me, and it's something I'm going to take a
lot of pride in one day down the road.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about PJ Washington, how prominent he is in the
game planning you guys are doing, how impactful can he be?  
JOE GOLDING: Well, if he shows up to play in a walking boot and Coach Cal lets
him play in a walking boot, we might have a chance. You just saw our post from
Throckmorton, Texas. If he takes the walking boot off, we've got a problem.
He's really good. He's talented. He's one of eight problems we have on their
roster. They're very, very talented.  
  
I honestly -- I don't know what we're going to do. We're still trying to
figure that out. He's an incredible talent. If he's making shots and he's
scoring the ball on the block, then he's really tough to defend. So we've got
to try to force him away from the rim as much as we can, but that's easier
said than done. You've got four other pros on the floor with him, too.  
  
We've got our hands full on that and still trying to figure that out. If
you've got any ideas, I'd love for you to share them with me, man. You've
probably seen them a little more than I have.  
  
Q. You've had a little bit of a back and forth with Tech's coach Chris
Beard. Have you talked to him about kind of what this is like? And also how
important is it to kind of keep it light this time of year and kind of keep
things fun and everything after the grind of the season that you talked
about?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, I don't think there's any secret in Coach Beard and I's
relationship. He coached me at Abilene Christian. He's my best friend, not
just in the business, he's been my best friend for 20 years. This was a dream
and vision we had years ago, man, when we'd go float the rivers with a bunch
of old ball coaches. Some of these guys in the deuce, some guys are D-3 guys.
We have a really tight circle that we've really kept close over the years, and
this was a vision and a dream that we used to always talk about.  
  
He was the first phone call I had Saturday night, and he's had his run. He's
had his eight seconds in Vegas, man. He's on a heck of a run right now. He's a
heck of a ball coach. We saw that firsthand this year. He's been incredible
for our university the last few years we played. He was an assistant at
Abilene Christian. He got masters at Abilene Christian. So he's taken some
pride in this, I think.  
  
So the friendship has been great. He doesn't have any answers for Kentucky,
unfortunately, but I think down the road one day we're going to have a heck of
a story to share, you know. I'm proud to call him a friend. But it's not just
basketball with him, man, it's life. We've been through a lot together the
last 20 years. He's been right by my side, and we've both had ups and downs,
both had a ton of adversity, but we finished the fight. He's doing a heck of a
job, and I'm really, really proud of him. We're not going to play them
anymore, though; we're done playing Tech.  
  
Q. Knowing the kind of run your team was on this year and what you were
capable of, how difficult was the decision to part ways with a couple of
players fairly recently, and also how proud have you been at the way your team
appeared to respond to some untimely adversity?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, I can't really comment on the situation, obviously.
Unfortunately I'd like to, but I can't. But what I will tell you is it was
very tough, toughest decision I've had as a head coach. Those two kids are --
they're family to us. They've been a part of the journey with us all along.
And so it was tough.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of this group and how they handled it. I think it's
an incredible lesson for our program and an incredible lesson for the country
to learn that when adversity strikes, there's two ways to go -- you can just
quit and you can make excuses or you can bunker down and fight and fight for
what you want, and these guys fight, man. They fought the last -- I think,
what, we won six in a row down the stretch.  
  
The double bye was really important to us because losing those two guys, we
don't have the depth that we've had all year long. With those two guys I
thought we were probably one of the most talented teams in our league. Without
those guys, we weren't.  
  
In our league first and second place get a double bye, so that's huge. You get
automatically into the semifinals. So we thought we had to go 3-1 down the
stretch, we had two on the road and two at home, and we ended up going 4-0,
which gave us the double bye and gave us a great opportunity to have to win
two games, not three or four in our conference tournament.  
  
Incredibly proud of this group. It's a great lesson to learn. It's great for
my two kids. I've got a 12-year-old and a 9-year-old and it's great lesson for
them to learn. It's a great lesson for our community to learn that when things
don't go your way, you can still get what you want.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. In some ways is all the pressure off of
your team as far as you guys can go out there and play loose and try to play
the role of the Cinderella? And also, have you had a chance to replace your
suit that you ripped at the selection show party?  
JOE GOLDING: I think there is no pressure on us, obviously. We're playing the
University of Kentucky, you know. So there is no pressure. The problem is
we've still got to find a way to score and rebound the basketball, you know.
We can go out there as loose as we want, it doesn't matter. At the end of the
day, it's University of Kentucky.  
  
We're going to keep our guys loose. I was laughing back here backstage, I've
been trying to get Jaylen Franklin to talk for four years. He's our point
guard, he's our leader, and he won't talk at all. He just started talking a
little bit this year. He gets up here and he won't shut up, you know.  
  
I think it's great, man, that he's experiencing that. I think he's loose. I
think he's having fun, and these guys deserve it, you know, so I'm excited for
them to embrace it.  
  
As far as my suit, this is true, man, I'm telling you. My bonus -- it's all a
fact. And the suit got ripped when I jumped up and hugged our associate head
coach. He's been on this journey with me for seven years. He took a chance on
me. He left a really good program where he had a ton of success and they made
the NCAA Tournament at Stephen F. Austin which you guys are probably familiar
with, to come here and build this with me, and man, it has not been easy. It's
been the hardest thing we've ever done. It was an incredible embrace that we
had the last eight seconds.  
  
Unfortunately I ripped my pants. So I get back to Abilene -- I haven't got my
bonus yet, either. I just found out I don't get that until June 1st, I think.
I heard somebody was going to start a GoFundMe page; I would appreciate it,
any help I can get.  
  
We've got one suit place in town, that's it. One suit place, and they couldn't
get it done. I guess you've got to alter and do some stuff. So I've got one
suit, my man. I had two suits when the year started. I left one in an airport,
true story. Had to go when we played Nicholls State and buy a suit or khaki
pants and a shirt. I'm coaching them all in my baby blue suit, and I'm going
to have a hole in my butt, man. So it is what it is, man. We're going to be
who we are and go out there and embrace it.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, what kind of impact was there at all tangible on
your program and others like yours with what Loyola did as an 11 seed last
year and what the 16 seed did for winning, the impact for programs like
yours?  
JOE GOLDING: Yeah, let me tell you, Loyola -- Porter is a good friend of Steve
Shields, my boss at Little Rock, so I got a chance to know him and we got to
embrace him in San Antonio. It was neat, you know, with the Final Four in
Texas and get to see him, and what an incredible job he did and a great story
that he got to share with the world.  
  
And so that was neat for a lot of us that are close to Porter. And then what
UMBC did last year was awesome. KJ Maura, their point guard, I don't know if
you guys know this, he played for us as a freshman. We recruited him. He
played for us. He ended up leaving us and going to JuCo, and then got to
finish the story. So we were so proud of KJ and the experience he had last
year.  
  
So I think those stories, I think they're out there. I think we'll share those
with our guys. I think our guys have grown up, too, watching March Madness.
They know what happens. We could play Kentucky, I don't know, man, 10,000
times, we might win once, but that's March Madness. That's what tomorrow
night's about. If we can find a way to keep this thing close and give
ourselves a chance the last 10 minutes, you never know. That's when the
madness happens.  
  
But that's really hard to do, you know. I mean, every time you watch tape --
I'm done watching tape. I quit watching tape last night. So there's nothing we
can do about it. We're not going to grow tonight. We're not going to get more
athletic tonight. We are who we are. We've just got to try to game plan, give
our guys the best chance they can to compete, and see how long we can hang in
there.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Alex Copeland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36893)

### [Miye Oni](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36894)

### [Blake Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36895)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. For any of you that want to answer this, could you just talk a little
bit, give a little bit of insight to people who don't get to see Ivy League
basketball, whether on television or whatever, and there might be a perception
about the skill level. Cornell came here in 2010 and got to the Sweet 16.
Could you just talk a little bit about what the outside perception of Ivy
League basketball may differ from the actual product?  
BLAKE REYNOLDS: Yeah, I mean, I think it's getting better every year. I think
the athleticism and the talent in the league is getting better. Every year as
we go, and I think a lot of people don't get the chance to see that.  
  
But yeah, I think we'll bring that to this first round here, just showcase
that talent and athleticism that we do actually have and that high level of
basketball that's in the Ivy League.  
  
Q. The Ivy League history in Jacksonville has been pretty noted over the
years, Cornell getting to the Sweet 16, Harvard having a major scare to UNC a
few years ago. Is that something that the guys talk about, maybe a little bit
of a good-luck-charm factor with Jacksonville and maybe a chance to sort of
carry a little Ivy League legacy down here?  
ALEX COPELAND: Not exactly, but we definitely know that teams from our
conference have been able to come into the tournament, just like Blake and I
did as freshmen a few years back against Baylor. Teams from our conference
have been able to come here and have success.  
  
We're not afraid of anything here. We feel confident. We know the teams before
us have done it. We feel like we're capable of doing it, and so we're excited
to be here and get a chance to showcase that.  
  
Q. Before you even knew you were playing LSU on Sunday, how familiar
were you guys with Tremont Waters and his game, him being from New Haven,
getting recruited by Yale?  
MIYE ONI: I think we all knew who he was and some of us had played with him
and played against him at different parts. He comes back home for the summer a
lot. We know he's a quick point guard, really talented, and yeah.  
  
Q. You guys are three of I think four starters that average double digit
points a game. What is it about you guys offensively that makes you so
dangerous?  
BLAKE REYNOLDS: Yeah, I mean, like you said, I think we've got a really deep,
deep team, especially on the offensive end. We've got a lot of guys that can
contribute and a lot of guys that can put the ball in the hole. And I think it
can be a different guy any given night that can hurt you. So I think that's
what makes our team pretty special is that we've got seven, eight, nine
different guys we can throw out there any night that can really make a big
impact on the game.  
  
Q. Alex and Blake, you kind of touched on this earlier, but the 2016
experience against Baylor, how different does this feel than that? And how
much more confident are you being that you've been on this stage and played
two of those teams?  
ALEX COPELAND: Yeah, it definitely feels pretty different. I think as
freshmen, I didn't actually get on the court, Blake did and he hit a three
against Baylor, which was pretty awesome. I think there was definitely an
element of kind of feeling like you were just along for the ride a little bit,
and as much as I enjoyed that, I think I have vivid memories of being on the
bus leaving March Madness and saying, okay, I've got to try to get back here
before I graduate. And to be able to do that as one of the leaders of this
team feels really special and just feels like a bit of a dream come true.  
  
I think that coming here and seeing it before, it kind of put that dream into
your mind, and we were lucky to have really great seniors and really great
leaders before us that were able to kind of bring some clarity to that vision,
and I think when you can have a dream combined with a little bit of a plan and
a vision and a blueprint of how to do it, I think you can try to do something
really special.  
  
Q. For all three of you, could you please tell us how heavily you were
recruited coming out of high school, whether you got any athletic scholarships
from somebody, and if so, why did you ultimately choose Yale?  
MIYE ONI: So at first I didn't have any Division I offers, and then I
committed to Williams College, Division III school before my senior year,
played out my senior year. Then after my senior year a lot of Ivy League
schools, Patriot League schools contacted me, and I committed to Yale after
like June or July after my senior year. The admissions was closed, so I had to
go to prep school for a year at Suffield Academy, and then I joined Yale for
the 2016 class.  
  
Q. How challenging is the financial commitment for your families?
Because I'm assuming that other than need-based financial aid, that not every
single dollar of your education is paid for.  
ALEX COPELAND: I think that when you sign up to go to a school like Yale, it's
one of those things where it didn't really -- even if it was just like
18-year-olds making the decision, I think something that our coaches tried to
really kind of drive home with us in the recruiting process was that it wasn't
a four-year decision. There were definitely sacrifices we'd have to make,
whether it was financial or maybe not being like, quote-unquote, a high-major
school, but we're making a 40-year decision, something that was an investment
in our futures, and having an opportunity, one, to be on a stage like this but
also to have like one of the best academic experiences and educations that's
around.  
  
Q. Any athletic scholarships for you?  
ALEX COPELAND: Yeah, I had a couple.  
  
BLAKE REYNOLDS: Yeah, I mean, there was definitely other interests my junior
summer. That's when I actually first started really playing summer AAU
basketball and started getting some exposure. I'm a Midwestern kid, so a lot
of like Missouri Valley Conference schools and schools in the Midwest area,
like that. And then when Yale reached out, I thought that was just an
incredible opportunity. I didn't really know much about the Ivy League or Ivy
League basketball at the time, but yeah, once I got up there on campus and got
to know the coaching staff and kind of what the program was about, I decided
that was the right decision for me.  
  
Q. You guys are a high-scoring offense in the Ivy League. LSU is one of
the most high-scoring offenses in the SEC. What is it about them that you've
seen that makes them so difficult to guard, and what kind of game are you
expecting? More of a shoot-out or are you going to try and make it more of a
slower game?  
MIYE ONI: Yeah, LSU has a great offense. They have a lot of key pieces to
their offense. They're pretty balanced. They're not fairly deep, but they are
pretty balanced with who they play. I feel like we're kind of similar. I feel
like we're a little deeper. We're also a very balanced team, and we both try
to play in transition a lot but we both can slow it down to run the half-court
set, so should be a fairly offensive game.  
  
Q. Alex, kind of piggy-backing on that last question, there's a school
of thought in these kind of games that you slow it down to play a, quote-
unquote, high-major, like you say. You all play up tempo, so are you going to
run with this LSU team tomorrow?  
ALEX COPELAND: Yeah, definitely. We feel really confident, one, in our style
of play, but also the actual talent level of the guys we have on the court.
And so we're going to play our game. I think that, like any game, we're going
to see how things are flowing, how things are going, if it starts to suit us
better to slow it down and really kind of grind them offensively, then I think
we'll try to do that in the half court, but if we're having success in
transition, I feel like we have guys that can run with anyone.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Ashton Hagans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36911)

### [Keldon Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36360)

### [Tyler Herro](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36361)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. The season, a fantastic run, but it ended a little shy in the SEC
Tournament. How did you guys bounce back, and what's it like to be back in the
NCAAs again?  
KELDON JOHNSON: I mean, it feels good just being able to get another shot. Of
course like you said, we fell short a little bit in the SEC Tournament, but we
just regrouped and refocused and locked in, and we're ready to go now.  
  
Q. When you guys all made the decision to come to Kentucky, it was
probably in part to have moments like this. Now that it's right here, how does
it feel to get ready to play on this stage, and do you guys feel prepared for
the moment?  
TYLER HERRO: I think it's a dream come true for all of us. Obviously coming to
Kentucky, the coaching staff and just being at Kentucky is going to be the
biggest stage in college basketball. We're just happy to be here. As a team I
think we're ready to go, and just ready to attack this tournament.  
  
ASHTON HAGANS: Like Tyler said, it's a dream come true, just growing up
watching this on TV and now getting the chance to play in this tournament,
it's a big confidence thing, and we're just ready to come in and play.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how Calipari gets you to this point of the year,
what the expectations are and a lot expected of you guys at this point? What
is the secret? What does he say? How does he handle and how do you guys handle
expectations of where you're at right now to try to win a National
Championship?  
KELDON JOHNSON: We've been just going hard all year, and at this point in the
year he always says that we just have to fall back on our training. I think
that's a big thing that we do. I think as long as we fall back on our
training, because if we try to live up to his expectations, that's exactly
what it is, how he coaches us every day in practice, and so that's what we're
used to, so that's what we just fall back on.  
  
Q. What has Coach Cal been emphasizing to you guys in the locker room in
preparation for the tournament and the first game tomorrow?  
ASHTON HAGANS: You know, like Keldon said, just play to our training, be as
one, stick together as we do on the court, and just go off our training.  
  
Q. How much of a difference has Reid Travis been for you guys? You're
all freshmen, he's obviously a lot older, fifth-year kid. How much has he
helped you in terms of maybe coming into a situation like this, even if he
hasn't played in a lot of NCAA tournaments?  
TYLER HERRO: Reid is obviously a huge part to our team. It really hurt us when
he was out for those few weeks, but I think the guys that didn't get as much
minutes, they got to come in and fulfill their role. Reid has been a huge part
to it, just being able to -- he's a leader, like you said, he's a fifth-year
guy and we can look up to him as freshmen, but he does a lot of things that
don't show up in the stat book, so we're happy to have him. We're happy he's
back and healthy and ready to go?  
  
Q. Is he the leader of this team? Like if there was a leader, is it
Reid?  
KELDON JOHNSON: It just all depends on the situation, what's going on. Of
course for him being so much older than a lot of us, we ask him for a lot of
advice, and he's always gotten us through certain situations that happen in
basketball, whether it's we're down at a certain point or we're getting a
little rattled, he's always just there to make sure we're good and bring us
back together.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If you could just an opening general statement about your
season and being back in the tournament as a 2 seed here.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: We had a good run. The team is getting better. They're coming
together. We've got great kids. I mean, they share. It's not about one of
them; it's about all of them.  
  
They all have worked. They're gym rats. If I go to the office and it's 11:00
at night, there won't be one in there, there will be four, five or six in
there. You know, they're into it.  
  
They've not been in this environment. We don't know how they'll react. I have
a feeling they'll be fine, but a lot of young guys.  
  
Q. Can you give an update on PJ's status? Is he here today, and do you
expect him to play tomorrow?  
JOHN CALIPARI: PJ sprained his foot in the Tennessee game. We had him in the
boot for a while. X-rays, everything was negative, MRIs. But we sent him to a
specialist. Again, precaution. He wants to play. Well, if you know me, I'm
like, wait a minute, let's go get one more level of this.  
  
So we expect him -- he's not here with us right now. He'll probably be here in
an hour or so, but we sent him to the specialist to make sure that he can't
harm himself. But we expect him to play.  
  
Q. You look at ACU, it's a very different team in many ways, first time
in the tournament, and your program has established itself. Is there anything
to be concerned about with that program? Is this just another match-up for you
guys? What is your mentality going into this?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, again, I've been in this thing a bunch, and I tell you,
it doesn't matter because everybody is zero and zero right now. You don't look
beyond anything else. All we're worried about is Abilene Christian because
they're good enough to beat us.  
  
I watched their games. I'm impressed with how they play, both inside and
outside. They defend. They make it hard for catches. They try to steal balls.
They scramble the game up. They're good. They're well-coached.  
  
You know, again, a 16 beat a 1 last year. There's been 15s that have beaten
2s. And so you just go in and you worry about yourself.  
  
Again, I'm trying to explain to these guys, you don't play to the opponent,
you don't play to the tournament, you don't play to the TV or the crowd. You
play to your training. If you can do that, you'll be able to do that for 40
minutes. If you do the others, you're going to be able to play for 15 and it's
not good enough to win in this tournament.  
  
And again, I've been doing this 30-some years. I mean, it's play to the
training, stay in the moment is the message to these young guys.  
  
Q. What do you see as you're looking at the game film? You talked about
how you want to make sure you're focusing on yourself. Everybody has a game
plan going in. What type of challenges does --  
JOHN CALIPARI: You can get hit in the mouth and then that game plan goes away.  
  
Q. That's right.  
JOHN CALIPARI: Again, we've got to take care of the ball because they want to
steal balls. They play aggressive. Their 5 man can shoot. So if you don't go
play him, he's making shots. The championship game they played, he made the
two threes that ended the game. It was their 5 man.  
  
So you look at this and say, they've got drivers, they've got a couple guys
that are making threes. They can stretch you out. They can get you near the
basket. I mean, they're good. They're good. And defensively they're not just
giving you baskets. You're going to have to fight because they play. They're
well-coached.  
  
Q. You've consistently had success recruiting players that have a future
in the NBA. How do your players on this team compare to the great players
you've coached in the past?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Every team I've coached is different, and I mean that
literally. Like I come in each year and it's a brand new team.  
  
This team is skilled, one of the higher skilled teams that I've had. This team
has been able to stay in the moment and be about each other, which in this day
and age with social media, with the clutter around them, with the people, you
know, the flattery they get, which is you're better than so and so, you should
be shooting more shots, why -- they hear this, being enabled, and to fight
that, this team has done unbelievable.  
  
Is there an Anthony Davis or a Karl Towns -- they all get mad. All 30 of them
want me to mention them right now. Do you guys mind if I mention all 30?
(Laughter). The $2 billion in contracts those kids make? I can do it if you
want me to. But these kids are different.  
  
Now, they're professionals, too. They're going to be in that league. But
they're doing it together. And different guys are doing it. The one advantage
we have with this year's team is Reid Travis. I mean, I've not coached a
23-year-old since I left UMass, and he is so professional in how he handles
everything, practices, preparation, training himself and also getting his body
right. You know, he's one of those guys.  
  
Now, he's not been in this tournament, so he's another one that you look at,
other than PJ, the other guys really -- Nick played a few minutes, but he's
not -- they've not been significant in this thing. So that's something we've
got to see how it turns out.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about Reid and how big of a challenge is it
for him to stay focused with finally getting to the NCAA, and then with the
Final Four in Minneapolis, his hometown.  
JOHN CALIPARI: Is that where it is?  
  
Q. That's what I hear.  
JOHN CALIPARI: Wow. I grabbed him today, I said, "You've prepared your whole
life for this," and I said, "Have a ball, man. Have a ball."  
  
And if he relies on his training instead of thinking of all the -- he will be
fine, because no one trains like him. And whatever you ask him, I can get on
him, like really hit him, and he's fine. He never wavers. I mean, I scream --
he missed a free throw last game, and I just looked, screamed at him, "Make a
free throw!" And he made the next one.  
  
I've had a ball coaching him. I mean, absolutely every day I walk in, it's
kind of like I used to say with Jamal Murray, who would smile and make me
smile, every time I see him when I walk in the gym, Travis, I smile. I know
he's going to give us everything he can.  
  
Q. Your team has had a really good job at the end of games this year
--  
JOHN CALIPARI: Until the last one.  
  
Q. That's what I was going to ask you. There were some uncharacteristic
turnovers, et cetera. Do you look back at -- one of them maybe could have been
something else --  
JOHN CALIPARI: There's stuff I can't say here, you know.  
  
Q. And I can't either, you see the news. Is it possible -- is it just
one of those things? Was it a fluke?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, there were -- if you looked at what you're talking about,
go back and look at the tape. You may have a different opinion. And the second
thing is -- and I told them this: When you go through a season, you have to
learn how to finish games off, which we have. You have to learn how to be down
10 or 11 and come back and win, which we have. You have to learn about playing
fast, playing slow, playing against pressing teams. We played against a team
that, thank goodness, played a 1-3-1. Nobody plays it anymore, but what if you
get it in the tournament? And I've got all young guys. This isn't like, well,
two years ago -- no, they weren't here two years ago.  
  
So it's been a great experience, in our league, there have been so many games
that were won in the last minute for every one of our teams in our league. We
got eight teams in, and the other two were on the bubble, like it could have
been 10 teams. And every team played through this league, gave themselves a
chance now to come in this tournament and do well.  
  
Q. You mentioned all the young guys that have played as many NCAA
Tournament games as ACU guys have, but when you wear that blue, there are the
expectations. How do you manage the expectations and the pressure that comes
with that "UK" on their shirt?  
JOHN CALIPARI: That's overrated. They don't care if we win or lose at
Kentucky. They're fine. As long as we really do the right stuff, we're okay.  
  
The one advantage that we have coming in to a tournament like this is every
game we play is someone's Super Bowl. And 98 percent of the time, the other
team has nothing to lose. I don't care who it is. If you come to Rupp, you
have nothing to lose because most teams are not going to win in that building.  
  
If we go to their place, they have nothing to lose, plus they have the fans.
In this tournament, everybody has something to lose. And we're used to playing
that way. So that helps us more than anything else.  
  
The kids, you know, I think they're proud to be in the uniform, but I don't
think it weights on them more than any other uniform. But they're proud. And
they know what happened before them, and they know how every one of those
players left this place better than when they all got here, and they know they
all finished the term academically, which is why we finish in the top ten in
the APR and they send us awards, which you guys don't hear about, every year,
because we're one of those schools that finishes in the top because the kids
finish the term and do what they're supposed to do academically. That's the
culture that's been left, and that's the culture that you leave when you leave
here.  
  
Q. In terms of what Immanuel has played of late --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Ooh, he's been great.  
  
Q. Is that just seeing the ball go in, or is it coming here and maybe
adjusting to playing with guys who are as good, if not better than him?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Emmanuel Quickley has probably improved as much, if not more
than anybody on our team. He's another one that lives in the gym. I'm trying
to get him to slow his mind down. In this game we play, you can have your feet
move real fast, but your feet can't move faster than your mind move fast. And
getting him to slow down his mind so that he can read stuff better, that's
been what we've worked on all season, and he's getting better and better and
better.  
  
From where he was defensively to where he is now, from where he is decision
making and shot making and play making to where he is now, not close. I am so
proud of him and so happy for him.  
  
You know, he and Ashton playing together, subbing for each other, it's worked
out well.  
  
Q. 30 years now for you at this level --  
JOHN CALIPARI: 35 maybe. I know, I started when I was eight. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Do you have an appreciation or can you remember like what Joe Golding
is going through here, about to coach his first NCAA Tournament game? I think
your first was maybe your fourth year at UMass. Do you remember what that was
like at all?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It took us three years to get to .500, to get to .500, and then
I think we went in the NIT and advanced. We went and advanced to a Final Four,
which the whole school went crazy because we were in the NIT and went to the
Final Four. We didn't win it.  
  
And then the next year it was year four that we were in the NCAA Tournament,
and Jim McCoy and Will Herndon, and Anton Brown and Harper Williams, Tony
Barbee, Lou Roe, who was a beast, and I could name the other guys if you'd
like, but as I get older I do slip up a little bit.  
  
But that run and what was done during that time with those kids, and again,
they shared, five guys in double figures, defended, tough -- we used to do
screaming rebounds. When you rebounded you had to scream. Like you didn't just
go grab the ball (screaming) and the other team was like, "These dudes are
crazy." But we would do stuff and have a ball with it, and at the time we
didn't know better. I didn't know -- until you get off your own campus and
you're on somebody else's campus and you see like, wow, you don't realize.  
  
But it was a fun time, and yeah, I do know. It's an exciting time, and you
just want your kids to have a ball with it, and I imagine that's what he's
trying to do. Let's have fun. Let's go, let it go, shoot the ball. That's what
makes it dangerous when you're the other coach, and that's what happened for
us there. We played so hard and with so much enthusiasm that we won some
games.  
  
Was that the year that we played Kentucky and we would have beat them except
there was a -- stepped out of the box in the Spectrum I remember. See, the
Spectrum had different colors, because it was the Spectrum, and so if you were
across the court like 62 feet away, you would have thought I was out of the
box, but I looked down and I'm like, I'm in the box, you can't see, the
Spectrum in the lines. That's how we lost the game.  
  
When did we beat them, the first game of -- '95, we beat them with like -- I
think they had 11 NBA players on that team.  
  
Q. In your 30-plus years in the business, can you recall the first time
you crossed paths with Rick Byrd, and what are your impressions of the job
that he's done taking a team from NAIA to Division I independents to now in
the OVC?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, he and I are friends. I went up and was in his house this
summer because I wanted him to tell me some five-out stuff, some back-door
stuff, some shooting -- because I thought we had a skilled team and I wanted
to learn some different stuff, and we ended up spending an afternoon together
with he and his assistant Tyler.  
  
But I've watched -- we've had to play him when I was at Memphis. He reminded
me we played them -- because I won't play them now. I'm like, don't call me,
I'm not playing you. You're the most dangerous team in the country. No one
knows how good you are or how good you coach. But I texted him last night
after the game and just said, I was so happy for him. When we play in
Nashville, we go to Belmont to practice, and he always opens up the gym to us.  
  
He's been so involved -- as a coach we all know, he's a Hall of Fame coach.
He's 800 wins, he's ridiculous. But also for the game of basketball, he's been
on the rules committee, he has spent time, and to be on those committees, it's
like time-consuming. He was an athletic director on the committees coaching
basketball. He finally gave up the AD stuff, he just wants to coach.  
  
He's a coach's coach is what he is, and great at what he does, great for his
kids, has an unbelievable -- he still has a fight and fire, but his kids love
him.  
  
Q. Your reaction to the fact your players don't believe you could
survive by yourself in the wild?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They truly don't know me. I probably would struggle wrestling a
bear, but other than that, I could live off the grid.  
  
Q. Your wife says you couldn't, either.  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, when we watch the shows, I say, I could do that, and she
busts out and says, you couldn't do that for four minutes. But no, I could. I
really could.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

### [Dylan Windler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36879)

### [Nick Muszynski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36925)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. Nick, how have you prepared for the match-up with Bruno Fernando and
Jalen Smith and just the physicality that bigs from the Big Ten bring to the
game?  
NICK MUSZYNSKI: That's kind of an everyday thing, that coaches are trying to
get me to play more physical, play tougher, play more active, so I think that
presents an awesome challenge. They're both really talented, great players,
but that's something I need to work on this whole season. I think I've gotten
better at it, but I still need to continue to work on it. So I think they just
present even more challenge for me to just up my physicality and my activity
defensively."  
  
Q. Dylan, if a recruit is coming for a visit on your campus and that
recruit asks you, "Tell me about Coach Byrd," what are you probably going to
be telling him?  
DYLAN WINDLER: I would just say he's one of the most down-to-earth guys I've
met. You know, in recruiting, he's not throwing out this and that trying to
get you to come. He wants to talk to you about your life and he wants to get
to know more about you. He's a very personable man, very honest, and he
teaches you life skills that you're going to take on with you for the rest of
your life, something that you can't really take into account when you're
picking a school. Those things really do matter, things off the floor as well
as on the floor.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, for Kevin, about 14 minutes to go in that game last
night, and the TV cameras are catching Coach Byrd losing his mind. He is on
you guys. Obviously Coach can't do that like all the time, but did you feel
like in that moment that his outburst did anything to provide a spark, because
it did seem like for a few minutes there you guys really got out of kilter?  
KEVIN McCLAIN: Yeah, definitely him just getting on to us really put us back
into gear and just it helped us to get ready to fight for the last 14 minutes.  
  
Q. Kevin, this is an experience pretty close to home for you. First of
all, how many times have you been able to see games here? Have you ever had a
game you've been able to see here at the arena in Jacksonville?  
KEVIN McCLAIN: No, I haven't. I came here a couple high school games and had
little tournaments during the summer, but that's about it.  
  
Q. No college games here?  
KEVIN McCLAIN: No college games.  
  
Q. What's it like to have I guess the closest thing to a home away from
home college setting and being here in the NCAA Tournament?  
KEVIN McCLAIN: I think it's great, just to be back home, and hopefully some of
my family and friends get to come to the game and support me.  
  
Q. What kind of whirlwind has it been, and what's the schedule been like
the last 12, 16 hours for you guys? Anybody feeling any kind of tired legs or
anything?  
DYLAN WINDLER: Yeah, it's definitely been a big whirlwind, very quick
turnaround, dealt with media after the game and then straight to the hotel,
had about 20 minutes to pack our bags, got on the bus, hopped right on a
flight, got back to the hotel about 4:00, 4:30 a.m., got to sleep at 5:00,
woke up at noon, got about seven hours of sleep, had breakfast, did a little
treatment, trying to keep our bodies right, and now we're already over here
ready for another shootaround. Very quick turnaround. It's definitely
something that can be hard to manage, especially with your body. I think a lot
of guys experienced tired legs playing 35-plus minutes.  
  
We're trying to do just everything we can to keep our bodies right and keep
our legs fresh, but it's definitely very hard. I think I drank five full
bottles of water on the flight last night.  
  
Q. Coach Calipari just a few minutes ago called you guys the most
dangerous team in America. A bunch of people including Jay Bilas have picked
you to beat Maryland. Does this sort of ruin you being the underdogs and
sneaking up on people?  
DYLAN WINDLER: It can for sure. A lot of people have us winning a few games
here, so I mean, obviously we're the higher seed as far as a Cinderella, but I
guess it can take away from that a little bit. But we know ultimately we're
still the underdog, and we're just going to do everything we can to win. I
think it's going to be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Kevin or Nick, do you take anything the last few years from what VCU
did, what Butler did, and say, I think VCU was an 11 seed and they went to the
Final Four; do you look at the recent history of mid-majors making that kind
of run?  
KEVIN McCLAIN: Definitely. That just shows like questions like why not, why
not us?  
  
Q. Question for Nick: The game last night, 14-2 run by Temple in the
first half, 21-5 run in the second half. What does it kind of say about you
guys' collective mindsets that you didn't let a really bad spell get worse?  
NICK MUSZYNSKI: Yeah, I mean, basketball is a game of runs, and we've been
playing the game for a long time now. We understand that. I think this group
is really tightly knit. We love to play. We love to play together. So we have
to understand to weather that storm and to come back with an even bigger run
or just settling that run is critical, and just not letting it get out of
hand, playing within ourselves, and sometimes we don't do that, we get outside
the offense or something like that, but Coach Byrd does a really good job of
reining us back and making sure we're all playing together and making sure
we're getting it done, going on and playing Belmont basketball.  
  
Q. In any kind of a lighthearted moment that you might have with Coach
Byrd, do any of you try to encourage him to expand on his wardrobe beyond the
sleeveless sweaters?  
DYLAN WINDLER: You know, he sticks to it. I think he's had a lot of success
with it, so that's him, and I'm all for it.  
  
Q. Really just for any of you, what does it mean to be able to have two
teams from your conference in the tournament this year and have a bit more
mid-major schools in the field this year?  
KEVIN McCLAIN: It just proves that mid-majors belong in the tournament and
further on in the history of the NCAA that mid-majors can make a big push in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Nick, I know you guys have played Purdue early in the year, which
obviously Maryland plays them on a regular basis, and you played UCLA, beat
UCLA. Is Maryland in your eyes what you see on tape, are they maybe the most
physically gifted or talented team potentially that you've played?  
NICK MUSZYNSKI: If I'm being completely honest with you, we actually haven't
watched tape yet. We're probably going to do that after we shoot around or
walk through their stuff, then we're going to actually go watch it to get a
good visual concept of what they do.  
  
But from what I've seen, yeah, they are. They're long, they're physical,
they're athletic, they're well-coached. They're really good defensively. So
those things can make it difficult.  
  
But I think there's a lot of similarities between teams like them and UCLA and
Purdue just with the way they defend, especially on the defensive end, and
it's kind of the way we have to attack that. So yes and no, they're definitely
up there. I don't know how they rank against UCLA or Purdue, but they
definitely have their own strengths that make them a difficult match-up.  
  
Q. Dylan, when you're not having a good scoring game like what was
happening last night, how cognizant are you of that in the moment, and are you
at least mindful, hey, if I'm not scoring, I've got to get rebounds, I've got
to get a steal, I've got to do something to positively impact? And how
comforting was it that Kevin picked that night to really go off and sort of
make up for the void that you had from a scoring standpoint?  
DYLAN WINDLER: Yeah, it just shows how dangerous this team is. You know,
basketball is just like any other sport, you're going to have off-days. The
ball is not always going to go in when you shoot. It's just one game, and just
knowing that you have other teammates around you that can pick you up and
score the ball when one of us isn't scoring it well. It happens to all of us,
so you know. I always try to do anything I can to help my team win, whether
that's getting rebounds, deflections, steals, anything that I can do, I'm
always trying to help this team win. It's a team effort and that's the beauty
of basketball; it's a team sport.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could start us off with a statement, the
whirlwind for your team to be here in Jacksonville today.  
  
RICK BYRD: Yeah, it's been nonstop, really, since we were selected, and
obviously it starts before then. We lose a championship game to Murray State,
and it's a week long of speculation. As I've said a couple of times, I
wouldn't ever choose it. We would like to beat Murray State every time we play
them, but as it just turns out, that loss to Murray State has been a good
thing for Belmont. I mean, the week-long talk about whether we should be in
and a lot of notable basketball analysts really making a case for us, so the
attention that Belmont University and our basketball program got all week and
then got again when we were selected, and then had we won that championship,
we would not be playing last night, and we'd have had a tough game right off
the bat, and who knows if we'd have ever won our first NCAA Tournament.  
  
In an odd way, losing a game, which is never something that I like in the
least, turned out to be a good thing.  
  
Q. John Calipari earlier called you guys the most dangerous team in
America. How would you assess that?  
RICK BYRD: (Laughing.) Sometimes I think they're the most dangerous team to
me. Last night there was about three or four times when I was really
disappointed with the way that we were playing. You think John's got a little
hyperbole in him every now and then maybe. He's a great guy. I'll tell you,
he's been a wonderful friend, for no reason, to me and our program.  
  
I think our team is at a point where there's probably not a whole lot of
people that want to play us. But I'm sure Maryland is not really very scared
right now. I mean, they've got plenty of good basketball players that we don't
-- the kind that we don't face, the length and the size and athleticism. We
just don't face that but maybe once or twice a year.  
  
Q. And just to follow up on that, a lot of people are picking you guys
to win, Jay Bilas, a number of national typewriters and broadcasters. Does
that sort of take the surprise factor out of it or in this day and age are
there no more surprise teams?  
RICK BYRD: You know, I didn't -- the only person I would have heard pick us
was the Selection Show I heard Seth Davis say that. He's picked us before and
been wrong.  
  
Don't you think those guys have to pick a few upsets just to -- that's what
they've got to do? Otherwise they wouldn't have shows. They'd just go by the
seeds and that's who they'd have.  
  
I'd like to think we're in the discussion, but they're a 6 and we're an 11 and
they deserve that. They play in a rugged league, and they've been tested time
and time and time again. We would be legitimately the underdog, but hopefully
an underdog with a chance to win the game if we play well and they miss a few
shots.  
  
Q. What is the concern with the short turnaround from a tired legs
standpoint, all that?  
RICK BYRD: Yeah, that's a good question, and I don't have an answer for it.
All these kids on both teams have played summer basketball, and they've played
sometimes maybe even three games in a day and then turned around and played
two the next day and all of that. I hope that -- when we go, we'll go out here
and do shootaround stuff and then we'll go try to prepare after that, and we
will do nothing with speed, running, and hopefully we find -- I think there's
going to be a little adrenaline going.  
  
But we had some tired guys last night. There's no question about that.  
  
It's also a little tougher on the other end of the quick turnaround to play on
a Saturday and then wait until middle of the next week after that to play.
You're trying to keep them in shape but trying not to wear them out. I don't
know, it's not optimal. Nobody would choose it. But we would choose it rather
than be on the bus back to Nashville right now, which is where we'd be if we'd
have lost last night.  
  
Q. There have been reports in the past that you've had a flirtation at
one time with Tennessee or at least discussions about that job. When you look
back on your career, is there a comfort and satisfaction in having taken
Belmont's program through NAIA, through the D-I independents to where it is
now as opposed to maybe having had an opportunity to coach at a Power Five
school or at a higher level?  
RICK BYRD: Well, by the time that I was -- let's say we made the tournament in
'06, '07 and '08, and in '08 I would have been 55 years old, and any job I
would have got at that level would have been one that you've got to start over
maybe, probably.  
  
And by the time you're that age, if you're at a place like Belmont and live in
a city like Nashville and quality of life is not more important to you than
whatever level somebody thinks you coach at, then I don't think your
priorities are very straight.  
  
So yeah, I do feel a lot of satisfaction for what's happened with this
program. I mean, 20-plus years ago Dr. Bill Troutt decided to take Belmont
Division I. A lot of people thought that was not a very smart decision. And I
think as we sit here today, it turned out to be a really good one, and I am
thankful that I got to be part of that.  
  
Q. If you were just another basketball fan looking at your team and
trying to figure out the bracket, would you pick Belmont to win?  
RICK BYRD: In this game coming up?  
  
Q. In this game or just in general.  
RICK BYRD: I mean, I thought the Temple game was pretty much a toss-up kind of
game. But in this game, I wouldn't pick Belmont to win. I mean, again, they're
a 6 seed. The committee spent a whole lot more time than I have thinking about
which team is better. It's not easy -- we have to overcome a lot to beat a
team, again, with the length and the athleticism and the physical size and get
good shots and keep them off the boards. There's a lot of extra kind of easy
points that they can get on us that it's hard for us to get on them. It can
happen, and we've had a lot of good big-name wins over the years, just not in
this tournament.  
  
Gun to my head, I would pick Maryland.  
  
Q. You played Purdue earlier in the year, does that give you a comfort
that you've played a team with that kind of physicality or does that give you
concern?  
RICK BYRD: You know, we went to UCLA and won, and before that UCLA had had a
couple of -- they'd had a loss or two, but they'd beaten Notre Dame. They
weren't falling apart at that point. And after us, they went to Cincinnati and
Ohio State maybe and got beat pretty bad, and then they were going downhill
quick.  
  
But they have the kind of size, athleticism -- they've got very good players.
I think that helps our team know they can belong in a game.  
  
Purdue, Purdue defended us really well, and if we hadn't made a little
unbelievable 12 or 13-point run with seven or eight minutes to go in the game
and cut it to six or seven, then it would have looked like a lot worse game
than it was. They outplayed us. But it makes you better when you play good
people, and that's why we've always been unafraid to schedule that way. I
think by the time we get to January, we're tested and ready to play in the
OVC.  
  
Q. Mark Turgeon said that he goes back with you quite a ways, I guess
Belmont was about to join the Atlantic Sun.  
RICK BYRD: Right.  
  
Q. The fact that he knows where you came from, in terms of preparation
from a coaching standpoint, do you think he can get that message across
knowing where this team and where you sort of evolved from?  
RICK BYRD: Yeah, I don't think -- I think that our program is at a point where
you don't have to talk too much to your guys when you're a Power Five team and
say this team can do something, because this is our eighth trip since '06, and
we've had some high-profile wins during regular seasons.  
  
But he knows his team, and he knows how to do this, and this is the NCAA
Tournament, and if Maryland is not ready to play tomorrow because they're
playing Belmont, then I'd be totally surprised, and just like him,
disappointed. When you get here, this is what you try to do your whole life.
They're young, really young. These guys are getting a chance. We had nobody
that had played in an NCAA Tournament game last night. It was huge for our
guys to be in that game and have a chance. They'll be the same way.  
  
Q. Coach Calipari talked about how you had a meeting with him last
summer, just a visit about, he just wanted to get some information and advice
about offense from you. You did the same thing in 2012 with UNF when Coach
Driscoll and his staff came up there. How often have you had these types of
meetings with other programs who just kind of want to kind of glean some
insight from your experiences at Belmont?  
RICK BYRD: You know, without naming names, I'd say that over the years we've
probably had -- over the last seven, eight years, eight or nine or ten coaches
come in from different level schools. We had one that came in and wanted to
know how we defended, and I thought, this is the first time anybody has asked
me that. You can come back any time you want to if you think we defend good.
Everybody else wants to talk offense.  
  
John is just being kind. He knows what he's doing.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

### [Skylar Mays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32814)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Q. Tre, how far did you grow up from Yale in New Haven? And did you ever
as a kid maybe think about playing there?  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, I grew up about -- like if I had a strong enough arm, I
could probably throw a rock to Yale's basketball facilities.  
  
Growing up playing basketball, I didn't necessarily think about playing them
in the tournament, but it's a great feeling to be able to make it this far and
be able to play against someone who's from back home.  
  
Q. I've heard you played some pickup games against some of those guys
when you were in high school. Do you remember any of them?  
TREMONT WATERS: I used to play on the same AAU team as Azar Swain and Jordan
Bruner. He was a guy that was on his way there like to start his school
process, but he had sat out one year, so we had put up a couple shots
together. Nothing crazy, but yeah.  
  
Q. This team, their starting five has four players that average double-
digit scoring. They're a high-flying scoring offense as you guys are. How do
you guys plan to keep up, or is the mindset kind of the same, you're going to
try to stay the same and score, as well?  
SKYLAR MAYS: Yeah, it's going to be a big challenge for us. You know, when you
see that balance on the scoring end, that means they really pass the ball
well, so everybody is a weapon. We're just going to try to stick to our
defensive principles and try to make shots hard for them.  
  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, obviously like when you come into this type of
environment, you've got to play against guys who either push the ball, slow it
down. It's just a bunch of type of different offensive schemes and defensive
schemes. We can't shy away from what we've been doing as a program, we've just
got to continue to do what our jobs are and just keep doing what we do.  
  
Q. Miye Oni, obviously a scorer, the leader of this team. What have you
seen from him on film and what makes him so difficult to guard?  
SKYLAR MAYS: He's a great player. He's been an integral part of a team that's
made it to the NCAA Tournament, so you can tell the talent that he brings, and
he's unbelievable in transition. So we're going to try to keep him out of
that, and again, just try to make shots hard for him.  
  
Q. What have you guys learned from the SEC Tournament? Obviously that
loss against Florida. What have you guys done over the last week to try and
pre-prepare and refocus, especially know that Will Wade is not going to be
here?  
TREMONT WATERS: All season we've been saying, we are a family, we are going to
grow together. Keep pushing through everything, all that adversity that's been
thrown at us. But nothing has changed since the Florida game. It was a game
that we lost. We didn't execute down the stretch, and we know that we have to
come together as a family even more now because we don't have our head coach.  
  
Coach Benford is our new head coach and everyone respects that. We totally
loved the change of Coach Benford being there, Coach GH, Coach Armstrong. But
like we say, we've just got to come together, just be one and not let anything
break us apart.  
  
Q. Not having your head coach, has it bonded you guys as a closer unit?
What has it done to bring you guys closer as a basketball team?  
SKYLAR MAYS: Yeah, you know, the ideal family is when one person is down, the
other person has to pick them up. The huge part of our team and Coach Wade,
with him being out, we knew that we'd have to come together even more, and we
probably didn't show it as much in the Florida game, but looking at that film
and learning from that loss, we understand that's going to be a big part of us
being able to move further down in this tournament and getting past Yale.  
  
Q. Now that y'all have worked with Coach Tony and Heiar and Armstrong as
that collective co-coaches unit for a couple of weeks now, how are you getting
used to that in terms of only having it for one day for the first game?  
TREMONT WATERS: Well, they were a part of our coaching staff before, they were
just an extension of Coach Wade, but now that Coach Benford is our actual head
coach now, everyone is looking towards him, and he's putting a lot of -- not
pressure, but he's putting a lot of trust into the players now and just
holding each other accountable more because when Coach Wade was the coach, he
had more say so. But now that we know we don't have him, everyone has been
coming together. We've been in the gym shooting a lot more. Like we've been
doing a lot of things together without the coaching staff pretty much forcing
us to do it, like throughout practice and stuff.  
  
I would just say that they're giving us a lot more freedom to see what we're
going to do, and I would say we've stepped up to the challenge. We know that
games aren't going to be easy. We've just got to go out, fight together and be
brothers.  
  
Q. Kind of following that up, with all the off-the-court stuff, how much
do you guys think about that other than when you're in press conference here?
During the day between practices, between games, is it on your mind, and does
it anger you what people say about the program and about your coach?  
SKYLAR MAYS: I think there's been a lot of outside stuff throughout the year
and we've done a great job of keeping that stuff outside. You know, once we
step on the court, and I think our record shows that. We should be able to
continue to do that, and me and Tremont as leaders, we trust all these guys,
and we've developed a great bond over the year, and we expect that bond to
keep us together on the court.  
  
Q. Obviously this is a different team than Florida, Florida more of a
slow-it-down type of offense, and this one more of a high-speed offense. Coach
Benford talked about how paint touches would be more important in this game.
Without giving away the game plan, what do you think is an important to do in
a game like this where it could be a shootout down the stretch?  
TREMONT WATERS: I would say we have to get back in transition because Oni,
he's a beast in transition. He likes to push the ball, get out, and their
point guard, No. 3, he pushes the ball a lot, and as long as we're able to
stop those two guys and pretty much play everyone else inside, then I feel
like we have a pretty good chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Skylar, I don't know if you saw, but ESPN rated all the coaches by
their playing ability, and Coach Benford rated pretty high. Has he ever told
you about what a great player he was, and does he still have any game?  
SKYLAR MAYS: Yeah, he brings up how back in the day he got drafted by the
Celtics, I believe, and said he was kicking butt back in the '80s. But he
doesn't dwell on it too much. It was a long time ago.  
  
Q. I don't know if you got asked this earlier, but being from New Haven,
what do you know about Yale? Did you get recruited by Yale? Did you consider
them? Some of the guys said you might play pick-up games.  
TREMONT WATERS: Yeah, like I said before, if I had a strong enough arm, I
could probably throw a rock to Yale's basketball facilities. That's where I
started playing basketball. My dad got a membership to Payne Whitney gym, and
it was like the local -- not local but the facility where everyone could go
in, if you had a membership. So that's where I started. Actually one of my
basketball videos, like my training videos is actually in their gym, and
that's when I wasn't being recruited by them, so it wasn't a violation or
anything.  
  
Yeah, I just grew up playing there. Now that Azar Swain goes there, I actually
grew up playing basketball with him for the CT Elite Basketball Club, and just
knowing that I'm from New Haven and that this team is from New Haven, it's an
honor to be able to play them in the first game of the March Madness NCAA
Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, a few thoughts on the last weeks and how it's gone for
your basketball team.  
  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, first of all, our guys have been great. They've been
working extremely hard. We've had some great practices the last few days,
really focused, especially after the SEC Tournament. After the loss to
Florida, we gave the guys a couple of days off. Came back, had two really,
really, I think, spirited practices. The guys are focused, looking forward to
the opportunity to play here in the NCAA Tournament against a very quality
Yale team, and we'll be prepared to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Naz Reid is a local guy for us. What's his development been like on
and off the court?  
TONY BENFORD: Great. I'll tell you what, I was just talking to another media
person about Naz. Naz has lost 30 points since he joined us in June, and he's
worked extremely hard. Out strength coach has done a great job with him. We
all know about his skill set, but he's been very coachable, he's got a high
IQ, he absorbs the scouting reports and our film sessions. He's really good,
and I'll tell you what, with our big guys he's like a coach on the floor with
our big guys. He's been good defensively. That's one area I think he's really
improved is defensively. He's able to guard ball screens. You'll see Naz,
we'll match him up sometimes on the wings. He's guarding 6'4", 6'5" wings.  
  
I've been really pleased. He should be a lottery pick, in my opinion. I don't
see how guys pass on a guy with that size and that skill set.  
  
Q. Tony, given the unforeseen circumstances of the season, being thrown
in so late, what does it mean having been a head coach so recently? Do you
think it would be -- has it made the adjustment easier for you? And if you
hadn't been, would it have been more difficult?  
TONY BENFORD: That's a good question. First of all, we have a quality group.
What I mean, a group of character kids, and they've really bought in. They've
really taken ownership of their team. They've had to unfortunately go through
a lot of adversity this year, losing one of their teammates in Wayde Sims, and
that really made these guys a tighter knit group, brought them closer
together, more trust and respect for one another, and it made easier for us to
coach them. They dedicated the season to Wayde Sims. That's the reason we were
able to win in overtime. Had six overtime games in the league and we were 5-1
in those games because of the closeness of this group.  
  
For me to step in, Coach Wade really delegates a lot to our coaching staff. We
have a great staff - Greg Heiar, who is ready to be a head coach. He was at
Wichita State. He does a tremendous job. Then Bill Armstrong, who was in the
SEC for 13 years. That's made it easier, having really good -- I say we're co-
coaches but really other good coaches on the staff, and that's helped our
transition and our relationship with our players.  
  
Q. Following that up, how difficult has it been for you to not only try
to coach a basketball team obviously but keep players focused on basketball as
opposed to everything swirling around the program?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, first of all, we talk about narrow focus, narrowing our
focus, controlling -- we can't control the outside noise and what's going on.
All we can control is our locker room and our huddle, and the players, they've
taken ownership of the locker room. They're holding everyone accountable,
their teammates accountable, too. So that's huge when you can narrow your
focus. Kind of have to have tunnel vision and put blinders on. But they're
aware of what's going on on the outside, but inside when we walk in those
doors, hey, it's about preparing for -- for instance, Yale. We've got to
prepare today, guys. We can't control what's going on on the outside.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about the program just being shown in such a
negative light? And do you have any sense for what players think about it, but
also what do you think about it?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, I mean, in college athletics, things happen. That's just
part of life, in any walk of life, any profession, things happen. So we can't
worry about that right now. I'm just focused on these kids and making sure
that we're prepared for Yale, and making sure that we're going to represent
LSU the best way we can at this moment.  
  
Q. I asked one of the players this: You saw ESPN ranked the coaches by
their playing ability, and you ranked pretty high. You were not Chris Mullin,
but one of the pretty good coaches in the tournament. I was just wondering if
you had seen that, and what do you take from your playing days to help you
relate to players and what they're going through and what they're thinking,
that sort of thing?  
TONY BENFORD: Yeah, that was about 100 pounds ago with that. But anyway, I saw
that. One of my subs sent that to me.  
  
But anyway, I had guys -- I played my senior year -- well, I played a couple
years in the NCAA Tournament. I played at Texas Tech, and we lost a teammate,
and I related this to my guys. We lost a teammate when I was in college while
we were playing at the rec center on the floor, had a heart attack and died.
That brought back -- I still stay in contact with those guys. That brought us
closer together, that group that I played with. That's what I see with these
guys. I shared my experience with these guys, and you can see like these guys
have went through the adversity, obviously the adverse situation with losing
Wayde that we've gone through there, a lot of people talk about being their
brothers' keepers and all that stuff. These guys are living it. They are truly
their brothers' keepers.  
  
So we've got to continue to stay focused and continue to stay together.  
  
Q. Tony, your history with the tournament, you know there's upsets
happen in these early-round games. You're playing an early game tomorrow.
What's your message to your team? How do you keep your team loose and not get
tight as a top seed?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, Yale is, first of all, they're well-coached. Coach Jones
is a tremendous coach. He does a great job, and those guys are -- they have
more experience. We have one guy that's been in the tournament. That's Kavell
Bigby-Williams. They have five that have played in it just recently two years
ago, and beat Baylor. They played Duke really, really close that second game I
remember.  
  
But you look at their numbers, they scare you. Offensively they're off the
chart. They really push the basketball. But also defensively they're pretty
sound. I think they're holding teams to 41 percent field goal percentage on
defense. So they're a quality team.  
  
But all we can control is what we do. We're not going to change a whole lot.
That's one thing, I think, is we've kind of kept our routine the same. We've
got to do a good job of pushing the tempo. They want to push the tempo. But
we've got to do a good job, make sure we get back in transition defense and
get to their shooters, and they've got some guys that can make some plays,
obviously Oni and Copeland and Reynolds all can make plays.  
  
So we've got to do a solid job defensively. We've got to be solid on our ball
screen coverage, on the defensive end, and then we've got to rebound the ball,
and then we've got to get on the glass. We're one of the best offensive
rebounding teams in the country, so when a shot goes up, we've got to make
sure we get on the glass, too, for the next possession.  
  
Q. As a coach, you've obviously been thrown into a very unusual
situation. How do you as a coach impart to 19, 20, 21-year-old kids trying to
navigate this with all the outside noise that comes in with a situation like
this? How have you handled that with them?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, earlier I was just mentioning to a couple of the members
in the chairs that we try to talk about today. We can't control what happened
yesterday. But we're mindful of the fact that there's a lot of noise out
there. You know that, but what we try to do is focus in on Yale right now.
That's what we've done, preparing for Yale, and we've talked about that.
Unfortunately guys have great leadership in Skylar Mays, Tremont Waters. You
guys just visited with those guys. Kavell Bigby has been a great leader for
us. So we just really try to have tunnel vision and just concentrate on the
task at hand, and that's to play a really good Yale team.  
  
Q. Has it become maybe a little bit easier now as time goes on, maybe
I'm sure the first few days it happened, there might have been a little more
of a chaotic feel to it, but has it become easier has time has moved on?  
TONY BENFORD: Well, I don't know about easier, but it's helped, and I think
we're settled into a routine I guess is the right answer to that. I think our
guys -- we haven't changed our routine at all as far as our preparation and as
far as the amount of time we spend with our guys and stuff. I don't think it's
gotten easier, but the guys I think now are accustomed that Coach is not
around right now. They're hearing my voice, Coach Heiar's voice and Coach
Armstrong, and they understand that.  
  
And then again, I just get back to the ownership. I think every championship
team that I've been a part of, associated with, it's always about the players.
Players have taken ownership of their teams, and that's the reason we were
able to win the SEC championship is because of our players.

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Dedric Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30608)

### [Marcus Garrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36809)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Auburn - 89, Kansas - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Kansas representatives to the stage, along with
Coach Self. We have Marcus Garrett and Dedric Lawson. Coach, a brief opening
statement, please.  
  
BILL SELF: Well, obviously, we're disappointed in how we played. But also how
we played shouldn't take away from how great Auburn played. They were
fantastic. We hadn't seen an onslaught like that all year, in the first ten
minutes of the game. And they rattled us and we didn't respond very well.  
  
I'm proud of our kids, we hung in there second half and didn't get a lot of
stops. We did play better second half. We just didn't have enough ammunition
to fight off what they threw at us early.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's take questions for Marcus Garrett and Dedric Lawson,
please.  
  
Q. Dedric, when they were hitting three-pointers early like that, how
does that change how you have to defend them?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: The whole game plan was to get out to the shooters. We did a
pretty poor job really, me and myself getting back, and other guys getting out
to the shooter, we let those guys get comfortable and that's what led to the
big deficit in the first half.  
  
Q. My question is for Marcus. Marcus, did you feel like defensively that
you guys did an okay job? Because it seemed like everything they threw up went
in.  
MARCUS GARRETT: Yeah, you could say that. I feel like we didn't do a good job
of getting to the shooters in the first half. But some of those lobs when they
were losing the ball, just throwing them up, everything seemed like it was
going in for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will dismiss these two and turn it over to questions for
Coach Self. Thank you, guys. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Bill, it looked like a couple of times early, two minutes in, you
took the one timeout and a couple of more minutes later, they kept swarming
and gaining momentum. Did you feel like you just didn't know what to do at
some point there?  
BILL SELF: Yes. (Laughter.)  
  
The thing about it, it was a bad NCAA rule change when they went from five to
four time-outs because we could have used more of them. A lot of it's on me. I
should have sent three back in transition rather than send two back. You know,
you see how New Mexico State dominated the glass so you wanted to at least
give yourself a chance.  
  
But the things that you have to -- when you're playing an athletic team like
that, and they're far more athletic and quicker, the things you have to do is,
your first step has to be full speed. You can't run an even race with them.
You have to be ahead, because if you run an even race, it will be hard to
catch up. And they had us so stretched out. A lot of it was we never scored so
when you don't score it's easier to run. But they had us so stretched out the
first half, or the first eight or ten minutes, and Harper and Brown were as
good as we have seen all year-long.  
  
Give them all the credit. How we thought we could maybe guard them really
didn't come into play because it's a little bit harder guarding an open court
than it is in the half-court. That's where they hurt us the most. I think they
had 22 points in transition according to the stat sheet. I don't know how
accurate it is. I assume it is. In the first eight minutes. That shouldn't
happen in three games. But they certainly did it to us.  
  
Q. You guys played better at the start of the second half, offensively
you hit your first seven shots and made up one point. How frustrating is
that?  
BILL SELF: The game wasn't over at half-time even though there had to be just
about everything go right. If you go seven for seven -- I didn't realize
that's what it was to start the second half -- you would think 26 is at least
18 or 16, instead it's 25. They shot the ball extremely well. I didn't feel
like the second half defensively our energy level was good enough to make them
play poorly. We basically hoped they missed and they didn't. So you know we
weren't good on that end at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Obviously, it's way too early to start talking about what next
season, but you're heading into an off-season with some uncertainty about who
is coming back as usual and coming off a different sort of season for you
guys. Do you have some sense of just where you are and how you look at
everything right now, Bill?  
BILL SELF: Well, obviously there's Dok and Dedric and Silvio are all questions
for next year, and certainly maybe other players as well. Which we are used to
dealing with that. That's okay.  
  
The thing about it is, it's been a challenging year. I thought the kids hung
in there and did a great job, for the most part. Their attitudes and
everything was terrific. And we didn't muster up enough momentum like some
past teams have to probably go on a run like other teams have.  
  
But being a four-seed in the tournament, and so much of the tournament is
match-ups, as much as anything. And I got to be honest with you, when I saw
Auburn as the five in our bracket, I'm going, I just watched them play and
they're fast and those are the teams we obviously struggle the most against.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about Dedric and what he's meant to this program.  
BILL SELF: He hasn't been here very long. So, you know, I -- he's had an all-
American type season, maybe not a first-team all-American, but a second-,
third-team all-American-type season. And I hate it for him because he only got
to play two -- he and KJ came and they only got to play two games in the
tournament this year, and it may be the only two that Dedric plays.  
  
He has got to make some decisions. He's had as good a year as we could ever
have hoped for. I don't know that we've ever ridden a guy -- maybe Thomas
Robinson -- but he'd be the only guy we would have ridden as hard as Dedric.
And you wouldn't have to if you had your full complement of guys obviously.  
  
But he's our best passer and you lose Dok, so you take away the guy that he
can pass it to, which really kind of minimizes his skill set a lot because he
is a terrific passer. I thought he improved. He scored the ball. He put up
numbers almost every night.  
  
And even tonight, he struggled so much like he did early, and he still come
away with 25 and 10. That speaks volumes to him not quitting and certainly
playing the entire game. But he's a terrific kid. I mean, I wish we had --
we've got great kids, don't get me wrong, but he is one of the special kids
we've had in our program in recent years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Alright, thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: SALT LAKE
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SALT+LAKE+CITY)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [Bryce Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35076)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Auburn - 89, Kansas - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Auburn representatives to the stage. Along with
Coach Pearl, we have Jared Harper and Bryce Brown. Let's ask Coach Pearl for a
brief opening statement.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: Well, first of all we're awfully excited to have advanced to the
Sweet 16. It's the fifth time in Auburn basketball history that we managed to
do that. We just know that, we're just grateful, all of us, for the
opportunity to represent Auburn in this kind of a competition.  
  
Tremendous respect for the Kansas program. It was an honor to compete against
them. The reality is our Auburn basketball team is a better team than the
Kansas team. I think Bill will say that. I think we just had a little bit --
we've got some firepower. We'd like to think we've got, we're tough to play
against because we have ten guys that play and they all contribute. So in some
ways, it really wasn't an upset; I thought the better team won tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jared and Bryce Brown, please.  
  
Q. Auburn's known as a football school. What do you think campus is
going to be like this week when you get back? It's been 16 years since you
have been to Sweet 16.  
JARED HARPER: Coming back to school, there will be a lot of support moving
forward.  
  
Q. Bryce, over the last couple of weeks, what's changed for this team?
It's an 11-, 12-game winning streak now and an SEC Championship. What's
clicked over the past few weeks? It's now six games in ten days.  
BRYCE BROWN: It starts on the defensive side. Kind of midway through SEC play
we weren't really happy where we were. Coach always talked about how it was on
us if you want to make that decision that you want to go far in the
tournament, it's starts on the defensive side. Ever since we made that
adjustment, we're moving the ball well, defending, you know, being physical.  
  
Those things are small things that it takes to get to the Sweet 16 and even
further.  
  
Q. For Jared or Bryce, six games in ten days, how are you guys able to
still play at such a high level with so many games in such a short period of
time?  
JARED HARPER: That is a testament to our off-season work with our strength and
conditioning coach, Coach D, does a good job with us getting our bodies ready
the whole summer, early in the preseason, and even during the season we work a
lot on our bodies just for times like this when other teams will be tired and
us as a team we're not going to be tired. Plus we have ten players that are
able to run the floor the way we do, we're able to tire teams out.  
  
Q. Either player. You guys got off to a hot start. What was going so
well offensively and did you feed off each other after that?  
BRYCE BROWN: Yeah, like I said, it starts on the defensive side of the ball
with us. Typically when we start off hot on a defensive end, we start off hot
on the offensive end. And that's what it's been like all season-long. We get
out in transition, knock down shots. And I feel like that's just part of who
we are and what we do. And we continue to do that and we continue to win ball
games and go even further.  
  
Q. It must be asked, have either of you guys met Barkley, Charles
Barkley?  
JARED HARPER: We've met him a couple of times. He has a statue in front of our
gym now so we have definitely met him a couple of times.  
  
Q. Any stories?  
BRUCE PEARL: No. (Laughter.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will dismiss the student-athletes and thank them. Once they
have left the stage, we will return to questions for Coach. Thank you, guys.
Questions for Coach Pearl.  
  
Q. Bruce, does this game feel like a polar opposite to the second round
last year?  
BRUCE PEARL: Yeah. I mean, look, last year we had a courageous group of kids.
We went into the SEC tournament with eight scholarship players. They give you
13. A couple of guys were suspended, a couple of guys were hurt. We were just
fortunate to limp home and win our last regular-season game against South
Carolina. We went to the SEC tournament and we just didn't have enough. We
were fortunate to get by Charleston and got dominated by Clemson.  
  
There's a much different feel because we have ten healthy bodies, we're
playing really good basketball. We were in the best position that the program
could possibly be in to win that basketball game. I talked to my athletic
director, Allen Greene, before the game, I said, I know the outcome, I feel
like we're in a really good spot right now to make history.  
  
Q. Bruce, talk about Jared and his play, how he runs the offense. Every
time Kansas tried to make a run, it looked like Jared had everything under
control. Talk about his leadership and the way he runs this ball club.  
BRUCE PEARL: I don't know if Belichick feels this way about Brady, but I'm
sure there are times he thinks Brady is smarter than him. I know he's smarter
than me.  
  
He's got -- obviously he's fearless. And he knows his role. Little guys have
got to be, they've got to have great range, they've got to be special in ball
screen offense and defense. And they have to have command of their locker
room, and he has all those things. Self-made, nobody works harder. Great
family. His best coach is his father.  
  
And I'm really proud of, like the two guys we had in here, Cedric Brown and
Pat Harper spent as much time with their sons in the gym still as we do as
coaches. Night, extra shooting. It's a beautiful thing. We're kind of a
father-son program. My son is on my bench. Next year Wes Flanigan's son is
coming to play for us. It's a really wonderful thing.  
  
Q. This program took a big step last year. How huge is it this year to
get to the Sweet 16?  
BRUCE PEARL: Say again.  
  
Q. You took a big step last year. How huge is it this year to get to the
Sweet 16?  
BRUCE PEARL: It's a big step. I'm very proud of the SEC. I'm blessed to be
able to coach in the SEC. I was rooting like crazy for LSU and Kentucky. I
will be rooting for Tennessee and the teams that we still have alive in this
tournament. Because we had a great Conference this year, so competitive, such
great coaches and the kids, really good kids. So the fact that we're still
playing, I know the SEC's proud of us. That means a lot to me.  
  
Q. Bruce, your daughter was sitting, your older daughter Jacqui was
right behind press row and she's fun to sit by, she's got a lot of opinions.
She seems to know the entire playbook. And she's not shy about sharing them. I
wondered, are all your kids like that? Your son coaches for you. But are all
your kids junkies and especially wondering if Jacqui has said, Dad, I think
you need to run this play instead of that one?  
BRUCE PEARL: Yeah. You can do anything as long as you have your family with
you. And my family's been, we've done all this together. And so it's great to
have her here. She was a pretty good player. In fact, she's probably a better
rebounder than a bunch of my guys. She was more physical than they are. But my
son is on my bench. Jacqui's here.  
  
My two other children, Leah, works for a Turner, and she helps a lot of the
talent get around. She works with Charles in Atlanta. So she's tied in and
connected. And my son Michael is a junior in Auburn. Doesn't that kind of make
sense? We're all in this together.  
  
And my wife Brandy, for every family that's out there, she's so willing to
give me up because she understands this ministry, she understands the needs of
her student-athletes. And so she's get to share me a lot.  
  
My kids are vocal. They yell at the refs more than I do. They think they know
more than I do. What kids don't? It is special to be able to do this with
them. Thanks for asking that question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for Coach? Thank you, Coach.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Corey Kispert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35106)

### [Brandon Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37001)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Gonzaga - 83, Baylor - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Gonzaga representatives to the stage. We have
Brandon Clarke and Corey Kispert along with Coach Few.  
  
We will take an opening statement from Coach followed by questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
MARK FEW: I am really proud of our guys, our effort tonight was exceptional.
We faced a really, really tough hard-nosed Baylor squad that's got a ton of
fight in them. We had massive amounts of respect for them, especially the type
of year they had, dealing with all the injuries.  
  
But, you know, we ended up beating on the glass and we ended up holding them
to four threes. And they were the two areas we wanted our guys to focus on and
in a short prep to try and take away. And as is always the case with this
group, they went out and did it.  
  
So, really, really proud. It's awesome to make our fifth straight Sweet 16. We
do not take that for granted at all. That is an amazing accomplishment that
the players in this program have been able to execute and come through in the
most pressure moments. And so very happy to be moving on and couldn't be
happier for this guy, both these guys.  
  
As I said afterwards, BC was spectacular tonight, but he's been spectacular a
lot of times this year. But Corey Kispert was our player of the game, which is
-- the things we asked him to do, rebounding-wise in defense and then to step
up to make those big shots was huge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Brandon Clarke and Corey Kispert.  
  
Q. Brandon, did you feel like you had to take it upon yourself every
time they made a run? It seemed like you had an answer for that. Was it the
flow of the game or were you being aggressive?  
BRANDON CLARKE: I would say both, really. Really locked in and focused
tonight. So, I mean, if it wasn't me, it was somebody else on the team making
big shots, too. So hats off to my teammates, really. And I feel like I was
focused tonight so the shots fell easy tonight.  
  
Q. Also for Brandon. A couple of people on Twitter wondering what you
had for breakfast this morning.  
BRANDON CLARKE: Pretty much the same thing I have on every road trap: I had
cheese, eggs, bacon, pancakes, and some fruit. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Brandon, another embarrassing questions for you. Do you ever work on
dunks when you're messing around in the gym? Because you had a few nice
opportunities tonight.  
BRANDON CLARKE: Maybe kind of, no...  
  
MARK FEW: They are really easy for him, unlike the rest of us.  
  
BRANDON CLARKE: I feel like the dunks come easy to me. You know, I have had
times when I practice the more tougher dunks, but I'm not out there practicing
them.  
  
COREY KISPERT: He's a two-time dunk champion.  
  
MARK FEW: Over you?  
  
COREY KISPERT: Yes, over me.  
  
Q. Could you describe what this year's been like for you? You didn't win
much at San Jose State and now in the Sweet 16.  
BRANDON CLARKE: It's been something that's been really fun for me. This is
easily the most fun I've had playing ball ever. So, I'm really blessed to have
the chance to come here and to play for the Zags. Obviously, it was tough last
year not playing. But it was something that was huge for me. It is something I
wouldn't change.  
  
Q. Corey, looking ahead to the Sweet 16, are you looking forward to that
rematch with Florida State?  
COREY KISPERT: Absolutely. 100 percent. They are a really good team. They're
going to demand our best and that's what we want. We wouldn't want it any
other way. It just so happened we got Florida State again in the Sweet 16 and
we have a special itch to take care of against them.  
  
Q. Brandon, were you at the game? Were you able to travel for the game
last year against Florida State?  
BRANDON CLARKE: I didn't. I watched it on my TV in my room at home.  
  
Q. Do you remember what it was like watching that game? You probably
felt you could have helped, right?  
BRANDON CLARKE: Last year, they had lots of really big guys that were able to
block shots. They had three or four really long guys, they were able to alter
shots in the paint. But I feel like -- and also we didn't have Killian last
year during the game so that was big for the team.  
  
I feel it's a great challenge for us coming up next week that we're going to
take on.  
  
Q. Brandon, I believe it was you that was down there when Geno threw
that alley-oop pass that ended going in. At what point did you decide not to
go up there?  
BRANDON CLARKE: It was probably going to land in the cylinder so I was
probably best off not to touch it. I was really shocked to see it go in
perfectly. I guess I can say it was a great passing shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and when they've left the
dais, we'll return to questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, there were a couple sequences where your guys worked through
the zone, like, I have never really seen it. Have you worked on that all year?
Is that stuff you put in the other day for Baylor?  
MARK FEW: That's players having great feel for the game and just playing. I
mean, we have been very good against zone all year, and it's primarily because
our bigs, our interior guys can play together and they can really pass.
Obviously, if given the opportunity, they can make plays at the rim.  
  
So that's something, especially when you put Killian Tillie in there, he's
probably the best high-post player I've ever coached. That's hard to say
because I had Kelly Olynyk who was unbelievable in the high post. Killian has
a real gift in there.  
  
Because of that, Rui and even Brandon have been playing with him by osmosis,
watching him make those plays and passes, they've kind of absorbed that, they
have a very good chemistry together. Obviously we can space the floor with
those guards, all those guards can really shoot, and shoot it deep.  
  
Q. Coach, how much of last year's game against Florida State can you
take into next week's match-up with them?  
MARK FEW: First of all, we're going to enjoy the heck out of this. Everybody
seems really willing to talk about Florida State. But we're going to enjoy the
heck out of this tonight, we're going to enjoy it again tomorrow, and watch
all these great games in the tournament. It's just an unbelievable time of
year to be involved in college basketball and we feel blessed to still be in
the tournament.  
  
But look, they returned their entire team from last year, so we will watch the
tape from that. We're a much different team this year. Again, because like
during the warm-ups we were notified that Killian wasn't going to be able to
play so that was kind of a crushing blow to us, emotionally. Florida State was
really good that night, I don't know if we could have beaten them with
Killian, but I know he would have really, really helped.  
  
So we will prepare like crazy. I thought they were really, really underseeded.
I have watched them a bunch this year and they've had a great year. They had
Duke beat at their place and played great all year. I mean, I thought they'd
end up on the 2 line and to see them at 4, that's kind of tough. You have to
beat really good teams to advance in this thing. So, we knew we were going to
have to play somebody really good, and Florida State is no doubt that.  
  
Q. Coach, from where you were sitting, was Baylor doing something that
made it especially tough for Rui or did he have an off night?  
MARK FEW: Baylor, they're a physical, like tough, hard-nosed team, they're
like a football team almost, the way they rebound and how physical they are
around the basket. And I think they bodied up on him some and he didn't finish
the first couple. And so I think it just kind of, kind of snowballed on him a
little bit. He hasn't really had a bad game for us all year. So just really
wasn't his night and, you know, that happens unfortunately.  
  
But we have Brandon Clarke, we have Killian Tillie, and Corey Kispert, and
some other guys that stepped up. That's why this team is so special.  
  
Q. Baylor came out with a 12-0 run in the second half, you took that
timeout. What did you tell the guys to bring them back?  
MARK FEW: We have to get back to bring the fight to them. They jumped us and
we were back on our heels. That was not how we had played the first 20
minutes. We were the ones making plays, we were the ones hustling and getting
those 50/50 balls. And we kind of lost our way in guarding the three line,
they had two threes bang out of the jump, just on a little casualness and one
missed assignment.  
  
So it's mostly just telling them to get back to who we are and what we'd been
in the first half.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: SALT LAKE
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SALT+LAKE+CITY)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [King McClure](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33265)

### [Makai Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30658)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Gonzaga - 83, Baylor - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Baylor representatives to the stage. In addition to
Coach Drew we have King McClure and Makai Mason. We will take a brief opening
statement from Coach followed by questions directed at the student-athletes.  
  
SCOTT DREW: I think every year a coach doesn't like to see the last game come
to an end, but some years are just a little harder than others. In the locker
room we all had a really good cry because we genuinely liked one another and
appreciated how each person contributed, starting with King, Makai, and Jake
and how they led the team.  
  
Gonzaga beat us today, but we didn't tap out and we did what we've done all
year, and that's compete and fight hard to the end. And we're proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Baylor student-athletes.  
  
Q. You guys were down 16 at the half and to come out on a 10-0 run. What
did the coach tell you at the break?  
MAKAI MASON: One of the biggest things was trying to win the 50/50 balls. We
felt like we had a lot that they won in the first half, and we really pride
ourselves on getting those. So that was the biggest thing, just the mentality
of, you know, getting the loose balls, obviously not letting up transition
threes also.  
  
Q. This is for King. Obviously an offensive juggernaut you faced. How
difficult was it to slow them down and keep them out of transition?  
KING McCLURE: It was kind of tough. We felt lackadaisical and they had a lot
of transition buckets. Credit to the guys, like Coach Drew said, all year
we've never tapped out, we've never given up. When they hit the transition
bucket and hit a big three, we come right back and we never ever give up.  
  
That's one thing I can say about this group of guys is, we just have fight and
we have heart. You can't measure a man's heart. I'm proud of all the guys. I
love those guys. They did an amazing job tonight in not giving up.  
  
Q. This is for Makai. Obviously, a tough time right now. How fun was it
to play on this team, you know, overachieved in most people's eyes?  
MAKAI MASON: Very thankful and grateful that I got the opportunity to play
here. Yeah, being a part of the Baylor family, even for one year, has really
meant a lot to me. I've really grown to love the coaching staff and the
players as well.  
  
Yeah, just being doubted all year, to see the fight that this team has, it's
awesome. I can't say enough about them, about the guys, their spirit. So I'm
thankful I made the decision to spend my last year here.  
  
Q. King, I know there's a lot of offensive firepower on Gonzaga. Did you
know that Clarke had that much going on?  
KING McCLURE: He was playing good. Credit to him. He made tough plays, he made
tough shots, he got rebounds. Like I said earlier, he had a great game.  
  
But we didn't give up. We kept fighting. And that's one thing I'm proud of,
I'm proud of the guys for doing that.  
  
Q. King, you said when you guys made it into the tournament that it was
such a good feeling because of how last year ended. For you to finish out your
career on this stage in the way you played tonight, kind of reflecting back on
this experience.  
KING McCLURE: It's been a great experience. I think I can literally say I left
it all on the court my very last game. It was a great year, an up-and-down
year. At the end of the day, we didn't give up. And the guys made sure that I
had the very best season I could have and they made sure that last year, we
didn't have a repeat of last year.  
  
We got to the tournament even when we lost Tristan and all the adversity that
we dealt with. The guys made sure that they kept fighting and for that, I'm
forever grateful.  
  
Q. A quick follow-up for both of you. All season you have talked about
your experience and leading these younger guys and getting them through all
the obstacles that you have faced. Now that you're moving on, what do you hope
that you have left with this group that they can carry on?  
KING McCLURE: Me personally, I just, I feel bad for whoever has to play us
next year because we're going to be pretty good. The guys following up,
another year of growth, summer of work. And just we have a lot of hard
workers. That is one thing I can say about this group. We work hard, we stay
in the gym. The transfers we got coming in. I just feel bad for next year
because I think we're going to be very talented and be very special. They just
take the leadership traits that they learn from myself, Makai and Jake, we
have a chance to be very, very special this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Makai.  
  
MAKAI MASON: This run is definitely going to help those guys next year. The
biggest thing this team can take away is just our fight. So if you have that
fight that this team has, coupled with the talent that they will have next
year, I think it's going to be a scary team, and they will be fun to watch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will dismiss the student-athletes. Once they have left the
dais, we will go to questions for Coach Drew.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how tough it is to see the senior class go and
what it has meant to you in this program.  
SCOTT DREW: You see a lot of senior classes come and go, and some of them they
just mean a little more. I think seeing the emotion in the locker room tells
you how much all the guys poured into this season.  
  
It's kind of like when you have a great time with the relatives, they leave,
and you're really going to miss them, and you cry a little bit more. And
King's one of those guys that I'm so happy he had a great tournament because
he really, really cares about Baylor basketball. Makai came in, and a lot of
times people that are just here one year, it's really about themselves. And he
never was like that. From day one he was a great teammate. He really loves the
Baylor community and I know he will be a great supporter. And we'll be there
for him for the rest of his life, too.  
  
Q. Coach, did Clarke surprise you guys at all? Obviously, everyone talks
about Rui and he goes for 36. Did that, what he was able to do?  
SCOTT DREW: There's a reason he's on the draft board. (Laughter.) That's what
makes Gonzaga really good. It's like plugging holes in a dam, you can plug
three but that fourth one gets you. And the biggest stat line was that he drew
nine fouls on people guarding him. When Tristan went down -- he was a top-five
rim protector, a bigger body, and we chose to play smaller.  
  
So they did a great job isolating him. They did a great job getting him the
ball, getting us in foul trouble. And the thing that I was a little surprised,
I thought we could block him out a little bit better and, I mean, he really
has a quick jump, too.  
  
Q. Was there one thing that stood out to you the most about his
performance tonight?  
SCOTT DREW: Could you repeat that, please?  
  
Q. Was there one thing that stood out to you the most about his
performance tonight?  
SCOTT DREW: That would have been his offensive rebounding, just how quick. I
mean, we couldn't keep him off the glass. I think he had four, but I think I
remembered them all. But sometimes you think it's going to be one of those
nights when they throw a pass and it goes in from three. And I know he had a
shot, we're like, Man, that's great defense. He made some tough shots, him
personally. I know he didn't shoot the three, but I thought us 4 for 21, at
the end of the day we've lived and died by the three so much that really hurt
us.  
  
Credit them for playing good defense.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed as though you guys came out a completely different
team in the second half. Can you just talk about what was said at half-time
and how you got them to come out and really attack Gonzaga?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I think we settled down and played how we play. And then it
always helps when you make a couple of shots. First half, we only had one
assist, six turnovers. Second half, we had nine assists, four turnovers. So we
shared the ball but we made shots then. And when you make shots, you keep them
out of transition. And I thought second half was a lot more of how we play and
I wish we'd have played two halves like that.  
  
But credit to the team and the upperclassmen making sure that we came out and
played Baylor basketball.  
  
Q. Scott, it looked like Mark Vital really gave you a shot in the arm.
Even though he was playing four fouls, he was very aggressive going to the
hoop.  
SCOTT DREW: Him getting in foul trouble hurt us. And block charge calls are
always the toughest to make.  
  
At the end of the day, when he got in foul trouble, he still competed until
the end. I thought they did a good job picking on him and putting him in a
position where he couldn't give much resistance. But again, Gonzaga's -- not
only are they really talented and well coached, but they are experienced. We
had a lot of guys, it was their first time playing on this stage and I thought
we did a great job the first game. I thought our youth probably showed up a
little bit in that first half.  
  
Q. Scott, what made this team so unique is that they never stopped
playing hard for you, you and the staff. They never really caved in or
anything. Given the circumstances, everything they went through, from the
beginning of the season to tonight.  
SCOTT DREW: I think, first and foremost, their character and work ethic. When
you get guys that really are high character and work hard, they're going to
compete and they're going to try. The toughest thing as a coach is trying to
always keep a team unselfish. And you watch a team on TV and you're like Man,
they're great, they really share the ball. And the next game, everybody gets
more selfish.  
  
And for the most part this team never really did. And because of that, that's
how we had to win as a team. So, we're better together. And because of that,
we're able to achieve what we did. It always hurts the last game. But it also
motivates you and gives experience to others that go through it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: SALT LAKE
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SALT+LAKE+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Mitch Lightfoot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35096)

### [Quentin Grimes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36864)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's open it up to questions for Kansas student-athletes.  
  
Q. Auburn's been on a bit of a run here, obviously making their way,
winning the SEC tournament, winning eight or nine straight games. What
challenges does that present preparing for a team that's on a hot streak in
March?  
QUENTIN GRIMES: We have to focus on the game plan. We know they are really
good, like to play really fast, like to get a lot of threes, spread the court
in different ways, so we have to be alert to the shooters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mitch?  
  
MITCH LIGHTFOOT: Like he said, they're really fast, they shoot the ball really
well. They do a lot of things well. They have big guys inside that can shoot,
too. There's a bunch of things that go into our scouting report that we have
to lock into to guard them as best as possible.  
  
Q. Mitch, you are one of the old guys on this squad despite being just a
junior. For those who haven't been here before, what kind of advice or what
will you tell the younger guys as we head deeper into the tournament?  
MITCH LIGHTFOOT: Telling the younger guys, my message has been: Enjoy it.
You're here, this is what you have worked for. They have done a great job of
preparing themselves for it. It's a big moment. There's a lot -- there's
pressure. But this is what you train for. This is what you spend all those
hours working on your game for.  
  
So, if we can listen to our scouting report and listen to our coaches, I think
they will be okay.  
  
Q. Quentin, take us through what was it like to have all five of you
guys that started making your NCAA debut on Thursday? Did you guys talk or how
did you calm the jitters down? What was it like?  
QUENTIN GRIMES: It was great just knowing we had four freshmen that had never
been in this experience. Dedric, it was his first time as well. There was
nerves in the first couple of minutes, as you could see, when they made those
couple of shots. But I feel like after the first time out, everybody kind of
settled down, when you stick to the game plan, everything started flowing
offensively. We had to get the first few minutes out of the way, and then
everybody just play basketball how they know how to play.  
  
Q. Just building on what you just said. The experience of being here,
what's it been like for you and the other freshmen first time?  
QUENTIN GRIMES: It's been great so far. All the freshmen are really enjoying
it now we have that first game out of the way. Now we can focus on just
playing basketball and just for the ultimate title, get to the Final Four and
hopefully just win every game. We've got to take it every game at a time.
Auburn are next so we have to prepare for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions? Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. We will await Coach
Self's arrival.  
  
Questions for Coach Self.  
  
Q. Coach, I was curious with starting five guys who had never been in a
NCAA tournament game, the result was good, but was there some anxiety and some
jitters to get out or did they just go into it smoothly?  
BILL SELF: I thought we played better as the game went on. But I -- if you
have some jitters, which I know we did, tried to take them out on the
defensive end as much as possible. And I think we were pretty good at doing
that yesterday. But I think they all handled it pretty well.  
  
That's going to be totally different playing speed like we'll play tomorrow.
But I thought our guys handled the moment pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, Auburn's been on a bit of a run here, with their run to the
SEC tournament, won eight or nine straight games now. How much of a challenge
is it to prepare for a team that's been this hot in March?  
BILL SELF: I think that -- it's a challenge. Anybody that's won a game in the
tournament can make a case that they're probably playing well at that moment.
So, they're probably as hot as anybody in the tournament, in their respective
league, which is so good to run off eight in a row, and then yesterday was the
ninth if I'm not mistaken. They beat a team yesterday that obviously went down
to the last possession that we played them earlier in the year in Kansas City.
So they're hot, they're hot.  
  
You can look at it that we -- I don't know that we're hot over time, but we
played pretty well yesterday. So I can convince our guys that we're hot, too.  
  
Q. I wanted to know two things about coaching such a young team. First,
has it taken a toll on you? Do you have more gray hair? Do you have to dye
your hair now? Also, how does that make you a better coach when you're
constantly teaching guys?  
BILL SELF: I'm not going to say I haven't purchased Just For Men at some point
in time over the last several months. (Laughter.)  
  
I do think that at our place it's a little different than a lot of places.
There's some places like that -- we don't use youth as an excuse. So
regardless of what's happened to us this year, if you're out there, you still
have to deliver and perform. Our guys have accepted that pretty well. We
haven't played to the level that past teams have. But I think I also believe
there's some reasons why we haven't, and I'm not going to say youth is one of
them. I just think we haven't had our full complement of guys.  
  
I'm really proud of our guys and how they have handled me all year-long. I
haven't been easy this year to deal with. For a large part because frustration
sets in when you think about things, to a coach seems so simple, but to a
player may be the first or second time they have ever heard something. So that
is a challenge. They've handled it great.  
  
I can honestly say it's been fun coaching them, you know. I think sometimes
the way that we play in the past isn't as available to us now so we have to
figure out different ways to do things. It's been fun for me to try to tweak
some things to get the most out of them. So it's been an enjoyable year but it
has been challenging.  
  
Q. Bill, I know your game yesterday wasn't close, but there have been
tons of games that have been close where you have had reviews at the end of
the games, long delays. Do you think that hurts the game, these long delays?  
BILL SELF: You know what, I have watched a bit of the games but I haven't been
able to, like in our film room we have TVs going everywhere and our film stuff
going, too. I haven't been locked into knowing of the exact examples that
you're referring to.  
  
But the long delays aren't good. But I do think this time of year it's more
important to get it right than it is to have a delay. And I'm not, I don't
know which exact example you're... excuse me?  
  
Q. There have been a few of them. It happened in the Auburn game.  
BILL SELF: That was obviously -- and the thing about those situations that is
unique, even though we look at it as I think people that watch it on
television as fans or in the stands as fans and, Oh, it's taking too long, but
it also plays in the strategy too much, because you give a team an extra
timeout that didn't have one, or you allow a team to have to defend something
when they wouldn't have had a timeout to put something in that second.  
  
So from a strategic standpoint, a late game, it certainly comes into play and
that is one of the unintended consequences I believe of the reviews and the
delays. I still think this time of year it is more important to get it right
than it is to rush through it.  
  
Q. Your team is playing against a team like Auburn, who leads the
country in making their opponents turn the ball over. Is that something you
talk about even more with your team about protecting the ball and hammering
that home?  
BILL SELF: Yes. We haven't -- you have seen us. We haven't been great this
year in ball security during stretches. There have been times we've been
really good and times we haven't been. And certainly a big key to playing them
tomorrow from an offensive standpoint will be the elimination of -- we'll turn
it over some, we're going to do that, live ball turnovers where they can
create numbers in transition or shoot threes in transition, things like that.  
  
So, we're going -- "careful" is not the right word. We will need to be very
strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you guys had a comfortable margin of victory.
Auburn's game went down to the last second, an emotional, intense game. Does
that give either team an advantage or disadvantage moving forward?  
BILL SELF: I personally don't think so. We read into those things. So if I'm
coaching, if we had the same game that Bruce had, I would say that's perfect,
it played out perfectly. Then if we had the game that we had, I would say that
played out perfectly.  
  
They've been in real game pressure, which could be an advantage for them, but
who knows. I think we try to make so much of things like that and I'm not sure
that there's an exact science to which it benefits more.  
  
Q. Just a general basketball question. When you look at sort of like the
top five or ten guys who leave college and go to the NBA over the last few
years, do you think the tournament impacts their status at all? I guess that
would be the best way to put it.  
BILL SELF: Statistically, I can't answer that. From me just thinking off the
top of my head, I would say the tournament certainly enhances it. I would say
there's been many times where the tournament hasn't hurt anybody, but it's
certainly helped a lot. And you know you could go back over -- think of Steph
Curry, that would be the first one that comes to mind with me.  
  
And I'll be honest with you, there are some players playing collegiately right
now if they don't have a great tournament, they will still go at the very top
of the draft. We've seen them too much. I do think it can really enhance.  
  
But for maybe a fringe guy, maybe it would hurt a little bit. But I don't see
it that way. I think there are a lot of guys at Villanova last year that
benefited from the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Devon Dotson obviously has had a great year for you as a freshman,
he's matched up against Jared Harper tomorrow, both very quick, Jared has more
experience. Quite a challenge but I guess you could say that at about every
position for you guys tomorrow.  
BILL SELF: Yeah, when you start four freshmen we're going to be seeing some
things that we haven't seen before. There's nobody in our league that plays
like Auburn. You could say maybe when West Virginia with Miles and Carter back
there, but it was still different, but at least the pressure of every
possession. They put pressure on you defensively most every possession, but
offensively, they put pressure on you most every possession as well. So, it is
different.  
  
But Devon will have his hands full. I love his mentality, his talent, I love
his toughness. It will be a big challenge for all our people tomorrow, all our
guards, but it will be one that they will welcome and are really looking
forward to.  
  
Q. When you talked a little bit about the challenge this year, obviously
the regular season run ended. But does what you do in the tournament, can that
kind of change how you look at it and change maybe how people back in Lawrence
look at this year?  
BILL SELF: I think so. I've always thought, you can win your league, win your
Conference, you can do whatever, but if you don't play well in tournaments,
it's just a good year. You have to do well in the tournaments to take it from
a good to a great.  
  
And even though -- I shouldn't apologize for being a four-seed. But even
though the year didn't go exactly as we had it scripted, I do think in our
fans' minds and certainly in my mind, in our players' minds, it takes the
sting off of that totally if you perform very well in the tournament.  
  
So you don't get a ring for winning a game in the tournament. You don't get
anything for winning the Championship. And we've not done that twice in the
Conference in the post-season. So the only way we have a chance to get a ring
would be to advance and to advance quite a way.  
  
So I do think the opportunity to get to a second weekend -- of course Auburn
has the same opportunity -- is something that I think our guys will look at
and say, Considering everything we've been through, this has been a really
good season. Still not great. But really good with a chance maybe to build on
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions? Okay, thank you, Coach.

_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go ahead and open it up for questions for Bryce Brown and
Chuma Okeke.  
  
Q. Bryce, have you thought over the last 48 hours about how far you've
come from being under-recruited to being on this stage presently?  
Bryce BROWN: I think about it all the time. Times like this is where I take
advantage of it and show people what I'm made of. All the people that's
overlooked me, I feel this is the time just play my skills and show them what
I made of and show them what they missed out on.  
  
Q. Is your nose okay? It looked like you took a shot in the face.  
BRYCE BROWN: This is doing much better now. Thank you.  
  
Q. There were a couple of moments in the game yesterday when he was
pretty direct in his instructions to you guys. How would you describe his
coaching style?  
BRYCE BROWN: Passionate, aggressive, just one of the best for us players. You
know, he's a loving coach, caring. He wants to see us do well and see us
succeed. And he was -- he's always on us, mainly our seniors, because he want
us to leave out on a good note and leave out strong. He doesn't want us to
regret anything in the future. And you know, he's a players' coach. I have
enjoyed playing for him all four years, like all the other seniors have. Yeah.  
  
Q. You guys had your run to the SEC tournament, now you got that win
yesterday against New Mexico State. How has your guys' confidence grown over
the winning streak?  
BRYCE BROWN: We know what it takes at this point to beat these top tier teams,
similar of Kansas. And as we knocked off Tennessee about a week ago, we kind
of knowing what it takes, we know what type of ball we have to play, which is
knocking down three-pointers, that's our game style, as well as defending and
getting up inside of our defenders. That's when we are at our best, forcing
turnovers. And we have to be physical, especially with a team like Kansas, we
have to be physical because we are undersized and they have a very physical
presence down low. It is our jobs as guards to help the bigs as well, you
know, get down there and help them out.  
  
Q. Bryce, you mentioned you guys were a three-point shooting team.
Northeastern were as well. Did you watch how Kansas defended against
Northeastern and what you took from it?  
BRYCE BROWN: I don't know much about what Northeastern and I'm assuming, since
you said they were a good three-point shooting team, I'm guessing Kansas did a
pretty good job of making them attack the basket, running them off the line,
which is what I can see them trying to do against us.  
  
And our job is to make our teammates better, me and Jared and Chuma, the
primary play makers, to get inside the paint and not only finish, but to try
and drive and draw to our teammates hoping they can get open looks as well.  
  
So taking note that you said that Northeastern is a good perimeter shooting
team, I still don't feel they're the team we are because we have quick guards
that are not just able to shoot but we can also get downhill as well.  
  
Q. Bryce, you mentioned it there, you might be a bit undersized. What
challenge does Dedric Lawson present you guys defensively?  
BRYCE BROWN: We need to do a little bit more studying on him as a team. Off
what I do know, he's a good physical, offensive presence down there. Not very
athletic, so I feel like we could take advantage of that. He's a big body, he
has good footwork and he has a soft touch around the basket, he can step out
on the perimeter. He can put the ball on the floor.  
  
But I have great confidence in my guys that we'll do a great job on him. He's
a good player, but I feel like our guys are just as good, maybe even better,
so yes.  
  
Q. For both players, you have had a strong schedule, you have faced
Kentucky and Tennessee. How much does that help when you face traditional team
like Kansas?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with you, Chuma.  
  
CHUMA OKEKE: I feel like the SEC prepared us for a game like this. We know how
to prepare for it now, so I think it prepared us really good.  
  
BRYCE BROWN: The level of intensity those teams come with. We know how they
come out and like I said, the top-tier teams, those type of teams, are all
well-rounded defensively, offensively. That's what it takes to be a good team.
They will be well on both sides of the ball. And I can probably see Kansas
being similar to that since they are one of those top-tier programs.  
  
Q. Chuma, when you were younger, you played with Dedric in youth
basketball, maybe when you were 10 or 11 years old. Do you remember that? Or
is that true or not?  
CHUMA OKEKE: I used to play basketball with him, he was on my team when we
were younger.  
  
Q. (Off microphone.)  
CHUMA OKEKE: He was a real smooth basketball player, real good, real long,
like he is today. He's always been a good basketball player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions? We'll let these gentlemen go and wait for Coach
Bruce Pearl. Thank you, guys.  
  
Let's open it up to questions for Coach Bruce Pearl.  
  
Q. Coach, at this point in the game, does experience matter? You are
playing a Kansas team with four freshmen in the starting line-up and a guy who
transferred from Memphis, NCAA debut on Thursday. Does that matter?  
BRUCE PEARL: I would think experience does matter. And older players have been
there and done that. Sometimes, you know, for us we were in a situation a year
ago where we were not able to compete in the Round of 32, we were down to
seven healthy players, and our roster is a little deeper right now. So we've
been there. We weren't able to take advantage of that.  
  
Now we're here against, you know, maybe the most historic program in the
history of college basketball. With the opportunity now to get another shot at
it is probably the thing that jumps out at me as far as experience is
concerned. There are no freshmen anymore; they have all been through it
before. And Kansas still has solid pros, former McDonalds All-American, and a
Hall of Fame basketball coach so we've got our hands full.  
  
Q. You are coming off a very emotional and intense victory whereas
Kansas won quite easily. Other than the fact that they could rest some guys at
the end of the game, do you see any other advantages or disadvantages as far
as the emotional state of the game?  
BRUCE PEARL: I was pleased with our team after the game because we weren't
very happy. We were accountable for the fact that we had a meltdown, and we
did not play very well defensively or keep New Mexico State off the boards.
New Mexico State's inside guys really had their way with us, and Kansas's
inside guys are bigger and better. So we have our hands full from that
standpoint.  
  
But the only other advantage/disadvantage was we were really tired yesterday.
Five games in eight days is a lot, plus the travel. So, even though this will
be six games in ten days, I really feel like having played early Thursday and
now with a later start Saturday we'll be fine, we will be fresher than we were
on Thursday.  
  
Q. Coach, through your run in the SEC tournament, playing against teams
like Kentucky and Tennessee, how have you seen your players' confidence grow
over this winning streak?  
BRUCE PEARL: The thing that jumps out to me is the fact that over the last
couple of years, if Jared Harper and Bryce Brown played well, we had a real
good chance to win. If they didn't, we had no chance to win. That's not been
the case here in March. We've had great play from our bench, we've had lots of
different guys step up. And from a confidence standpoint, I think it's been
really, really good that those guys don't have to carry us, that somebody else
is capable. And so, therefore, the kids are trusting a process and they're
beginning to rely on themselves and each other more.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you do better or differently than other schools to
make you the best turnover team in the country and create steals?  
BRUCE PEARL: Again, what jumps out to me is the rules are constantly changing
and adjusting. I'm a Tom Davis disciple, 94 feet full-court pressure. But
because of some of the different rules, trapping has virtually disappeared
from our game. And so, therefore, our full-court pressure defense has really
had to change. You can't be as aggressive because you're going to get calls
for fouls. So we had to find a way to turn people over in the half-court.
Simply put, we try to take a look at what you like to do and take away what
you like to do and make you do something else.  
  
So how can we stop Kansas's inside game? How can we stop Lawson with his
inside-outside game? How can we stop those guys from driving down the lane? If
we can figure out a way to do that and turn them over some in the process, we
have a fighting chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Coach, your voice is in a better shape today than it was yesterday.
What are the challenges when you do lose your voice down the stretch,
especially in a game like yesterday when you're trying to get play calls in or
yell at guys to do certain things? How do you recover 24 hours before the next
game?  
BRUCE PEARL: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. I'm wondering in a tight game like yesterday, how do you get signals
in to guys when you can't scream? And part two, how do you get your vocal
chords rested so you don't make it worse?  
BRUCE PEARL: We have hand signals on how we call plays. I can call anything
verbally, I can also call it with hand signals and communicate with my point
guard that way.  
  
Late in the game, I had one timeout left and I did not want to use the timeout
in case we were in an inbound situation where the inbound passer needed it.
I'll be honest with you, my coaches were asking me to call timeout and burn
the last one, whether I should or shouldn't have I don't know. I instructed
our guys, up three or up four, what to do in that situation. Now, could they
then take that instruction, get it to the other players and execute it?
Remains to be seen whether or not we were able to get that done or not.
Obviously, we fouled a three-point shooter when we weren't supposed to.  
  
There's a fine line in there. You can go through a situation all you want in
practice, but until you're out there in that pressure situation, that's why
you understand that players are going to do what they do, you know. And
they're going to make plays, both good and bad, so that can sometimes win you
games, it can cost you games.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned your guys being upset about the way the game
finished yesterday. Every run has a game like that; one you have to survive,
one that you've got to win ugly. Do you spin it that way after? Do you move on
as quick as you can? What was the immediate aftermath of that with your
guys?  
BRUCE PEARL: The immediate aftermath was the guys were really down, whether
they missed the ball, turned the ball over. But we still won and we're still
alive and we still advanced.  
  
What can we learn from it? I tell parents this all the time: When Johnny
strikes out and cries, or sometimes he throws his bat, I'd rather teach him
how to care a little less rather than to teach him to care and not sure
whether that was strike three, did we win? I want him to keep score, I want
him to know.  
  
The fact our guys were down tells you they wanted it really badly. Sometimes
wanting it really badly can get in the way. We've been in a lot of close game
situations because we play in the SEC. I told my team that one of the
advantages that we had over New Mexico State is they haven't been in very many
close games because they've dominated the WAC. It's going to be a close game.
I mean, I knew it was going to be a close game because I knew they were that
good and I knew we weren't that much better than they were. We made five out
of our last six free throws. That's how you close out games. We still did some
good things at the end.  
  
Q. How important has Chuma been to what you do defensively, as far as
creating turnovers? How unique is it to have a big guy leading your team in
steals?  
BRUCE PEARL: I know you all love the game, watch Chuma, just watch him,
because I know the pro scouts are. He is always in the right place at the
right time. He is a great defender. Great hands, great instincts. Covers up a
lot of our misses and mistakes and has got a great future. He gives us
terrific versatility.  
  
The match-up of he and Lawson will be a good match-up when Lawson is playing
the four. Lawson will also play a lot of five, mostly five. When he does, I
don't know if I can get Chuma on that match-up as often.  
  
He's been a great, great guy to coach 'cuz he gives us great versatility
defensively and then offensively he can score inside and out. And so he's
really a guy that we try to play call for and he's been a big difference maker
for us this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Time for two more.  
  
Q. Bruce, I'm sure there's a lot of gamesmanship at the free-throw line
that we can't see or hear. I'm curious how you felt about J'Von doing the
choke sign yesterday?  
BRUCE PEARL: I didn't hear about that until ten minutes ago, so I apologize.
And I talked to J'Von about it -- maybe it was 20 minutes ago -- I just talked
to him about. I haven't seen it so I can't comment on it. It's certainly not
something that you want or certainly not anything you promote.  
  
And for me, what I would love, with your cooperation, J'Von McCormick, great
kid, great family, played in a smaller JuCo, his best offers were Florida
International and Florida Atlantic. When we lost Davion Mitchell to transfer
in the spring, I had a scholarship for a player on a team that had a chance to
go to the NCAA tournament, and I couldn't give it away because I had Jared
Harper and Bryce Brown. Nobody wanted to come to Auburn because everybody
recruited wants to start, they all want minutes. I recruit guys straight up.
This is most likely going to be a backup position.  
  
You can challenge those guys. To his credit he said, I'm going to come in and
push him. If I come off the bench, I come off the bench. He's a great kid. And
we haven't lost in March, and one of the major reasons is because of J'Von,
his ability to come off the bench, his quickness, to accept the role that he
had, not complain about it. He hasn't started a game, he hasn't come close to
starting.  
  
So the story for me with J'Von is, Hey, J, I haven't seen this yet, but
unfortunately you have given the world an opportunity to focus on that, which
I wish they wouldn't, but sometimes you have a responsibility. So we're
dealing with it. All it is, you look at it as a lesson, not only for him but
for the next guy. That's not at all his character and that's not at all ours.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. You were talking about your coaching philosophy and things and I
don't know if you saw this, but Tom Izzo is a lightning rod today because he
went out and yelled at a guy pretty harshly. What's your take on coaching
players in games when they mess up?  
BRUCE PEARL: That's a great question. The great Pat Dye at Auburn said: You
can coach them as hard as you love them. There's nobody that can yell at your
kids like you can. Nobody. You wouldn't let anybody else yell at your kids if
you feel like you need to in a particular moment. Why? Because you love them.
They love you. They respect you. And so that's number one.  
  
Number two, sometimes kids are afraid to fail. Sometimes they're scared for
the moment. And why not, the moment's huge. I'd rather have them scared of me
and what I might say to them or how I might bite their head off versus being
afraid to fail and not execute something.  
  
So I don't know what all the hubbub is about, I haven't seen him yell, but I
have seen it before. And so my guess is it's a huge overreaction. Kids still
want discipline. Kids still want to be coached. They want tough love. And I
want my son playing for a guy that knows his role. That's your head coach.  
  
By the way, I told my guys, Half the time I'm yelling at you, I'm wrong. I'm
wrong. But I'm going to do my job to the very best of my ability. You do your
job to the best of your ability.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: SALT LAKE
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SALT+LAKE+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Zach Norvell, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37031)

### [Corey Kispert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35106)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Gonzaga student-athletes Zach Norvell, Jr. and Corey
Kispert on the dais. Let's open it up to questions.  
  
Q. How much of the Baylor game did you get to watch last night? And what
were your thoughts after seeing them play?  
COREY KISPERT: We got to watch most of it, a bit of the first half before we
left and a bit back at the hotel, and gathered how physical Baylor was
altogether. They are not very tall but they make up for it with their
aggression and physicality.  
  
ZACH NORVELL, JR.: For sure. Same.  
  
Q. They run that 1-3-1 zone. How much have you seen that and how
difficult is that for what you guys do?  
THE MODERATOR: Zach?  
  
ZACH NORVELL, JR.: They close things up a little bit more, but it just comes
with swinging the ball and playing together. We seen it a little bit with BYU.
But obviously it's a little bit different, but yeah, swinging the ball and
staying poised.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Corey, anything to add?  
  
COREY KISPERT: Yes, the whole point of the zone is to take you out of your
rhythm and possessions can seem like they are stagnant. But as long as you get
a good shot against the zone, it's a win.  
  
Q. This for Corey. Was it really motivational after losing in the
Conference tournament? You obviously played very well yesterday. Was that a
motivation at all?  
ZACH NORVELL, JR.: Yesterday was a lot of motivation. After you lose, it is
never a good feeling at all. We had nine days off and we all wanted to get
that bad taste out of our mouths. You seen it when we came out on the floor, a
lot of emotion, we were in attack mode all night. It was really special.  
  
COREY KISPERT: Really good to get the monkey off the back.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, Killian had probably scored most points
since he's been back. He's been back since January. What does getting his game
back do for you guys?  
THE MODERATOR: Corey.  
  
COREY KISPERT: Killian impacts the game in so many ways. He can shoot it like
you said. Had a really hot start in the first half. Athletic. His foot seems
healthy. He had a big dunk in the second half. Besides that, Killian is a
great passer, too. Man or zone he can facilitate. We trust him with the ball
to bring it up the floor and making good decisions on the offensive end.  
  
ZACH NORVELL, JR.: Yeah, to piggyback off of what Corey said, not only does
Killian shoot the ball well, but him being out on the floor, him being a
veteran now, him able to space the floor, his physicality on the defensive
end, rebounding and stuff like that. He does a lot more than just shoot the
ball.  
  
Q. This is for Zach. Obviously, Coach Few has had a tremendous amount of
success. As a player, why do you like playing for him? Why is he able to get
the best out of you guys?  
ZACH NORVELL, JR.: First, he is just one of the most humble guys in the world.
He is a competitor. Any time you get coached by somebody like Coach Few, you
always want to put your best foot forward all the time. He has respect for you
on the floor. He always asks you how you are doing. It's always fun to play
for anybody like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions? Okay. We'll let these two go and we'll wait for
Coach Few. Thank you, guys.  
  
We will open it up to questions for Coach Few.  
  
Q. Mark, you guys have had your share of transfers over the years. I
wondered with grad transfers in particular, what do they bring that's better,
that's different? They are learning a new system but they have experience
which helps.  
MARK FEW: We've been really, extremely blessed with the grad transfer. They
backed Byron Wesley, he ended up a seamless way that he worked himself into
our system and into the season. Geno has been -- Jordan Matthews in, was a
huge part of our success in the run to that National Championship game.  
  
Geno's was probably the most interesting, we didn't finally get him into
school and class till right around mid-October. And the way from day one, I
remember his first practice, he was great and it's -- he deserves so much
credit for just how much of his game he kind of gave up to come be a part of
this. And then I think our guys deserve a bunch of credit for openly accepting
him and understanding, okay, this guy's going to help us get to where we want
to go. That might mean I might play less minutes, get less shots, or have less
ball-handling.  
  
So it's been a win-win on both sides for Geno to play in something like this
and be ranked No. 1 for long stretches this year, playing now in big games
like that. That's certainly been what he was looking for, too.  
  
Q. Look, I know Killian has been back since January, but he looked more
like himself the other day. He's going to give you that. What does that do for
this team?  
MARK FEW: It makes us much more versatile. He is a player that you can put
into a bunch of different spots, especially maybe when teams are playing zone
or mixing up their defenses. He's got an incredible feel for the game and
basketball intuition. He also allows us to stretch the floor a little bit more
than we do maybe with those starting bigs. And he's actually moving much
better than when he came back in January, I think because he was in a no
weight bearing and his legs weren't quite there. This last time we were able
to kind of do more things in his recovery. So he's moving better and has a
little bit more pop and he is feeling better out there, especially
defensively.  
  
Q. A follow-up: How was he? This was a big year for him and he's missed
so much time. How was he during that time off? Was he down?  
MARK FEW: To his credit, he was a great teammate and he was pretty darn
positive. He's a really positive, fun-loving kid. You could see where,
especially after the second one, how disappointing that was.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had a lot of great teams over the years. Is there
anything about this team that would be more capable of going further than the
teams in the past?  
MARK FEW: No, hey, listen, you get to this tournament, you just need to win
your next game. And looking back on the year we did advance all the way to the
Final Four, we had a really tough game against Northeastern here in our second
night out, where they made a heck of a run at us in the second half and we
withstood the rally.  
  
Offensively, we've got a lot of answers and tons of versatility and they've
shown for 33 games or 32 out of 33 games that we can really share it, score it
in a variety of ways. But our defense has been rock solid, too. I think our
defense was a big key early last night and then that kind of got our offense
going.  
  
Q. Mark, on Rui's maturation, not in terms of his ability as a player
and learning the language, he is such a big deal in Japan and on your campus,
but everybody in this country is overshadowed by Zion, how does he handle all
of that?  
MARK FEW: He's a very reluctant star. I think he's embarrassed about all the
attention that he generates, especially back home. So we're pretty careful
about overloading him, you know, with everything over here. At the same time
he's under constant -- I'm not going to say "duress" \-- he's under constant
requests for interviews, for sit-downs, for anything and everything because,
again, this is a huge year in international basketball for Japan and they're
trying to qualify for the Olympics. He is the future of Japanese basketball.
He's going to be the first one to ever be drafted. So he's really, really big
over there.  
  
And so, I think it shows his personality and I think the reason he's
embarrassed and a little bit reluctant with it, he would prefer his other
teammates get equal time on the podium, in the limelight and things like that.
And it shows you the kind of guy he is.  
  
Q. Coach, there's no easy way to ask you this, but Jimmy Kimmel has made
some pretty outlandish accusations about Gonzaga not existing. I feel
compelled to ask you: Does Gonzaga exist?  
MARK FEW: I'm a Jimmy Kimmel fan. I've been watching him for years and think
he's hilarious. I haven't been watching any of this stuff. Some guys have
shown me an occasional clip or something on their phone. So it sounds like
he's had a lot of fun with it. As long as they are talking about Gonzaga and
the program, I think that's probably a really, really good thing.  
  
Q. That wasn't a yes.  
MARK FEW: What's that?  
  
Q. That wasn't a yes.  
MARK FEW: I'm not going to go down the road on some silly little deal. But as
long as he's having fun with, he can have fun with it.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Scott Drew and Baylor and what they do that poses
the biggest challenge for you guys?  
MARK FEW: They do a lot actually. Guys, I tell you, I think Scott Drew is --
has been throughout this whole run at Baylor vastly underrated as a basketball
coach. He does a really, really good job. We did some pre-season scrimmages
with him back in, probably -- actually 2017, we did two or three years in a
row.  
  
I was always impressed with what they ran, what they did, and they always had
a purpose and some real depth to what they were doing offensively and
defensively. I'd say he's done an amazing job this year with all the adversity
that they've had thrown at them. Within that last week of a Big 12 season they
were in the hunt for the Championship. I mean, I think this is arguably one of
the best years he's had coaching.  
  
And when you watch this team, the thing that stands out to me is just how
tough they are. They're physically tough, they battle you every possession on
both ends. They're the best or very close to the best offensive rebounding
team in college basketball. We played North Carolina, that's a team that's an
unbelievable offensive rebounding team here, but these guys are right there
with them. And then when they're making threes like they were last night, they
are really dangerous. Mason is a heck of a play maker, and they've gotten some
great play out of Butler, the freshman.  
  
So, yeah, scary team with their toughness, their physicality and the way they
shoot the ball.  
  
Q. You mentioned Mason. He had missed most of the last two years with
injuries. What do you see from a veteran like that? And how much can a guy
like that help a team?  
MARK FEW: I mean, he can help a team tremendously. He's an elite level guard.
I know he's been battling injuries all year. But when you shoot the ball
comfortably out to 30 feet like that -- and it's comfortable -- he was hitting
them from the logo last night. That's tough to face from an opponent's point
of view. And then he's got a really good pull-up game, so that makes him very
difficult to guard. And then he understands the little nuances of the passes
to make, the pick-and-roll of how you're guarding it.  
  
We've been fortunate to have some guys like that, Dan Dickau. Kevin Pangos was
very much like that. He's a little more aggressive offensively than Kevin was.
I have been impressed with how functional he's been battling all the foot
injuries that he's had. He's a tough guy.  
  
Q. Mark, I have heard you talk a lot about scrimmaging, not that you're
the only team that does it, everybody does. Over the years who else has
scrimmaged? Over the years, when you play good teams, you are not playing Duke
every day, how much does that help over the long haul?  
MARK FEW: It help us a lot and helps us prepare for those early-season
tournaments that we're in and to prepare for the level of size and
athleticism, you know, that we're going to see in our pre-season schedule,
because we always try to schedule really hard then.  
  
So, back when Rick was at Texas, we did numerous scrimmages with Texas, and
then we scrimmaged Baylor several times. We had a great -- I mean, very
productive scrimmage with Michigan State this year, actually in Minneapolis of
all places.  
  
So, yeah, that's why we do it. We just try to find somebody that wants to have
two teams kind of get after it and kind of prepare ourselves for what lays
immediately ahead with our usual arduous pre-season schedule.  
  
Q. Would you have an issue bringing in someone who just ended your
season like Baylor has done? It is funny how things have worked out there.  
MARK FEW: Not if you had 31 on us. Geno lit us up for 28 and took us into
overtime on our home floor. I didn't have any problem bringing him in. It's a
great, it's a pretty strong eval if you can see how he plays against your guys
in game conditions. No, not if you can play like Mason.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [King McClure](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33265)

### [Makai Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30658)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Baylor student-athletes to the dais, Makai Mason and
King McClure. Let's go and open it up to questions for Makai Mason and King
McClure.  
  
Q. For both, Makai first, what is this turnaround like? You played on
Thursday, you have a whole new team you have to get ready for on a Saturday,
that quick turnaround.  
MAKAI MASON: It's a little tough physically. But mentally, it's kind of nice,
you can get to refocus real quick, you're not waiting around a whole lot, not
a lot of practice time. So that's one nice thing about it.  
  
KING McCLURE: I think it's a lot of mental preparation. You have to be
mentally focused, mentally locked. There's not that much practice time. We
watch a lot of film. You've got to be locked in to the personnel, to adjust to
what they do compared to what the last team did. So a lot of mental
preparation.  
  
Q. King, when Makai got to Baylor, what was your reaction considering he
had just beaten you in the NCAA tournament?  
KING McCLURE: I was like, Why did we get this guy? Why? (Laughter.)  
  
Coach Drew talked to me about it. He's a great player. Coach Drew asked me how
I felt about it. I was like, He's pretty good, he's proved himself that first
game. So I was happy when we found out we got him. He's been a great teammate
so glad we got him.  
  
Q. Makai, how does one come in and sort of smooth over the thought like,
I know I torched you for 31 but now I'm on your team?  
MAKAI MASON: I hoped a lot of the guys were gone. I think only Jake and King
were pretty much left over. Those guys in particular had done a great job in
welcoming me pretty much as family. So it's been easy to take on the
leadership role with those two guys already leading the way.  
  
Q. Makai, how did you wind up there when you were looking at options?
Did you think, like, Those guys could do with some offensive help considering
I went off on them?  
MAKAI MASON: It's funny. Baylor was a school I got my lists together of
schools I might want to go to, and reach out to. Me and my dad was talking and
I was like, We might as well throw Baylor on there in the end. Coach Drew
recruited me very hard. Just got very comfortable with the staff. Took my
visit, it ended up being the only visit I took and I fell in love with the
coaching staff, the team, the school as well. So that's how it happened.  
  
Q. Why did you decide to put Baylor on the list?  
MAKAI MASON: (Laughter.) I don't know honestly. It's just one of those gut
things, that just ended working out.  
  
Q. For both, Makai, I don't know if you had a chance to watch the
Gonzaga game at all before your game, but if you guys have or seen, what do
they do well that could give you guys some trouble tomorrow?  
MAKAI MASON: I think we only got to watch a couple of minutes. They're
impressive in person and impressive on film. They have a lot of guys that can
do a lot of different things which makes them very dangerous. They have three
or four guys averaging more than ten points in their starting line-up. So it's
always tough to face a team like that. Obviously very well coached, and it's
going to be a battle.  
  
KING McCLURE: I think they're really talented. They have Rui, they play really
fast, so transition between defense and offense will be key. They have guys
who can score the ball, three or four guys in the starting line-up. So it will
be a battle, a great test for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. King, those guys are probably more your size, the team size as
compared to Syracuse. Will that be a nice change? What do you think about the
height they bring?  
KING McCLURE: We've always prided ourselves on being the toughest team. So
regardless of last night, they were 7-2, 6-10, it really didn't matter. We
will go in there and do what we do, and do the business. Size doesn't matter
to us. We pride ourselves on sticking to our game plan and doing what we do
every single day, that's it.  
  
Q. Makai, what were the last two years like for you? You played one
game, did you have doubts about ever getting back?  
MAKAI MASON: I don't know if I had doubts. It was obviously definitely a
struggle, mentally more than anything, just to kind of stay engaged, just
having setbacks pretty much all along the way. Just when you think you're
getting back, there's another setback.  
  
So I really attribute my family and friends for keeping me locked in, keeping
me on the right path and getting through the rehab and everything like that.
It definitely makes it more special to make it back here. It kind of puts
everything into perspective.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that the second NCAA tournament was better than
the first. Why was that?  
MAKAI MASON: Just the struggle that was alluded to before. Basically not
playing basketball for two years, something that you love so much, to have
that taken away from you is really a struggle.  
  
So, you know, kind of, a culmination of everything over the hard times to get
back here, just made it a little more special.  
  
Q. Makai, grad transfers have become very popular in the last few years
in college basketball. When you were looking at going down that path, was
there a particular grad whose game you liked, that translated well and who you
almost looked up to as a role model almost?  
MAKAI MASON: Not off the top of my head, really. Grad transfers have had
success because they're older than everybody, they've had the experience,
they've gone through battles. So it's a little bit easier, the transition,
versus a freshman who doesn't have the experience.  
  
Q. For both of you. Yesterday was the first time for a lot of your
teammates to play at this level in the NCAA tournament. How are they handling
it? Are you guys having to guide them through not being too excited but
realizing you still have another game or is that just taken care of?  
THE MODERATOR: Makai, let's start with you.  
  
MAKAI MASON: They have handled it really well. There's only so much me and
King can say. You can't simulate the game atmosphere in the NCAA tournament.
So all of our guys have done a great job. Obviously you saw yesterday, just
adjusting to that really quickly. We have a lot of mature guys, some of our
freshmen are super mature out there on the court, so that definitely helps.  
  
THE MODERATOR: King.  
  
KING McCLURE: I'd agree. I'd say they have handled it really well. Not getting
too excited. But at the end of the day, we won one game. We have to win
another one on Saturday.  
  
So the biggest thing that Makai and I can do is just get our minds focused on
what we have to do Saturday and just try and help them understand the mental
preparation that needs to go into the game on Saturday in order to win.  
  
Q. For both of you. The way you guys played last night, on both sides of
the board, shooting, taking charges, what does that do for your confidence
level going into another game?  
THE MODERATOR: King.  
  
KING McCLURE: I think that's who we are. The four games before, that was not a
good representation of us. I think last night, that's who we are. We can shoot
the ball, we can defend, we have a lot of guys step up when their time is
called. That's huge for our confidence, especially having so many young guys.
It is huge to finally get a win after the four-game losing streak, especially
in the tournament. That was huge for us in our confidence.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Makai.  
  
MAKAI MASON: Like King said before, the biggest thing for us is our toughness,
that starts with the defensive end and then with rebounding offensively and
defensively. Those are always our keys really. Then if we can hit shots like
we did last night, we're tough to beat.  
  
Q. Makai, I know that your name is from Hawaii and I understand you have
two brothers who have Japanese name. Is there any connection with your family
in Japan?  
MAKAI MASON: No, there's actually not. My mom just kind of likes out-of-the-
box names, so that's just how it happened.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. We will wait for Coach Drew.  
  
Let's open it up to questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How is Jake Lindsey still able to impact this team now that his
career's done?  
SCOTT DREW: First of all, Jake loves Baylor. He's well-respected with all the
team. And once he knew he couldn't played, he wanted to do whatever he could
to help the team. He's a great voice of reason and he does a great job helping
the young guys out as far as what he sees. And the great thing is Jake is very
intelligent, he could be a coach, he could be a GM, he could run his own
financial company.  
  
So we're just glad that he loves Baylor and wants to help.  
  
Q. Scott, I know Makai is the first grad transfer in program history.
Did you have opportunities with other guys and feel like it wasn't a good fit?
And what made you want to have him there besides the fact you knew he could
score?  
SCOTT DREW: We have recruited other grad transfers and he's just the first
that it's worked out with. And couldn't be more pleased and blessed to have
someone like him.  
  
Part of our reason of getting him was a lot of times when people grad transfer
they want to know, Do you really know my game? Do you know how good I am? So
it took us taking an L to be able to explain, Yes, we know how good you are
and what you can do.  
  
The good thing is, it was great, we were walking off the bus together and I
said, It's great going in with you today before the game rather than going
against you. When we played Yale he was the number one person we were
concerned with coming in, had a lot of respect for him even at that point.  
  
Q. With a tough win last night, is it difficult with a quick turnaround
having to prepare for another team on maybe a day of rest?  
SCOTT DREW: In this situation, I'm glad it was a quick turnaround, because the
more film you watch of Gonzaga the more worried you get. So there's the reason
they're a No. 1 seed. Our staff, Coach Jakus was on their staff, one of our
GAs played there. But as a head coach, you don't watch a lot of other
basketball games during the year, you're so busy watching your team and your
opponents that you don't get a chance to watch a lot of other games. So
watching them last night, you go from being in a great mood to, Oh crud.
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Scott, they obviously have so many offensive weapons. How tough are
those guys to deal with?  
SCOTT DREW: No. 1 offense in the country for a reason. If they just had one
guy they wouldn't be the No. 1 offense. And I think besides their multiple
weapons, besides Coach Few being a tremendous coach, and they have a great
basketball history and culture, they all have experience, a lot of it
international experience, a lot of older guys. And that really makes things
easier especially come March.  
  
Q. Speaking of Jake Lindsey, his father is a Baylor alum, how much is
Dennis involved in the program? You have a couple of Baylor alums on the Jazz,
they are out of town. Did you interact with Ekpe or Royce?  
SCOTT DREW: First of all, that's the best thing about being a coach, having a
relationship with the players after they graduate as well. Unfortunately asked
Dennis, Could we dress Royce and Ekpe just for two games? He said no, the Jazz
needed them. We talked to them all the time.  
  
And probably I think any parent can attest to this, when you hear people
talking highly of your kids, you really feel good. And just from different
people around town that we've met, come across, boy, Ekpe or Royce, they're
great people and they're just great role models. But when you hear that, it
makes you even more appreciative to have the opportunity to coach them and
have them represent your program.  
  
As far as Dennis, Dennis is a Baylor guy. And that's why we're blessed to have
Jake, he bleeds green and gold. And he is about the right things and about the
same things we are. So appreciate him. I think he's entertaining a lot of his
former teammates so he might be worn out after this weekend. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. What has Makai meant to this team this year?  
SCOTT DREW: With only three returning lettermen, so many first-year guys, it's
a calming influence. He doesn't get rattled by his demeanor and the way he
plays with such poise and confidence. He's like a security blanket for
everybody out there. Then, obviously, you have his talent and that is --
people have to pay attention to him, and he stretches the defense and that
allows other people to have opportunities to drive and make plays.  
  
Q. Scott, I know you scrimmaged these guys a year or two ago. How much
does that inform what they do for you? How much did that help you guys get
ready playing that Gonzaga team that went to the National Championship game?  
SCOTT DREW: We scrimmaged them a couple of times, played them a couple of
times, so all that stuff helps. We don't have a lot of guys that were part of
that. They don't have a lot of guys that were part of that. So coaches always
adjust what they do to their personnel. So probably can't help as much as if
we had a bunch of returning players and we were running a lot of similar stuff
and the same with them.  
  
Q. Scott, I know it's a bit of a bittersweet day for your family with
Bryce. Have you spoken to him? You know how this business works. How do you
help him get through this?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I think you go to bed and you finally, after watching film
and answer other congratulation texts and told how much you appreciate that, I
woke up and there were more texts this morning than last night. I was like,
What's going on? And, obviously, I think everybody can relate. When things
happen to you it's one thing. When it happens to your loved ones, your mom,
your dad, your brother, your sister, it probably affects you more than them.  
  
At the same time, he's got -- he's blessed to have great friends, great family
support, and he's got a great faith and he knows God has a different plan for
him. And as big brother, obviously whatever I can do to help him, I'm going to
do. He knows God has got a plan for him. He's a lot more powerful and has more
wisdom than I do.  
  
Q. Their star Rui Hachimura, what does he bring to the table for them?  
SCOTT DREW: Someone said can you describe him, his game to someone. I said
yeah, it's -- a lot of guys I see playing in the NBA. So, with his size, his
power, his skill set, he's a real tough match-up. And that's why -- one thing
as a coach, you love he's progressed.  
  
We've had several of our players, like Johnathan Motley ended up being power
forward of the year, who didn't play much as a freshman. Same thing with him.
He put in his time, listened to the staff, got better, now he is a great
player, he scores inside-out, can drive it, can shoot it. So obviously a tough
match-up.  
  
Q. So, everyone knows what Rui brings and he's kind of the star of the
show. But when you watch the film, who stands out to you as maybe their X
factor, that's underappreciated?  
SCOTT DREW: That's one thing. I think all of them have had a chance to get
enough attention. Maybe it's because I've heard so much from our coaches about
each one of their players. I don't think there is anybody that I'm not aware
of.  
  
So, I'm not going to limit it to one guy. I think, again, their strength of
their team is they have multiple guys that can step up and make plays. I think
with our team, that's why we have been successful. As a coach you go into game
and you know, you've got nine guys you're playing and any different one of
them can step up and have a big game, and have at different times.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: SALT LAKE
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SALT+LAKE+CITY)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [K.J. Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32940)

### [Dedric Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30608)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Kansas - 87, Northeastern - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Kansas representatives to the stage. Congratulate
the Jayhawks' coach Bill Self, Dedric Lawson, and KJ Lawson. We will ask the
coach for a brief opening statement and then turn it open to questions to the
student-athletes.  
  
BILL SELF: I thought we came into the game with a great mindset and performed
pretty well for the most part 40 minutes, defensively especially. I thought
our ball screening and switching was better and it eliminated them getting a
lot of uncontested looks so they could shoot the ball. It is one game, and
certainly, you know, sets up a game in which we have to be as athletic and as
in tune as we've been all year playing Auburn.  
  
Q. Dedric, at a point in the second half when they'd cut it to seven
points, you guys proceeded to outscore them 32-6 over an 11-minute stretch.
What did you do specifically defensively that you were able to neutralize
their perimeter shooting and shut down their offense during that key
stretch?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: We came out second half kind of lackadaisical, kind of
comfortable, and our coach got us in a huddle and once he did, the guys
realized the game was not over and we just locked down and guarded it. We
switched forwards and made it tough on those guys and we did the best we could
to give them the one shot, so that helped out a lot.  
  
Q. Dedric, could you comment on KJ's performance and if you knew he was
going to have a big game. KJ, could you comment on your game today? Were you
intent to be a leader and break out today?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: You say if I knew he was going to have a good game? I expect
everyone to have a good game when we go out there. It doesn't always go that
way.  
  
He definitely came out aggressive. He played defense. He got some rebounds
early. There was one particular play where the guy didn't stepped up and he
got a lay-up and he came back in and got another lay-up. So I guess easy
baskets can get you going in a game like this. And he played great tonight and
we need everyone to step up, and tonight it was his calling.  
  
KJ LAWSON: I think I had a solid performance. As a team we did a great job on
defense. We had a bounce attack on the offensive end and everybody was
assertive going downhill and trying to make guys guard and we were settling
for threes early in the game. And once we settled in everybody was in attack
mode and everybody had a great solid performance today.  
  
Q. I was wondering if both of you could answer this: You watched this
last year, the tournament run that Kansas went on, you were there for a front
row seat. What was this like being out there today, finally getting to be your
turn in this thing?  
KJ LAWSON: It was a great moment. Being in that moment and watching those
great guys that came before us, like Svi Mykhailiuk and Devonte' Graham, and
you want to be on the court with those guys. Actually being in the situation
where we can play, it's a great feeling my first tournament game playing.  
  
DEDRIC LAWSON: I went to bed early last night so the morning could come
faster, so we could get out there and be a part of such a great opportunity.
I'm looking forward to it for a long time...  
  
Q. What time?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: I went to bed 10:30, 10:45.  
  
Q. How do you think you did regarding the three and was that mentioned
so much this week that that was a big emphasis?  
KJ LAWSON: We knew those guys have great players, great three-point shooters
and the emphasis is those guys average 26 threes a game and they make ten. And
we just tried to get to the shooter as quick as possible on the ball screen
defense.  
  
They're a great team and I wish them the best of luck.  
  
DEDRIC LAWSON: Next season though. (Laughter.)  
  
KJ LAWSON: Come on, bro. (Laughter.)  
  
DEDRIC LAWSON: They did a decent job. The guy slipped between me and Q, No. 20
hit a shot, other than that, that was the only mishap personally. But as a
team, we were locking in defensively. And the same thing for Saturday, another
team, they shoot threes. It was a good preparing game for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for student-athletes? We will dismiss Dedric and
KJ and return to questions for Coach Self in just a moment. Questions for
Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, KJ had 23 minutes tonight, that was match-up based coming in,
did you know you were going to use him more or was it performance based?  
BILL SELF: I think it was both. The fact that we knew that we were probably
going to play small the vast majority of the game and when you look at it, we
only have, what do we have, five perimeter players total. So naturally it was,
if we're going to play small, four out of five are in the game -- maybe we
have six. So, yeah, I didn't anticipate, you know, spreading the minutes out
like we did, but he was on a roll and we were better with him in the game so
it was a natural thing to do.  
  
Q. Bill, you had that line the other week about your team being a bit
like the "50 First Dates," the Drew Barrymore thing. Do you feel you have a
better sense of what you might be able to expect after today? How much did
today seemed you reached them and they were locked into the scouting report?  
BILL SELF: I thought our guys were as locked in as they have been in a long
time. One thing about Northeastern, it's so important to take away shots off
the catch and make them try to score off the bounce, which will be totally
different with Saturday because you've got to take away shots off the catch
and be able to contain the ball so you don't force help everywhere.  
  
Our guys were locked in pretty well. We didn't play great early offensively at
all. I don't know when the 21-21 or 21-19, something like that, but after that
point, after about the ten-minute mark in the first half, I thought we
executed on both ends really well.  
  
Q. (Off microphone.)  
BILL SELF: I understand better what maybe we can expect tomorrow. But after
practice who knows what that will mean for Saturday. I do think that we're
playing the right way, even when we got our butts beat against Iowa South, I
thought we played the right way, we just didn't finish plays and certainly
didn't score the ball.  
  
But tonight, the margin's misleading because we shot it really well late and
they had some open looks that they didn't make that they normally make. But,
overall, I do think that maybe we're getting an understanding of how we have
to play to be successful.  
  
Q. Coach, it is one possession, but that first defensive possession of
the game where you get the long two and he doesn't draw, was that a positive
sign? Did that help the mental state of your guys?  
BILL SELF: First possession is probably too early. I do think it did help.
They come back and really, of our first five or six defensive possessions, I'd
say four of them were really good. The other two they made threes on.  
  
But I did think that defensively we were so much better and I didn't feel like
there was a lot of uncontested looks. Even when they made shots, I felt like
we had a hand in their face and we didn't put ourselves in a situation where
we were playing catch-up throughout the entire possession.  
  
Q. Bill, you are used to this kind of performance from Dedric. Was his
match-up perfect on how he performed today?  
BILL SELF: Would you repeat that in English, please? No, I'm joking. Go ahead.  
  
Q. And how it all played out was perfect for how he plays?  
BILL SELF: The match-up -- Dedric is a hard match-up for folks. If you play
small like they did, you have a guard guarding him. And if you play big, he
can play away from the basket some.  
  
Basically, Northeastern, Bill, is going to play four guards primarily so we
tried to make it a conscious effort to throw it inside to him. We didn't do it
enough. When we did, it certainly helped our cause quite a bit.  
  
Q. Coach, you limited Vasa Pusica to 2 of 13 from the floor. What was
the strategy to containing him and how was that so effective for you?  
BILL SELF: (A) he missed some shots that he normally makes, so that's not
really defense. Our whole game plan -- we went under one ball screen on him
and he made a three. Our game plan was to hard edge him, make him change
direction and certainly go over every ball screen and every dribble handoff,
and the switching helped us do that.  
  
Q. It seemed like there were two time-outs at least during which the
tone changed a bit after you guys came back out. I think you guys had not been
going inside much, maybe the second timeout. So I wonder if that was a point
of emphasis? Could you expand on Dedric's point about being lackadaisical the
first two minutes.  
BILL SELF: I thought Dedric had Q wide open on an uncontested lob the first
possession of the half and he underthrew it by ten feet. Terrible. He is our
best passer. Then we gave up a couple looks. It goes from 12 to 7 and Q, he
made one basket, but he made the biggest basket of the game getting it back to
ten and Dedric made a three after that. So we had been outplayed the first
three minutes of the second half and we gained one point in the margin.  
  
So I thought those were probably the two biggest offensive possessions. After
that, we got on a good roll. We moved the ball well offensively second half.  
  
Q. (Off microphone.)  
BILL SELF: I thought we were jacking around. The half-time is long. And I
still don't know the guys totally understand the importance of every minute
and every possession in an NCAA tournament game. I felt like we allowed them
to believe that they could certainly play with us and at that point in time,
they definitely were.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [J'Von McCormick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36982)

### [Jared Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35147)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Auburn - 78, New Mexico State - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's open it up to a brief opening statement from Coach Pearl
from Auburn.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: I want to congratulate New Mexico State, Coach Chris Jans on an
outstanding season. His team plays like he coaches. No fear, they're well
coached. They play together. They're relentless on the boards. And I told my
team that the toughest one for us to win was probably going to be the first
one. The next game, the team will play Kansas or Northeastern, are not better
than New Mexico State, they're as good. A great compliment to New Mexico
State.  
  
Our kids worked hard to build that lead and we did not do a great job of
taking care of the ball, but giving New Mexico State credit for pushing us to
the limit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jared, every time they made a run in the second half, you came up
with the big shot. Same in the SEC Championship. Talk us through it.  
JARED HARPER: I started to shoot the ball well. I was able to get a lay-up
early in the second half, that helped my confidence, and I think I hit my
first three to start the second half. Being able to make plays, my teammates
trusting me, so that's all.  
  
Q. What was the atmosphere like at the end of the game in the final
minute of an intense NCAA first-round match-up?  
JARED HARPER: Like the coach said before, the first game was going to be the
hardest game. We made some plays down the stretch that didn't help us, we made
a lot of mistakes. I made a couple of mistakes, a couple of turnovers, bad
foul situation at the end and getting myself out of the game.  
  
So I'm glad my teammates bailed me out.  
  
Q. You were flashing the choke gesture in those last free throws. Were
you hoping to get the free-throw shooter's attention there?  
J'VON McCORMICK: I saw in his face he was pretty scared. We knew coming in
they were a bad free-throwing team so that was the key.  
  
Q. Can you describe the Auburn swagger for me?  
J'VON McCORMICK: I feel like -- I don't know. I really can't tell you.  
  
Q. (Off microphone.)  
J'VON McCORMICK: We all got a chip on our shoulder, so we come out with that
swag, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and then direct questions to
Coach Pearl.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: Can I follow up on that swagger? I'm glad you think we have a
swagger. But I think the hesitation in answering the question is because I'm
not so sure our kids do in this sense. He came back with it. He says, We got a
chip on our shoulder. J'Von was not a heavily-recruited player. Most of our
guys were three starts. So we've developed a confidence and a trust in one
another and our depth as the season progressed. I don't know that we really
have a swagger. Yet.  
  
Q. Bruce, how agonizing for you was that last few minutes of that game?
Have you ever been involved in anything quite that preposterous?  
BRUCE PEARL: The only time I can remember almost losing it like that was when
we did lose it Jared's freshman year against Missouri the first round of the
SEC tournament. And it was kind of unfolding the same way.  
  
No matter how many times you practice your spacing and what you want to do in
those situations, until you get in that moment, you don't know how you're
going to react. We obviously panicked and made our share of mistakes which
could have cost us the game. At the same time, we made enough really good
plays throughout the game against a really good team.  
  
That's a really good 5-12 win for Auburn because that New Mexico State team is
formidable. I don't want to do it again, though. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Coach, on that final sequence, you know they were going to look for a
lob towards the basket. Your defense did a great job of forcing the kickout
and a wild three. Was that the plan, tuck it in the middle and force a long
jumper?  
BRUCE PEARL: Again, Chris did a great job with that call. Thinking 1.7, we got
to protect the rim. They have some good lob things in there so I put my
center, one of my centers on the ball. I actually played two centers; one to
protect the rim. But we did not switch out on the ball side shooter and so
that was a mistake and they got a clean look and could have knocked it down.  
  
We got a good test and we're fortunate.  
  
Q. Do you take anything from this game and apply it to the next round?  
BRUCE PEARL: Could you repeat that?  
  
Q. Do you take anything from this game and apply it to the next round?  
BRUCE PEARL: This was our fifth game in eight days. Stop and think about that.
Our fifth game in eight days. It looked like it. Bryce was tired, Jared was
exhausted at the end of that game. So I think what I'm going to take away is
we're going to be fresher. Horace is the energy bunny out there, this is his
fifth game in eight days. He didn't have a ton of energy. We played Sunday. We
traveled all across the country. We had to play hard because of the way New
Mexico State plays. Our kids were popped at the end.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: SALT LAKE
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SALT+LAKE+CITY)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Chris Jans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35083)

### [Johnny McCants](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36979)

### [AJ Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36980)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Auburn - 78, New Mexico State - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome New Mexico State. Comments from Coach Jans.  
  
CHRIS JANS: Heck of a college basketball game. That is what March Madness is
all about. Really proud of our guys. I think a lot of teams would have packed
and went home when it got bleak for a while. We kept trying to whittle it back
and we gave ourselves a chance. We gave ourselves a chance, in the end to come
from behind and get a win in the tournament. Unfortunately, we didn't.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for AJ Harris and Johnny McCants.  
  
Q. I want to know, did you know you were down by two and based on that,
you know, talk about your decision to kick it out for the win, I guess?  
AJ HARRIS: I seen the points, we were down two, so I felt like Terrell Brown
was open, he got a great shot off, got fouled. I was trusting my teammate, my
partner.  
  
Q. Did you think you had an open shot? For us, it looked like you were
open. I don't know.  
AJ HARRIS: Yes, I did, I had the open shot. I felt like Terrell Brown was
going to hit the three.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions for New Mexico State student-athletes?  
  
Q. You got a lot of guys on this team that are going to be back next
year. How much encouragement do you take in a loss from this game going into
next year?  
JOHNNY McCANTS: This loss is hard for us. We have a lot of young guys, first
time in the tournament. They saw what we could do this year. We're going to
take this loss right now for a couple of days and get right back to it next
week. We can't dwell on this for a long time. The season comes fast next year.
We have to be ready for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for student-athletes?  
  
Q. AJ and Johnny, can you talk about, you shot the ninth-most threes in
the country this year. Can you talk about the philosophy of taking a three
over a two a lot of times?  
AJ HARRIS: Could you say that again?  
  
Q. You shot the ninth-most threes in the country this year. That is not
an accident. I wanted to get your thoughts about taking the three over the two
at any time in the game.  
JOHNNY McCANTS: We got shooters that stay after practice and they work on
their shot all the time. When one gets going, like if we get on a streak with
them. But we try to get the ball inside the most that we can.  
  
They're a good team. They're on the high side the whole time so it is hard to
get it in. We had open shots at the end, in the whole game, and we couldn't
get them to fall.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for these two?  
  
Q. Johnny, you did a good job protecting the rim. Going into this game,
was that the plan, protect the rim, make them kick out and hit those long
shots? Because you did a great job today.  
JOHNNY McCANTS: The plan was to don't get beat at the point of attack, but if
we do, step in and take a charge. A lot of the teams, they're all athletic,
they want to block shots and they are not used to people taking charges. So we
tried to take charges most we can and show the rim most we can and have them
kick it out and scramble off that.  
  
We tried our hardest to get as many charges as we can but we didn't get the
calls.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and return to questions for
Coach Jans. Thank you, guys. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Chris, in that situation, given your druthers, does he take the lay-
up or kick the ball for the three?  
CHRIS JANS: I have trusted my guys to make great decisions, and we have. We
have won a lot of games, just like this game unfolded, we won a lot of games
where the ball was in AJ Harris's hand or Terrell Brown's hand and the clock
was running down and we made the final shot.  
  
Right now, you can sit up here and second-guess his decision to kick it out to
Terrell Brown instead of trying to lay the ball in. And, you know, obviously
at that point, it is out of your control and you have to trust your players
and players make plays. If he does make all three free throws or makes the
three, it is an Ali Farokhmanesh moment and that will be remembered forever.
That's what happens in the NCAA tournament.  
  
I trust my players, players make plays, and it didn't work out for us this
particular time.  
  
Q. Coach, have you watched the replay of it yet or are you almost not
wanting to see that? I don't know how open he was because it wasn't right in
front of me.  
CHRIS JANS: I didn't watch the replay, no.  
  
Q. Will you?  
CHRIS JANS: Yes.  
  
Q. Are you looking forward to that or is it going to be painful?  
CHRIS JANS: I'm looking forward to watching it at some point. I won't watch it
today, or tomorrow, but at some point I will get over this and put myself back
together and sit down and watch it. It will be hard, I'm sure.  
  
At the same time, I'm really proud of our players. I mean, again, a lot of
teams would have went away and they didn't. They showed what they're made of.
They showed how much character they have. They showed how resilient they are
and how hungry they are. And I think everybody understands there is no moral
victories in sports. Certainly there isn't in the NCAA tournament. But at the
same time, I'm proud of our players, the way they competed and stuck around
and found a way to have a chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Coach, a couple of minutes left, you were still down by eight and you
had a hard time making a dent into that cushion. What was the attitude like of
the guys at that point? Did you think that this could come down to the end?  
CHRIS JANS: They were awesome. I mean, they were awesome. They were
encouraging one another, picking each other up. Very lively in our huddles,
which has been the case the last few weeks of the season. They've really
bought into what we were doing and we obviously had a big winning streak going
and we had a lot of confidence. We had been in that situation earlier this
year and we tried to talk about that and lean on that and, you know, it was
just too little too late.  
  
Q. Chris, you've had 50-plus wins in two years at New Mexico State,
back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances against Power Five opponents, quality
Power Five opponents. You've got basically your whole team coming back. What
can New Mexico State and you guys do to get a higher seed if you win the WAC
next year? What can the WAC do as a whole to put the champions in that
position?  
CHRIS JANS: Obviously, the next step for our program is to win this game, and
go to the Sweet 16 hopefully. And we know it, you know, we understand the
history of this program and how meaningful this program is to the people of
Las Cruces, and to the university and all the fans that follow us worldwide.
And we understand how important that is. And we want to make it happen, you
know.  
  
We've had two cracks at it. We weren't able to accomplish that goal, to kick
that door in, but we got a lot of guys coming back. And we'll certainly
regroup and pick up our pants, if you will, and get back to work at some
point.  
  
But it's disappointing. We had a chance to be a team that won a game in the
tournament, for our program that's been quite some time and I know that fan
base is dying for it, and we are too.  
  
Hopefully, the WAC will continue to improve. We're turning heads nationally in
terms of our numbers ranking-wise. We have really good coaches in our league
and they've been allowed to string together recruiting classes and everybody's
scheduling a little more aggressively to try to help one another. This past
fall we had a lot of near-misses in our league. There are a lot of teams that,
you know, that had chances against teams that were ranked higher than them,
that really helped their particular resume and our overall resume. And
hopefully that will continue and hopefully next fall we'll win some of those
games, so whoever represents the WAC next year will have a chance to have a
little better seed.  
  
Q. Coach Jans, you have been a part of some of these tournament games
like here and in your past. So are you guys equipped to advance in the
tournament now? Are you guys built to advance here? Physically, you matched up
with them, it's a matter of getting a better seed and knocking down some of
those shots at this point?  
CHRIS JANS: I think so. We can have a whole different narrative right now.
Make another free throw or two, Trev makes that last shot -- and he shot the
ball extremely well from three tonight. And I think we were prepared this year
more than we were last year. We talked about it, part of the tournament we
felt last year we had to make some changes in how we played offensively and
spread the court a little bit more. It was beneficial to us. I thought it was
beneficial to us this afternoon, you know.  
  
We out-rebounded 39-24. They outsized us all the way up and down the roster.
But we expected to out-rebound them, that is what we do, that is our calling
card. We've got the right players, the right mindset and we have to keep
getting better and hopefully put ourselves in a position to have a chance next
year.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Greg Herenda](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30633)

### [Mike Holloway, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36929)

### [Darnell Edge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36871)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Gonzaga - 87, Fairleigh Dickinson - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Fairleigh Dickinson representatives to the stage,
student-athletes Darnell Edge and Mike Holloway, Jr. and Coach Greg Herenda.
We will ask Coach Greg Herenda to make an opening statement really briefly and
then we will turn it over to questions for the student-athletes. We will take
our brief opening statement from Coach.  
  
GREG HERENDA: I'd like to thank everyone for covering this great event.
Congratulate Gonzaga on a tremendous performance. I think they were rested,
ready. And maybe a little angry they did not win their Conference
Championship. And they played incredibly well on both ends of the ball.  
  
I'm so proud of my team. I felt that, you know, it was a really tough first
half to go through. Again, what happened was these kids rallied and our goal
was to win the second half. And we lost by two points and that might seem
trivial to some, but we don't quit. We stayed together.  
  
And these two guys next to me are what college basketball was all about. And
our third senior, Nadi Beciri, who made that basket, he was out for 30 games
or so, with a real bad back injury. And that was kind of our victory tonight,
that we played a great team and fought and never quit. But we were beaten
soundly by a team that has the potential to win a National Championship.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Darnell Edge and Mike Holloway, Jr., please.  
  
Q. Can you describe the range of emotions for the last few weeks? You
win the NEC title, you come here and obviously face one of the best teams in
the country and lose, what the last few weeks have been like for you guys.  
DARNELL EDGE: It's been a great experience for all of us being able to get
back and win a Championship and then get to the tournament and win a game is
just history. So it's something I will never forget, me and Mike have gone a
long way. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of this team. I'm really happy and proud
of everything we've accomplished.  
  
Q. For both the players. Gonzaga's awesome offensively, they have been
all season and everyone knows that about them. But how good were they
defensively tonight, especially in the first half?  
THE MODERATOR: Darnell?  
  
DARNELL EDGE: They were real good, real long, athletic. It was hard to get
down the lane on them. When you did, they had a shot blocker. So it was just
difficult, on the ball, defense, they are really good and active, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mike?  
  
MIKE HOLLOWAY, JR.: They were very, very good on defense. We know they are a
National Championship capability team. We got downhill, we were not used to
their size, but we were fighting, we kept pushing and all we wanted to do was
let everyone know we weren't going to quit.  
  
Q. Have you ever seen a team like that or played against a team like
that?  
THE MODERATOR: Darnell?  
  
DARNELL EDGE: Not that offensively sound. Defensively, Cincinnati a few years
ago was pretty good defensively like that. This team has so much firepower
offensively.  
  
Q. What are you going to remember the most about the last few weeks? Is
there going to be one moment that sticks out with you the most and stay with
you for years later?  
DARNELL EDGE: Nothing in particular. Just the moment we won the Championship,
you know, running on the court, cutting down the nets and then winning the
game, you know, two nights ago was big for us. It was history. My phone
wouldn't stop going off. It was a great celebration and I was happy, filled
with emotion. It is something I will never forget.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for student-athletes? We'll let them go and we'll
return with questions for Coach as soon as they have left the stage. Thank
you, guys. Questions for Coach Herenda.  
  
Q. When you are playing a team that good and they get hot and they're
just blitzing you guying, how do you make sure at half-time your kids are not
completely deflated and that you did play them so well the second half?  
GREG HERENDA: Yes, that's the core of our team, that we just rebound. Our
first Championship year was 2016, we lost 15 straight games in 2015. So in '15
we lost 15 straight, then in 2016 we win a Championship. So we fight back, we
have resilience. Rich Conrad, who is an alum that passed two years ago, Hall
of Famer, we hung up his jersey, he said, Greg, your team is so resilient. So
was Rich Conrad.  
  
That's how we practice every day and how we play and how we approach life. You
have to get off the canvas and fight, even though you know you're not going to
win. And that's what the kids did in the second half and I was proud.  
  
I'm still not happy. I thought we could have played better in the first half.
I honestly think -- I don't make excuses -- but the turnaround from Dayton to
here. Darnell Edge could barely run. Mike is a load, it's hard for him to get
up the floor. It is not an excuse. It's what it is. And that's why a one-seed
gets to rest and you have to get on a charter right after the game and fly.
And so that played a lot into the game.  
  
But take zero, zero, Gonzaga were awesome. We watched a lot of tape. All the
credit goes to Gonzaga. But we were banged up and tired and they took complete
advantage of that and they should.  
  
But, again, to answer your question, we just keep on fighting.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you talked about how both teams were fast and quick
and the difference would be that they were big. And their three bigs took it
to you tonight, they got 50 points between them. Talk about that.  
GREG HERENDA: We knew their size was really going to hurt. The key to the
game, believe it or not, we gave up 87 points, was us not scoring. If we
score, we can maybe get back and protect our goal line. It felt like a
football game. Because when we didn't score, they were out and it didn't
matter if we went back zone or man, they just come at you and come at you and
they're bigger and stronger. I don't know if they're faster.  
  
We went to the foul line more than Gonzaga. We drove by Gonzaga. But when we
drove by, we found two more Gonzaga players. And in our league generally,
we'll drive by a guy and there'll be one player and then we can make another
pass and we get a great shot. It's a different level. And the Zags tonight
showed that level and it's plain and simple to everyone who was at the game.  
  
But just a lot of credit to Mark Few, the way he handled that game. When it
gets out of hand, you know how coaches handle games. And he did it incredibly
professionally and he did it the right way and that's why their program is a
program that I look up to and all the people at our level and our Conference
look up to Gonzaga. Because guess what, at one point they weren't Gonzaga. And
he and their players did it and I respect those guys a whole heck of a lot.  
  
Q. What does it mean for your program to get here, to win a tournament
game and get to this stage?  
GREG HERENDA: It was the next step. We lost at Dayton really bad, like
tonight, against Florida Gulf Coast, and our goal was to get back and
validate. We got back and validate.  
  
Now our goal is to get back and win a first-round game, not a First Four game.
That's hard, really hard. And it takes good players, it takes good coaches, it
takes a little bit of luck.  
  
I don't know who in America would play Gonzaga and beat them tonight. I told
our guys, Man, I want your heads as high as a kite and you deserve to be that.
They're champions. In every sense of the word, except in the final score.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have time for three more.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the logistics. I assume you got on a
flight Tuesday night and did you get here really late Tuesday?  
GREG HERENDA: With the time change, I don't know what time we got here. What
time did we get here?  
  
NEW SPEAKER: (Off microphone.)  
  
GREG HERENDA: We got here at 1:30 at night, then the time change kind of
helped us. But we got here on Wednesday morning and played Gonzaga on Thursday
afternoon. You know what I'm saying? And I'm -- to answer your question, I'm
being factual.  
  
Q. Have you had any sort of turnaround like that before?  
GREG HERENDA: We play in our Conference, we play Thursday, Saturday.
Generally, we're playing home games or our road games are -- we've had some
tough ones. Our last road trip we went from Emmitsburg, Maryland, to New
Britain, Connecticut. We got on a bus and then slept and it was more, you
know.  
  
But I'm not complaining at all. I'm just giving you the facts that it was a
tough turnaround but that's the deal. That's the deal. And I think there's so
many coaches out there that would, including myself, prior to getting here,
would die to do what we did, and we did it and we enjoyed it. We were taken
care of, first-class. My Athletic Director and President were with us every
step of the way making sure we were treated like champions and treated like
men and I have zero complaints.  
  
Q. Coach, can you expand a little bit more on Nadi and what that meant
to you and to the program because that seemed like a special moment within a
tough loss?  
GREG HERENDA: Nadi is one of the nicest kids and grown men -- he's a grown man
now -- that to know him on our campus, he is like the Pied Piper, he walks
around and there's love and he's a great kibitzer, as my mother would say, he
can talk, and you love him. When he couldn't play it really hurt. As we went
down, he said, Coach, I want to dress, I'm feeling better, can I dress and can
I potentially play? I said, Nadi, if you can play, I'm going to play you.  
  
Tonight, our trainer said it would be safe for him to play. His back was
really -- he couldn't travel. You guys know, when you have a bad back, you
can't do anything. And how that ball bounced to him and how he like lumbered
to the basket and then I'm mad at him, I said, Nadi, I need 50. That was the
second goal, to get to 50, and he's got 49 on the foul line. But he was -- I
don't think he knew where he was. (Laughter.)  
  
Nadi Beciri, man, he is going to be a very successful person. Write that name
down. He is a business major. And a beautiful person. And if sits down for an
interview, he's got the job, trust me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. It's the same question, but can you describe the emotion you felt
when he made that basket?  
GREG HERENDA: It was just -- if you can get beat by 38 points and be euphoric
and hug somebody, it's special, you know what I'm saying? That's a hard thing
to do, be on national TV and get a little bit exposed and be in front of the
camera and then a guy cuts it to 38 and you are the happiest guy in the
building. It's a special moment, or there is something wrong with me -- I
think it's something in between. But Nadi Beciri -- every one of our players
has a story in this tournament. Every single one has a story and Nadi's story
amplifies what college athletics is about and it's way more than advancing and
surviving. It's life. And he's going to have a great life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Killian Tillie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37000)

### [Brandon Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37001)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Gonzaga - 87, Fairleigh Dickinson - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, welcome. We welcome Gonzaga representatives to the stage.
We have student-athletes Brandon Clarke and Killian Tillie with us and we will
ask Coach Mark Few to make a brief opening statement.  
  
MARK FEW: Just a great performance by my guys here. I thought they did an
excellent job in all facets of the game. Obviously, it started on the
defensive end in the first half. After watching Fairleigh Dickinson, they came
in on quite a roll, the guards were really shooting it well and their bigs
were athletic and very good around the rim and so that kind of had us
concerned. By and large, our intensity was good. Our attention to detail was
excellent, like it's been all year. And then that led to us getting out
running, and when we get out and run like that and share the ball, I think we
had over 20 assists. That is a really, really good thing.  
  
Very proud of them and good to get the first one under the belt so we can get
moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Gonzaga student-athletes.  
  
Q. This is for Tillie. You've had a rough go at it this season. How nice
is it to get out there and start feeling it a bit?  
KILLIAN TILLIE: It feels great. Being back with my teammates is really fun.
They did a great job playing with me. I think I did a great job playing with
them. I think it was pretty good night tonight, yeah.  
  
Q. And for Clarke, Tillie had an impressive dunk late in that second
half. How cool is that to see?  
BRANDON CLARKE: That was really crazy. I have been waiting for that moment for
him, honestly. Because he -- I don't think he's had a dunk yet this season and
I've been waiting on it personally. (Laughter.) And that one was a crazy dunk.
It was over two guys. That shows how bouncy he is and plus he can shoot
threes, too, floaters too. So he's a really, really tough player to deal with.
So obviously if he can do that, we will be a really tough team to beat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions?  
  
Q. FDU is one of the best three-point shooting teams in the country.
What was your game plan to stop their three-point shooting?  
THE MODERATOR: Brandon?  
  
BRANDON CLARKE: I would say we were trying to not gap off, I believe his name
is Edge, and also Jenkins and also their four man. I feel we did a really,
really good job of doing, like two things at one, so being like in the gap and
then getting out on the shooter still. I feel like we had a really, really
good focus on the defensive end tonight doing that, so that made it harder for
them to hit threes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions for the student-athletes? We'll let these
gentlemen go and when they've left the stage we will turn it over for
questions to Coach. Questions for Coach Few.  
  
Q. Mark, you guys are awesome offensively, you have been most of the
season, everyone knows that. I wondered what you thought defensively, you guys
were so good especially early, they just looked like you had punched them in
the face and they didn't recover.  
MARK FEW: I loved our intensity from the jump. You nailed it. But also, a
great attention to detail. We've been pretty good with that all year, of
finding the scouting report, understanding it and then taking it out on the
floor. And I thought the combination of both those, great intensity and the
physicality around the rim.  
  
What I saw from Fairleigh on film, they are playing three bigs now, they are a
good size, they walk out on the floor, you don't think it's a 16 seed, just
their presence. And I thought we did a good job handling the physicality with
our vertical contests and got up and blocked some shots which we have done all
year. When we're doing that, that gets us out running and we're obviously at
our best when we are out running.  
  
Q. So, just about a month ago Tillie left the game with that partially
torn ligament in his foot. You talked about how much Tillie meant and
wonderful he was to coach. How much joy does it bring to you to see him back
out on the court?  
MARK FEW: Just an absolute incredible amount of joy and satisfaction to see
somebody that worked so hard, had such a great year last year for us, and
then, you know, the practice before we go down to play Florida State, he has
this fluke injury so he wasn't able to obviously play in that game, and then
he had to miss a bunch of the off-season, kind of getting back in the fold.
And then hurt his foot again and had surgery.  
  
And actually, it's funny you say that because what the date -- the night it
happened, the trainer and I and Tills were looking at this, Okay, are we going
to play on the Thursday or the Friday? Here's what we've got to work with. And
it's a plantar fascia tear and we can do this.  
  
He did a great job staying positive. He had a bad run of luck there. It's
awesome, awesome to see -- and you guys can all see if you've forgot, I mean,
he's a hell of a player.  
  
Q. Mark, Zach did so much for you guys tonight, 13 points, 7
assists...  
MARK FEW: I like that.  
  
Q. He would probably say he only went 4 from 12, he would be mad at how
he shot it. I was curious when you watched him in high school, in AAU, did you
imagine he could do this, that he could like fill a stat sheet for you or did
you think he'd be mostly a shooter?  
MARK FEW: I hoped we'd get some development out of him. I was happy to watch
the game, he had 14 or 15 threes in one of the back gyms in Vegas and that's
what really initially caught my eye.  
  
The other thing that caught my eye during the recruiting process with Zach was
what a great leader he was. You know, Simeon has an awesome, awesome history
of basketball, and he was without a doubted the leader on that team. And he's
rounded into quite a leader for us also. I'm probably most proud of that.  
  
And he was the guy that spent most of the night on Darnell Edge who was an
excellent player and came in on a roll and Snacks did a nice job of making it
a tough night for him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions for Coach? Thank you, Coach.

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Jared Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37004)

### [Makai Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30658)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Baylor - 78, Syracuse - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Baylor representatives to the stage, student-
athletes Makai Mason and Jared Butler, and Coach Scott Drew. We will ask Coach
Scott Drew to make a brief opening statement and we will turn it over to
questions to the student-athletes. So, we'll ask Coach Drew for his brief
opening statement. Coach?  
  
SCOTT DREW: We thought we could get looks if we executed and it was important
we knocked down shots, and we made shots and that makes the offense work a lot
better against the zone. 16 for 34, you have to have good guard play to win in
March, and we are blessed to have very good guard play and make us coaches
look very good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Makai Mason and Jared Butler.  
  
Q. We talked about Syracuse and their zone, and the players were saying
there is nothing like our zone, we are longer than other teams, you can't prep
for it. But you guys play a zone. You haven't used it as much this year. So
did that play a big role in you being so confident in taking so many threes
that it was something you were used to?  
THE MODERATOR: Jared, let's start with you.  
  
JARED BUTLER: Our zone is very different and I think our mentality going to
the game, that we had to make shots, was important. And we know when we play
zone and guys hit tough shots, it's heartbreaking. So we had that same
mentality going into this game and we had to lock down on defense.  
  
But like I said, the zone is different, they make you think. I think our
aggressiveness and wanting to shoot the ball helped us a lot.  
  
MAKAI MASON: The fact we play zone helped us in this game, being able to go
against that and practice every day with our guys flying around, we are used
to those kind of shots, just kickout threes. That helped us tonight.  
  
Yeah, they have great length across the board, sometimes tough to get in high
post. I thought we did that well at times. That really helped us.  
  
Q. Can you describe the win for Baylor Nation, the crowd was loud and
you guys were going like two heavyweights toe to toe, but you ended up...
describe this win for you guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Makai?  
  
MAKAI MASON: It was pretty special. Honestly, being picked ninth in the Big
12, we harp on that a lot these days. We have the underdog mentality. We're
not backing down from anybody. That's the reason why we were able to stay calm
in those big moments. We know we're sticking together and, at the end of the
day, we ain't supposed to be here, and we're just happy to be moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jared.  
  
JARED BUTLER: We have been through a lot all season, a lot of ups and downs, a
lot of doubtfulness. I want to say this, these guys stuck together, we stayed
together, even through four losses back-to-back. So these guys are special.
Everybody believes in Coach Drew and the coaching staff. So, man, I think we
deserve this in a way, so it's big time.  
  
Q. Again for both of you. How many three-point shooting contests have
the two of you participated in and did it feel like that the first half? Each
team only attempted five twos and I noticed when you guys came on the floor to
warm up for the second half, no one was taking shots in the paint, it was all
outside the arc.  
MAKAI MASON: Jared doesn't want to talk about our three-point contest.  
  
JARED BUTLER: In the first half, we expected Makai to hit at least five
threes. Makai, when he comes out in the first half, it's butter. In the second
half, I had to get him. I had to hit a couple and-ones, took a couple of
threes. Yeah, he's a great shooter, man. (Laughter.)  
  
MAKAI MASON: It was fun to go back and forth with them. We weren't expecting
them to hit shots like that. They hit some tough ones and we hung in there and
they pulled up.  
  
Q. You both talked a lot about just now your three-pointers and how big
of a momentum swing that was for you guys. You both hit threes and you turned
around on defense and took big charges. Can you talk about how much that means
for your team to have that impact on the defensive side as well?  
SCOTT DREW: That is a great question.  
  
JARED BUTLER: Makai actually leads the team in charges. We actually stat the
charges after their game and tried to get the most charges for a pair of
shoes. Lucky. (Laughter.) Makai does a great job. I want to be just like that
when he takes charges, he gets the team riled up. And any way I can get
momentum swings and get the good players in foul trouble I'll try to do. Makai
has taught me how to take some charges, I'm not going to lie.  
  
MAKAI MASON: JB has three more years to get to that charge level (laughter.)
But it shows our mentality, our toughness. We're not trying to celebrate
threes, we're trying to make the next play. That's big for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have time for one more question for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Do you guys have any thoughts on Gonzaga? Have you watched them at
all this year? Did you watch them at all earlier?  
JARED BUTLER: I have watched being a college basketball fan, they have a
great, solid team. Every team can be beaten in March. We will prepare just
like any other team, scout, look at their tendencies and their best players.
So we are going into it like we are playing another team.  
  
I'm not saying Gonzaga are not good, they are amazing, but we are levelheaded
going into it.  
  
Q. This question is for Makai. You beat Baylor in 2016 in the NCAA
tournament.  
MAKAI MASON: Today was better.  
  
Q. How would you compare and contrast the feelings of those book-end
tournament wins?  
MAKAI MASON: Both are very different. But both are special for their own
reason.  
  
When I was at Yale, we hadn't been in the tournament for like 64 years. We
were a huge underdog going into that game. With Baylor, just -- basically,
they missed the last two years, just go through all that physically and
mentally. Just to come out here and have a chance to compete against the best,
you know, going into March Madness, you can't write a better story, really.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will let the players go and once they have left the stage,
we will turn it over to questions for Coach. Questions for Coach Drew.  
  
Q. Scott, what were you thinking the first half when you were trading
threes? Were you enjoying it or were you thinking maybe we could put the ball
in the paint occasionally?  
SCOTT DREW: I'm an offensive coach so I liked it. Defensively, when you're
making shots like that and not getting separation, that is frustrating. So, I
liked what we were executing on offense, but defensively, I thought we needed
to be better. And really credit Syracuse for making a lot of shots and some
tough shots. And we had some defensive breakdowns and Coach Boeheim has his
team executing at a high level and you can't have breakdowns against a good
team.  
  
Q. Coach, Buddy has been a big three-point shooter for Syracuse, and he
did not hit a single one. What was the game plan on him to stop him hitting
threes today?  
SCOTT DREW: You can see his influence on the court. People spend so much time,
it opens up other people, similar to Makai. Sometimes Makai doesn't score but
others get a lot of great looks because he's on the court. And Buddy is the
same way, you have to pay so much attention to him that it makes it easier for
other guys and he spaces the floor to give them room to operate.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, I wondered if that was part of the game plan, to go against
their zone to shoot that many threes going in?  
SCOTT DREW: I told them they could shoot 40 today. I did want to make 25,
though, so we were a little short. On both fronts.  
  
Q. Have you watched Gonzaga at all this year? Did you see any of their
game or were you in the locker room preparing for 'Cuse?  
SCOTT DREW: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Have you watched Gonzaga at all this year? Did you watch them?  
SCOTT DREW: We have two guys on our staff from their program. They called them
and made sure they didn't play any of their play calls. We have so much
respect for their program. Coach Few does such an amazing job. Those guys
competed at such a high level.  
  
I know we'll be very familiar with their program, and they're familiar with
ours because we've played against each other, we have scrimmaged against each
other.  
  
Q. Coach, in a tournament format like this, how long does the feeling of
euphoria of surviving and advancing last before you have to try and put that
in the closet and turn your attention to Gonzaga in the unique format setup?  
SCOTT DREW: Once I get back to the locker room, it is all on the Zags. So
that's the tough thing is you can't rely celebrate a win in that first game
when you play so quick.  
  
Q. Makai mentioned about being underdogs the whole year, injuries
happen, piling up, and you come in on a four-game losing streak. How
satisfying is this win after everything you guys have gone through this year
to come out now on top and go into the Round of 32?  
SCOTT DREW: I think one thing that's safe to say in any college program, you
will have to face adversity and you will have to persevere. Everybody gets
banged up and everybody faces tough games and challenges each and every year.
When you deal with people, you have issues.  
  
And one thing that I can tell you is this year we have been blessed to have
outstanding leadership with Jake, King, and Makai, and they've always done a
great job keeping the locker room and making sure everyone is focused on the
right thing.  
  
And you have to credit the whole team for having great chemistry for
supporting one another. When you lose, fingers come out and you are pointing
blame. We haven't done that. That is why we have been able to achieve what we
have been able to achieve. All logic would tell you, you are picked ninth, you
only three have your returning lettermen, you lose your best player at that
time at that time who was so dominant on both ends of the court, and you have
to credit the guys for playing with a lot of joy and really sacrificing for
each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Bill Coen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26089)

### [Jordan Roland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32911)

### [Bolden Brace](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36994)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Kansas - 87, Northeastern - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Northeastern representatives to the stage. In
addition to Coach Coen, we have Jordan Roland and Bolden Brace. We will take a
brief opening statement from the coach and then we will go to questions to the
student-athletes. Coach.  
  
BILL COEN: Obviously, it wasn't the day everyone associated with Northeastern
was hoping for or envisioned. But you have to give credit to an outstanding
Kansas program. You know, they played really, really well today. I think they
took us out of our own identity. Typically we're a team that, you know, moves
the ball on offense and shares the ball and gets quality looks. I thought
their efforts really limited the quality of our looks and unfortunately, we
couldn't make any shots today. You know, if you are kind of dialing up the
blueprint for an upset, it would include, you know, a great shooting night.
Unfortunately, we didn't have that.  
  
That being said, I couldn't be prouder of this group of young men. It doesn't
take away of what they accomplished this year. And just getting to this point
and playing in this tournament and competing against some of the very best
teams in this tournament. Certainly Kansas is one of the best programs of all
time. It was an experience I think we'll all remember for the rest of our
lives.  
  
So at the end of the day, it was just -- they were just too much for us and
shot the ball too well and executed too well in order for us to get a victory.  
  
Q. Jordan, just looking at the second half there, you guys came out to
start the half, cut it to seven, and then they proceeded to outscore you guys
32-6 over an 11-minute stretch. What kind of got away from you as a team
defensively and offensively in that stretch?  
JORDAN ROLAND: I think getting away from our plan. We had a game plan that we
went in and we didn't execute, we got a little momentum going. Before that,
they came out and we weren't able to stop them.  
  
Q. Just for both of you. Vasa and Anthony are playing their final game,
what was it like to play with them?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan?  
  
JORDAN ROLAND: We will miss them tremendously. They have done a lot for our
program. Vasa is one of my closest friends, so I will miss him. All three
brought a lot to our program and they will be definitely missed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Bolden?  
  
BOLDEN BRACE: I think being with those guys for the three years that I was,
was a really special opportunity for me. I went through a lot of turmoil with
those guys. I feel after this season, it almost seems like we overcame some of
that. Despite the loss tonight, I'm appreciative I got the opportunity to play
with those guys and be a part of this family with those guys. So I think they
really are special guys and I'm grateful to them.  
  
Q. You guys are known for your excellent three-point shooting and
tonight it wasn't there. Were they doing something differently on defense, or
was it one of those nights where the shots aren't falling?  
THE MODERATOR: Bolden?  
  
BOLDEN BRACE: As coach said, we went in with a plan. We knew they were going
to hard show, that was their defensive coverage. And as bigs, we were supposed
to pop in and try to skip, get skip, open threes, and I just don't think we
executed very well.  
  
After the first couple of shots didn't fall, I don't know if we got a little
flustered. We kind of relied on our offense and our three-point shooting and
when that didn't work out, I think other parts of our game kind of fell apart
a little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for student-athletes? All right. Thank you, guys.
We will return to questions for Coach Coen once the student-athletes have left
the stage. Questions for Coach Coen?  
  
Q. Coach, Dedric Lawson is a great player, had a very good game tonight,
a tough match-up. It seemed like he got his game going on both levels.  
BILL COEN: Yes, he is an outstanding player. Maybe a top ten player in the
country. He's got a tremendous feel for the game. He's got great hands.
Obviously, his skill set is what it was. I mean, I think he's three-for-five
from three. He's incredible around the basket in terms of his timing and his
length and the way that he creates angles on the glass.  
  
And we didn't really have a match-up for him. And Bo got him the start, but
when they put him at the five, it gets even more problematic for us because he
is a guy that can take Anthony away from the basket or Tom -- overpower Tomas
underneath.  
  
So it was a very difficult match-up for us going in. We were hoping to do a
better job on him. I think every time that we made a mini run, he was the guy
that kind of stepped up and answered to it. It speaks to his senior leadership
and his talent level. And, you know, when you're facing a guy like that, he
just settled them down each and every time that we made a mini run at him.  
  
Q. When we look at the three-point shooting, from your perspective, what
was kind of the biggest factor for the shots just not dropping? I mean, it
seemed like you were getting some good looks on there, but they just weren't
dropping.  
BILL COEN: Yeah, I thought we were anxious to start the game. I thought
everybody -- usually your catch-and-shoot threes are your best percentage shot
threes, and a lot of the threes we took were of that variety, but we also took
some threes off the dribble which are generally a lower percentage three.  
  
I thought their switching defense ultimately caused us some problems because
they put -- everybody has a man on them, so it's a one-on-one situation. And I
thought their defensive scheme turned our team, which is typically an elite
teamwork philosophy, into a one-on-one game and that certainly favored Kansas.
I mean, whether it was one-on-one on the post and not going against team
defense, or on offense trying to go one-on-one against their switching
defense. I thought we lost some energy.  
  
I do think at the beginning of the second half we came out, we made a little
run at them and thought we could climb back in it. But they answered that with
a big punch of their own.  
  
Q. Vasa has done so many good things for you guys over the last couple
of years. Was it tough to see him on a personal level have such a struggling
performance in his final game for you?  
BILL COEN: Yeah, certainly it doesn't diminish what he's accomplished and what
he's meant to this program. But whenever -- it's so hard to get to this stage
and I think everybody almost in some respect just wanted it too badly to
happen. And sometimes when you try too hard, or you push too much, you put too
much expectation on yourself, you cannot perform at a high level.  
  
But he's been outstanding. We would not be playing today, we'd all be home,
you know, glued to our TVs watching it if it weren't for Vasa. He's a
tremendous competitor. He's a tremendous leader. And unfortunately today, he
didn't have his best game. But we're proud of him, as we are of all the guys
and their efforts throughout the year.  
  
Q. Bill, forgive me if you have been asked. But you made a line-up
change in the second half, brought some guys off the bench. What were you
thinking, was it to get some new blood and let those other guys watch the game
for a minute?  
BILL COEN: I thought we were pressing and we were pressing most of the game
offensively and so -- even defensively, we were trying to contain their
defensive transition and we were taking some gambles in the back court. Guys
were one-pass shot on the offensive end, we didn't take time to break the
defense down. And it's not because they don't want to win, they don't want to
-- they are trying to help, but sometimes when you're in the moment, if you
can take a breather and see it out, one, to get some fresh blood in there,
guys were coming out a little winded and just utilized the guys on the bench,
maybe change our energy. I thought that group did a decent job. They settled
down. They ran some offense. It wasn't perfect. But it allowed the other guys
to kind of shift their paradigm a little bit.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

### [Tyus Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34258)

  
_Salt Lake City, Utah_  
  
Baylor - 78, Syracuse - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Syracuse representatives to the stage along with
Coach Boeheim. We have Tyus Battle and Elijah Hughes. We will ask Coach to
give a brief opening statement, then we will turn it over to student-athletes
and then once they have left the stage, we'll turn it over to questions for
Coach Boeheim.  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: Both teams shot the ball extremely well. They made a couple at
the end and we missed a couple at the end. We couldn't stop their offense and
they really couldn't stop ours. And it ended up when they got a couple open
threes at the end and we got a couple, we missed ours and they made them, and
they deserved the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's take questions for Tyus Battle and Elijah Hughes, please.  
  
Q. This question is for Tyus. Now the season is officially in the books,
what can you tell us about your future in Syracuse?  
TYUS BATTLE: I'm not making any decisions. I'm not worrying about that right
now. I mean, this was a tough loss for us. I thought we did a pretty good job
offensively. We have to do a better job defensively. They got way too many
threes. It was just a tough loss.  
  
Q. You had a great first half and then went a long time without scoring
in the second half. Were you not feeling well? You went to the bench at one
point because you got a bloody nose. Did they change their defense on you?
What was going on?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Nothing necessarily. Tyus got going a little bit so he took
over and did his thing and I started getting in the rhythm a little bit as the
half went on.  
  
Q. Tyus, how much did you guys miss Frank's defense out there? Mason had
a big game for them. Was that a factor?  
TYUS BATTLE: No. I'm not going to leave it on one person. We have to do a
better job as a team finding shooters and keeping the guys in front of us. I'm
not going to keep it on one person like that.  
  
Q. It's not the end you want, but your first season in Syracuse, what
will you remember from your first year?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: How resilient this team is. We never put our heads down really
all year. A lot of times people counted us out certain games. We knew we had a
chance and we went out and competed. Probably how resilient this team is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will dismiss the student-athletes and when they have left
the stage, we will direct questions to Coach Boeheim. Thank you, guys.
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Jim, do you agree with Tyus's assessment that, you know, you guys
didn't miss Frank as much as the rest of us thought?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Obviously, we missed him. He is our point guard. I'm not going to
sit here and make excuses. He isn't here. Would we have liked to have had him?
Yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: More questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jim, what did you see from your defense? Your two-three usually
creates problems for teams this time of year, especially for teams that don't
see it.  
JIM BOEHEIM: They are a smart team. They are good against zones. They play
zone. They got the ball in the middle and used the guys as passers, and we
didn't cover it as well as we needed to. Both guards have to key it, which way
they go. And that's where our inexperience probably hurt the most because we
didn't really make the right rotations, and that's a little bit of the
inexperience of having a freshman out there.  
  
Q. Jim, how do you have to change what you do without Frank on the
floor?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, Tyus had played some points, so offensively, I thought we
handled everything pretty well. We attacked their zone well when they changed
to the zone, we attacked their man-to-man pretty well. It puts a huge strain
on Tyus. He gets no chance to rest a little bit. I think he got tired a little
bit at the end because he's got to do so much with the ball. But I thought
offensively we were fine. We played as well offensively as we played for the
most part.  
  
Defensively, that's where it hurt us. It hurt us on the defensive end. We
rebounded pretty well. We handled the ball pretty well. We moved the ball
well. You know, we shot the ball extremely well. It's, you know -- we wanted
to get to the foul line and we did that. But we needed to make a couple of
threes in there when the run went on. The advantage of trying to get to the
basket is to get to the free-throw line, which we did, but we just didn't get
there enough, really.  
  
Q. Jim, considering what you brought back, the pieces you added, how
would you describe this season? Are you disappointed with the year you guys
have had?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think you are always disappointed when you lose in a
tournament, if you think you had a chance to win. We obviously had a chance to
win the game tonight. You know, it's been an up-and-down year. We started out
really poorly, and even though we lost to some pretty good teams early, Oregon
is a good team especially with Bol Bol. And obviously Buffalo is and Old
Dominion, they're tough teams. We played pretty consistently in the league, we
beat the teams we were supposed to. We upset Duke obviously, and upset with
Ohio State at Ohio State. Those were good ones.  
  
It was a solid year. It just wasn't the year I think we would have liked to
have had. I thought these kids, I thought everybody played well. I think with
Buddy coming in, Elijah coming in their first years, Marek and Oshae are
sophomores. But I think we didn't have the consistency from the beginning,
missing Frank for a long time and then obviously at the end. So, it wasn't the
year I think it could have been.  
  
But all in all, considering everything, I would say it's been a solid year.  
  
Q. Coach, you have enjoyed great success, particularly in the first
round of the NCAA tournament. You are dealing with a disappointed locker room.
How would you summarize the message you gave to your team a few minutes ago?  
JIM BOEHEIM: It's what I have said right here. I thought we got off to a
really bad start from this game and dug ourselves back into it. Really played
well 30-some minutes, we had the lead and we had two defensive breakdowns, we
gave two wide-open threes and we couldn't get back from that. We come back the
whole game from the beginning, you know, in the half, even the second half
came back. But we just couldn't get enough done in the defensive end tonight.  
  
And again, when a team shoots like that, obviously they're going to make --
they are a pretty good shooting team. But guys that don't shoot a lot go
three-for-three and they bank the three in the first half, they banked the
foul line shot that hit the top of the backboard and went in. Those things
sometimes happen and those are sometimes, those are sometimes hard to
overcome.  
  
We played well offensively for a long time tonight. Then we missed two key
free throws when it was obviously still close and then we missed the lay-up.
And we are still right there. But they made a couple of big threes at the end.
That was the difference in the game.  
  
But considering the circumstances, we played really well. And nobody's happy
when you lose. But Baylor's a really difficult team for us to play against.
They pass it well and they shoot it well. And Mason is a really accomplished
veteran point guard and he knows where the ball should be. And he can shoot
it, too. So, it was difficult for us. Probably of any team other than the one-
seeds in the tournament, or two, Baylor is a harder team for us to play than
anybody else that was three, four, five, six, seven. I would almost rather
have played anybody.  
  
But they just really -- I mean, they might not make 16 if we played them, but
they'd make 12 I think. They are good, they are a really good shooting team.
And we knew that coming in. We tried to adjust our defense outward. But that's
where the inexperience at the guard spot hurt us the most in the defensive
end. Okay?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. I was wondering what your thoughts are on Buddy's performance
tonight.  
JIM BOEHEIM: He struggled offensively, but I'd expect that from a freshman.
I'm not sure -- where are you from?  
  
Q. Citrus TV.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Where?  
  
Q. Syracuse.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I should have known that. The first question, I should have known
that.  
  
Thank you, guys.
