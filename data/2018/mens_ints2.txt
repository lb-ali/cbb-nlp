# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [Nate Oats](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30683)

### [Dontay Caruthers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35148)

### [Wes Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27920)

### [CJ Massinburg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35020)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 95, Buffalo - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Buffalo to the stage.  
  
NATE OATS: You've got to give Kentucky a ton of credit. They shot it well from
3. We needed them to shoot a little more like Arizona did. They shot 7 of 15
from 3. So part of our game plan was to try to get them to shoot 3s and keep
the ball in the lane. I didn't think we did a good job.  
  
They're pretty good athletes and pretty good players. There's a reason three
of those guys are supposed to go in the first round. Probably some more that
are going to be pros. They have more length all over the place. And I think it
affected our shooting. Usually we shoot a lot better. We were 7 for 31 from
the 3. A lot of that had to do with Kentucky's length and just challenging
shots. We had 8 assists, usually we're pushing 20 assists. Our turnovers
weren't bad, but didn't get the ball moving.  
  
They're a great team. They're a great defensive team. Cal has them playing
really well at the right time in the year. They've won 10 of their last 11 and
we ran into a buzz saw tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously a tough game, but you guys gained a lot of fans while you
were out here in Boise. How would you hope that people that might be new to
watching you guys remember this team?  
DONTAY CARUTHERS: The type of guys we have and the coaches and the program we
have. We're unselfish guys, and play really hard. And things happen, because
we're a good team. And we felt that we could have done better. But things
happen.  
  
WES CLARK: On top of us being good looking, we did play hard and we got some
great tools. So it's fun. We're a fun team to watch. And we appreciate Boise
coming in with true blue.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: I just want to say thank you to all the Boise fans. We felt
they welcomed us really well. When we pulled in for the game, they were lined
up out there, they were waving at us. Boise has a lot of friendly people.
We'll definitely come back. And I want to say thank you to all the fans.  
  
Q. Dontay, given the matchups, you had to guard 6-9 Knox, you didn't do
bad. What did you think? It was tough matchups. Have you ever guarded a 6-9
power forward?  
DONTAY CARUTHERS: Not somebody his size. I think last year I guarded a forward
from Nevada. But I know he's a great guy. He's a great player.  
  
Q. What was your mentality really between Bonaventure, Buffalo, and
Syracuse putting western New York on the map, and UNGC beating No. 1, then you
guys going up against Kentucky, what was that like knowing that it would be
yet another upset?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Well, western New York has a lot of good basketball. We came
into this tournament to make some noise, trying to be remembered. We felt like
we could play with a lot of High Majors, and we showed it. But, yeah.  
  
WES CLARK: Western New York, I think a lot of people overlook some of the good
players, just because we come from Mid-Majors or lower division schools.  
  
DONTAY CARUTHERS: We just show what kind of program we have, coaches.  
  
Q. Knowing what you guys went through this year and where you got to,
it's hard to do right now, but how fantastic was this ride to get to the first
NCAA Tournament in program history and do it the way you did it?  
WES CLARK: It was phenomenal for me. I know we had a loss right now. It was
definitely a win for me. I've never been to a NCAA Tournament, and to get here
and win a game, it's phenomenal, it's a great feeling. It's exciting. I'm glad
to wear the Buffalo jersey.  
  
Q. I guess CJ or anyone who wants to take it. You lost the game tonight,
and there's a lot of happy talk about putting Buffalo on the map. You expected
to win this game so how disappointing is it to not go any further?  
CJ MASSINBURG: It's very disappointing. Trust me, we didn't go back in the
locker room and it was all happy talk. We were down on ourselves. But at the
end of the day, after all is said and done, we can be proud of what we did for
Buffalo and as a collective group.  
  
Q. You've got another year here with the Bulls. So what does what you
guys have built up over the last couple of years, what does that say about how
much there is to look forward to next year?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Man, this program was just trending in the right direction,
even our women's team, they just got a win today in the NCAA Tournament. This
whole school is just trending in the right direction. After we get a couple of
weeks off we're going to get back to work. And we say a term of: Making our
ceiling our new floor. This is our ceiling; we won a game in a NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. After that dunk from Hami that put them up 20 you called a timeout,
about 3 minutes left to go, and then you went back on the floor. Cal
apologized to you. Was he apologizing because Hami posed in front of the
band?  
NATE OATS: I don't know what he apologized for. He didn't need to do that.
They're playing basketball. At first I thought he was telling me they were
going to a zone. And then he apologized.  
  
I'll tell you this, I apologized to him before the game. I used the word
"whining," that's a bad word choice of him talking about their youth all year.
I don't know why I chose that word. Big Blue Nation certainly let me know
about it, don't want to let them mad, they're tweeting all day long.  
  
I apologized to him. He said he didn't take it the wrong way. I've got a ton
of respect for him. Used to go to his program in Memphis, we ran the dribble
drive at Romulus, basically because of what he did at Memphis. We had a good
talk before the game. I don't know what he felt bad about. He's a good guy. I
appreciated it, but he didn't need to.  
  
Q. I believe both teams ended up making 7 3s, and it took you twice as
many to make those.  
NATE OATS: It was huge. It took us longer. They were 0-6 against Davidson. We
wanted to make them shoot a lot more than six. But we did not want them to
make half of them.  
  
Jeremy has been our best shooter, him and CJ. But Jeremy has been on fire
these first two tournament games. I think their length bothered him a lot.
They're great defensively. I talked to Sean Miller after our game, he said
they guard way better, and it's true. They're unbelievable defensively. Cal
gets them to play hard. And they were playing with a chip on their shoulder.  
  
They have a great chance to make it. I think they play Cincinnati if they can
get by the next round. But they have a good shot to go to the Final Four. And
they've got a chance to win these next two games.  
  
Q. Two things. One, could you just talk about the problem of defending
Shai? You did move CJ on him, but that meant you had to put Dontay on the 6-9
guy. And comment on Wes Clark's performance and his season.  
NATE OATS: I told the guys, there's a reason this guy is projected to be the
lottery pick. He's the best point guard we've seen all year. He passes it,
scores it, he's 6-6, he's long. They can usually take other guards out of it,
but we started out trying to deny him the ball back, once he gave it up.  
  
But he's so long at 6-6. He gets open. And then he gets it. I saw some teams
try to trap him; he throws over the trap, they dunk it. He throws it, they
dunk it. He finishes at the rim. We really didn't have an answer for him
tonight, that was a major problem for us tonight defensively. We were supposed
to be loading up and tightening the gaps, then they start making some 3s. We
cut it to four or five -- was it four -- four or five, and then they hit back-
to-back 3s, if I remember right. That kind of killed us right there. And then
they got some dunks at crucial times. To me, Alexander makes them go.  
  
And what was the question about Wes? Listen, I told him I'm so proud of him.
We've got a history. I coached him in high school. But for him to come in with
the one semester. He took this program to new heights, we don't do what we did
this year without him. I think the guys welcome him in, if guys were selfish,
they would not have welcomed him in. They wanted him and he showed up in a big
way. He's 0 for life against Kentucky, he didn't beat Kentucky or Missouri. He
was trying to make this his first. But it's a good program.  
  
He had 26 and six assists. I thought he showed he belonged out there.
Alexander is a pro, I think Wes is right there with him. He's pretty dang good
tonight.  
  
Q. 22 dunks and layups. Were you a little worried about that, because
your post defenses --  
NATE OATS: We gave up 22? I wouldn't doubt it. It was bad. They got it in the
lane too much. They hit the 3s. They didn't shoot enough of them. We wanted to
keep it out of the lane and make them shoot more 3s. We got out-rebounded by
12, too.  
  
Three things had to happen: We had to keep turnovers down, keep them out of
transition, but defensively we had to keep the ball in the lane, keep them off
the O boards. They were in the lane all night. We didn't do what we were
supposed to. They're just that good. We're a pretty good defensive team, but
not -- we weren't good enough tonight and they are a great offensive and
defensive team, as well.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Kam Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35077)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Gonzaga - 90, Ohio State - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ohio State.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Give Mark and his kids a lot of credit. I think they're really
good. I think they can make another really deep run. He's got a phenomenal
program. We begin by just giving Gonzaga a lot of credit for making the plays
down the stretch.  
  
I was really proud of our guys' spirit, competitive spirit. It's been that way
all year. We've got a special bunch, and it's disappointing to see it end
because we have such a special group of guys. We'll leave it at that.  
  
Q. Obviously not the ideal start to the game. They scored the first 15
points. What was going on that allowed you to get off to a slow start there?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: It wasn't how we like to be. But we tried to stay calm. I
was proud of how we fought.  
  
Q. On the flip side of that, how were you able to fight back after being
down by so much early to get back a lead and be able to maintain it, although
it obviously didn't end how you wanted it to go?  
KAM WILLIAMS: It's a long game, 40 minutes, it's a lot of possessions, you've
got to keep chipping away and keep staying positive. You have to believe in
yourself and your brothers. Anything is possible.  
  
Obviously we didn't come off with a win. I couldn't be more proud with our
coaches and players the way we fought today. We're just extremely proud.  
  
Q. Zach and Rui both had big games. How big were those two? How many
issues were they giving you defensively?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: They gave us a lot of issues. They got some easy baskets.
Give them credit, they made some tough shots especially down the stretch. They
both made their free throws down the stretch, too. They're great players, a
good team.  
  
Q. I was curious, have you made a decision yet on your future in terms
of what your plans are? And if not, what will go into that decision in terms
of potentially going into the draft?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I haven't thought about it. I want to spend this time with
my team.  
  
Q. Seemed like the momentum was swinging, but they had a 11-0 run. What
did you see during the run? What happened down the stretch there?  
KAM WILLIAMS: We got beat on the 50/5 balls, on the glass a little bit. Just
tough plays we didn't have at the most crucial point in the game and it cost
us.  
  
Q. If you could talk about Zach and Rui, those two players. It seemed
like they were the difference makers. Talk about those two and what kind of
issues they were giving you guys.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Their two 3s were really the difference. Zach's 3 in the
corner off, it looked like, a step-back corner 3 that was really well defended
by Andre Wesson was a crushing blow. And then obviously 21's 3 there -- I
think it's the first one he's made since December. So I just was told that.
It's nice to hear.  
  
But, yeah, those were crushing.  
  
Q. Certainly you're talking about how much different this team was than
when you played them before. It was pretty evident out there. Seeing that game
transpire, is it everything you hoped as far as seeing where this team has
come?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, obviously you'd like for it to end differently,
obviously. But we've evolved as you hope a team has evolved. It's hard when
you take over a program. And obviously took it over midsummer. You're trying
to figure them out. They're trying to figure you out. You're also trying to
figure out your guys' strengths and what triggers to pull with guys. And just
what guys you can challenge in what areas. And you're learning their
strengths, too, strengths and weaknesses, and how to put them in the best
position and I think that took some time for us.  
  
This group really turned a corner at some point. And I think it was maybe
after the PK-80. And after the Clemson game it turned a corner and flipped the
switch and we were really never the same. And it was all positive. We just
kept growing together. I've been proud of a lot of teams but this one is up
there.  
  
Q. It certainly didn't start off that way. They scored the first 15
points. Were you having flashbacks to that first game? What did you see that
made you guys have a little bit of slow start at the beginning of the game?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Missed layups. And maybe nerves. Maybe nerves. Or I think we
missed four point-blank layups that we don't normally -- we're going to miss a
few in the game, but not four in a matter of the first four minutes.  
  
They were making plays, too. Gonzaga was good, too. I think Gonzaga can get to
another Final Four. I thought they were really good. After we played them once
we said that, and I just think they're really good. Mark does an incredible
job with them. He does an incredible job with them.  
  
Q. What is kind of the challenge in defending Gonzaga, because they can
throw so many options at you?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It's their balance and the number of weapons that they have.
Williams is a load but we handled him okay. Tillie can make obviously open
shots and you have to know where he's at. We really struggled with Perkins in
game one. Really struggled with him. And we handled him a little bit better in
this game. But then you have Norvell that goes off to 26, 28.  
  
They're what you want a program to be, and that is year after year after year
they have good, young players, or players sitting out or whatever. So there's
never going to be a significant dip in the program. It's what you want in an
elite program. A good recruiting class and a system in place and culture in
place, and Gonzaga has all that. And that's a credit to Mark and his program.

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Johnathan Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33110)

### [Josh Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30801)

### [Zach Norvell Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35061)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Gonzaga - 90, Ohio State - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Gonzaga.  
  
MARK FEW: Well, what a great weekend for us here in Boise. Just what a great
performance by my guys. We beat a heck of a basketball team in Ohio State
that's got a ton of fight and so well coached. And the run they made at us in
that second half, that had us back on our heels. Just like these guys have
done all year, they responded and were able to figure out a way to get some
stops down the stretch, the real stretch of that game. And then had some guys
step up and made some big shots on the offensive end.  
  
But, Ohio State is good. And just so impressed with how much they've improved
since the PK-80. We couldn't be happier. There aren't many things better in
life than winning one of these games in the NCAA Tournament in March. I tell
you, they are something special.  
  
Q. I know yesterday was a special moment for you hitting that three. But
you had a season high 28 points, double, double. Do you like this game better
or what were your thoughts on that performance from your team today?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: I like this one a lot. Getting 12 rebounds is a big thing
for me.  
  
MARK FEW: He goes a month sometimes without getting a rebound.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: That was big for me. I always have confidence on the
offensive end, but helping the guys on the board was big. Ohio State is a
great rebounding team. Helping the bigs was great.  
  
Q. It seemed like the entire stadium was cheering for you guys. How does
it feel to have your fans travel so well, and the neutral fans seemed to be
cheering for you guys?  
JOSH PERKINS: As we all said before, we have the best fans in the country. For
them to do that for us, especially when that run hit, we heard it, they stuck
with us and we fed off the crowd. We stuck together, and the crowd was a big
reason.  
  
Q. Coach did a handstand in the locker room to celebrate. Is that a
regular occurrence in a NCAA Tournament or all games?  
JOSH PERKINS: When he does it, we're all happy. We want him to do it again so
we can keep winning. He did it a couple of times last year, when Coach pulls
out a handstand, it's a good performance team-wise, and we need to see it at
least four more times.  
  
Q. How are you enjoying this run now, these two games? How much are you
enjoying being a part of March Madness?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Sitting last year was big. Behind great guards, I learned a
lot from those guys, and to be in the moment, to be out there is huge, being a
competitor, and also being surrounded by a lot of guys that want to compete as
well, is great.  
  
Q. I have to know about the nickname "Snacks." Where did it come from,
was it something when you were little and you told your teammates? How did
they find out about it?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Growing up all I wanted was candy and chocolate. Everybody
called me "Snacks." On my recruiting visits my dad called me "Snacks." The
coaches took it on and campus and everybody around the country calls me
"Snacks."  
  
Q. A lot of foul trouble for the bigs to get through. Looked like Rui
played a big role.  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: Yes, our bigs have been doing a great job all year. Corey
came off the bench and Rui did, too. They came off the bench for us.  
  
Q. You guys were down 67-62, the game seemed to be swinging a little
bit. But Zach hits that big corner 3. How big was that? That seemed to get you
going.  
JOSH PERKINS: That was a huge 3. This guy's making tough shots for us day-in
and day-out. You saw one yesterday. But I've been seeing it the whole season.
He hit that corner 3, and that was the spark plug we needed to get that run.
I'm glad he took it and hope he takes some more in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Zach red-shirted last year. How happy are you to have him on the
team?  
MARK FEW: It's not just because of that it, it's because of the whole package,
he's got a persona that we really need in our program right now, quite
frankly. We have an overabundance of introverts, and that's one thing he's
not. And so I call him our spiritual leader, he gets us going every practice,
even the ones they don't want to be at.  
  
And he's just a firey guy with some swag from Chicago, and we need that. And
then you add in the fact that he's right there with probably one of the most
clutch players I've ever coached, going back to Dan Dickau or Adam Morrison,
he's got an amazing ability to -- the shot before the 3 missed by eight feet.
I don't know if you remember that one. And to come back and swish the next
one. That's like me shanking two into the water hole and then hitting a hole
in one or something, which doesn't happen.  
  
So he's got an impressive fortitude about him. And there's so many things to
like, we're very blessed to have him.  
  
Q. It seemed that you were able to sway a lot of neutral fans to cheer
for your team. What is it about your team that makes them so likable and gets
people behind them?  
MARK FEW: I don't know, the neutral fans. Boise is a Zag-friendly place. We
have a bunch of former players down here. I have tons of family down here. It
meant everything to me to finally get my team to come down and play in Boise.  
  
My father-in-law was a basketball player himself, played at the College of
Idaho, and was just kind of a legendary humble man around here, and just
absolutely loved the Zags more than anything. He passed away this summer. He
missed it by six months. But I could feel his presence, looking down on us and
smiling when Snacks and Rui hit that big 3.  
  
It's special to do it in front of our family and former players. And like I
said, this is definitely a Zag- friendly spot for us.  
  
Q. What's up with the handstand thing? I've never seen that before.  
MARK FEW: I did it a couple years back. It's not quite as prevalent as it was
after I hit 50. And there's some rotator cuff issues that I worry about. But
in the moment and the guys motivated me enough, I lose my mind and attempt it
once in a while. This happened to be one of those times.  
  
Q. It wasn't just Zach, Rui had a tremendous game, 25 points after the
bench. How big is it to have a guy like that come off the bench and score that
many points for you?  
MARK FEW: It's a luxury to have. We have seven guys score 20 points this year.
Again, I thought Corey Kispert came in and gave us good minutes. It was great
to get Rui going again. I think he was disappointed with how he played
Thursday.  
  
Obviously I think we all knew he was going to play better, but for him to play
this well was huge. We needed every point. We needed every rebound. And lost
in all this was Perk. Josh Perkins has put two really, really solid games,
kind of managing the throttle of our offense, and taking great care of the
ball, two assists, two turnovers tonight, and he had a big shot.  
  
Everybody hit the floor for us. We needed every basket, because they
definitely pushed us to the limit.  
  
Q. You mentioned Josh Perkins. How has his game evolved and improved
over the course of the year as your point guard? He had struggles early on.  
MARK FEW: Again, with Josh, Josh is as high a level shooter I think in the
point position in college basketball. Him and Joe Barry are very similar to
that. He's always had a little bit of flash and stuff to his game that he
values probably more highly than he needs to. And I think he's really been
able in the last -- since we dropped that home game to St. Mary's he's came
eons from where he was as far as understanding winning plays and just figuring
out who to get the ball to at the right time, when that guy is going or what
the matchup is or hunting his own shot or getting us in the right sets at the
right time and place.  
  
That's been as big a key for this run we've been on is him understanding
winning basketball as opposed to just and-one stuff.  
  
Q. It seems like we're talking with streaks, four straight Sweet 16's.
How much does that mean to you?  
MARK FEW: Like I said, certainly there's some personal things out there in
your life and family. But as far as professionally I can't think of any better
feeling than winning games in March.  
  
I was telling -- Leon Rice and I went out to dinner, the head coach here in
Boise, any win in the NCAA Tournament I think is the hardest thing you do.
They're harder than road games in league. They're really, really hard to come
by.  
  
And to be able to advance now to that second weekend, to get another -- we're
guaranteed of at least five days more with our team with the hope of getting
to that next week that many of us have experienced how special that is.  
  
Along with that, somebody brought to my attention in the locker room that
we've got two guys in Perkins and Silas that have made it to four straight
second weekends. And with all this day and age with people leaving early and
doing this and doing that, I don't know how many players in college basketball
can say they've been a part of four straight second weekends. I know there's
obviously some. But that's got to be some elite company.  
  
Unbelievably proud of not just those guys but the whole team, but our whole
program, the administration and everything. We've built this thing the right
way. And we do have followers all over the country and it's because my guys
are what college basketball is all about.

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Shai Gilgeous-
Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34914)

### [Wenyen Gabriel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34479)

### [Hamidou Diallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35117)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 95, Buffalo - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Kentucky.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: My comment to the players after the game was the reason this
has been the most rewarding season I've had in over 30, or however many I've
done this, is because of what's happening for Wenyen, what's happening for
Hami. You saw what he is and what he's capable of today. Let me say this, you
may say that -- I was trying to learn about him and he was trying to learn
about me. We were trying to figure this out. Everybody said, Why are you
starting him? Because he deserves it, I love him, and he's going to do it. It
just took us a long time.  
  
Wenyen, the same. He had to conquer himself. When you're not playing well you
have to kick out of it and go.  
  
And Shai, I didn't really enjoy coaching Shai, but he's a good kid, I guess
(laughter).  
  
Q. What I asked Hamidou yesterday about whether they were overestimating
the importance of experience. Do you think you answered the question today?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: The same answer yesterday. We just try to come out and try to
prove everybody wrong, and that's what we did today. And can't feel better
about this one.  
  
Q. At one point after you hit a 3-pointer, you turned to the crowd and
silenced them. Do you enjoy when you have a crowd against you? Does that feed
you guys?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: This whole group is a bunch of competitors, we go
after it every day in practice. We love proving people wrong, and that's what
we did today.  
  
Q. I'm sure you saw that Virginia lost yesterday. Is that a wake-up or a
reminder to see when a huge upset happens? Is that something that reminds you
that anything can happen in March Madness and makes you play more on your
game?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, Coach has been telling us this whole week, You
never know what can happen in this tournament. And you have to step up and
make plays. And we don't focus on any team but ourselves right now. We try to
get better each and every game.  
  
WENYEN GABRIEL: Definitely. I don't watch too many of the games, but when you
hear about the upsets, it tells us to lock in more and focus on anything can
happen.  
  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: It makes us play with a little more chip on our shoulder
because we don't want to end the season now, we want to play to the last game.
So we're coming out there with more chip on our shoulder.  
  
Q. Coach Cal frequently jokes about all the players that he sent to the
NBA, telling them that he's held them back when they've been in college. We
know we haven't seen all your full games yet. What parts of your games has he
been holding you back on?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Hami has a list.  
  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: We're just trying to get better every day. We know there was
going to be a lot of adversity. We're playing with a bunch of talented
players. Every night can't be your night. And that's what we knew when we came
here, and that's why we chose to come here.  
  
WENYEN GABRIEL: Just try to go out and play the game and show our strengths,
and the other stuff will come. Right now we have to focus on what makes us
look good out there.  
  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Myself, including this whole group, has probably felt
like he held us back at one point in the season. If you really know the game
and you watch the game, when we do what he's asking us to do, we're a much
better team than you've seen in the past couple of weeks.  
  
Q. You made it tough on them to start the game defensively, you jumped
20-10 you were up. Was there any talk about your focus, defensively, to start
the game? They're the underdog, was there talk, don't let them get hope or
match their intensity or anything like that?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Our identity is defensively. So that's the first
thing we focus on going into every game. We know if we shut down the other
team we're capable. We just go into every game trying to lock up the other
opponent.  
  
Q. You show up with obviously the reputation of excellent defense.
Clearly the last few games you have been a huge factor offensively. What point
along the season did the offense open up for you in the sense that you saw
where your shots were going to be and what you could do at this level?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: About midpoint during the season. I watched a lot of
film. I was really taking what Coach was asking of me, what this team needed
me to do. I just tackled it. Once I cleared that role out and stuff like that,
I worked on my game and got better every day.  
  
Q. Obviously the freshman thing gets played and played and played.  
JOHN CALIPARI: And I whine. Coach and I talked about it before the game, Nate
and I talked. There's nothing there. He's a great guy and a heck of a coach
now. What he's done and how that team plays and what they've done in their
league, amazing. It's amazing.  
  
Q. But what I wanted to ask you was -- (laughter) -- sorry. Obviously
today was a game with a ton of peril and the other night was a game that had
all kinds of things that could have happened. Would you say your kids might
have graduated to the next class now? Are they beyond your regular freshmen?  
JOHN CALIPARI: There will still be experiences in this tournament as we go
forward that they've never faced and I have to try to talk them through it. I
told them at halftime Buffalo is going to make a run. They may tie the game
up. So what, just keep playing. They made their run and got it to six, they
may have made it to four. I said, This is what happens in this stuff, you've
got to keep playing.  
  
I think, again, we are inexperienced and all that stuff. But I've got good
players, and my challenge was they had to establish themselves first. Hami is
still figuring it out.  
  
Second thing is, they had to change how they thought about training and
working and preparation. I talked to them today. We had a great shoot-around
today. And I said, the beginning of the year -- Sean Farnham watched this in
South Carolina, and he said that was the worst shoot-arounds that I've ever
seen one of your teams have. We had guys laughing and joking, and I had to
stop and scream. It was an hour and 10 minutes. My shoot-arounds are 40
minutes, 42, 45 minutes.  
  
Today they were good. It takes my team a year to really learn how important it
is to use the entire day to prepare for a game. It's rewarding to see
individuals do what they're doing. But it's also rewarding to get them to
understand they need each other, because this is a team sport.  
  
And I said this before, Pat Riley said to me, one of the best compliments:
Your players are all good teammates in this league. They come in this league
and they understand. They share.  
  
And you're right, they've all had to give up something, and I held them back.
You ask DeMarcus or Anthony, ask Devin, he's still mad I didn't start him. Am
I going to start now? Devin Booker had 78 in a NBA game and I didn't start
them. Eric Bledsoe, You held me out. You're doing all right. I said, Will you
buy dinner?  
  
Q. You've come a long way with these young men. You decide now going
into the next round if you can name one thing, just one thing that you would
like to instill in them as a team or as individuals for the next round, what
would it be?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, let me take that back, I need -- Nick is the only one
that isn't breaking through right now. For him personally, I want to see Nick
Richards step up and dunk and block and play. He's kind of holding himself
back right now. And I start him just like I did Hami every day, because I want
him to break through.  
  
As a team, the biggest thing is everyone is connected. Everyone is for each
other. And we still have a couple of guys that aren't quite the servant
leaders that they need to be. Like I'm playing for everyone else. Well, if
I've got a whole team of guys doing that, I'm not playing for me, I'm playing
for everybody else, that's when this thing takes off.  
  
We're getting closer, but that's probably the one thing I hope.  
  
Q. Shai has the early morning sessions. Do you see any MKG at all in his
habits?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had the morning breakfast club. This kid
goes at 7 a.m. But he also watches tape. He'll go up and show me turnovers,
show me what you want. What he was missing was any kind of skip, he couldn't
see it. And so you've got to keep showing them. Then when he does it you have
to reward him. Now you see him come down and throw skip passes. But it took
two months.  
  
And he has a spirit about him, a smile. Every Canadian kid -- I don't know why
I don't get every Canadian kid, Jamal Murray, Trey, Michael, they all like
have smiles, and they have -- when Jamal would come and practice he'd look at
me and go, Coach. Like, I wasn't smiling. Smile. And so his spirit starts
moving us that way. He was the one guy that was having fun. The other guys on
this team two months ago, everything was a struggle. This kid was just smiling
and laughing.  
  
I kept bringing it up, Be like him. Happy-go-lucky. But he's working. On time
for everything. Never late for anything. Goes to class, does all that he's
supposed to do. And look at him, he's playing himself into being one of the
best players in the country.  
  
Q. Very efficient today, 7 of 15. Seemed like every time UB put a little
bit of run on you, one of your guys would come up and hit a big 3. How big was
that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: The last 10 games we're shooting 40 percent from the 3-point
line. Against Davidson we only took six. And I'm still trying to figure out,
how did we only take six? Was it their defense? Was it what we did? Was it
that we were trying to be aggressive? I don't know.  
  
But we want to take between 15 and 18 3s. We're not taking 30. Any time in the
history of my career my team takes 30 shots from the 3, we lose. We don't win
those games.  
  
We're not relying on 3s, but we shoot 40 percent. It's a different -- I mean,
some guys are going to shoot 30 and that's how they coach and that's great.
It's not what I do.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [Nate Oats](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30683)

### [Nick Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30768)

### [CJ Massinburg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35020)

### [Jeremy Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35090)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Buffalo.  
  
Q. Have you heard back from former President Obama yet? Any apology for
him picking against you?  
CJ MASSINBURG: No, I haven't heard any response from Obama yet. We actually
haven't had our phones, we got them back this morning. Coach took them last
night, just so we could get some rest.  
  
Q. You guys, I was really impressed with the confidence you had after
last night's game against Arizona. What do you have to do to keep that going
against Kentucky? And what do you expect from the Wildcats, the second
Wildcats you're going to face in three days?  
NICK PERKINS: I would just say it's really a focus thing. I think with some
people they get a little success you start to get out of what you've been
doing from the jump.  
  
Really just staying focused. Kentucky is a little different team from Arizona.
They've got more guards and more perimeter-based team. The scouting report is
going to be a little different.  
  
We've just got to come ready to play and stay focused.  
  
Q. The crowd was pretty well behind you last night. I'm assuming it will
be the same tomorrow night. Did you feed off that energy?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I'd say we did feed off it a little bit. Like I said last
night, I felt like we were in Alumni Arena in Buffalo. Shout-out to the fans
out here in Boise that supported us, and the Buffalo fans that traveled out to
see us.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: At the beginning of the game we got a couple of buckets, you
could hear the UB fans cheering and stuff like that. When we went on a run at
the end and everybody seeing what we was made of, we had the whole arena
erupting, and it was a great feeling.  
  
NICK PERKINS: That second half was something crazy. We started hitting all the
shots. Things really started going our way, I could hear the crowd behind us.
It made us feel good. It gave us a little bit of confidence to finish the
game.  
  
Q. Their players don't buy the idea, and your coach is definitely
selling it, they're all freshmen and your veteran experience will benefit you.
Do you think your veteran experience will be a factor in this game?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I mean, Kentucky is a very good team, as we all know. But I
think experience should give us just a little bit of an edge. I think the team
that plays the hardest is going to come out with the win.  
  
Q. From the film that you've seen so far of Kentucky, I don't know how
much you've gotten to see yet or if you saw any of the game yesterday, where
do you think you match up well against Kentucky and what areas are going to be
the hardest to defend?  
NICK PERKINS: I think we match up pretty well with their guards. They've got
some guards who are pretty good on the ball screen and stuff like that. But I
also think they're lacking on the inside with defending and stuff like that.  
  
One strength I think they have is pretty much their size. They're a good
rebounding team and stuff like that. But I don't think they can stay with us
in transition and stuff like that. They've got a lot of big guys, they play a
little bit too much, and I think that will play to our favor.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: I feel like this game is going to be a little different than
last game. Last game we wanted to shoot all the 3s to like kind of expose
their 7 footers. But this game I feel like my big guy, Nick Perkins, is going
to get a lot inside and dominate and play his game how he's been playing the
whole year.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: Could you repeat the question? I forgot it.  
  
Q. From the film you've seen so far of Kentucky and if you got to see
any of their game yesterday, what areas do you match up and what areas will be
a struggle?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I think we match up with them pretty good. I mean, they've got
players on the boards, we know they can play. They're real good. But they put
on their shorts just like we put on our shorts.  
  
Like I said, I feel like the toughest team and the hardest-playing team is
going to come out tomorrow night, or afternoon.  
  
Q. How do you keep that energy going? Yesterday, especially the second
half, you outscore Arizona by 18 points, you snagged the momentum and never
gave it back. How do you keep that going on Saturday night against Kentucky
and maybe getting into the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Just sticking to how we play. We came into yesterday's game not
really changing too much of how we play. We're going to come into the game
with Kentucky not changing anything. We want to stick to our base. We always
want to be the hardest-playing team every time we step on the floor, no matter
who we're playing against and stuff like that.  
  
Q. From being around you guys the last couple of days, it seems that
Nate has really created a culture where you guys are free to say what you want
and be confident and speak your mind, and he clearly does the same thing. I
was curious how that has helped you guys develop both the playing style you
have and the confidence to come out and play last night and hopefully for your
sake tomorrow?  
NICK PERKINS: I feel like it's big. I feel like we have a good relationship
with Coach and you know who he is as a person, he know who you are. I think
you want to play harder for him. And he wants to go harder for you. It makes
the program so much better. We're comfortable with each other and you get to
be yourself.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Coach is definitely a player's coach. He basically asks us what
we want to do. Today we have a practice in a few. And he asked us, Hey, you
want to go live or walk through and get a lot of jump shots up? And that's
really big, when you have some coaches it's really a dictatorship in the
program, they say, Their way or the highway. That's not like it here.  
  
You always want to play for a coach that has the utmost confidence in you and
listens to you as a player.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: Yeah, when the head man of the program is the hardest-working
man in the program, it's easy to follow. So like they said, he's a players'
coach. He gives us tons of confidence and that's why we play how we play.  
  
Q. You're the Cinderella now officially, I think. I wonder, when you
were growing up watching the NCAA Tournament did you have a favorite
Cinderella team?  
JEREMY HARRIS: No.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: No.  
  
NICK PERKINS: I can't even think of one, to be honest.  
  
Q. Jeremy, you didn't seem to like that I called you "Cinderella." Is
that accurate, you don't like that label?  
JEREMY HARRIS: Everybody thinks we should be here. And yesterday's game wasn't
like a fluke or whatever you call it. But I think we have a very confident
team. And I don't really like the term "Cinderella team."  
  
Q. What do you think that you showed to the rest of the country that
might not have heard of you before or watched you before?  
JEREMY HARRIS: We're a team that plays very hard. We've got some tough guards,
Dontay and Vonta, they started it last night. I told them after the game,
Ya'll started the game very good on the defensive end. And CJ hit a couple of
3s early, and we just feed off of each other. We give each other confidence
all the game.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Just kind of saying after last night you guys are on a national stage
now, you guys are getting so much national attention. What do you think that
you have shown to the rest of the country that maybe has never heard of you
guys, never even watched you play before?  
CJ MASSINBURG: I feel like the way -- not only the game last night but the way
we won, showed everybody that it wasn't a fluke. Sometimes teams can, like,
stick around with a High Major and come down to the last shot and hit a lucky
buzzer-beater, and go crazy. But I feel like our win wasn't like that
yesterday. Our win showed that.  
  
You heard Charles Barkley, you hear people saying that we dominated them. And
that's not really a fluke, you know. And I feel like the best team isn't done,
and we're going to show you tomorrow.  
  
Q. I would put this to all of you: How did you end up at Buffalo? What
was the recruiting process like? Were there other schools in the mix?  
NICK PERKINS: Well, coming out of high school, I'm a native Michigan guy, so
I've known of them for a while. Me being from Michigan, when Nate came to
Buffalo -- I think I committed here when Bobby Hurley still had the head job.
When Coach Hurley decided to leave, it was only right for me to stay with
Nate. Me and his relationship was to strong and all that, that's how I got
here.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Our story is a little bit different. I was playing AAU
basketball as an unsigned senior in the adidas Circuit. And I actually got
referred to Buffalo by Dusty May, who was at Louisiana Tech, he's not there
anymore, and they referred me to them.  
  
Then one of our assistant coaches, Jim Whitesell, he came and saw me in
Indiana and he liked my defensive game. They didn't know that I had the
offensive game. They recruited me for defense. When I got here and they seen
my offense, they were really shocked.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: I'll just say I was recruited right out of junior college, but
Coach B and Coach Oats recruited me the hardest, I believe, and I trusted them
the most. And I felt like I have made the right decision.  
  
Q. I was just asking the players how they ended up at Buffalo and I was
wondering how do you recruit to Buffalo?  
NATE OATS: Who wouldn't want to come to Buffalo. Go look now, it's about 8
inches of snow. You get all the skiing in during basketball season.  
  
Honestly, we try to just build relationships and sell our style of play and
sell the program. When I first got to Buffalo as an assistant, they didn't
have a name, nobody knew about them. I was selling Coach Hurley, Bobby had a
name, he was the best point guard ever in college basketball, we got Lamonte
Bearden then. So I recruited Bobby's name as an assistant.  
  
We got the program in the NCAA Tournament the second year. And then you had a
bit of a name and then we started recruiting, we go back to the NCAA
Tournament, and now you've been there two years in a row. Kids want to play in
the NCAA Tournament. Right now I think we're 5th in the country in length of
possession on offense. Our tempo is fast, we play spread out, wide open. Our
style of play is one that guys want to play.  
  
And then I think really the biggest thing in recruiting comes down to
relationships. There's certain places, if it was all about weather, everybody
would go to Miami. But I think Kansas gets some pretty good players, Kentucky
gets pretty good players; it's not on the beach.  
  
Honestly, the first thing I ask some of these kids is, Listen, we're up here
in the north, it snows little bit. But winter is during basketball season. So
let me ask you right up front: If you're one of those kids that's worried
about the weather outside the gym during basketball season, let me know up
front, because the weather inside the gym is the same in Miami as it is in
Buffalo. And we have gym rats that live in the gym. If you're worried about
the outside weather, let me know, you're not the type of kid we want. They all
say, No, that's not me. We get that right out of the way right up front.  
  
Q. I know you said that you made it. Has this win been everything you
imagined it would be?  
NATE OATS: I didn't imagine what it was like. I guess I was too busy trying to
prep to get the win. I don't have a very good imagination anyway. It's been
pretty crazy. They've had me on every radio show I've ever listened to, I
think, when you're trying to kill time.  
  
It's been great. Honestly I didn't want to turn too many of them down, because
I want the program itself to get -- like I said, we never had a name. We've
never been to the NCAA Tournament before Coach Hurley got hired and I came as
an assistant.  
  
Now we finally got a win. Let's build the program, and let people know what
Buffalo basketball is about, let's keep the snowball going. It's been great.
You get live on Scott Van Pelt, you get live on all these national television
shows. You talk about the kids. The kids are great. I didn't get to listen to
this. I'm assuming they gave you good answers. I love the group we've got.  
  
Q. How do you move on behind the best winning program in history and get
your team mentally ready against a hard test against Kentucky?  
NATE OATS: It's not the easiest. We've got a mature group of kids. We've got a
lot of juniors. Wes is a 5th-year senior. The maturity of the group, just
knowing that we want to get to the second weekend. I told them, Look, nobody
can ever take this win away from you, you beat Arizona. That's one of the best
programs in the country over the last 30 years. Unbelievable job.  
  
But listen, if you get to the second weekend of this tournament, you have no
idea. Like, this is almost a life changer. As far as your basketball career it
is.  
  
So our SID told me we had something like 1800 articles written about us since
last night. I told the guys, Those articles will be on the Internet for the
next year, ten years, let's concentrate on what we can do right now in the
next 24 hours to get this next win. Then go Twitter search and Google search
your name after the season, and you can spend all the time reading all the
articles you want. Reading all those articles right now helps us zero getting
the win against Kentucky. Forget it, let's move on, let's figure out how to
beat Kentucky, and after the season go and do all that other stuff.  
  
Q. What was the key in your opinion to the second half? You were locked
in for 20 minutes. It was 40-30 at the half. You missed 3s, turned the ball
over a little. You had 9 turnovers in the half. You come into that second
half, seemed like everything was clicking for you guys. What was the biggest
change from the way you played the first 20 and the last 20? And how does that
transition to Saturday night playing another good team in Kentucky?  
NATE OATS: I think part of it it's the first NCAA Tournament for most of these
guys. There's a little bit of jitters. And I told all of them going in, if we
take care of the ball and that our defense is where we need to be and rebound
it, we'll win the game.  
  
We had nine turnovers in the half. If you go to the second half the biggest
difference was we only had one turnover. I think calming down, taking care of
the ball. Our defense was a little suspect at the beginning of the second
half, we gave those three layups up, I was ready to kill some guys in there.
Ended up calling a time out, we were hitting 3s, and they were only hitting
2s. He was mad, called the timeout. We've got to get on them, and after that
we just locked in. Our defense for the last 17 minutes of the second half is
as good as it's been all year.  
  
Q. How about a job where coaches and players never say anything? And
here you are talking about Cal's whining about his freshmen, your players say
it's an advantage to have experience. Do you care about the idea that they put
it on their bulletin board and use it against you?  
NATE OATS: It is what it is. If you look at the roster, Wes Clark, senior,
their team, freshman, freshman. Their players are going to play in the NBA for
a reason. There's a reason that three of these guys are in the first round and
I'm going to show you. The talent level is absolutely there. And when they go
win the lottery, I'm going to agree with NBA teams that took them, they're
that good. They're still freshmen.  
  
No disrespect to our two freshmen, they have lapses. We're experienced.
They're inexperienced. It's no disrespect. It is what it is. It's facts. I'm
going to tell them, they're not freshmen? You are freshmen. Just like Cal's
been saying. Cal's been saying it.  
  
I will say this, when you play freshmen as many minutes as they've had to play
all year and you get to this point in the season, they're pretty seasoned
freshmen. They're not the first ten games freshmen. So they're almost
sophomores, but they are still freshmen, so it is what it is.  
  
We've got a 5th-year senior running our team. I like the way Wes is playing
right now. I think his experience and all that can be big. Now, he's 6-6, the
point guard they have, it's probably a lottery pick, but Wes has played
against some NBA guys and held his own. He's a pretty good player.  
  
Q. The players almost grimaced at being called "Cinderella"? Is that
something you instill in them to make them believe they deserve to be here?  
NATE OATS: If you look at the games we played, from Cincinnati to Syracuse and
Texas A&M, when we went to Syracuse and lost, the better team lost. We really
felt like we screwed some stuff up in the last three minutes when we had a
lead in the last three minutes of the game, it cost us.  
  
So we felt like -- when we played Cincinnati we didn't have Wes. And he makes
a difference. Now, Davonta was great, but Wes is experienced, 5th year. So we
got Wes just in time for the Syracuse and then the Texas A&M. Those were his
first two games. We didn't have Caruthers.  
  
I told them, this is the first time we have a full roster available to us.
We're going to get a High Major on a neutral floor. So this is what we've been
waiting for. Because we only got one High Major on a neutral floor in
Cincinnati.  
  
Now, I think we just instill in them from day 1: This is where we belong, this
is what we're going to do and this is what we're going to get. When we get the
next High Major on neutral floor in a NCAA major, we're going to take care of
business.  
  
Q. How is this different than preparing for Arizona?  
NATE OATS: They're similar in some regards, but much different. They both
don't get a lot of their points from three. Kentucky is 312 in the country in
percentage of points from 3 -- or Arizona was. Kentucky is 344th. They really
don't get -- they went 0 for 6 yesterday. The first time in years that
Kentucky hasn't had a three.  
  
The difference is Arizona pounds it into two 7 footers and gets their paint
touches. Kentucky takes you off the dribble and runs off of ball screens and
really plays off their athleticism. Their spacing is a little different. You
want to keep the ball out of the lane with both teams, but you have to do it
different ways. And then rebounding, Kentucky is 8th in the country in
offensive rebounding percentages. If you look at the defensive numbers, too,
Kentucky's defensive numbers are much, much better than Arizona's were.  
  
We're going to struggle to score a little bit more against Kentucky than we
did against Arizona, I think.  
  
Q. You're up here talking about Calipari whining, talking about the
weather, you've got Bulls fans going through tables. Your guys are talking
about how handsome they are. How are you able to be so loose right now and
have that --  
NATE OATS: Let me clarify, when I said Calipari whining about freshmen, I was
maybe -- it was a misuse of the word. He's a pretty dang good coach. He's made
known the fact that he's young all year. It's a fact. It is what it is.  
  
We both want to win. We both won nine of our last ten games. They lost four in
a row before they went on a run. So I think he finally broke through and got
through to his freshmen and maybe he'll say that -- I don't know what -- I
tell our guys, I'm not going to lie to you, I don't go into scouting reports
and blow some team up that's not very good to tell them that they're great.
But I also don't go the other way, either.  
  
So let's say it like it is, let's be real. I'm not going to try to disrespect
anybody. But our players -- you can talk to them, too, they're a little older,
they're good guys. Wes has two kids. He's trying to catch up to me. I've got
three. We can trade parenting stories.  
  
Q. You guys are up there talking about this stuff, how are you able to
have this mindset? You seem pretty loose right now.  
NATE OATS: Here's the other thing, like I've been through a little bit here in
the last few years just on a personal level; my wife's cancer and everything.
The game of basketball is big and it is my job and I need to win games to keep
my job, but it's not -- I tell our guys all the time, if all I do is teach you
to play basketball, I've failed miserably.  
  
We have a training -- we bring a guy in at least once a week. We talk life a
lot of times, too. We don't just talk basketball. Basketball is big and we're
going to play as hard as we can, and if you don't give max effort you're
letting the whole program down. But it's not the end-all. We're all going to
be fathers and husbands and let's be better men than we are when we started.
So I think it gives you a little perspective of life, too.  
  
Q. There has been some joking around about the fans of Buffalo and
tables and whatever. But what is it about the sports community of Buffalo that
makes them so passionate about not just Bulls, but it seems every sport
there's so much passion for their sports teams?  
NATE OATS: It's a great question. Had I lived there my whole life I could
probably give you a much better answer. He could probably give you a better
answer, he should come up and answer the question instead of ask the
questions.  
  
Look, from my five years in Buffalo, my experience -- everybody wants to talk
about the Super Bowls that almost were. Was it wide right or wide left? Wide
right, my bad. But it's almost like they've had some really good teams that
have almost got there and they -- shoot, I live in a neighborhood, like they
literally shut down -- you don't do anything during a Bills game. They've got
the tailgates going. Everybody locks into every single Bills game all the
time. They're good. Like the playoffs, that was great.  
  
I don't know, it's a blue collar town. I grew up in the midwest. I tell
everybody, Buffalo is way more midwest than it is east coast. We're four hours
from Detroit, and six hours from New York City. It's blue collar, hard
working, really good people that get behind their sports team that like to
have a good time and support them.  
  
Did you see the kid breaking the table and running through a foot of snow?
That's one more motivation for us to win last night, so we could stay in
Boise. It was like 70 the second day we're here. And it's snowing 8 inches.
Let's work on our tan in Boise while we're here.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [C.J. Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32829)

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Ohio State.  
  
Q. Now that you've had time to digest the win a little bit, what are
your thoughts and emotions about being able to hold off a late comeback
attempt by South Dakota State?  
C.J. JACKSON: It's always good. We were going against a good team. The way
they shoot the ball they were never out of the game. Just to come away with
the win and get that first game out of the way is a good feeling.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: We know we played with a team that are so efficient
offensively. No matter how far they get down, a couple of shots can come back
and be right in the game. I think the guys did really well down the stretch of
just overcoming those comebacks.  
  
Q. What has the addition of Andrew Dakich meant to the team? Since he
did come from Michigan, how much trouble did you have to give him for that?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Like you said, first it was like, Who is this guy coming from
Michigan as a walk-on? They don't really like those guys up there. Dak is one
of those guys that came in and has the personality that you've got to love.  
  
And he was a great addition to our program, just because he's been on winning
teams in his time at Michigan. So he brings a lot of advice to us other guys
who have only been here one or two times. Just to pick his brain and see what
the winning teams did, that's a great contribution.  
  
As far as what he does on the court, he keeps our huddles close, and does a
lot of little things. Like last night he had some key steals and key rebounds
that really won us the game.  
  
C.J. JACKSON: In the beginning it was a little rough, just kind of he came
from up there. So we don't really like those guys, as he said. But as the
season went on he's really grown on us, personality on and off the court. We
kind of do things more as the season went on. And how he handled last night we
needed him. He came on with big plays down the stretch and those were game-
winning plays that kind of decided the game.  
  
Q. You played Gonzaga in the PK-80 in November. What do you remember
from that game? How have you grown since then?  
C.J. JACKSON: We're a completely different team. We're a lot better now. And
as they are, they're a lot better team. We have to play a full 40 minutes, and
just be ready for, like yesterday's game had its ups and downs, and tomorrow's
game is going to have the same. We have to be ready to play the full 40.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: We were kind of trying to find ourselves the first time we
played them. Now that we have our culture and we know what winning looks like
and what -- things we need to do to win. I think this is going to be
completely different matchup than it was earlier in the season.  
  
Q. We heard you guys are staying in the same hotel as Gonzaga. Have you
had any interesting interactions with those guys?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: No, I think we ran into a couple of fans, but we haven't really
seen them. I didn't even know that until you told me, honestly.  
  
Q. What do you think specifically changed from November to now? What
kicked into place?  
C.J. JACKSON: Just our roles defined are a little bit better. Chemistry is a
lot better. In the beginning of the season that was like our 6th game together
with all of the new faces, the new coaching staff. So we didn't really
understand each other very well. And now it's a whole new season basically,
and just understanding what we need to do, who we need to be together out
there is much better.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: I mean, just like C.J. said, we had a whole -- Gonzaga, I think
personally that was our first test of the season.  
  
So just seeing us early on, we're just a completely different team now. We've
been through so much adversity, ups and downs throughout the season. We're
looking forward to facing a great opponent.  
  
Q. I'm just curious about your thoughts on Coach Holtmann. What was he
like when he first came on board and how has your perception of him changed?
We won't tell him what you say.  
C.J. JACKSON: It's like we met him for the first time, I knew nothing about
him personally. We knew he came from Butler, a good program, had a great year
last year, making it to the Sweet 16. That was about it.  
  
In the beginning we had our doubts and questions just because that's when you
come into a new situation and it happened so fast.  
  
Now today it's the perfect fit. We're kind of taking after him as a team. He's
a tough guy. He works hard, hard-nosed worker. As a team we're taking after
him and that's huge for us.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Like C.J. said, at first, definitely you don't want to see your
old coaching staff go, and it happened so suddenly. I think Coach Holtmann did
a great job of taking us older guys under his wing. And he let us know when
you see college coaches get a head coach change, they use the first year to
recruit and start over next year.  
  
But he definitely made it -- obviously he wanted to hit the ground running.
And at the beginning of the year we would go over to his house, it seemed like
we went over to his house like every weekend, just to get that chemistry and
get that closeness. It's paid off a lot. He's one of those coaches who wants
the best for all of his players and he's going to go to bat for us. He's going
to fight for us every step of the way. I couldn't ask for a better head coach
for my senior year.  
  
Q. How tough is it to balance playing Kaleb Wesson who is one of your
better offensive players, but also playing small ball for defensive purposes?
Is that difficult sometimes?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: As a coach you have to make those judgments on what's best for
your team. What gives your team the best chance to win. And that's what we've
done.  
  
He's played consistent minutes for us, certainly as a freshman throughout the
year. The other day was just a unique, very, very, very unique matchup with a
5 that is as good as Mike Daum is.  
  
Q. Coach Few brought up how you reached out to him when you were
considering taking the Ohio State job, and asking for advice. Can you say what
some of the advice he gave you was?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I won't get into great detail on what Mark said. But,
listen, I've got tremendous respect for Mark and this Gonzaga program. That's
what they are, they are an elite program. And when you can go to a
championship game and come back the next year and have the kind of year that
they've had, the consistency that they've had, it says you have reached elite
level status. And I think that's where they're at right now. That was one
reason for reaching out to Mark.  
  
Another reason was just he's obviously been a guy that a lot of people have
reached out to, other programs. And I wanted his feedback. And he probably
gave me, as you'd expect, as level-headed of advice. He didn't say to go or he
didn't say to stay. He just kind of gave me what his thought process was when
situations came up. And that was helpful.  
  
Q. Could you talk about bringing in Andrew Dakich and what it was like
to bring in a guy from Michigan and how glad you are now that you did take
that chance?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, certainly really happy. The fact that he came from the
team up north didn't really factor in a whole lot because we were really
desperate for guards. And we were in a situation really in July when there was
really slim pickings. It was a no-brainer in our mind. I think when we took
him I think our coaching staff felt like, Okay, we got better as a program.  
  
Now, I don't think we anticipated him having quite the impact that he's had
kind of with the -- we thought the intangible stuff he would really help with.
But he's been a little bit better in some areas than maybe I anticipated,
which has been a real credit to Andrew, particularly on the defensive end.  
  
But, yeah, it was a no-brainer for us because we were sitting with -- in terms
of our back court we had, at one time, two guys on our back court; really,
C.J. and Kam. And I was thinking, Okay, we're going to have to probably play
Jae'Sean some at the point, but how will that -- so we were just in scramble
mode. And he was a gift for sure.  
  
Q. Players win games. Best players have to be the best players this time
of year. As it comes to Keita, how much do you have to remind him either in
games or before games that, You are the guy, be the guy, and how does that
work itself out?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I probably had to remind him of that less and less as the
season has progressed, because I think his confidence has grown to the point
he's embraced that role. It's been, Okay, you're saying it to me, you were
pushing us early. I think he saw that we were going to utilize him as a focal
point of what we do. I've had to say it to him less now. Now he's embraced
that role.  
  
And his assertiveness on the offensive end is not something I've really had to
address, as you can tell. He's pretty aggressive most times when he's out
there, which is great to see.  
  
Q. Back to Andrew and him being a coach's son. How does that affect a
player when they have a father like he has?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, in coaching coach's kids, sometimes it's a blessing and
sometimes it's a curse.  
  
With Andrew it's been much more a blessing. It's been much more a blessing.
Sometimes coach's kids, they kind of think they've got it all figured out and
they've kind of got the answers because of where they grew up. I think Andrew
has been one of our most coachable, teachable guys. He'll share his
suggestions, for sure, unsolicited. But it's what we love about him, too.  
  
But he's been a dream to coach. He has been an absolute dream to coach. And
his family has been perfect. They've been incredible player parents, probably
because they get it, because Dan was a coach. Dan understands there has to be
a separation in that relationship. Dan really understands that. It's been a
dream scenario for us.  
  
Q. How have you seen Gonzaga grow since you faced them in November?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think they just have gotten better and better. They are
really balanced, as we would expect.  
  
Listen, game one was not much of a game. They absolutely took us to the
woodshed. It was a mismatch in every way. And I'm hopeful that we can do a
better job of getting our guys ready for that.  
  
But I don't know that they've made dramatic changes, they've just gotten
better and better, as you would expect one of Mark's team to be. I think
they're an elite team right now.  
  
Q. I thought I read somewhere you talked with Mark earlier this week.
Was that about South Dakota State or the tournament?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I called him late, late one night we were in the office
just doing some work. And I was going to ask him about South Dakota State
because, you know, they obviously played them last year. And he was enjoying a
beverage and a view of the mountains. So I said, Man, what a life that is
right there. (Laughter.) I was quite envious at the time. And it was about
9:30 or 10:00 our time. And I just tried to figure out honestly how to guard
South Dakota State and if he had any suggestions.  
  
South Dakota State is very different than when Gonzaga played them last year,
but I just wanted his thoughts, because I really respected his opinion. We had
a good conversation. And you could tell, he was pretty chatty. And I was like,
I've got to go, I've got to get back to work, all right? You can finish
whatever you're doing, but...  
  
Q. With Kentucky playing in the same pod you probably have a few
additional supporters. Do you have any shout-outs to the people of
Nicholasville or Jessamine County?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: That's my hometown, Lexington and Nicholasville. I have a
great affinity for that town, that city, that area, Down there in Big Blue
Nation. We would love to steal a few fans, because we know it's going to be a
road environment. So absolutely I would love to solicit some extra help from
Big Blue Nation because it's going to be a pretty raucous crowd, for sure,
with the Zags.  
  
We played them in Portland and we felt like it was a road environment.
Yesterday was kind of a road environment for us, I think for a variety of
reasons. And we expect it to be another tremendous road environment. And our
guys have been good on the road, for the most part.  
  
But the last couple of years, I think last two years we've been in the same
area as Kentucky. Wish them great success.  
  
Q. Growth in your team from November to now, what have you seen is the
most difference?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I don't know that I did a great job early on. I was trying to
just -- you get a new team, you're trying to figure out some things with your
group. And I don't know that I always did a great job figuring out our
personnel and how they fit. It was just such a new group.  
  
I think once we got into a little bit of a rhythm and maybe we as a coaching
staff understood some more of our guys' strengths, that really helped us. And
I think it also took time for them to understand kind of what our expectations
were. We thought it would take some time, it always does with a new coach. And
fortunately we hit our stride at the right time with this group. And as I
said, they've been extremely coachable.  
  
Q. What were the challenges of trying to build trust with a new team
taking over so late?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, as in any relationship, I think I just tried, we as
a coaching staff, just tried to be honest and up-front and as real as possible
with them. They play for a very good coach in Thad Matta, and we were going to
do things different than they did. But I just wanted to be really real with
them and honest with them from the get-go.  
  
And we knew that there was going to be some time that was going to need to
take place where they could fully trust us, both to put them in the right
positions and just trust what we were saying. Fortunately that happened and
probably happened even a little quicker than we all anticipated. It helps when
you have great kids.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Gonzaga.  
  
Q. Both of you used red-shirt years, yours was due to an injury, Josh.
Can you talk about what you learned during your red-shirt years that you might
not have learned if you spent the full season with the team?  
JOSH PERKINS: I knew not to take any day for granted. Any day can be taken
away from me. Just approaching every day with that mindset.  
  
And basketball-wise, I had a great mentor, Kevin Pangos, learned some of the
little things he did; talking, hand shakes on the low. Just noticed stuff like
that to be a better leader for the team.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: For me, just having guys like Josh, to see how the guys
approached every day, every practice, stuff like that, all the stuff you can
learn. They're all winners so the attitude and mentality that they had going
into every practice was big for me.  
  
Q. Now that you've had some time to digest the game, what are your
thoughts about being able to hold off a comeback attempt from UNCG? And what
are your thoughts and notions about that?  
COREY KISPERT: It's March, and teams are going to give us their best shot.
They made a lot of tough shots. And that's something you can't control all the
time as a defense. But a team will make a shot or not. It's our job to execute
on offense and play as hard as we can.  
  
We did that down the stretch and it showed.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Obviously our leaders, Perk, J3, and Silas, kept us
composed. So looking for our leaders to carry us and stuff like that.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: We're very fortunate and grateful to be here. But like he said,
any team could have wavered, but we didn't, we knew we had to dig deep. We
came out with the win. So we're glad to be here.  
  
Q. You guys played Ohio State and dominated pretty well. But this looks
like they've made some changes. What do you see different with this team that
you're going to face tomorrow?  
JOSH PERKINS: Like you said, they've got a lot more shoes out there, a lot
more confidence. They're still monsters on the boards. But we're a different
team, as well.  
  
It's going to be a fight tomorrow, for sure. Just try to execute our coach's
game plan and we should be in good hands.  
  
Q. Did you know Donte Ingram very well? Did you talk, text or anything
yesterday?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: He texted me yesterday. We played together in high school;
when I was a sophomore, he was a senior. We played in a city championship. I
was really excited for him after he made the shot. He texted me, being from
Chicago and being from this school, he was really proud of us.  
  
Q. Gonzaga sometimes is known for having a lot of the former players
come back and have a presence around the campus. What kind of impact does that
have for you guys? What does that do for your team?  
COREY KISPERT: I love it. I remember one of the very first games in pickup I
played on campus, Rob Sacre was screaming at me. After the game he'll tell you
a joke and give you a pat on the back. And being a scared freshman, my first
few days in the summer really helped me feel at home and have all those guys
come back gives me a good feeling to know that this is where I need to be.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: They've been through the program. They've been through the
ups and downs, and also talking to them about the transition from your
freshman to graduating was really big to me. We came here to develop as a
player.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: It's just an awesome feeling. Guys come back and build
relationships. And as I said before, they really helped us. Gave us the ropes.
And obviously it's competitive, as basketball players. But they show us the
things they learned in the program and they do what they can to help us better
ourselves as individuals and basketball players every day.  
  
Q. Being on the team last year but not playing, just what was that like
going through the tournament?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: I mean before, you know, going through the red shirt, being
a victim, Why me, why do I have to red shirt? Seeing how special the team was
last year, and the fight and the determination they had from day 1 was big for
me. Taking every moment, I don't want to take anything for granted. And just
take it all in.  
  
Q. Last year you made it to the championship game. Does that have any
affect on your mindset this year? Do you feel like you have more pressure on
you to go out and prove something or is that last year and doesn't affect this
year?  
JOSH PERKINS: I mean that definitely is going to stick with us forever, coming
so close, coming so far. But it wasn't a burden or anything, like it was last
year. But that chip has gotten bigger for us. People expect us to be here this
year, that chip is going to keep be getting bigger and bigger.  
  
COREY KISPERT: I was in high school last year, and I picked the Zags to make
it to the championship last year. And people kind of looked at me, They never
made it to the Final Four, what are you doing? Don't pick them. I had
confidence and faith. And now that they actually made it and broke that
barrier, and got the monkey off their back, I don't expect anything different.  
  
This is my first year. I expect us to do big things. And that's kind of all I
know.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Like he said, just the big monkey off the back. It's an
expectation for us. Having the feeling last year, you want to get back to
that. That's just the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Ohio State has changed from your first meeting but you guys have,
too. What would you say the biggest difference is from November to where you
are at now?  
JOSH PERKINS: I mean obviously ball movement, more experience. The young guys
are getting better and better every day. Corey has improved, roles have
changed. Guys are more comfortable in the spots they've been in before. We
know how to win now. And hopefully we can do the same thing tomorrow.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Just being more comfortable with our roles and stuff like
that. We drill every day in practice being proactive, we're kind of reactive
and kind of surprised with some of the things that were happening. But now
we're like a well-run machine. We look to Josh to make big plays for us, J-3
and stuff like that.  
  
COREY KISPERT: The biggest thing I noticed from watching is the defense. The
defense has definitely tightened up. There were definitely holes we left open
in November that we definitely tightened up now. We've been preparing for
them, piece by piece.  
  
Q. Start with the obvious. You played this team before, Ohio State. They
won a lot of games since then. How different are they from that first
meeting?  
MARK FEW: It's a lot of the same faces, but, again, that's why Chris is up for
National Coach of the Year. Just an unbelievable job. We watched them as they
ran through that Big Ten almost to the last week of the season. And they did a
great job getting them to believe and really come together. And they seem like
they're really connected.  
  
When we faced them in the PK-80 I think both teams had a lot of -- he was
trying to get his system and philosophy put in. We were trying to integrate a
bunch of new faces and players in different roles. And I think the game was
closer than the final result. We kind of blew it open there in the second
half.  
  
But, no, we know it's going to be really tough, physical. They've got great
size and great physicality. And tough guys. And they've really shot -- some of
them shot the ball well last night.  
  
Q. You've done this a long time. Is it harder to keep a team on top or
to sort of try to rebuild it maybe after a couple of tough years?  
MARK FEW: I mean, just speaking from experience, say it's a lot harder to
maintain a high level of success. That's why I have so much respect for Coach
Cal and Duke and North Carolina, just to be able to stay at a level. Because
it's a constant pecking away at you, in every way, shape and form. And trying
to tear you down. And it's everybody's biggest game all the time.  
  
We've done both. We've built our program up. And were the Cinderella for a
while. And the maintenance part is a lot harder than I think people realize.  
  
Q. Eight players on your roster have had a red-shirt experience during
their career. It's pretty high for a one-and-done era. I know a lot of times
that's injuries and transfers. But for guys like Zach, can you talk about the
process of deciding to red shirt them, and what you think they get out of
their red-shirt years?  
MARK FEW: Yeah, it's strictly up to the individual. And it's not something
that we go in and tell them, other than on a transfer situation, obviously
those guys have to.  
  
We have a culture up there that we're very proud of. It's a culture of
winning. It's a culture of handling things the right way, whether it's
academically or out in the community or the cohesiveness of our team. We're
very protective of our team-first culture. And I think it gives those guys
just a great opportunity to assimilate all that stuff as well as grow the
basketball side of them.  
  
We've been lucky enough and fortunate enough to do that with a portion of our
guys that feels like to me we've done less of it as we've evolved. But in
Zach's case, his knee was really bothering him last summer or two summers ago.
Then looking at our roster with Perk coming back, Nigel Williams-Goss, we all
knew how good he was going to be, Jordan Mathews, Silas Melson. It was the
right thing to do.  
  
Q. Last night was a fairly pro-Gonzaga crowd. I would assume that it's
going to be the same way tomorrow night. Did you feel like your team fed off
the energy of the crowd last night or how do you feel they did?  
MARK FEW: No, not necessarily. I thought UNCG had certainly some momentum
going down the stretch. You watch how all these games are playing out, even
ones that are currently going. Those first-round games when you're the
favored, higher seed, momentum is a crazy thing. And it affects people in pro
sports at the highest level.  
  
So I think that's probably what I'm most proud about is we were able to stem
the momentum of Greensboro and just find a way to win. Obviously the Zag fans
travel, showed that throughout the run last year to the Final Four. And we
consider Boise a Zag town. And we'll take as much support and as much energy
and as much of a home crowd we can get tomorrow. We're going to need it.  
  
Q. Your best players have to be your best players especially during
tournament time. Have you had to, through the years, remind guys, your best
guys, that they need to be the ones, they have to even take it up another
notch?  
MARK FEW: We talk about it. Not just so much the tournament, but anytime
there's a big game, that that's when they've really got to shine. And this
year's team's unique. We're pretty even across the board with picking who our
best guy is. A lot of times it's matchups and a lot of times it's who's
playing well at that particular time. It might be Josh Perkins, it might be
Killian Tillie, if you look at the conference tournament. Certainly down the
stretch for a lot of games Rui has been spectacular.  
  
But through it all Johnathan Williams has been an absolute, rock solid guy you
can count on as far as his physicality, his rebounding, his protecting the
rim. And then delivering when we get him the ball down low.  
  
Q. Obviously the sport's had some rough headlines the last few months.
And we roll around into this time of year. What is it about this that kind of
makes you forgive and forget?  
MARK FEW: It should make you forgive and forget. It's a magical, magical
sport, this college basketball. You've got kids that no matter what we say and
no matter how we try to -- many of you out here and everything try to push
them into the next level, this is the greatest years of their life. You play
in this NCAA Tournament, they'll remember it for the rest of their life. It's
the ultimate experience if you're a college basketball player. Not only are
they playing on a national stage or even an international stage, but they're
doing it with their best buddies, you know. And the connectivity that you see
from 18, 19, 20 years old is real. And they care about each other and they're
having a blast.  
  
And then just the opportunity that you see coming out there, for these 14
seeds and 13 seeds and 12 seeds and all that. They make their one statement in
front of the world. It adds even a higher level of drama to it.  
  
I think it's the greatest thing going. I'm obviously biased. But you watch
these games yesterday and the ones starting today and it's definitely
captivating and makes you want to believe in the good part of the sport, which
is probably like 98 percent of it.  
  
Q. Chris Holtmann mentioned yesterday that you had helped him a little
bit with South Dakota State or you guys had talked a little bit. Now he is
your adversary, and somebody asked him about that and he said, Hell, he's glad
he's got us now.  
MARK FEW: I don't remember saying that. I don't remember implying that.  
  
Q. Chris said that.  
MARK FEW: Okay.  
  
Q. But you talked a little bit about what he's done this year. You
regard him as one of the guys in that young rising star class?  
MARK FEW: Absolutely. And I have the highest level of respect for him that you
can have. He's an excellent basketball coach. But he's an even better person,
that has the right values and the highest level of character to run a program
like that. And just like he ran it at Butler.  
  
So he's definitely at the highest level of respect I can give a man and a
father and a husband and a coach. He's the real deal.  
  
We've talked a lot, we even talked when he was mulling over the Butler-Ohio
State move. And he reached out to me out of nowhere and we had a talk about
that. He's a good man and a great coach.  
  
Q. You have quite a bit of tournament experience now. And in your
experience would you say the first game has any impact on the rest of the
tournament? Or is each game kind of its own individual animal?  
MARK FEW: I just think each game is its own -- takes on its own life, much
like it does during the regular season. And the styles of play vary so much. I
think there's something a little bit different from that first-round game to
now you've played, you've experienced it, you've got it out of the way. And
the second-round game kind of becomes a little bit more just playing.  
  
I'm hoping that's the case, because we did not play very well last night. So
I'm hoping we'll come out and play like we played down in Vegas or play like
we played against Ohio State in the PK-80, that would be good.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, it's obviously been a long time since you saw Ohio
State, and you both are very different teams than in November. How have you
seen Ohio State when you scouted for them now versus scouting for them in
November? How do they look different?  
MARK FEW: They're a team that looked like they came together more and they
certainly have their belief in Chris and the staff and the system and all of
that. Certainly has grown exponentially.  
  
And as far as adjustments, it's a short turnaround here. We're pretty much
going to do what we do and I'm sure they're going to do what they do. But we
can tweak some things here and there.  
  
But like I said, we look at a game, and someone said it was 20-something
points, you go back and watch the game and it was a little tighter than that
for longer periods than maybe the results indicate.  
  
So expecting a really, really physical game. And Bates-Diop, we prepared for
him heavily last time, as well we should have. He's a fabulous player. Tate is
a unique player to prepare for. He's just a load and tough and physical and
aggressive. And I really think those guards have stepped up their game. I
think they've came into their own and are playing with a lot of confidence,
which I think that's probably the biggest difference from November to now.  
  
Q. Over the last two decades you've done a really good job of getting
players to return to campus and come and be part of the larger Gonzaga family.
What is it about Gonzaga and how do you get different players to buy into the
larger Gonzaga family?  
MARK FEW: It's just the culture. We've been able, because of the players that
came before them, to create a unique team-first, winning culture that involves
cohesiveness of players that really care about each other, and a fan base that
is unbelievable, the experience, when you're up there.  
  
So I think there's a lot of love that the players feel and the support and the
notoriety. And you combine that with getting to hang out and kind of hoop with
your brothers. And certainly winning makes everything more attractive and more
fun. And we've been fortunate enough to win at a high level for a long time.  
  
I think the one thing that our guys do a good job of passing all those
qualities down. And then one way or another we find a way in recruiting to
find the right guys that kind of fit the Gonzaga culture.  
  
And I'll tell you the last thing, I think we're very unique. A lot of our
former players move back to Spokane after they're done playing. I can't think
of a place that probably has more former players living around them than what
we have in Spokane.  
  
Q. With everything that's going on in college basketball right now, it
would seem to me to be a difficult time to be a college head basketball coach.
Do you sense a trend in more and more people coming out in support of each
other in the coaching fraternity? How would you assess the collegiality
between college basketball coaches now?  
MARK FEW: That's a great question. I do think we're in an age, in an era where
we're just -- again, I think it mimics what's going on in our country and
everything. But we flipped way, way over to here, and we've just got to move
the needle back and just get everything calmed down a little bit.  
  
But I've been fortunate enough to have a bunch of really good friends in this
business. I mean really, really close friends. And the one thing -- it's a
fellow head coach, you can really share some experiences and share some
feelings. And have some great talks, whether it's Coach Cal out there on the
floor to just so many of my buddies that I have in the profession, and I do
think there's a collegiality that happens, and there's, I don't want to say
like a care group or anything, but we have a tendency to call each other up
and have these little bitch and moan complain sessions. Like, wow, we're going
through the same thing. It's like, you'll be fine. You'll be fine, and go from
there.  
  
There's some really, really, really great people in this profession. Like I
said, Chris Holtmann is obviously -- it's great to see the profession being
passed on to guys like him, because it's going to be in great hands with guys
like him.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Kentucky.  
  
Q. Yesterday in the locker room everybody was asking about Arizona and
you were the only guy to say, Hold up, let's see who we play. Have you seen
Buffalo play at all? Were you surprised they were able to advance?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: I've seen Buffalo play a little bit. I know they're a really
good team. We watched some film on them, and know they're a great team. We'll
have to come out really prepared to beat this team.  
  
Q. UB's coach said you guys are young and they're veterans, and they
don't have the problem of having all freshmen. Do you think he's
overestimating the veteran experience?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: I feel like we've been getting that statement all year. That
statement is kind of old.  
  
At the end of the day, we're all basketball players, we're going to try to
come out and compete and show the world what kind of basketball team we are.
That's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Now that you've had some time to digest yesterday's game, what are
your thoughts and emotions about being able to slow down or stop the comeback
from the other team?  
QUADE GREEN: Just play hard, play our speed, play our pace, and play our game.
Everything else will sort itself out.  
  
Q. They're 6th in the nation in scoring. Obviously your guys' defense
has been pretty good all year. What do you think has been the strength of your
defense and what makes you confident about your defense?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: I think our length is what bothers teams, and our athleticism.
And we've been able to defend the rim. So we're going to continue with that.
And I think as the season, our communication has picked up as a team. As young
players we've been coming together and that's helped us defensively.  
  
Q. Curious to know how much you guys have seen from last night's
Buffalo-Arizona game and what have you learned about them and what do you
expect tomorrow night?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: The game tape we went over didn't have any of last night's
game. Some of us watched highlights and some of us a little bit of the game.  
  
They're a great team. They defend well. They've got great guards and great big
men. We just have to come out and play Kentucky basketball to get a win.  
  
Q. You're due for a breakout game. What's your mindset when you see
people like Wenyen hitting all those 3s and all your other teammates doing so
well? How do you stay so patient?  
QUADE GREEN: I'm in the gym, really. I know my time will come. But I'm not
really focused on that; I'm focusing on the team. So whoever is hot gets the
ball; if you miss them, you miss them, if you make them, you make them.
Simple.  
  
Q. Your decision-making seems to have improved a thousand percent. Can
you give us a couple of examples of play decisions that you're making now that
maybe you wouldn't have made at the very beginning of the year?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: I think my decision-making was always well, I was just trying
to rush things, that's the biggest thing. My decision-making was always, Well,
I just needed to slow the game down, be able to see the floor, and accept my
role I have to play on this team. And that's what I've been doing. Anything
the team needs me to do, that's what I've been trying to pick up on.  
  
I feel like my decision-making has always been there, but I just had some
lapses and adversity, and things like that. I just stay level-headed, and know
if I keep working everything will work out.  
  
Q. I was hoping PJ would be there so I could ask him, but I'm interested
to see what you think about this. All his facial gestures have really been
getting a lot of attention out there on the court. Does he practice those,
like in front of the mirror? Can you give us some examples of some of your
favorites?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: No, I just like that mean face he makes after a dunk. I think
that's become one of the fan favorites. He doesn't practice them. We only see
those in the game. He doesn't even do them during practice. I think it's a lot
of fun.  
  
Q. If a player is having a good time, do you enjoy watching them or do
you also use it as a little bit of motivation if the other team is talking
that way?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: At the end of the day I feel like everybody can talk on the
court together. We're just going to keep working and keep staying humble no
matter what. We just tend to stay level-headed and just keep working and know
that for us to keep moving on, to go further and further, we just have to be
together as a team.  
  
Q. You say that you haven't really looked at the film of Buffalo. Last
night's game, they came out and they showed more energy and intensity than any
teams that we've seen all year. How do you plan to match their intensity
level?  
QUADE GREEN: Playing our game. Doing what we do best: Match their intensity,
match our intensity, even boost even higher that we're going to win the game.  
  
Q. Have you watched any of the Texas A &M-Buffalo tape, because SEC --  
QUADE GREEN: No.  
  
Q. Secondly, you guys come in, all of you could come in with the
attitude, I'm going to take 16 shots a game. How would you describe Coach
Cal's approach early in the season to get you guys thinking collectively not
individually?  
QUADE GREEN: Everybody can score on our team. 1 through 6 scoring on the
court, everybody can score. It depends who's open, who gets the ball, if
you're open, shoot it. That's how everybody is on this team. Just making the
right play at the right time, that's all.  
  
Q. Young team, first NCAA Tournament last night. How encouraging was it
that it was Hami that got things rolling really early? Have you ever had a
player to be in the hole as deep as he was and trying to climb out?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Not that was a starter. I've had guys in that hole, but they
weren't starting. And we've stuck with him, he's stuck with us. The way he
drove the ball and the things he did. And the other thing you may have missed,
he really did a good job defensively guarding Grady.  
  
Q. Just curious what you think of the way Buffalo played last night
against Arizona, how much you watched of that game tape, and what do you think
of Buffalo? They seemed pretty confident.  
JOHN CALIPARI: If I were on their team I'd feel very confident, too. The way
they played, I watched about six tapes of them, and they remind me of my UMass
teams. Hard-nosed, tough, swagger, chip on their shoulder. I'm a high Major
player, and they are. And my UMass teams went to, I don't know, four or five
Sweet 16s, a couple of Elite 8s, a Final Four, I believe. Some of my people
will check those numbers, but I believe it is.  
  
And that's what I see in them. The ability to score the ball, they score 85
points a game. They play fast. But they're tough defensively. They're not
afraid to mix it up and be physical. And they've got players that come off the
bench and give them a jolt defensively. They've got those kind of players that
are positionless. You play them, and you say he's their 4. He's not their 4.
He's like a 2, 3 playing as a 4.  
  
So their record indicates that what they are, which is they are an outstanding
team. They're well-coached. And we understand it's going to be a hard game.
We're walking in with all freshmen. We know it's going to be a tough game. It
will be a hard one for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the biggest challenge when you have that many
young guys, what's the hardest part?  
JOHN CALIPARI: The first thing you have to understand that young people will
do, and they do this at every level, I would imagine every sport, until you
establish who you are, it's hard to be about the team. They go through the
process of trying to establish themselves. It takes time.  
  
The biggest thing for me is to try to get them to think different. They've
never had to prepare the way they do now. If they played bad it was always
someone else. It was the coach. They never had to take responsibility for
their play. They never had to self-evaluate. They just went on to the next
game, because they had three games in one day. A lot of times they were
enabled by people around them, never held them accountable. They believed they
worked, but they never -- they have to learn all that.  
  
Most of it is a mindset. They can do probably 40 percent -- when they think
they're done, they've got about 40 or 50 percent more in their bodies. But
they've always stopped. I'm done here.  
  
That being said, I've always had veteran players that could talk the young
players through. That's not the case with this team.  
  
I said I've never gotten frustrated, because this has been maybe my most
rewarding season as a coach, to see a group on the edge of the abyss, the look
of terror, the text to me, Coach, we need you more than ever now, to smiling
faces, being about each other, picking each other in the locker room. They
were so happy for Wenyen in the SEC tournament. Seeing that an individual is
playing better, individuals helping their team as they helped themselves.  
  
The last piece of it is they've got to come together and be about each other.
And normally that takes us, the people that have watched my teams until
February. We play okay, but it takes until February before they establish who
they are, start thinking the right way, start preparing the right way. If I
want to change I've got to work and do things different. If I want to be
disciplined on the court I've got to be disciplined off the court. I've got to
do things I don't like to do and then try to do them well. I mean, it's like a
process that every one of these kids go through.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about Georgia hiring Tom Crean?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He and I talked yesterday. I couldn't be more happy for him.
Terrific coach. One of the best. He's into basketball. He loves it. He's about
getting kids better. He's always done it. We've had some good games.  
  
I did tell him I'm taking Georgia off the schedule. He laughed. Said, We're
playing you twice. I said, Not in Athens. No, I'm just kidding. We're playing
in Athens. But I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. During the losing streak a lot of people, myself included, doubted
that you could get this team playing at this level. Given the fact that --  
JOHN CALIPARI: You doubted me?  
  
Q. I doubted you, yes, sir.  
JOHN CALIPARI: And told me that? Why did you tell me? I didn't know. Now I
look at you different (laughter).  
  
Q. Given this team is the youngest in the history of college basketball,
and given the fact that they could revert at any time --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Everybody have followed us closely.  
  
Q. Everybody talks about peaking at the right time. Is it fair to say
that this team is peaking at the right time?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We don't know yet. I'll tell you after tomorrow's game.
Tomorrow's game is: Are you ready to dig your heels in and ready to be strong
with the ball and not make excuses and play harder than the other team? That
means I'm looking at a guy in the eyes and I'm going to play harder than him.
And Buffalo is looking at us and say, No, we're playing harder than you.  
  
Do you know what that ends up being? That is a scrum. Are you willing to play
in the scrum? I love it. I think it's the best. And here's a big part of the
reason: These kids, every experience they go through they're learning, it's
going to help them in the future. And playing in this type of game, it's
wonderful, because there are some guys on the team that have to conquer that.
You can bail out, take a fade away or you can go right at that rim and try to
get fouled. You can play defensively and stay in a stance and here he drives
it, or you can foul him. You can have this look or you can have this look,
which one do you want?  
  
And so this is all good for these kids. I have no idea. What I'd like, and
what's been rewarding, I saw the eyes that you saw in February. But I also
knew they were looking right at my eyes, like how is he taking this? And, you
know, I've been doing this 35 years. 35 years. I've seen everything. We've had
losing streaks. We lost to four NCAA Tournament teams. They were four. They
weren't bad teams. And so I knew we were getting better, and everybody is, Why
are you so calm? Because we are getting better, that's all I can ask of these
guys.  
  
And now that I see what they look like and how they're responding and how
their games are changing, that is rewarding to me. And I'll say it again, of
all the years I've had, this may be the most rewarding for me personally, to
see this team do the things that they're doing.  
  
Q. How about this quote from Nate Oats: Calipari has been whining about
no experience, young, young, young --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Who said that?  
  
Q. Nate Oats. His direct quote. He was excited after the game. We don't
have that problem, we've got some veteran guys. What do you think, just trying
to talk his guys up?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I don't know if it's whining or telling the truth. I'm not
whining about it. I've got a pretty good team. He should not tell the truth.
He should not even say it. Introduce them and don't give their year. That's
fine.  
  
At the end of the day we've got to play a basketball game. Everybody has got
to get in the ring and play.  
  
Q. You've probably been in every single tournament situation but going
into tomorrow, playing a team that's coming off their biggest win in school
history, what kind of challenges does that face for a team that's playing
loose and playing like they have nothing to lose?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We're playing like we have nothing to lose. If we play and they
play, it's probably going to come down to who has the ball last. That happens
in the NCAA Tournament when two teams are fighting.  
  
If they come after us and we back up, they win the game. It's just how it is.  
  
I'll see how the game is being played. I don't know until the game starts. And
then what I have to do to try to keep my team in the game I'll try to do. My
freshmen -- I start five freshmen, by the way. I'm not whining, I'm just
explaining.  
  
Q. How good a leader has Shai been for you this year, and does he remind
you of anybody else you've had?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He's come on for that. And you have to earn that. I hate to
tell you, we won the SEC Championship and the Commissioner said, Who are your
captains? He wanted to give my captains the trophy. I never named captains. I
didn't know who the captains were. I just, You two, come up here.  
  
But he is now becoming that guy because of how he works, how he performs, how
he finishes games. Players are now looking to him. It's the best way is to
have captains kind of evolve versus I'm naming you a captain. I'd rather it be
that way.  
  
Q. Last night Arizona had Deandre, and Perkins is probably four inches
shorter than Deandre, and he was blowing by him. What kind of matchup issues
does Buffalo pose in that lineup that has four guards, and a 6-8 center? And
you and Arizona both have a lot of height. Is that difficult when you're going
against --  
JOHN CALIPARI: They also front the post. They also put unbelievable pressure
on the ball. As much as it's that, you've got to withstand it. They're going
to play. You're not just passing it where you want to pass it. You better get
open and be strong with the ball. If you're in the post you better fight for
the position, because they're not going to give it to you. It's not just
height. It's more battle.  
  
And they've been through it. They won their league. They won their league
tournament a couple of years running now. They're good. This is no -- I'm just
telling you. I've lived it. I had that kind of team. I had guys with chips on
their shoulders. It's fun to coach those guys. I always say when I had a whip
I would talk. I would say stuff, because I had a whip, I knew, they'd back me
up, they'd go play.  
  
It should be fun. It's going to be a hard game.  
  
Q. I don't know if you agree with this, but a lot of higher-seeded teams
might try to shorten the game. Buffalo is 17th in the country in tempo. Do you
agree that they're a little unusual and they use the tempo against everybody
and what do you think of the tempo?  
JOHN CALIPARI: My thing was I thought they were the top 5 in how fast they
were playing, not 17th. And they're creating shots for each other. They're an
unselfish team, too, now. They don't just come down -- they're creating good
shots for each other. They use the lane to create opportunities on the
perimeter. And they've got a lot of mismatch problems.  
  
Q. Do you recall who the player was that sent you the text that said
--  
JOHN CALIPARI: I do.  
  
Q. Can you tell us who it is?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, but I do.  
  
Q. Has it ever happened before? And how much did that drive into you
that you've got to get this right or these kids will never get to where they
should be?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, it's more of how can I feel bad when I've done this for 30
years and been through everything? My focus is going to be on how do they
feel? And that just because they're 6-9 and 6-10 doesn't mean they're grown
men. They have not been through these experiences that I have. And I've got to
keep relating to them that it's okay. And it's okay not to play poorly, if you
self-evaluate and figure out how you're going to change it. If you make
excuses, if you're enabled by the people around you it's not good.  
  
But these kids didn't do that. The people around them didn't do that. They
just kept fighting.  
  
I text with a lot of the guys. I texted today a couple of times with the
entire team. And I'll text each guy and give them something, some thoughts and
stuff. And sometimes I get stuff back. Sometimes not. But hopefully they read
some of it.  
  
Q. I know that the coaches and the players often run into each other in
different settings. With the Buffalo kids, seen any of them outside of
whatever you've been watching the last few days?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No. I don't know if you remember, but when I was at UMass my
team was No. 1 in the country, and we went to Buffalo. Dan Bazzani coached the
team. He said, Come and play at Buffalo. We played at Buffalo in their new
arena. One of the reasons I got to -- I like to talk food, I went to Bacci
Pizza, unbelievable, big square. They had anchor wings, have you ever heard of
them? I said, We'll play in Buffalo, I'm going to have two nights of eating
good food. I'm good.  
  
We played. And I've always had great thoughts. I've had friends of mine who
lived in Buffalo, Art Serotte was a high school coach for years and years and
years, and stays in touch with me now. So I've always liked Buffalo. In August
it's 76 degrees. The rest of us it's 110. In Buffalo it's 76 degrees.  
  
Q. I wonder, you're very animated during games and very into the action.
I wonder if there were coaches you watched coming up that you sort of got that
from how do you try to handle that, not getting too excited?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You are who you are when you're coaching. And I never tried to
be anybody else. But whether it's the guys I played for, Bill Sacco, and Joe
DeGregorio, I thought everyone that went into coaching was Italian for a
while. I didn't learn until I left high school that there were other people
that coached basketball. And then I worked for Larry Brown. I've worked for
great people. Paul Evans.  
  
They were all different. I learned from each of them. But I don't think any of
us in this profession can try to be anybody else.  
  
I wish I was less animated. I wish I was less emotional. But I was born this
way.  
  
Q. I've been sitting here listening to all these other coaches talk
about how much they enjoy the process of seeing their teams develop without
having to worry about the results. At Kentucky you don't have that luxury,
you've got to win every game by 20 points. Do you ever feel cheated that
you're not able to really enjoy --  
JOHN CALIPARI: I enjoy it. No one will steal my joy. I don't read anything.
Has anybody followed me on Twitter. If you do, I don't read what you send
back. 600,000 Facebook, 700,000, a million, I don't read any of it. I send
stuff out. I send pictures out and most of it is trying to help other people.  
  
But my joy is my joy. No one creates it for me and no one will take it away.
I've had many people try to steal my joy. They failed. They failed. If I worry
about people in the seats, what they're saying -- in Kentucky we have four
million coaches, that's how many people live in the state, four million. If I
worry about them I'll be up there sitting with them.  
  
I try to coach my team. And I get great joy. When I don't get that great joy
then I won't do this anymore. I don't feel like I have to do this the rest of
my life and then that's it. I'm really enjoying the players. Very hard turning
over teams like this. Very difficult. And there were times I'd shake my head,
why do I even try this?  
  
And I think back to my teams where I had four years with guys when I was at
UMass. And I wish I had guys for four years. But it's not my rule. And all I'm
trying to do is help the kids and whatever is right for the kids I'll deal
with. They are 19. I am 49. I can deal with it.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you knew Nate Oats at all? Have you recruited any
of his guys at Romulus?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I've been up there and I've recruited some guys up there, yeah.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [T.J. Otzelberger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33061)

### [Mike Daum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30736)

### [David Jenkins Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35078)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Ohio State - 81, South Dakota State - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome South Dakota State.  
  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: That was a very high-level basketball game. A lot of credit
to Ohio State. They played differently than they play each game. They decided
to go small, switch a lot of screens. And credit to Coach Holtmann, he does a
phenomenal job.  
  
Really proud of the young men in our program. We didn't come here for a moral
victory. We certainly didn't come here to lose. At the same time we got
ourselves in tough spots, down 13 in the first half, down 10 in the second
half, and brought it back, which speaks volumes to the character of the guys
I'm fortunate to coach each day. They made more plays down the stretch and
they came out with a win and credit to them.  
  
Q. You were matched up against Bates-Diop a lot of the game, did
anything surprise you?  
MIKE DAUM: Bates-Diop is a great player. For him to be able to shoot the way
he does at the height makes him a tough guard and his ability to take you off
the dribble. When I was on him I tried to keep my chest in front of him and
contest the 3-pointers he was taking.  
  
Q. They go on that 16-0 run, the game looks like out of hand and then
you storm back. What did you do to get back in the game? What does it say
about the team to not give up?  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: Yeah, I mean it just shows the togetherness of our group
of guys. We've been together, we fought through a lot of adversity throughout
the year. And they made their push and then we kind of popped back.  
  
But in the end they hit big shots. You've got to give credit to them.  
  
DAVID JENKINS JR.: We just made sure we kept a fast pace throughout the whole
game. We knew they were bigger, a strong team, we knew we had to go and push
it at them up and down the court. We kept doing that throughout the whole
game. And I feel like that helped us.  
  
MIKE DAUM: It just shows how together our team was, no matter what was going
on in the game, we just always huddled together, kept our game plan, stuck for
each other. And we were able to get ourselves back into it.  
  
Q. I know you had a big first half, 17 points, second half only 10. Were
they doing something to limit you in the second half? Were they making
adjustments guarding you or what were your thoughts on that?  
MIKE DAUM: I think they pressed up more when I was out on the perimeter,
forced me to take more contested 3s than anything else. Then I tried to go in
the paint in the second half. I thought they did a good job of adjusting from
the first half.  
  
Q. When you look back on your season, on your career, how much will it
mean you haven't got a NCAA Tournament win yet?  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: It's awesome that we've made it to three. It's always
going to hurt that we could never get a W in this environment. But I just look
back, the guys I've got to play with and the coaches I've been coached by. I
would not be in any other place than South Dakota State.  
  
Q. Their guard play was really good tonight, the 42 points. How big was
their guard play today and what did you see from the guards?  
DAVID JENKINS JR.: The guard play was really good tonight, and felt like they
really kept a good pace, as well. We tried to keep our chest in front of them.
But the guards stepped in front of the bigs.  
  
Q. A big decision on your future, NBA or otherwise, just take me through
the time line.  
MIKE DAUM: Honestly, I haven't really thought much about it. I've got to kind
of let this settle in for me. I've got to finish my school this year. So make
sure I get my credits all done, and I'll worry about it when it comes down the
line a little bit later.  
  
Q. They run that big 16-0 run but you guys fought back. What were you
able to do to get yourself back in the game and give yourself a chance to win
it there late?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: We've played all year faster style of play. And when you do
that there's runs both ways. We talk about moving on to the next play. We have
a lot of spurtability offensively. Our guys keep their composure, share the
basketball, we know it's going to come back around. Had it happen to us twice
in this game.  
  
Q. Not the time to reflect back on the season as a whole or some of
these individual players' careers, but when you say good-bye to players like
Reed and Lane and Ian, how much have they meant to the program and you as an
individual, and what will be your lasting memory of those three?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I'm thankful for those three. From the first day, they've
been unbelievable teammates and workers, great students and citizens. I've got
a tremendous amount of respect for those three guys, and they'll be missed.  
  
They did something that many of us aren't fortunate enough to do, they came
into a place that experienced success and took it to another level. They'll
always be remembered as a group that left the Jackrabbit jersey in a better
place.  
  
We hope that this is just -- even though they're leaving us in terms of
eligibility, but they're part of our extended family moving forward and we'll
see a whole lot of those three guys.  
  
Q. How much is it going to start to get to this program that you still
haven't won a game in the tournament?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I think our focus will continue to just remain on improving
every day and being at our best. And we're not a program looking at results
driven. We certainly have a high expectation for what we can do and what we
can accomplish. But it's not going to be something that overshadows all these
things these guys have accomplished on the court, in the classroom, in the
community.  
  
Any time you lose it's not what we're in this for. We play to win. But I don't
think that will overshadow what these guys continue to accomplish on a daily
basis.  
  
Q. Did it feel like a home game in there tonight? How much did the fan
support help you guys?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: It was a great feel. It's an awesome college venue. We're
fortunate that we had tremendous fan support. They came out. We've been lucky
with that all year long, loyal fans, and I think a few others maybe jumped in
with us as well, for one reason or another.  
  
I'd like to think our guys showed fight and they're a fun group to pull for.
But it was exciting and our guys certainly fed off that energy.  
  
Q. I know you kind of talked briefly about it, switching to small ball.
C.J. and Kam combined for 42 points, how big were those two in the second
half, how much difficulties did they give your defense there?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: Yeah, they did a tremendous job. Those guys are really good
players. And then certainly Kam at the end stepping up hitting the big 3 and
getting the 4-point play and the foul shots.  
  
They're coached, as you can tell, they're very well schooled and disciplined
and those guys stepped up and made big plays throughout the second half. But
none stand out more in my mind than the ones Kam made that separated them to
get the victory.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Buffalo - 89, Arizona - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Buffalo.  
  
NATE OATS: Can't say enough about our guys, just fought and battled. I felt
like we had a shot; I didn't think we were going to win it like that. I really
felt like we were going to win this game. I liked our guard play, I said it
from day 1.  
  
We felt like maybe we had a bad seed. We thought we were better than that.
Then I told the guys after the initial -- we'll try to get to the second
weekend, whether you beat a 5 as a 12. And then a 4 or 4 first and a 5, let's
go get what they gave us and get it done.  
  
Then the more you looked at them, the more beatable they looked because they
weren't that deep. We play fast. We had great guard play. I thought we could
guard their guards. They had one ball handler. I thought we could do a pretty
good job.  
  
And they've been through a lot of controversy. I thought they've done an
unbelievable job. They won 8 out of their last 9. The only one they lost is
when Trier didn't play and Coach Miller wasn't coaching. I didn't think the
more -- I watch enough Pac-12 games to last myself about five years. Nobody
puts any kind of ball pressure on them. We've got two of the best defensive
guards in the country in Caruthers and Jordan.  
  
I thought they'd come out and pressure and see if they can get the ball to the
two 7-footers with the guards having to handle pressure all night. And they
got it to them enough, but not enough to beat us. So if you look, Ayton had 14
and Ristic had 16. They were 312th in the country in percentage of points from
3. We wanted to make them shoot a lot of 3s. We're fortunate that they shot
2-for-18. And some of that was due to us and some they just missed.  
  
That's a great program that Sean has built, unbelievable program. To get a win
over a program like Arizona, that speaks volumes to our guys. Wes and Jeremy
kind of carried us through the MAC tournament. This is the Third Team All MAC
selection. Supposedly there was five better point guards in the MAC than them.
The other coaches, I guess, didn't want to give them a First Team. Jeremy is a
Second Team All MAC guy. Apparently there are five players better than him in
the MAC. And CJ was First Team. He struggled a little bit in the MAC
tournament. I told him this afternoon, CJ, statistically it's impossible for
you to have another bad game because you're too good of a play. So you're
going to get this thing going tonight. He came out, hit a big 3 right out of
the gate.  
  
Jeremy and Wes got going right away, and felt good. We had to shore some
defensive stuff up and get the turnovers down. After that I felt good about
it. I felt great at halftime. We had 9 turnovers at the half. If we'd quit
turning the ball over we'd be up 10. We only had one in the second half and we
got a pretty good win.  
  
Q. Did you feel a little bit like people didn't understand how good this
team really was?  
WES CLARK: Definitely. With us being the MAC team it's easy to look as a team
that can't compete with a high Major or a team that got four NBA prospects, we
wouldn't be able to compete. But we know deep down, watching enough film,
looked at things, that our confidence was there. We can play with these guys
and play hard.  
  
Q. It was very back and forth in that first half. You guys took over the
second half. What were you guys doing to get separation from them?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I have to give the credit to our coaches, because it was a
great scouting report. And we just followed it for the most part. And did what
we've been doing all year. That's it.  
  
Q. You guys came out shooting incredibly in the second half, shot 64.3
percent from the 3-point. How do you explain how you shoot that well from
3-point?  
WES CLARK: I think it was simple, you just make the shots no matter who was
out there. It's the same kind of shot, still the same basketball, 18 feet --
is it 18 feet?  
  
NATE OATS: 19-9, I believe --  
  
WES CLARK: 20 foot 3-pointer, we had the same confidence and didn't worry
about who was on the defensive end.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: We've been putting in work all year. We always staying after
practice, before practice, late at night, just shooting and getting the shots.
Since we've been here we've been in the gym late at night. We had a shoot-
around this morning. Same shots we've been shooting all year like Wes said.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: It just shows what type of program we have and what type of
guys and coaching staff we have in our program. We are very hard-working guys.
Ever since we've been here we got here early just to get in the gym, get used
to the altitude, and stuff like that. As soon as we got off the plane, went to
the hotel, Let's go hit shots. We just kept pounding it.  
  
Q. When you started you had a small section of Buffalo fans, a small
section of Arizona fans, and as it started picking up in the second half, you
had about 10,000 fans for Buffalo. Talk about that and the motivation it gave
you.  
CJ MASSINBURG: It was amazing. I noticed it at first, when we first got there,
we heard our Buffalo fans, then we went on a run. The whole arena started
erupting. It felt amazing so I guess with Wes Clark there, they thought we
were handsome and they got behind us.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: The same thing as CJ said. We had a little section and then by
the end of the game it seemed like we were in the arena in Buffalo.  
  
WES CLARK: Man, you know, it's the same. It's just the same feeling. We just
took it one play at a time. Everybody likes a nice, hard-working team. So we
just embraced that and tried to play as hard as we can.  
  
Q. One of the things I noticed about your style of play is that you know
exactly what you wanted to do and you stay with it. Where do you get that?
Arizona made a nice little comeback, down 2 going into halftime. They went in
a little bit, and then you took over from there. Where do you get the
relentlessness from?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Man, it comes from the man at the end of the table. He has the
utmost confidence in all his players. We just came in feeling like we belong
there. We belong at this stage. He's not scared of anything, and he puts that
into us. And we follow his lead. He's a relentless person.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: I have to say the same thing. Coach is probably the most
competitive coach I've ever played for. He wants his players to go out and
play the game. If you're a 3-point shooter, he wants you to shoot 3s every
time. If you're a driver, same. Credit to Coach Oats.  
  
Q. You guys busted a lot of brackets tonight. How does that make you all
feel?  
JEREMY HARRIS: That's pretty amazing, I can't even sit up here and lie
(laughter).  
  
Yeah, we did bust a lot of brackets. We kind of knew that we could play with
them. So we went out there with a game plan. We're really happy.  
  
Q. You were here two years ago when this team lost. So what's it like to
be a part of winning the first tournament game, with this being your first
ever NCAA Tournament?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Oh, man, it feels good. Yeah, like you say, we came here two
years ago, we felt like we could have got that one. That one came down to the
last four or five minutes. We just carried over that experience. We did get up
on Arizona like maybe 6 or 4 or something like that, we've got to put our foot
on the gas. We just carried that experience over to here.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: Wes and I were talking late last night -- I won't tell you the
time, because Coach might get mad -- we couldn't sleep because we were so
excited to play. And it's amazing. March Madness is amazing.  
  
WES CLARK: This is a great opportunity for us. We watch it on TV every year.
But for us to be in this type of tournament it was a great opportunity. We
wanted to embrace it. We couldn't sleep, like he said. We were up all night,
thinking about the game, watching film, and thinking about what we had to do
to get a W.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: President Barack Obama, he picked Arizona to beat us. And I
just want to say, President Obama, I'm sorry, but I had to (laughter).  
  
WES CLARK: Should have chose the handsome guys. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. You mentioned it yesterday, did anybody go through a table
celebrating?  
NATE OATS: Search it on Twitter, I'm sure somebody has by now. You Be Naked
Guy maybe, our big fan in Buffalo, probably went through a table.  
  
Q. I confess, I haven't really watched your team play a whole lot this
year. Do they usually play with that amount of effort and intensity? And if
so, how in the world did you lose 8 games during the regular season?  
NATE OATS: Great question, really. Wes Clark transferred from Missouri. We
didn't get Wes eligible until second semester. So we lost five of the non-
conference, three of them without him. And we were down to seven scholarship
players, one of them we had to pull off the football team, Dominic Johnson. We
didn't have enough players. We lost to Cincinnati and South Dakota State, who
everybody saw play here.  
  
We got Wes back, we were up one at Syracuse, and ended up losing it. That was
his first game in 22 months. We had to travel to Texas A&M, it was the travel
day from hell. And we were still in that game with three minutes to go, and
lost that. We lost to St. Bonaventure, who is playing -- they're playing
tonight. I don't know if they won it. Did they win or not? Oh, they lost? But
they're a pretty good team, too.  
  
And then we got in conference. Conference play sometimes -- we had some
injuries. Caruthers missed a month and a half with a stress fracture, and he's
basically been playing the game. We shot 11 of 26 at the free throw line in
one game.  
  
We do play that hard all the time. We've given ourselves a blue collar
mentality, we give out a hardhat after every game. We have charges, floor
dives, loose balls, deflections, we tally up the whole thing, and give the
hardhat out to whoever wins the blue collar points we call them.  
  
We were 7th in the country in scoring. But we score off our defense. So we
keep preaching defense, defense, defense. It was pretty good tonight.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about some of your ideas of how to slow down
Deandre. Talking about it and doing it are two completely different things.
Are you at all shocked at how well you guys were able to slow him down and
almost made him look like a normal human being at points?  
NATE OATS: No, because our bigs do a great job. Our guards do a great job.
He's really good, but you can take a big out of the game in college. It's not
that hard. There's no three seconds in the lane. You can pack a guy, sit right
behind him the whole time. You can't take a guard out. You can't take Wes
Clark out of the game. The thing was if Trier got hot, Jackson caught fire, we
knew they were going to have to miss some 3s. It's not that we don't have guys
with size. We have 6-10, 6-8. Jeremy is long, he's got length.  
  
So I might be a tad surprised with how well it went but no, we've been able to
take bigs out all year with how well we play.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Wes Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34993)

### [Demetrius Troy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35062)

### [Francis Alonso](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34995)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome UNCG.  
  
WES MILLER: Well, I don't think I could be prouder of my group. We're 0-13 in
the first half, 3-8 from the free throw line and we're in a three-possession
game at halftime. And I think that says a lot about the toughness we've had
all year, the grit that we've had all year. So I felt really fortunate because
I felt we got pretty good looks in the first half, maybe we had to kick some
jitters off.  
  
In the second half I thought things opened up for us offensively. The ball
started going through the basket. And certainly in the first half James Dickey
kind of kept us in it. I thought he was in a good rhythm offensively. Probably
could have done a better job getting him the ball in the second half.  
  
In the second half Demetrius and Francis got us going with the plays, not just
for themselves but for other guys. And then our defense wasn't what it wanted
to be, especially to start the second half. But I thought we had some tough
possessions, just to go get 50/50 balls. There were a couple of scrums around
the basket and you always kick yourself and go "what if"; what if we came up
with that one or this one.  
  
But I thought our fight to the ball was pretty good. We'll always think about
that last minute or so and think kind of "what if." I could have made some
better play calls. I changed the play call coming out of the timeout. And I
put Francis in a really tough position. I think if I kept the first one it
wouldn't have been scouted and we might have got a better look and not turned
it over.  
  
And then I think for these young guys, the guys that will be returning, we can
build on the fact that we had all off season we've been a good defensive team,
but we can get better. We had a lead, two possessions to get stops to win a
game. And we gave up five points in those two possessions.  
  
There are some things we can learn from and build on, but I couldn't be
prouder.  
  
Q. The play late in the second half where the ball skimmed off the rim
and they didn't reset the clock, how did that happen?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: To be honest, I didn't really even notice it. All I hear is
guys from the benches yelling at me, You've got to shoot, you've got to shoot
the ball. We kept playing. And I think that play didn't really affect us as a
team in the last stretch of the game.  
  
For me personally, I could have guarded the ball better in the last two
possessions, and we could have had a better chance to win the game. But
absolutely that play didn't affect us for the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Mark Few said he was surprised how well you were able to penetrate
and score. Your thoughts on why that was working so well and how much of a
difference that made today?  
DEMETRIUS TROY: Well, I think it worked really well. Coach Miller gives us a
lot of freedom to just play very freely and open and confidently. And Coach
was just giving us a lot of great play calls for us to be able to get into the
lane. And we were able to continually get down there and make things happen.
So we just kept going along with what was working.  
  
Q. The play with 20 seconds left where they called the foul on you, what
was that play supposed to be? Take me through that sequence, what happened
there.  
FRANCIS ALONSO: You're talking about coming off the screen and they called an
offensive foul? Well, I was hearing from the Gonzaga bench that they knew the
play. So I was trying to set up a ball screen for me. The guy stepped on my
feet. I was leaning into him. The ref called charge for some situations that
had happened during the game. And you can't control that.  
  
And I'm still frustrated by the defensive stops that I didn't get, guarding
the ball. And the last possession, and those situations, there are things that
I can control as a player. But absolutely that call, it was -- that was a
ref's decision so I couldn't blame them.  
  
Q. Not making the 3-pointer in the first half, he said you had some
looks. How would you assess what wasn't working in getting those shots falling
in the first half?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: Of course playing against a great team as Gonzaga and making
wide open 3s or good looks is going to hurt you by the end of the game. Some
3s went in and out, but it happens. We stayed true to our values on the
defensive aspect of the team. We knew that some shots aren't going to go in.
And it happened today, unfortunately.  
  
But we fought, as Coach said, in a defensive aspect on the other side of the
court. And we kept competing. We kept competing as a team and we didn't give
up. So we've got to be proud of that. Of course, really sad because we didn't
have our day offensively.  
  
Q. You have only one senior in your starting lineup -- two seniors in
your starting lineup. What can this team build for next season, and how
encouraging is it that you'll have players coming back?  
WES MILLER: We hit on that in the locker room. We've really worked hard to try
to build culture on a day-to-day basis in our program. And I told our guys in
the locker room that our seniors from last year, Diante Baldwin and R.J.
White, were probably really proud watching them play in the NCAA tournament.
And for the returning guys, Jordy Kuiper and Marvin Smith and Garrett Collins
and Justin Jordan, our seniors this year, be really proud if we can take a
step forward and keep growing our program.  
  
So we do have the opportunity to keep growing and moving forward. And I'm
excited about the young guys in our program and the returning guys. These two
guards sitting up here today, they're pretty darned good players, they'll be
seniors next year. Hopefully we can continue to try to grow one at a time.  
  
Q. You said you put Francis in a tough position. I know there were two
possessions, the offensive foul and one where he was really behind the eight
ball trying to get a shot off. But I just wanted to get your breakdown of what
happened on those.  
WES MILLER: We had the ball there and I looked up and there's 50 seconds or so
on the clock. And we were struggling to guard him in the second half. I felt
like we were searching at times. And I felt like we tried the zone a little
bit. We were trying to mix up how we were playing the post.  
  
But I felt like sometimes we were lucky, they missed some quality 3s. I
thought we really guarded in the first half. I didn't think we were as good
defensively. So I looked up and it's a feel thing, sometimes I've gone two for
one with this team, sometimes I haven't. I looked up and said, man, we can go
two for one.  
  
I want the ball in Francis's hand, we needed a basket, we give him the ball
and give him space. We set a high ball screen, and I wanted to get the two-
for-one opportunity, which we did, but I don't think he got a great look and I
probably sped him up a little bit. And then coming out of the timeout there
after Norvell hit the big three. Again, I had the call, the same set, and I
changed it to another call in the set. The one that I changed it to they had
scouted and I put him in a tough position.  
  
I don't think any of our calls are were bad calls, but you think "what if," I
think that's what you do in this situation as a player and coach. People say,
man, you were pretty gutsy when you threw the lob, we were up two, but they
were starting to really extend on pin-downs.  
  
I love Demetrius and James, they've connected on a lot of lobs this year. And
we weren't going to be afraid tonight, we were going to come out swinging.
People might think that's a gutsy call, I thought James would call it, and
come down with it, there might have been a little contact there, we have to
look at the film. We didn't execute in the last minute and a half, and we'll
have to go through the film and look at that.  
  
Q. Two things about James, you pulled him about 90 seconds into the
game. What did you talk about? Were you surprised how well he got off the
block offensively against a team that's long and tall?  
WES MILLER: You mean 90 seconds in the first half? He gave the tired signal
which is why he came out there early. I thought he was in a great rhythm
offensively. Our team was in a good rhythm offensively. We got quality shots,
we just couldn't seem to make them. But he was the one guy that had it going a
little bit.  
  
The last two or three weeks he's been sped up a little bit on offense, he's so
excited, plays with such good energy. I thought he had slowed down around the
basket tonight and that's who he's been most of the year. But maybe he was
just a little too excited.  
  
Tonight he was really under control with the ball there. We're not even in the
game in the first half offensively if it's not for him. He was tremendous
tonight. He's been defensive player of the year in the Southern Conference.
You look now and he's got 11 rebounds tonight and I thought he was a factor
defensively. He's a tremendous young player, and we're fortunate he'll be back
for the next two years.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about the problems they present for you in the
post. You out-rebounded this team tonight. How pleased were you with that
effort and particularly the effort inside from your guys?  
WES MILLER: I thought we had to do that to give ourselves a chance. I thought
we made a great effort to get the ball in the second half. I don't think we
guarded as well, I don't think it was from lack of effort, they're just a
really good team. Give them the credit. They can execute offense, so we were
struggling.  
  
But the one thing I think we did was we pursued the ball well. My favorite
play of the night was Marvin going for a loose ball, gets knocked to the
ground. Sometimes that's frustrating, you thought you had it, you get knocked
off your position, he just sprints up and goes and gets a big-time rebound in
traffic.  
  
I thought we had an edge in the second half to go get the ball, even though I
thought they were in good rhythm offensively.  
  
Q. Mark talked about how essential he thought it was that they guarded
the three. He also said he thought you guys were exceptionally efficient at
driving for 2s in the second half. Did you emphasize in any particular way
dribble penetration as a reaction to what they were trying to do to you?  
WES MILLER: We're a spread team. We try to open the floor up and let the guys
go. We like to shoot the 3. We got 22 looks, and I venture to think that 18 of
them were pretty good looks for us. But the one thing we did really emphasize
was being strong with the ball and we did drive. We thought we could drive it.
But they're good at coming in and getting deflections. We saw that on tape. We
drilled it this week. We talked a lot about it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Dusan Ristic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32916)

### [Parker Jackson-
Cartwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33080)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Buffalo - 89, Arizona - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Arizona.  
  
SEAN MILLER: Well, we knew we had a very tough draw. We knew we were playing
an excellent basketball team. And the team, quite frankly, that we didn't
necessarily match up well with. We prepared hard but we ran into a team that
played well on a night where we didn't. They certainly had a lot to do with
that.  
  
But it's difficult to exit the tournament the way we have because it doesn't
shed light on a lot of the great moments, a lot of the things especially these
two guys have fought hard to establish on a season that represented 27 wins
and the Pac-12 tournament, regular season championship. All that goes away
when you lose in the tournament, but in particular lose in the first round the
way we did.  
  
It wasn't a lack of effort, certainly wasn't a lack of wanting to advance. We
got beat. And we got beat by a good team. A well-coached team. A team that was
tough.  
  
And the second half -- we didn't play well in the first half to be down 2. I
think we felt like we had been in that situation many times, but they
overwhelmed us in the second half. We struggled on offense and on defense. And
clearly all credit to Buffalo. They did a great job.  
  
Q. You guys represent two of the winningest players that this program
has ever had. Could you take me through your emotions right now in what's got
to be a particularly disappointing time?  
DUSAN RISTIC: Like you said, it's a disappointing time for us. We didn't
expect to lose this tournament. And the last four years, like, doesn't feel
good right now. It's frustrating. It's something we didn't expect.  
  
PARKER JACKSON-CARTWRIGHT: It really doesn't seem real right now. And for our
team, just disappointed.  
  
Give them credit. They played really well. Did a good job.  
  
Q. The Buffalo coach talked about how part of his plan was to pressure
the guards and he felt that was an effective strategy. Did you notice more
pressure, like defensive pressure than most teams had played on you this
year?  
PARKER JACKSON-CARTWRIGHT: Yeah. They were physical from the start of the
game, which kind of got us out of rhythm, particularly on offense. The
pressure on not just myself but all our guards made it tough on us.  
  
Q. Can you just take me through your emotions in terms of the course and
way you took this season, the ups and downs, and for it all to come to an end
tonight?  
PARKER JACKSON-CARTWRIGHT: We endured a lot from the beginning. People kind of
wrote us off. And I thought we responded every time that happened. We kind of
fought through everything. People were writing about us or tearing us down. We
felt like coming into tonight we were playing good basketball, and for it to
end like this is just really disappointing.  
  
Q. Deandre just now said that the biggest thing he got out of the season
was a real appreciation for you, for how hard he had to play game in and game
out. He said that he really didn't think he understood what that represented
until he came here. Could you talk a little about where he was versus where he
is now?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes, you know, Deandre superceded any expectation that I could
have ever had for him. He was an incredible teammate. Worked hard every day.
Played for the win. The way our team is made up and we've fought all year with
this, when you play two 7-footers, one of the two 7-footers has to do some
extraordinary things on defense. And that's part of what I saw Buffalo play.  
  
I knew it was going to be a tough draw for us because Harris is so good. And
it's what they do every game. They exploit that matchup.  
  
But with Deandre as fine of a kid as we've had and an extraordinary player, I
hate to see him go out in the first round. It's not his fault, really. He had
13 and 14. I thought Buffalo pressured us and took us out of some things and
negated some of the things that he's done all season long. But for anybody to
not remember Deandre as the greatest freshman that ever walked through
Arizona, they weren't paying attention, statistically and just the type of kid
he is. He's destined to go do some great things.  
  
When you get someone like him, you want to go all the way, right? And when you
lose in the first round that's a tough pill to swallow. But he was fantastic.
He's one of a kind.  
  
Q. Deandre has looked superhuman at points this year. You mentioned that
you knew it was going to be a tough draw, because of how Buffalo plays. Were
you surprised at how well they were able to slow him down?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes. Even him. He might not have had his A game. But I thought
their pressure decimated us. It was 40-38 at the half. And kind of the way our
team played this entire season, we've been more of a second half group than a
first half. And a lot of times, in the first four minutes of the second half
we really get going.  
  
The opposite happened tonight. And that's to Buffalo's credit. The stat sheet
is one that you don't oftentimes see in that they had two players had 20 made
field goals. They were 15 of 30 from the 3-point line. We were 2 for 18. Their
guard play, their pressure defense, you know, they really took it to us.  
  
The other thing is, Perkins can make a couple of 3s in addition to what they
already have, especially against us. That means their 5 and their 4 are making
3s. UCLA gave us problems with that. That was one of our losses. And the way
they utilize their bigs, I mean they're very difficult to defend and yet at
the same time they play tremendous defense. They did a great job. They beat us
hands down from start to finish.  
  
Q. Two years ago Wichita State kind of came out similarly to Buffalo.
Besides losing the first round, can you explain your emotions going through
the course of the season and what you're feeling right now?  
SEAN MILLER: This game feels a lot like Wichita. Wichita, they had those
guards and they pressured us, and they were physical and an excellent team.
Buffalo, excellent team, physical, pressured us and both of our first-round
exits had that in common.  
  
You know, in terms of my emotions, I'm not going to change. I'm taking things
a day at a time. Obviously this is a tough day. And we have to move forward.
My thoughts are more with our players right now. It's not easy to win the
Pac-12 Tournament in the regular season, overcome a lot, get here to the
tournament finally and not play well and get beat like we got beat. But that's
part of sports.  
  
Q. Along those lines, how do you think this season will be remembered
two or three years from now?  
SEAN MILLER: I don't know. I can only go on what we've done. We're 27 and 8.
We made the tournament. We got beat by I think a really good team. Didn't play
well. They had a lot to do with it.  
  
Let me just say this: We worked hard to be ready for the game. The guys
practiced hard. When you go three games in three days in a conference
tournament you're a little bit banged up. So we tried to be smart in our
approach. But our intention was good. We just didn't have it tonight. And
Buffalo deserves a lot of credit.  
  
Q. There were a lot of stretches where Deandre did not touch the ball.
And it resembled when they lost in Oregon. How do you guys not give him the
ball?  
SEAN MILLER: Buffalo did a great job. They did. They pressured our guards.
They took us out of a lot of things. Deandre in the first half had zero
offensive rebounds, so that was part of the story. Obviously he came alive in
the second half. He had five offensive rebounds. We as a group didn't get him
the ball. But it wasn't like we didn't know that.  
  
I think sometimes you have to give the defense and the other team the credit.
They were able to pressure us at a level that hasn't happened very often. And
Deandre's averaged 20 and 10, 20 and 11. I think in the last two or three
weeks he's probably closer to 26, 28 points, 15 rebounds. So we've established
that we can get him the ball.  
  
Tonight it wasn't as if we got away from him; it was just that the other team
did a great job. I'll use the analogy of a great wide receiver. If the pass
rush and the blitzes just continues to get to the quarterback, then that
receiver is not going to get as many catches or opportunities. And tonight in
the basketball terms their ball pressure, taking us out of our ability to get
him the ball, and it certainly played to their advantage and they deserve a
lot of credit.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE.)  
SEAN MILLER: He's frustrated because his career is ending. He wanted to keep
playing.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Will Magarity](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35087)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 78, Davidson - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Davidson College.  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Congratulations to the University of Kentucky. They made life on
both the defensive end and the offensive end difficult.  
  
I have such incredible gratitude to the Davidson players for the way they made
this one of the most joyful seasons of my life. To see them cap off the season
with a NCAA berth and then go toe-to-toe with a storied school like Kentucky
gives me great pride as well as the great joy. And it's a memory I'll treasure
forever.  
  
Q. John just said that he was obviously extremely concerned, as you
expect, with the 3-point shooting. And he felt it was essential to use their
length to get up on you guys, more than they might against a typical team.
Could you talk a little about that and to what extent you thought that
affected you tonight?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Yeah, they're a very long team. And tonight I thought I got
some open looks early on, even later on they didn't fall. They did a good job
of knowing where I was at and trying to close out every time I saw the ball.  
  
Q. Looking back at the season and your careers at Davidson, how are you
going to look back at this four years ten years from now?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: This has been one of the best four years of my life. I
couldn't be any more proud of the Davidson community, Davidson College. It
means everything to me. They're my family. I love each and every one of the
guys, each and every one of the coaches. You'll never be able to take Davidson
College away from me.  
  
WILL MAGARITY: I decided to come here from -- when I transferred in. The first
day I was here I knew right away this was family. This is a different program.
The way that Coach really instills trust, commitment, and care every single
day. It's hard work, but we love what we do. And I think this season is an
accumulation of everything and is really the peak of it. I'll treasure this
for the rest of my life.  
  
Q. What sort of difficulties did Kentucky present defensively that you
might not have otherwise seen this season, if any?  
BOB McKILLOP: I think the ability to defend the rim, to take away maybe four
or six layups that we normally would have had. And with taking away the rim
they were still able to close out on our shooters at the arc. So I would say
in the first half there were four or five layups that came up empty. And in
fact, led to baskets by them.  
  
I felt their break on the ball, which was very deceptive. They're not a denial
team, but they have the ability to close space very quickly. And there were, I
think, three occasions they closed space very quickly, got steals and baskets.
When you add it all up, that's the game right there. This was a two-possession
game, and we ran out of time.  
  
Q. Early in the game it seemed like your team was focusing getting back
on defense. But partway through the game you were crashing the board. Was that
a change in the game plan or what was the decision?  
BOB McKILLOP: It wasn't a change. A few more of the balls were going through
the net. We did a much better job of tipping out long rebounds, and I think
that was where the offensive rebounds occurred on the tip-outs, much more so
than securing them and going back up with them. But I thought that the ball
went through the net a little bit more the second half.  
  
Q. I'm more fascinated with this than anyone, but Kentucky did not make
a three tonight. Did you know that?  
BOB McKILLOP: We sure did. And that was a point of emphasis. And may have
caused us the problem of sending them to the line as much as we did. And
having them score points in the paint as much as they did. The point of
emphasis was on a couple of their shooters, but not to the point of not being
connected. And I thought we had such a sense of urgency about covering their
shooters that we didn't stay connected on penetration. And there were several
penetrations that we should have had much more help, which we didn't, because
we were concerned about the shooters.  
  
Q. Along the same lines, it's so rare, would you have almost always bet
the house that if you held any team without a three that you would win?  
BOB McKILLOP: Well, when they send them to the line for 32 shots and they make
80 percent of them, you're putting yourself in jeopardy right away. And you
give them a couple of undefended baskets with turnovers, you're talking about
35 points right there. And that 35 points in a 5-point game is very pivotal.  
  
I'd also like to make one comment. The fans in Boise, the hospitality here in
Boise, the people that worked, the police department, the people in our hotel
absolutely sensational. I could not be more impressed, felt more a sense of
belonging here, welcomed here. And, boy, it's going to leave a lasting memory
with our players, with our program and with our coaches because the people of
Boise are just absolutely sensational. So thanks to them.

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Kam Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35077)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Ohio State - 81, South Dakota State - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ohio State.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Listen, we have a lot of respect for South Dakota State. And I
think our preparation certainly defensively, certainly defensively was on
point. We did not always have as good of attention to detail as we needed to
against them. They're a matchup nightmare in a lot of ways. And I give them a
lot of credit for how they played. I just thought they kept battling. They had
the benefit of the crowd behind them. It got loud for them.  
  
But our guys responded and came down the stretch. Players win games, and they
did that.  
  
Q. You shot 40 3-pointers, today, was that in the game plan?  
KAM WILLIAMS: I'm going to say yeah, but not really. We knew if we got the
ball we'd get rotations to drive to the basket. We were taking what the
defense was giving us. We forced a couple of them. Once we got settled down we
were able to execute like we were supposed to.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: It wasn't really in the game plan, but the game kind of
called for it. We had good shooters and for the most part had good shots.  
  
Q. It had been a couple of seasons since this team had been to the NCAA
Tournament. What did it feel like getting back here?  
KAM WILLIAMS: Amazing. Ohio State's been in a drought. And myself, JT,
everybody on the team, Kaleb, we've been hungry for this moment. The coaching
staff has been preaching to us: Embrace the moment. You never know when you're
going to make it back here.  
  
So just embracing the moment and just hopefully we can go as far as we can.  
  
Q. You talked about it yesterday, you finally were matched up against
Mike Daum. What was that like and was it what you thought it was or did he do
anything to surprise you?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: It was about what I thought it was. It was a tough matchup
because of his size. He's a tough matchup, but everything we expected. We did
a great job scouting.  
  
Q. The corner 3 they made when you had a guy in your face, you made it
and get the shot to go down, and then scored the next seven points.  
KAM WILLIAMS: I give the coaching staff the credit. They called the play for
me. They had enough confidence to do that down the stretch. And as hard as I
worked, my confidence is never going to be shot. So as soon as I let it go I
felt like it was going to go in and it just went in. It just felt great. And
everything just kind of got rolling from there.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a game there's a lot of talk about whether the
long break would be helpful or hurtful. Do you have any opinion on the impact
of the longer break?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I feel like it was good, just because we fine-tuned some
things, especially on defense. We had a lot of time to get back to basics and
defensive principles specifically. But I did think it helped and we won the
game.  
  
KAM WILLIAMS: I think it definitely benefited us. Because the way we went out
in the Big Ten tournament, that made us more hungry. So we had to fix little
tweaks that we had in the games previous. Once we did that and we got our game
plan together we felt like we'd be here for a while.  
  
Q. In that second half it seemed like they were maybe about to go on a
run, what did you do during that one run to put separation between you guys?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Tried to stay poised. It's a game of ups and downs and runs.
We went on a run obviously and just kind of played our game.  
  
Q. What do you remember about your game with Gonzaga?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Like you said, it was a long time ago. We're two completely
different teams, especially us. I remember they were obviously big and long.
But they killed us on the big point shooting, I'm pretty sure. That was months
ago. And not even close to the same team.  
  
KAM WILLIAMS: We're nowhere near the team we were back then. We've progressed
in so many different areas. And the whole team is excited for this one. We've
been wanting this matchup ever since the bracket came out. Hopefully when they
take the court they'll feel us, because they didn't feel us in the first game.  
  
Q. Everyone knows about you're the Big Ten player of the year. But what
was it like seeing Kam and CJ have a monster game. In the second half they
seemed to take over the second half. What was it like to see those two players
and what do they mean to the team?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I wasn't surprised at all. This isn't like a one-man team in
any sort of way. I trust Kam to shoot the shots he took, and CJ to do what he
did. I get a lot of credit sometimes, but this is a team, this is a great
team.  
  
Q. Were you surprised when you looked at the stat sheet and saw 40
3-point attempts?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It's not really who we are. It wasn't the game plan. It's
really difficult because they're literally giving you tee-up 3s. I think they
knew we liked to play inside out. And they were taking away all the interior
stuff that we wanted to do. We have got -- probably could have shot about 8 or
9 of those 3s, honestly.  
  
If we were at 30 or 32 -- it's a tough thing as a coach where you're trying to
figure out, Are we going to get a better shot than a wide open 1, 2, step 3?
And talking to coaches in the past we knew they were going to play us like
that here. We didn't always make the ones that we had open. But certainly 40
is too much for us.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Kam's role, 7 points and kind of iced the
game and talk about his play down the stretch.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It was great. One of the assistant coaches, Ron, we had a call
on an action we run for him. We were struggling there late, we were saying,
Somebody has to make a play, and someone has to take an open look and make an
open shot. And he's that kind of a kid. He wants the ball in his hands in
those moments. And he's got that look in his eye.  
  
And I thought Keita did a nice job screening for him, and Dakich did a nice
job tipping out. When he gets the offensive rebound the bench is screaming,
Pull it out, pull it out. When you have a guy that can shoot it like him, I
don't know if you're going to turn the off switch there in that moment. I was
happy he took that shot and got fouled.  
  
Q. Dakich never left the floor in the second half. What did you think of
his performance?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Good. Andrew has given us a lot of quality minutes, he's glued
our team and connected our team in a lot of ways. Missed some open looks, had
some defensive errors. But Andrew has been terrific for us. And he was
terrific again tonight, he really was.  
  
It's hard for me to -- I don't know if I'd have thought this going in the
season, but when we put him out there a lot of times he's hard to pull off the
floor.  
  
Q. In the second half it was pretty tight. But you ran that 16-0 run.
How big was that run for you to set the tone of the game in the second half?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You can't get a whole lot of separation from these guys. I'd
watched them against Wichita State and Colorado and Ole Miss and Iowa. It's
hard to get separation from them. They're so proficient.  
  
So to get a little bit of separation and then kind of keep them at bay, and we
knew it could get tight late, again, I think we anticipated a road-type
environment. I don't know that we anticipated that it would be quite as loud
as it got. Maybe I should have prepared them more for that. It was great to
see our guys respond.  
  
Q. How does the fact that you played Gonzaga earlier this season affect
your preparation for Saturday?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Two different teams a lot of ways right now. I've got so much
respect for them after playing them. I'd never coached against a Gonzaga team
before. Mark does such a fantastic job. They're physical. They're tough.
They're very talented. I thought that they're one of the top one or two teams
we played all year. They are one of the very best teams we played all year.
And they handed it to us. So we'll go back and we'll watch that.  
  
How much they've changed and we've changed, I don't know, because I didn't
follow them as much. But they smacked us around pretty good.  
  
Q. Daum, in the second half you did a better job containing him. Did you
feel you did a better job limiting what he could do?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, obviously you did. But I didn't think we did a terrible
job in the first half. We probably weren't as good -- we left him open a
couple of times off of offensive rebounds and then had a couple of slip-ups.
He's just a really, really good player. Man, he's a really good player. And
when he gets driving it downhill he's a low 2 because of his size.  
  
But I thought our attention to detail was a little better in the second half
and we had probably about four errors with him in the first half and then the
second half we had maybe one or two.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Gonzaga.  
  
MARK FEW: It was a heck of a ballgame. We sit up here and feel very fortunate
to advance and to win. But at the same time I'm proud of how my guys just hung
with it and hung with it and hung with it. We knew it was going to be kind of
that pace of a game, that's all UNCG plays. And I think we just made enough
plays down the stretch to hold them off.  
  
But, man, I thought they were really, really good. And I thought they were
really good down the stretch. The guards hurt us with the penetration. And yet
we were guarding them very, very well. And they were able to make some very
difficult shots against some of our switches on the ball screens. Our guys
kept their poise and continued to get good shots through all that. Made one
more play than they did. We're fortunate to advance.  
  
Q. This isn't your first tournament. Just talk about the battle you just
went through.  
JOSH PERKINS: I'm still shaking, still sweating, but I'm just glad I'm here
with these guys and coaching staff. This is my first tournament, but I'm just
glad I'm here with this group of guys, my brothers.  
  
Q. The shot at the end of the game, can you talk about that?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: For sure. I'm a really confident guy. And the coaching staff
and all the guys around me put the confidence in me. I don't know how many
shots I missed tonight but every time I missed all the guys came to me, The
next one is going in, the next one is going in. So I had no choice but to make
a bucket.  
  
Q. On that shot it seemed like you were feeling it. You saw the open
window and you took it. Walk us through the play and why you felt so
confident.  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Throughout the whole game they were trying to get over the
ball screens really good and they were showing really high, as well. So I knew
if I tried to get over really hard and I was able to knock the shot down.  
  
Q. You had the shot to tie the game. What was going through your mind?
What were you trying to say and the emotions you're behind and 30 seconds it
all turned back around?  
JOSH PERKINS: They were all over the place. I looked at the coach and said,
We've got this. I trust you and we're trusting each other.  
  
I'm glad I'm here with this guy and we're not done yet.  
  
Q. What was the crowd like and what was it like having them behind you
tonight?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: It was great. Anytime you have Zag fans that can travel like
that and have our back, and when we got down, they didn't sit down at all.
They kept us going.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: It's nice when it felt like a home game out there for us. A lot
of credit to them and hope we can keep doing it Saturday.  
  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: We have the best fans in the country, probably in the
world. We appreciate them coming out and supporting us. They did an awesome
job.  
  
Q. From the first three minutes you had three turnovers. Was it jitters
or their defense? And if it was the defense, how did you push through that
down the stretch?  
JOSH PERKINS: I don't know. I can't answer that question. I'm just glad we
didn't keep that train going. If it was jitters, we got rid of it. I'm glad we
got rid of them.  
  
Q. What's going to have to improve for Saturday?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's direct the questions to the student-athletes and then
we'll go to the coach.  
  
Q. The matchup between you and James Dickey was entertaining in the
first half. What does he present from a length perspective, and why was it
rubbing off on the other guys?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: It wasn't just him. It was also other guys, as well. And
32, he had a big body. As far as Dickey, he's long and athletic and he can
jump. He made it tough for us.  
  
But we was able to make the shots down the stretch. He played awesome game. I
give him a ton of credit.  
  
Q. What made you calm enough to play Perkins after four fouls?  
MARK FEW: Basically out of necessity. He's essentially the only point guard we
have, and they were pressing us. But also there's some trust built up after
being with him, around him for four years. So it's a combination of probably
both of those.  
  
Q. You've done this a few times now, ten in a row. Does it get any
easier? What were you telling the team when Greensboro was making the run?  
MARK FEW: No, it doesn't get any easier. These first-round games are hard.
They're really hard. And I think people get a little misled when they see the
seed numbers up there.  
  
That's a really, really good team that we were fortunate enough to beat. They
were a very good defensive plan that kind of never quite let you get the flow.
I think we were able to get flow a couple of times there, especially in the
start of the second half and around that eight- to ten-minute mark.  
  
But I kept telling our guys to stay with it, stay with it, stay with it. We
were taking great care of the ball down the stretch. And we were actually
getting good shots on goal. I just felt like we weren't quite finishing them,
even the ones that led up to the three. It was a very good play. I think
somebody else had a jump shot that was a great shot for our team offense.  
  
I think the thing that probably most surprised us is their guards finished 2s
in the paint better than we saw on film or better than we had seen them do all
year. We went into the game trying to held them from the 3-point line, went 3
for 22, we out free-throwed them 13-5. But they made two.  
  
So that's when you tip your hat to them. They did a heck of a job making some
really tough shots.  
  
Q. What's impressed you about the confidence? Josh had it and Jack had
it, too. Making shots like that, and they felt they had a chance.  
MARK FEW: Those two are really confident players. It's probably more so than
anybody in our program have a high belief in themselves and at times that can
hurt us. But at times, especially down the stretch of the game when obviously
pressure is up a little bit and somebody has to step up and make a play,
that's when you want those two guys.  
  
Perkins has hit shots like that for us. Last year he hit them and this year he
hit him. And Norvell has a knack for that. When you size the guy up, A, he was
going to shoot it, and B, it was probably going to go in. So I was fine with
it.  
  
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about Zach? He was a red shirt last
year. And he had to sit there and watch a lot of your great stuff happening.
How did he deal with it?  
MARK FEW: I think he had some knee problems all through the summer and into
the fall. And then I think reality hit him. And he was a little bit behind
with everything. But he was looking at a back court that had Perkins, who had
been a two-year starter, Nigel Williams-Goss, he was a preseason All-American,
Jordan Mathews, who was a grad transfer who had unbelievable success,
especially shooting the ball like Zach does at Cal. And then Silas was
obviously going to play a lot of minutes because he's such a good defensive
player.  
  
So I think he understood that. And he's got a winning spirit about him. He has
an effervescence and charisma that is much needed with this team, because it's
a really quiet, introverted team, and he's certainly not any of that. He
provides not only that stuff on the floor, but off the floor is very
important.  
  
Q. Obviously first tournament game for Zach. Just talk about the
confidence you had in him making that shot.  
MARK FEW: Well, he's done it a lot. He's really done that time and time again
this year. And it might have happened in the first half when someone is on a
10-0 run against us and we're really struggling, or five minutes to go in a
game and they've shrunk our lead from 15 down to 7. And he's just wired to --
he's going to make a play. Now, sometimes it's a bad play and sometimes it's a
bad shot. But usually down the stretch of games he's confident enough and it
usually goes in.  
  
But prior to that shot, guys, he was 2 for 11. So it wasn't exactly one of his
greatest games in the Zag uni. I felt totally confident. When he sized it up I
knew it was going in. And that's kind of what he does.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Kevin Knox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34916)

### [Shai Gilgeous-
Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34914)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 78, Davidson - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome University of Kentucky.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: It was a good one for this young team. First time they've been
in the NCAA Tournament, not knowing what to expect. If you come out to play
the way we did in the second half, our season will be over. The way they
played in the second half, I thought defensively, to play a team that's as
efficient and an execution team like Davidson, this young team did pretty
good.  
  
And we had some breakdowns late and I got upset with a couple of the guys,
based on the fact that you cannot do what you're choosing to do. We're a team
and you cannot just break off. They're freshmen, and they're learning. We're
learning game to game now. Every one of these experiences is new.  
  
Kevin made some shots, Sacha is playing better and better, and he made shots,
and Shai controlled the game at the end to take us over the finish line,
barely.  
  
Q. You brought up yesterday that the main thing that you saw on tape was
the 3-point shooting. Was there anything in the game that surprised you from
Davidson?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Nothing really surprised us. We scouted really good
and Coach got us prepared for the game. But in terms of physically, it took a
lot from me personally guarding them, their actions, they don't stop moving.  
  
SACHA KILLEYA-JONES: Everything Shai said sums it up. They're a shooting team.
We expected that. They got off a lot of 3s, and they played strong through
their actions, their offense was tiring. But we did what we could.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: They did a real good job of knocking down the shots they got open.  
  
Q. For the past three weeks we can't get through a press conference
without Coach Cal saying something about your game. How does it feel when the
lights are brightest, the stage biggest, and your game finally coming
around?  
SACHA KILLEYA-JONES: It feels good that I'm playing well. Mostly I'm just
happy that the team is winning games, and anything I can do to contribute to
that is going to obviously feel great. And I'm glad I'm doing my part.  
  
And like I said, we're winning games and we are exactly where we want to be,
and looking forward to keep going.  
  
Q. What's been the difference these last couple of weeks? Seems like you
continually have been playing well. What was the difference today for you?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Personally, I don't think I played too well today.
Yeah, I've just been trying to do what I worked on and do what Coach is asking
me, what this team needs me to do. Today I didn't do too well. My shots
weren't falling. I got a little selfishness. I'm going to learn from it and
get better for the next game and try to do better next time.  
  
Q. You guys did not make a three tonight, which is strange. Do you think
about that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I just looked at the stat sheet myself.  
  
Q. I'm going to get to you.  
JOHN CALIPARI: They don't know, because I didn't know.  
  
Q. Do you try to make one, do you try to get hot?  
KEVIN KNOX: I didn't know that at all. We just shoot the shots that were open.
They didn't fall tonight. It's rare for us not to get a 3-point shot. But
yeah, I didn't know the whole game.  
  
Q. You all are young men, you're about as far away from Lexington that
you can get in the United States. There's a lot of pressure in the season, are
you enjoying yourselves here?  
KEVIN KNOX: Yes, I'm really enjoying myself here. Idaho, there's not much to
do here, but I'm enjoying it. First time to be in this state.  
  
I'm here to play basketball, get these two wins and get back to Lexington with
two Ws.  
  
Q. I'm curious, when the crowd is upset, they're looking for an upset,
cheering for Davidson, and you were able to pull it through, what's going
through your mind when you hear the crowd roar for the other team?  
KEVIN KNOX: We were making plays down the stretch, executing offense to get
stops on defense, and that's what it comes to down the stretch of the game.
They were making runs, but we responded pretty well for freshmen.  
  
Like Coach said, we have to mature some day. This is the time of year it's win
or go home. We have to make plays down the stretch. And Davidson did a really
good job. Down the stretch we executed our offense and got some stops down the
stretch.  
  
Q. You were young the last time this happened. It's been 30 years since
Kentucky didn't make a three.  
JOHN CALIPARI: 30? I was nine years old then (laughter).  
  
Q. It's a fluke? I know you've been struggling with this all season.  
JOHN CALIPARI: We really haven't. In the last five games we shot over 40
percent. But we're not a team that relies on 3s. I wouldn't like to go 0-6,
but we'd like to make five, six, seven, maybe eight 3s. There's other teams
that need to make 12, 13, 14 to win; we're just not one of them.  
  
Second half we didn't guard. We just kind of let it go. We exchanged baskets.
But I thought the first half proved that this young team could guard an
execution team that really runs their stuff hard and really does a good job.
But, again, we were trying to go inside. We were trying to go inside, we were
trying to drive the ball. I told Hami, Put your head down and get to the rim.
He did a good job of it. We wanted to get to the free throw line, we wanted to
post it some. We thought that was our advantage.  
  
Their advantage is they were going to take 30 3s; they took 33. We held them
to 33 percent on the year; they're probably 40 percent.  
  
Q. You talked about some of your struggles. Just talk about some things
you'd like to see your guys improve on moving forward?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We became undisciplined. There was a stretch where guys did
what they wanted to do. Just tried to steal a guy and foul and it was like,
Wait a minute, we don't stand behind the post; we were standing dead behind
the post. I don't know if they were tired or so anxious the first 20 minutes,
like tired them out. They have never been in this tournament. We start five
freshmen.  
  
And I think they were -- I even thought we were tired to start the game. It
looked that way. Then we got our legs and I took a couple of guys out, we
played with more energy and we got going. But this is all new to these kids.
And it's an exciting thing.  
  
I'm holding them accountable, I'm not just clapping right now. Because each
time you play the next game you're going to have to play more of a well-
rounded game. You cannot have three bad minutes because you'll be down 12. Now
you're down 12, you can't come back in this kind of tournament, because those
teams make free throws, they're good defensive teams or they wouldn't still be
playing. They're tough rebounding teams. You can't have three minutes of a
breakdown. And that's what I was on them today about a little bit.  
  
Q. How would Aldridge or Grady fair in the SEC?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They'd do fine, on all the tapes. I had friends of mine from
within the league and told me, You know, they have guys that could play for
you guys. And they do.  
  
I also looked at their stats prior to the game within their league. They're in
the top 1, 2 or 3 in almost every category in their league. Bob has done a
great job. They play a style that's hard. One advantage we had, Rick Barnes
and Bobby are really good friends, so a lot of stuff that Tennessee runs is
similar to what we faced today. So we had an advantage.  
  
We had a short-term, we had a day off, one day of practice, and then open gym
here to get ready. If we had never seen this stuff before, we would have had
no chance, none. We just had played Tennessee three times so a lot of the
stuff is similar.  
  
Q. What are the things that you did well in this game you'll need to
continue to do well moving forward?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You have to defend and rebound in this thing. Again, we can't
go 0-for from the 3-point line. You have to make some shots. And I always say
this: You don't have to make them all. You just can't miss them all. You can't
miss every one. And then you can't miss them bad because they're demoralizing.
This is a good shooting team. But we only took six. If we took 6 more we'd
have been 6-12.  
  
Q. How would you rate your overall defensive effort in this game?  
JOHN CALIPARI: First half really good. Second half shaky.  
  
Q. You brought up how you held Davidson to 11 of 30 3s. How did you go
about defensively scheming against that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They drive baseline better than anything we play. We worked on
a day and a half on just when they caught it on the wing, make them go middle.
They go baseline, that's how they create 3-point shots for themselves. They
find areas to shoot.  
  
The second thing was we wanted to be up, because our length we felt would
bother them. But when Gudmundsson made four in a row, we were like, Guys, is
anybody watching the game? And then -- well, he was lucky. Lucky? He just made
four in a row. He's not lucky; get up and make him put it on the floor.  
  
I told them in this tournament you enjoy wins, but you still need to learn
that if we played the way we played in the second half, it's been a heck of a
year, but you're not advancing, doesn't matter who you play. You've got to
play 40 minutes and fight like heck and then go back to the hotel room and
pass out. And then get a day in between. This is not a conference tournament
where it's game, game, game. You have a day in between to recover.

### [T.J. Otzelberger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33061)

### [Mike Daum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30736)

### [Reed Tellinghuisen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33062)

### [Tevin King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34999)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Q. Mike, on Sunday you said you didn't know anything about Ohio State.
I'm assuming in the next couple of days you've had a chance to study them a
little bit. What do you know about them now?  
MIKE DAUM: We really respect the basketball club they have at Ohio State. They
are a group of guys that play well together. They do a good job of getting the
ball in the paint and have a lot of matchup problems. They're a team that's
really well oiled and can play well together.  
  
Q. You guys have done a good job of taking care of the basketball this
season. You played different roles. Why have you done such a good job of not
turning the ball over this season? How do your strengths play to something
like that?  
TEVIN KING: For myself, I understand that offensively we need to be as great
as possible. You can't turn the ball over. We've got great scorers, that just
getting the ball in their hands and getting at least a shot attempt is the
best thing for this team.  
  
MIKE DAUM: Kind of go off him, like he says, for us it's just taking care of
the ball. For me last year I feel like turnovers were something that every
game I would have two or three of, and I tried to cut those out. To try to get
those guys open shots is a big deal for us.  
  
Q. How much did the experience last season help out coming into this
year? This is the third straight trip you've made to the NCAA tournament. I'd
imagine the experience has helped.  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: Yeah, definitely. Three guys sitting up here have been to
three NCAA tournaments. We've got a group of experienced guys. And some
younger guys that are mixed in. And I think our group overall has great
experience. And I think that definitely helps us out as a group.  
  
TEVIN KING: Going off of that, being here a couple of times before, you get a
feel for things. You see it from a different perspective and you're just
comfortable.  
  
MIKE DAUM: I agree with what they said (laughter).  
  
Q. Ohio State is a good defensive rebounding team, they're top 40 in the
country. You guys are No. 1 in the country. How important is that matchup
specifically controlling the glass, and it leads to offensive transition.  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: That's been big for us all year. Coach stressed getting
defensive rebounds. And that definitely helps us in the transition offense,
that's a big part of our offense. Getting the defense rebounds makes our team
at its best.  
  
TEVIN KING: Just getting the ball out and pushing it, it's one of our greatest
threats on the offensive end. We really emphasize that.  
  
MIKE DAUM: I'm good again.  
  
Q. It's no secret to pull an upset most Mid-Majors have to shoot about
45 percent or better. That's something South Dakota State struggled with
historically when they get to these tournaments. How do you get comfortable
and get in a rhythm? And is the big setting, avoiding the nerves, hopefully
you will kind of shoot the way you normally do during the season?  
MIKE DAUM: I think this kind of goes back to our experience in previous
tournaments. For us we're a veteran group of guys who have seen the spotlight
now for a couple of years. And I think that we're going to be able to help
keep our nerves down on the team when we just go out and play our basketball,
move the ball, and just be able to take the shots we've been taking all year.  
  
TEVIN KING: Just staying disciplined to what we need to do. Just being calm.
It's going to be an up-and-down game, just being able to stay calm and
collected and take our part and the rest will work out.  
  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: I think this is the best shooting team we've had in the
past three years. Just doing what we do offensively, moving the basketball,
and taking open shots, I think that's one of our strengths.  
  
Q. Mike, from what you've seen the last couple of days, what are your
thoughts about Bates-Diop?  
MIKE DAUM: He's a tremendous scorer, he's got tremendous size for his
position, he can shoot the ball well from the outside, and using his body in
the lower post. He's going to be a tough matchup for us.  
  
We just go over that Ohio State is a great basketball program and we're going
to have to play very well.  
  
Q. How did you view last year's game? You were extremely, extremely
competitive. And did your view of it change as time went on? I know you must
have been bummed walking off the court.  
MIKE DAUM: For us last year it was kind of a hectic season. No one kind of
expected us to make the NCAA tournament. So for us to make it we tried to go
in with as much open mindset as we could, knowing it was going to be a tough
matchup game for us.  
  
Obviously this year expectations are really different for us. We have a group
of guys that really play well together, work hard and do whatever it takes to
win.  
  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: I'm going off Mike, it was just totally two different
seasons, this year we have higher expectations, and I think our guys are
playing with tremendous amount of confidence right now and that just kind of
helps going into an environment like this.  
  
Q. You've played with Mike for a couple of years now. You've seen all
the accolades he got. Accolades notwithstanding, what's the biggest thing he
brings to the team?  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: It's just his leadership. Obviously he's a great
basketball player. But he's there messing around with everyone, he's just a
great person. And that's what leads to everyone liking him. And we're just so
happy for him, how many accolades, how awesome his college career is going so
far.  
  
TEVIN KING: Mike is a versatile player. His attitude day on and day off, he's
just a great person to be around. It's great.  
  
Q. Mike, near 12,000 mostly neutral fans. Why should they pick South
Dakota State to root for? What's your pitch?  
MIKE DAUM: South Dakota State, first off, we have one of the best mascots in
the game. I want some Jackrabbits to win.  
  
They're going to see a well-oiled ball club. We play for each other. You'll
see us smiling and laughing with each other on the court, and how coachable
and how close we are with each other on and off the court. You're going to see
a group of guys enjoying playing with each other, and I think that will help
tie in some fans for us.  
  
Q. We talked about this is your third straight year. Why is it important
that it's no longer good enough to get to the NCAA tournament and bring that
first victory back to Brookings, but why is it so important to get out of the
first round and put this program on the map?  
TEVIN KING: I think we owe it to ourselves. We worked really hard for the past
couple of years. We grew as a team. And we grew ourselves. And getting this
type of win would be phenomenal for us and this program.  
  
Q. Everything you've done throughout your career, how much would this
mean for you to get a win?  
MIKE DAUM: It would mean a tremendous amount. Not just for me, for my
teammates, for the coaching staff and for the school. For us it seems like
years in the past if you win your conference tournament you get that automatic
bid and that's considered a good season. But going off what Tevin said, we're
holding ourselves more accountable, because we want to be able to come to NCAA
March Madness and make some noise and get a win.  
  
Q. Mike, what is it like playing, developing as a player with your mom
being such a great player in her day? And tell us about the first time you
beat her one-on-one.  
MIKE DAUM: My mom is the baller of my family. And she'll always hold that
against me. She taught me everything I knew about basketball up until I beat
her one-on-one. That was a good day. I was probably 7th grade, I was still
young, and I knew she was pretty upset about it.  
  
But she's been a great influence in my life with basketball, and she's been
super supportive, my entire family has, and helping me get to the point where
I am today.  
  
Q. Talk about Ohio State, and what it is you see and what concerns you
most about them?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I think first of all any time a team can do what they did,
play 15-3 in the Big Ten, is impressive. The coach is a tremendous coach.
They're a physical team defensively. They have a really good defensive system
and they're strong and tough and physically imposing. They've got great
mismatch players, Diop obviously being the Big Ten Conference player of the
year, scores it inside and outside, and so talented. And with Jae'Sean Tate,
6-4, 230 pounds, really physical.  
  
Those are players that we don't see every day in our league. And just a very
fundamentally sound team. A team you don't see a lot of weakness there. Very
well coached and a group that displays a lot of physicality and toughness.  
  
Q. The guys up here were talking about this is for real, and you're not
coming in as a Cinderella. As the guy who's trying to set the tone, how do you
deal with expectations versus that whole Cinderella thing?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: Yeah, for our guys being here three years in a row, we have
quite a few players on our roster that have logged a lot of minutes and
experience in this situation. And the more of that you can get on any big
stage is beneficial.  
  
So I feel our mindset coming into this, is we know we have a tremendous
challenge with the Buckeyes team that is very physical, very well coached. At
the same time our guys are playing really confident right now. They're sharing
the basketball, they're playing for each other. And I think our mindset is
such where we're focused and trying to do everything we can to be on our best
tomorrow afternoon to come out with a victory.  
  
Q. Depending on how much they guard each other, how do you see the
matchup going against Bates-Diop and Mike?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: Yeah, not sure on their end totally how they'll do things.
Mike, when you haven't played against him, his ability to shoot it in the
range that he shoots it from poses some challenges. I guess they'll put
different guys on him at different points in time.  
  
Where Mike has been successful we try to determine is where he has the best
advantage, whether it's in the block, on an isolation, on the perimeter and
trying to do what we can to take advantage of that.  
  
So I think you're dealing with two guys, both conference players of the year,
both can score inside and outside, both who have a long career playing
professional basketball. So it's just a really neat matchup.  
  
Q. This is a chance to expose your program, your school to a lot of
people that don't know a lot about South Dakota State. What would you like
people to know about your program and your guys as they get in this
position?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I think first of all would like them to know about the
character of the young men in our program. We're very selective in who we
recruit and bring in. We want it to be people that are great citizens in the
community, great on campus, and also have really high desires on the
basketball court. And we want to recruit guys and bring in people that want to
win, want to be in a winning program and understand that sometimes that takes
sacrifice and may not be instant gratification.  
  
As far as our school overall, just take a great sense of pride and the
tremendous people we have, leaders on our campus and community, the
camaraderie we have in Brookings, and the support we have from the great fans
we have. So I think it's a unique situation, because it has a small town feel
with big-time dreams and goals and visions.  
  
Q. When you recruited Mike what did you see in him? Did you see him
being as successful as he is today?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I wasn't here when they recruited Mike. But what Coach Nagy,
the former head coach, had told me is that they saw a skill set with him and
his ability to shoot it with the size he had.  
  
At the same time when he got here it wasn't like things just took off from the
start. He needed to get in great shape. He needed to get a lot stronger. He
needed to improve on playing with a really high base, so he could get moved
all around. That first year they red-shirted him not knowing what might come
from it.  
  
And I think to Mike's credit, his work ethic, his character and his natural
ability, he's put those things altogether to develop at such a rapid rate
since he stepped foot on campus.  
  
Q. I know all year you guys have emphasized rebounding and controlling
the glass. No. 1 in the country for your program. Do you emphasize more this
week how important the matchup on the glass will be, or if not, what do you
think will be the biggest or one of the biggest pieces of the matchup?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I do think the rebounding battle will be something that will
be very telling. Oftentimes it sheds light on who the more aggressive team is
that night.  
  
For us on the defensive glass it's really important, because we like to get
out in transition and go. And you need to make sure you're finishing plays on
the board. I think for them they have such great physical toughness and bodies
and they're so well coached, those guys play with great energy and effort on
the offensive boards, and great effort on the defensive side. We're going to
have to be not only very intentional, really competitive in those situations,
because they're a very good rebounding team.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [Nate Oats](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30683)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Nate Oats.  
  
Q. The million dollar question, how do you begin to slow down Deandre?  
NATE OATS: That is a million dollar question. Everybody in the PAC 12 hasn't
figured it out. So I've got a few friends that coach there, I've talked to
them. He's definitely the No. 1 pick in the draft from what everybody is
saying. You can see it when you watch film. He's 7-1, 260 and moves like a
guard.  
  
It's not going to be that easy. I think you have to limit his touches as much
as possible. When he does get it you can't play one-on-one. There's some
pretty good bigs in our league, but we've just told our guys, If he gets it,
you're going to just have to guard him. That's not going to work with him.
You're going to have to double, and pick your poison on who and where you
double on. You've got to play hard.  
  
I told our guys, it gets to this time of year, you ain't getting an easy team.
You're going to play a team with some players.  
  
We're going to have to figure it out. We're going to play a little bit harder
than them and figure it out. We've got option A, B, C, and D, and we'll see
what's working the best.  
  
Q. Earlier Coach Cal was asked if he watched any video of Arizona. His
answer and his response was, I haven't watched it yet because UB is a great
team. And if you've seen film on them you'd know that. A, what does that say
about what you think your chances are against Arizona; and B, how nice is it
to hear what Coach Calipari said about your program?  
NATE OATS: When we played at Kentucky, my last year as the assistant, and
Bobby was the head coach, and we were up on them in the half, and then played
them pretty tough. After the game I actually talked to Cal a little bit, he
was super complimentary of how hard we played. I know he said let's bring you
down every year. That hasn't happened.  
  
But I do respect the fact that he will be humble enough to talk about our
program that way. We played them tough the only time we played them.  
  
I don't know if he's actually watched us, but he gave the right answer on
that, not assume anybody is going to win. My guess is they're putting a little
bit more time in Arizona than us. It was nice he said that.  
  
We have a shot. We're going to have to do some stuff right. We're going to
have to make some shots. Their depth is not quite as good as ours. And we're
5th in the country in possession length on offense. So it's not like we've got
to do something we don't do. We're going to speed them up. We've been speeding
people up all year.  
  
We're going to play our game and tweak a few things. There's no Deandre Ayton
on our schedule. So we have to change a few things to deal with him. But other
than that, we don't have to change who we are. Who we are is more than capable
of beating them. I think people know that. I think that's why a guy like Jay
Bilas talked about this might be the best four seed in the history of four
seeds. And putting them at a 4 doesn't necessarily screw them; it screws their
opponent. Because know we've got a chance to win some games.  
  
I still think we've got a chance, too. Earlier in the season we went to the
NCAA tournament two years in a row, we didn't make it last year. We talk about
getting to the tournament and then winning some games. If you're a 12, if you
want to get to the second weekend you have to beat a 5 and a 4. If you're a
13, you got to beat a 4 then a 5. It is what it is. You're are going to have
to play some good teams.  
  
I think we'll be ready to go tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You said before when the matches came out that you were going to
exchange some scouting reports with Bobby Hurley. How much have you talked to
him?  
NATE OATS: A few times. They played them pretty tough. They didn't get either
win. I think they showed enough stretches in there what they wanted to do. You
always know what you want to do against a team. Sometimes it's a little easier
said than done.  
  
But I definitely -- I saw both their games live. They're on the West Coast,
and you're up late, 11 o'clock, all of a sudden their game is on and you get
to watch them. I watched both their Arizona games live. I watched their second
one.  
  
There's no secrets here. Deandre Ayton is a force to deal with, but they've
got Trier. He's a pro, too. Rawle Alkins is a pro. Ristic might be a pro.
They've got two 7-footers, you're not dealing with just one.  
  
I do think that Bobby was on to some things when they played the. They play
similar to us. I read somewhere Sean Miller talked about us kind of playing
like them. So they kind of know we're going to spread it like Arizona State
did, but it was successful for Arizona State at stretches in the game. We have
to do a better job than they did at some of the things they didn't do so well
on.  
  
Q. I've been asking some of the teams why should the people of Boise get
behind your team. Your guys said it's because they fight really hard, they
play really hard, but they also look really good doing it, because they've got
a lot of good looking guys on the team.  
NATE OATS: Perkins takes a million selfies a day. I'm sure that's what he said
when you asked him about that.  
  
The reason they should get behind us is we play together. We don't play
isolation basketball, and it's fun. And I think teams want to cheer for the
underdog.  
  
So you're seeing Deandre, you don't see too many of those guys in college
basketball now. Our group is a fun group. They love playing with each other.
They're a fun group. They legitimately want their teammates to do well. CJ
struggled in the MAC tournament, he said I'm going to do something to make
sure we win this game. And he came up with some big rebounds. When somebody
gets going, they start cheering for them.  
  
And guys on the bench that don't play a lot that really could play on a lot of
teams really pull for the guys that are in there. Nick had to get himself
calmed down in the MAC championship. We had Brock Bertram, who hasn't played a
whole lot, but a really good big that could be playing a lot in a lot of
places, getting in Nick's ear, getting him right. Guys that genuinely want
each other to do well. And it's fun to pull for a group like that.  
  
Q. Your guys have talked a lot this week about not having a lot of
pressure on them, which is different from how it was during regular season in
the tournament when you were favorites for much of the year to win the
conference tournament. How do you change that mindset, expecting to win the
MAC championship to saying we don't have any pressure on us and hopefully come
out with a win?  
NATE OATS: We started the conference, knowing our people were writing about
guys running the table. And I tried to slow them down. Let them know we've
been in the conference a long time, it's hard to win road games here. It was a
bit of a wake-up call. We dropped 3 out of 7. Ever since we started, there's
been pressure on them, but it's a disappointment if we weren't winning by
double digits.  
  
It might be a relief, finally someone else is picked. It might be the first
game in 20-plus games where we weren't supposed to be the winner. It might be
nice coming in as the underdog and play with a little bit more freedom, so to
speak.  
  
But there is still pressure on us. Because we talked early in the year, we've
been to this tournament twice in the last three years. This is the third time
in four now. It's time to start getting some wins. We've been here, done that,
got the participation trophy deal.  
  
There's still some pressure to come in here and not just play well, because we
played well the last two times. It was one or two possessions in the last
minute both times we were here. At least I feel a little bit of pressure that
we need to get a win. I don't think it's bad to have a little bit of pressure.  
  
Now, it's a different kind of pressure than it's been for the last 20-some-odd
games, though, you're right.  
  
Q. Could you describe your relationship a little bit in detail. We know
about Wes Clark and your history with him, but also that trust you have in him
and what it's brought your team.  
NATE OATS: Everybody knows I coached the kid in high school. I love the kid to
death. He's competitive and a warrior. He's got plenty of stories from high
school we could talk for an hour about. We brought him in here and I told
everybody bringing him in, my assistants, administration, when we talked about
bringing him in, why should you bring him in, you talk about the positives. He
obviously had some stuff going at Missouri. I knew him well enough and trusted
him well enough. And he's been unbelievably great since walking on the campus.  
  
He's been in the program going on a year and a half, he came at the semester
and he had to sit a whole year. So he played with our guys all last year, from
January on all this year until he got eligible in December. So it's not like
we just threw a kid they didn't know. They knew him well. He had been kind of
dominating them on the scout team for a year now. And finally when he got
moved over off the scout team with them they were like, yeah, come on, come
play with us so we don't have to guard you every day in practice.  
  
He's a great kid. He's not one of those -- he knows he's really good. He's got
a lot of confidence, he's got swagger to him. But he's not arrogant. He's not
all about me. He's all about winning is what he's all about. It's easy to
throw a kid that's all about winning in a team that's all about winning.
Davonta Jordan has done an unbelievable job but he's a winner more than
anything.  
  
So you throw him in with a group like that, and it works pretty well. So it
kind of seems like it was real seamless, throw him in, and we played well and
kept this thing rolling. But there's a lot of work, a lot of friendships
built, a lot of camaraderie built over the last year before he actually got to
play in a game.  
  
Q. What effect did bringing in Coach Hodgson have, as far as recruiting
and things like that, and having a guy like that to bring in the talented
players that you've been able to do?  
NATE OATS: Caruthers played for him at Midland, Jeremy Harris, who's been
pretty dang good, Montell McRae has been great for us, Blake Hamilton was
pretty good, got us to the tournament our first year, Willie Conner, Davonta
Jordan, all that stuff that we went national with recruiting and a lot of
that's him.  
  
As far as what the roster looks like, he's been like super big, just integral.
He's a great guy, if you get to know him well, he's personable, and doesn't
have a big ego. He works hard at building relationships. He had been working
hard at building them. He's a western New York guy. So to have a western New
York guy on staff, he's all Bills everything. And all the annoying Bills fans.  
  
But it's easy to sell western New York and Buffalo when you're from there, and
he's been doing an unbelievable job for three years. I'm becoming a Bills fan.
I grew up in Wisconsin, so you have to be a Packer fan. You can never leave
that. But the whole Bills mafia thing is growing on me. They made the playoffs
this year.  
  
Most of that is Bryan. If he can sell me on the Bills, he can probably sell
recruits on Buffalo Bulls basketball, too.  
  
Q. You brought up Bills fans. Any chance we see any Bulls fans going
through tables in the parking lot tomorrow?  
NATE OATS: They didn't ban selling folding tables out here in Boise for the
deal? If we get the win I'm sure somebody is going to dive through a folding
table after the game.  
  
Q. Bills just signed quarterback A.J. McCarron, it was just announced.
Is that the good move? Is that the veteran or do they need to draft a guy
still?  
NATE OATS: They have to draft somebody. They need options. A.J. can be one.
They need to have a quarterback battle through the entire preseason unless
somebody earns it, that's my opinion. Not that I know anything about football.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Q. For any of you, how would you describe Wes's approach to coaching,
anything distinctive about the way he interacts with the guys?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: Well, I can tell you he's a really great coach. Our coaching
staff has done an unbelievable job, knowing the practicing in determined ways,
but actually making us a better person in terms of how to approach every
practice and what type of mentality we have to have since we are on the court.  
  
But it's really helpful to have a coach, really young coach, in this case,
that has been on both sides, as a coach and as a player. And also he played
with a great program at UNC with the Tar Heels, and that makes things easier.  
  
JORDY KULPER: Coach, I've had the pleasure of being with him five years. When
he came to Spain to visit me, he had an image for Greensboro, and we're
working every year, every day, actually, for five years to get that. And I've
never been around a coach that is so intense, so consumed with the process of
getting better.  
  
But the thing I like most about his coaching style is that he's never worried
about or never thinking about other teams or even actual, like, specific goals
or results. We're only focused on the process. So every day we come in and the
only thing we're worried about is getting better, one drill, one possession,
one practice at a time. And if you keep coming to work every single day, all
the results and accolades will come.  
  
We've always thought of the Big Dance as a huge goal for us, but we're always
thinking about thinking big but working small. And that was something new to
me as a player, and something I really cherish that he brought to the program
personally.  
  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: He's definitely a player's coach. He wants nothing but the
best for us. And he'll do whatever for us, he'll push us to reach out to our
fullest potential. That's what he wants. I can't appreciate him enough. He
drives us extremely hard.  
  
Like these guys said, he says to just come in and work every day. The results
will take care of itself, but let's come in and do our part and control the
things we can control. And giving our best every time we get out there on the
court.  
  
In all aspects of life he pushes us to be great men, as well. He made a
promise to my mom that I would not only grow as a player but also as a man. I
can honestly say that at my time here him and the rest of the coaches have
helped me grow as a better player but also a better man, as well.  
  
Q. Three-point numbers are off the charts with what you guys do. How
much of a green light do you all have from him?  
JORDY KULPER: : Well, when I came in as a freshman, in Spain, if I shot a
jumper it was suicide in Spain. I'm happy for the problem. The big thing for
ourselves is that we have incredible shooters. Right next to me is the best
shooter in the country, best shooter I've seen. But the only thing we worry
about is everybody on the team doing their job and working to get the highest
quality shot every possession. We call it a quality shot. And that can be a
post-up, it can be a 3-point shot. But our inside-out game is very strong.  
  
If people like Francis, myself or Marvin get a good look at a 3, if we don't
shoot it, that's when we hurt our team. If it's a high-quality shot we have to
take it, we will. And luckily through the great confidence and positive energy
that our teammates give me we're able to knock those down. But it's all about
getting the highest possible quality shot.  
  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: We just commit to working together, get the best shot
possible for the team. We work on our jump shots. And coach and our teammates
trust us. We get over shots we just knock them in, not necessarily no green
light, so to say. But like I said, we work extremely hard to get the best shot
for the team.  
  
Q. Francis, you played impressive defense especially during the
conference tournament. Are you changing your play style at all to match
Gonzaga?  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: My teammates are going to say the same thing, we are really
focused on ourselves. We're going to play against a great team that has a
great history at Gonzaga. And they have been good, but we're just going to do
our part, as Marvin said. It's nothing special for us, being here is a great
goal that we always dreamed of. But now it's just time to put the work in that
we've been practicing on back in Greensboro and just do our part.  
  
Q. Ten thousand neutral fans in there tomorrow. Your pitch to those
neutral fans, why should they root for you, NC-Greensboro, and should people
appreciate it?  
JORDY KULPER: I feel we play basketball the way it's supposed to be played.
Really hard. Defense first. We have guys really deep that give the absolute
all to the program, to our school, to our city. Every time we step on the
court we feel like it's the last time we'll pick up a basketball. And I feel
that the passion we have for our game, for our program, for our city is
contagious.  
  
And hopefully we're able to show here in Boise, and hopefully longer in the
Big Dance, what Greensboro is all about, what UNCG is all about. And I think
the way we play basketball hopefully will spark some excitement for the fans
that come. And I'm excited to see them come out here, it's a beautiful venue,
and show what we're all about tomorrow.  
  
Q. I'm wondering what you knew about Boise before you learned that you
were going to be coming here for the tournament?  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: Only thing I knew about is the football team and the blue
field. I haven't known much about it. But since I've been coming, it's a
beautiful city, I've been enjoying it, the weather is pretty nice. It's better
than Greensboro. It was snowing in Greensboro when he left. It's been a
beautiful view here. I'm enjoying my time here.  
  
JORDY KULPER: I've never been before. I'm from the Netherlands and my hometown
team, when I grew up, I was really closely involved with the pro team we had
there. And a person that I used to actually teach me some moves back in the
day was Matt Bauscher who played there. I've seen a play or two. And that's
probably the first time we heard of Boise State.  
  
Looking to their program a little further, obviously, but that was the first
connection I had. He's a great player, and helped me a lot, too, when I was a
young kid growing up. That's only the connection I have to Boise.  
  
FRANCIS ALONSO: Same. I'm from Spain, so it was really difficult for me to
know about Boise State. But as soon as I got here this place is really
beautiful. And all the people from here are really passionate about it,
basketball, and I can't wait to come out there and play with a beautiful
environment, absolutely.  
  
Q. You have obviously played some games against Power Five teams.
Playing a team like Virginia, playing a team like Wake, I just wonder, I know
it's kind of an extrapolation, but what kind of value do you think that might
provide going into a situation like this, that you have been up against those
kind of teams?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: To be honest with you, I think that the Virginia game really
helped us a lot in terms of how to view, how badly was the defense and how
much it does to the game. And I think my teammates are going to agree with
this, since that game we changed our mentality and how to approach our defense
and how to approach every possession.  
  
And absolutely that happens a lot at this time of the year, because all the
teams we're going to play here are going to be top teams and good defensive
teams. So we're going to match their level of defense.  
  
JORDY KULPER: Yeah, I mean when you're playing them there are certain
weaknesses we can exploit as a team, but when you get to this everybody is so
really good. And also they always say that what travels is defense and
rebounding, it's been our identity all year. And to be honest, we're all
committed, we're all talking, getting one stop at a time. I'll take our
defense against any team in the nation.  
  
And I'm seriously excited for the opportunity to go up against a great team
like Gonzaga tomorrow and show them what our defense is all about.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. What is your first memory about seeing
Gonzaga playing basketball? And with them in the Mid-Major and you in the Mid-
Major, is this something you strive to be going against a program like this?  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: I just remember Gonzaga basketball, I mean they've always
been a good team. I followed college basketball since I was young. I've always
known them to be a good team; pretty good guard play and can shoot the ball
pretty well.  
  
Going against them, I mean, yeah, it's a good opportunity to stop shots. They
are a major program who had success over the years and established themselves
as a powerhouse Mid-Major team. And that's something that we're working to
build at UNCG, that would be a time to establish ourselves as a major program.  
  
JORDY KULPER: Yeah, what he said. Gonzaga is basically like almost an ideal
blueprint for what a Mid-Major program aspires to be. And I really like that
matchup, too.  
  
Obviously we're maybe a little younger in that regard, but we're shooting
towards it. So I think it's a great opportunity for us. We are both really
tough teams, great rebounding teams, all-around strong defensive teams. I feel
it's going to be a war out there. I feel like we're ready, and I'm sure
they're ready, too, so I'm excited.  
  
FRANCIS ALONSO: I know a lot about Gonzaga. One of the reasons why is one of
my good friends back at home played here. And we still have a good
relationship and are still in contact. And absolutely we talked about this
program having adversities and opportunities. And I think we have a great
opportunity in front of us to show what we are about.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. When I asked the kids if there was
anything that they feel is particularly distinctive about your coaching style,
Jordy went out of his way to talk about how you value process over results.
I've heard people talk about that for years. And that luxury of looking at
things that way might be more difficult. I was curious where that point of
view came from. The other thing I was curious about is obviously UNCG stuck by
you in some losing seasons. In these days of college basketball I wondered how
rare you felt that experience is?  
WES MILLER: I think it's a great question. Early on we really struggled, my
first handful of years. I think as a staff we were trying to figure out who we
were as coaches, what our values were as a program. And that process kind of
led us to the idea that we wanted to base everything around the idea of
growth. And you come in our practice facility, it says it on the wall, a big
banner, just growth, one at a time.  
  
And we just talk about that term a lot, let's just be a one-at-a-time program,
one drill at a time, one practice at a time, one lift at a time, et cetera.
And I think we're fortunate that we've had a group of guys now that have
bought into the process, as you mentioned. And the idea of just trying to get
better one day at a time.  
  
I think we kind of got to that through some of the trials and tribulations
early, so that's kind of how we developed that type of a mindset. But I don't
think we have any chance to see if we could execute it or not without
leadership that would allow us to work through it. And I think that's really
unique now in 2018 in college athletics to have people stick behind you.  
  
Three or four years ago there were a lot of questions, as we go out recruiting
and things of that nature, we have a job the next year, try to defend and
still be there. And our athletic director always stuck by us. We've had two
chancellors since I've been the coach here, Linda Brady being the first and
Frank Gilliam the second one, always stuck by us. That's the ace in the hole
why we're here today because people have always given us a chance.  
  
Q. Following up on the process notion, I just wondered if there's
anybody in your upbringing as a player or coach, who stressed that point of
view of going after process, rather than just goals?  
WES MILLER: You know, I was fortunate to play for a lot of great coaches and
be around a lot of great ones, Jaime Arsenal [ph], my high school coach
believed in that approach. Roy Williams believed in that type of approach. I
was always really impacted as a player how Coach Williams graded every player
on every defensive possession, and how sometimes you could get a good grade
even without getting a good result. Like you could play great defense and they
just made a tough shot and you'd still get a good grade.  
  
I remember that impacting me a lot as a player, and we bought into those type
of things in the program here.  
  
Q. I don't know if any of your guys have NCAA tournament experience as
players, but I know you and your staff do. Is there anything you worry about
or try to talk about in trying to handle this type of stage?  
WES MILLER: No, none of our players have been in the NCAA tournament, and none
of our staff have coached in the NCAA tournament, with the exception of Kyle
Bankhead, who's the director of operations, who had that experience in San
Diego. So this is really new for all of us, even those of us who played it in
as coaches.  
  
The first thing we try to do is just balance the idea of really enjoying this
moment. I have great lifetime memories of playing in the NCAA tournament. I
want our players to have those same type of experiences. But also to kind of
stay true to who we are and what our values are, and that's a team that's
prepared every single day, that comes in the gym and tries to get better one
day at a time and hasn't been afraid of any type of moment.  
  
Some of the experiences that we've drawn on to -- obviously it's not the NCAA
tournament, but we played some really tough non-conference games. We played at
Virginia early in the year, I think we learned a lot from that. We played at
the NIT last year at Syracuse in a game that was nationally televised that was
a big moment for our program. Even though they're not NCAA tournament
experiences, but our players and staff can draw from them.  
  
Q. You brought up Kyle Bankhead from your coaching staff. And I know he
used to play for Gonzaga several years back. How big of an asset has he been
for preparing for Gonzaga?  
WES MILLER: Yeah, you know, kind of funny, we had a selection party, which was
awesome. We had a lot of support there. And the community really has gotten
behind this thing. Our selection show, when our name was called, and the kids
and coaches, we all had our same reaction, we'd been waiting six days, since
we won our conference tournament, to figure out who, when and where. And after
about 25 seconds I think everybody in our program kind of turned and looked at
Kyle, because obviously we all know he has the Gonzaga connection as a player
and as a staff member there, and our players were kind of funny. They were
asking who were they pulling for. And he's pretty far removed from being a
part of their program.  
  
So I do think he's been a part of our preparation process, for sure. But it's
not like he's been a part of this team and been a part of their program the
last couple of years. I do think he's been able to give his two cents, but
it's not like we have some extra special knowledge, because he's not as
familiar with this team the last couple of years as he was back when he was
coaching against them at San Diego, playing, helping out in the program.  
  
Q. Two-part question for you: Gonzaga has kind of been a staple now for
a while. What was your first memory with that program? And with them being a
Mid-Major like yourself, do you model your program for the type of success
they've had over the years?  
WES MILLER: I'm a basketball junkie, grew up idolizing the NCAA tournament,
and watching games. It was funny, I did a radio interview with Dan Dickau, I
walked in and laughed at myself, he's one of my first memories of Gonzaga, to
say I'm a short little white guy.  
  
I saw Dan Dickau out there running around winning games in the NCAA
tournament, that's my first memories, as a young guy you look up to people
like that that you can relate to.  
  
As far as Gonzaga, I don't think any of us in college basketball think of
Gonzaga as a Mid-Major, I don't think the term applies to them in any way. But
I do think they're the standard for how you take your program from one level
to the next for all Mid-Major programs in college basketball, is you look at
what they've done over the last 30 years. And so certainly that's a name to
start around there, but I wouldn't call them a Mid-Major at all.  
  
Q. You guys scheduled Virginia, you scheduled Wake this year. Jordy
talked a lot about how valuable a learning experience of having to play
Virginia early in the season was. He thought it had a tumbledown effect. I
know Bob McKillop has aggressively scheduled in the past. How conscious a
decision was that on your part in playing Virginia and playing Wake to get
these guys ready for what might be down the road?  
WES MILLER: A couple of things. Really interesting that you brought up
Davidson, because they were in our league when I first got the head coaching
job at UNCG. We took some lumps, like everybody in the Southern Conference.
But we really did look early on in how they scheduled. Because I think they
have a really unique scheduling philosophy if you look at it. We have talked a
lot about them as we scheduled.  
  
As far as the experience, we've opened up the last two years with Virginia.
Our first game the last two years or two years ago was Virginia at our place.
And then we opened up up in Charlottesville this past year. I don't think
there's any game we benefited from more than that game the last two seasons.
We used that game to go to our players and say, Did you think it was hard to
get a shot. And without question they say yes, because it's so difficult
against them. And then we've gone through the film and showed them why.
They're always in the right place in every possession. Their communication is
elite. They do the little things.  
  
So we've learned a lot from that Virginia game. And we've used it as a
teaching tool, even though it hasn't been a whole lot of fun getting our tails
kicked. But I do think as a Mid-Major school those tough road games early in
the year against elite programs, I think you can gain confidence from them if
you have success. Our win with NC State really gave us confidence moving into
conference play that we could play with everybody. Or you can really learn
from them if you struggle.  
  
And I think of Virginia in that way. That we really learned a lot from that
game the last two years, even though we didn't have a whole lot of success.  
  
Q. To put your program in the spotlight a little bit, to introduce it to
a lot of people that don't know about you, what do you hope people take from
this? What do you want people to know about your program as they see it?  
WES MILLER: Thank you. We're basketball junkies. And we've been fortunate now
that we have a locker room full of guys and a staff full of guys that are just
nuts about basketball. That's not always the greatest quality but it's true. I
don't think our wives and families always appreciate how locked we are into
hoops. We're gym rats and basketball junkies first.  
  
I think we value competitive, junkyard dog-type guys. And I think this year
you can see that when you watch our team play. We're not perfect, by any
stretch. We're not consistent defensively, even though we've done some good
things. We've been up and down on offense, but we value competing and really
value sticking together and fighting through adversity.  
  
So I hope people see our grit and our toughness and our togetherness when they
take the floor. I hope people realize that we're just a bunch of guys that
love hoops.  
  
Q. Gonzaga is the reigning national runner up. What's it going to take
to win against a team like this? And a win over a program like that would put
your program on the map and take a step in the right direction, not being in
the major program, kind of establishing your own brand a little bit.  
WES MILLER: Well, Gonzaga presents a whole lot of challenges. We knew we
wouldn't be a really high seed. So we knew whoever we played would be a great
program. When Gonzaga came up on the screen you go, okay, they're not just
good, they're great, like you mentioned. They played on the last day of the
season last year.  
  
As we dove into the scouting report to break them down you start to see why.
They are as consistent on both ends of the ball as any team in college
basketball. I want to say in offensive and defensive efficiency, they're the
only team in the nation ranked in the top 20 in both. They have very few
weaknesses. Their size in every position, their skill level in every position,
that will be something we haven't seen in a long time, maybe since we played
Virginia, and that was a long time ago.  
  
So it's going to present challenges that we're not accustomed to. We know it
will take a tremendous Goliath-like effort. But we're not afraid of the
moment. We have tremendous respect for Gonzaga, we know how difficult it will
be. But we have a bunch of guys that are excited for this moment, excited for
the opportunity.  
  
Q. Playing at the level you played at with the stakes you did, and I
just wonder if you have any thoughts how that applies to what you're going to
be doing the next 48 hours?  
WES MILLER: I think there's some comfort with what the NCAA tournament is,
that I've been through it. Been through an open practice. I know the idea of
the media sessions and the whole nine. Outside of that I'm not so sure that my
player experience has a whole lot to do with coaching. I think they're two
totally different extremes.  
  
That said, I think this is what you're asking, I always felt that coach
prepared us. I always felt that he let us have fun and enjoy the moment. But I
felt it was hard, he was doing every single thing he could to prepare us for
everything in the NCAA tournament. I have drawn on that as I thought about
preparing my team. I want to make sure they're having fun, I enjoyed it. But I
want to make sure I take it as seriously as he did to prepare them for every
single moment of this and I don't shortchange them. I think as a staff we've
taken that approach over the last week.

### [Allonzo Trier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30553)

### [Rawle Alkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33150)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Arizona student-athletes to the dais.  
  
Q. Questions for both you guys. It's obviously been a chaotic month for
you guys in this program. Can you talk about what's that been like to deal
with that distraction, but still playing good basketball, if you could talk
about that.  
RAWLE ALKINS: I think off-the-court stuff, we don't really worry about that.
We focus on the court, on the task at hand, this week, and we just take
everything game by game.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: We're taking it day-by-day, worrying about playing our best
basketball every time we step on the court. There's nothing else to take away
from our focus of that.  
  
Q. This is an off-the-wall one. Today a lot of high school students
walked out in their classes in protest of gun violence and gun control. Have
you ever talked about that as a team, if the two of you have thoughts on gun
control?  
RAWLE ALKINS: We haven't really talked about it as a team. To be honest with
you, I wasn't aware of that. I didn't know about that stuff. But I don't think
it's right.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: Something we've never talked about as a team. I wasn't aware of
the protest happening today. But there's something that needs to be done about
that. I don't know if we have the biggest voice to have that opinion if it's
going to change anything. But I'm sure something needs to be done about that.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk to me about your opponent, Buffalo, what do they
bring? Is there anything that you're concerned with? Anything that you've seen
on film that you really need to lock in on?  
RAWLE ALKINS: We know that they play a fast tempo. And they have four guards
on the court at all times. They're kind of a small team but they still play
tough. That East Coast toughness. And we know it's going to be a battle
tomorrow.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: We respect them a great deal. They have a great pace. We also
understand that they're in the top five point scoring teams in the country.
They're really good on offense in what they do. It's going to be a challenge
for us defensively and we respect them a great deal.  
  
Q. You guys were seeded lower than a lot of people had predicted. Do you
think there's any particular reason for that, either being part of the West
Coast or the FBI investigation?  
RAWLE ALKINS: I don't think so. I don't think the FBI investigation has
anything to do with seeding. But that's just my opinion. I don't know.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: We can't be worried about where we're seeded or anything like
that. We have to beat them, no matter who it is. All we can do is focus on
every time we step on the court playing our best basketball, that gives us the
best chance to win.  
  
Q. What do you guys plan to do to slow down CJ Massinburg? What are your
guys' plans for stopping that core four? They're all averaging double digits a
game.  
RAWLE ALKINS: We're going to still do what we do. We don't have a game plan
for the one person. It's the whole team. We play whole team defense. And we're
just going to try to play our best.  
  
Q. It really seems like the program and the school have stood by your
coach. Just talk about the support that you have lended to Sean Miller during
this trying time.  
ALLONZO TRIER: Our basketball coach has led us on the right path. All we're
focused on is basketball right now, and nothing else.  
  
RAWLE ALKINS: The same thing that he said.  
  
Q. Last one for you, despite all the outside noises, the team has still
done well. Winning five in a row on the road. What's it like for this team to
still play the best basketball, despite the outside things?  
RAWLE ALKINS: Just the same thing, just focus on the task at hand, us winning.
We understand with team success comes individual accolades. And we just want
to win the championship.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: Not worried about what anybody is saying or what's going on the
basketball court. Trying to put together our best basketball and see where it
takes us. That's what we care about. That's what we're worried about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Coach Sean Miller.  
  
Q. It is a very, very difficult time to be a college basketball coach in
this day and age. A lot of coaches talk about managing distractions. What have
you done to manage all the distractions around your team and get them to focus
and play at such a high level?  
SEAN MILLER: I think it starts with you have to really attempt to control the
things that you can and to block out the other things that you can't. For us,
whether it's anything off the court, an injury, a tough loss, you want those
types of things that are adversity-filled to build your team, to build
character and the players on your team.  
  
For us, I think we're playing our best basketball as we enter this tournament.
That doesn't mean we get a chance to stick around or we're automatically going
to win because of that. But I think our team has shown a lot of resolve. And
it's been through some of those obstacles that we've had to overcome.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just what it means for you to be the head coach of
the Arizona Wildcats? What's it mean to you to be the head coach of this
program?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, the University of Arizona is one of the great programs in
college basketball. It's not anything that I have done. When I showed up in
Tucson nine years ago Lute Olson built the University of Arizona's basketball
program, and he did it with decades of excellence. Players like Steve Kerr,
Sean Elliott, Damon Stoudamire, Jason Terry, Luke Walton. And I'm almost
embarrassed because I've named them all that didn't play for me.  
  
If you start to name the players that have played in our stretch over nine
years there's quite a few: Solomon Hill, Derrick Williams, T.J. McConnell,
Nick Johnson, Deandre, who is playing with us. And I've left out a hundred.  
  
So it's been a foundation of great players and great teams. And it's an honor
to coach. If you've ever been in McKale Center on basketball weekend, there's
no more pageantry than anywhere else.  
  
To answer your question, it's an honor to coach at Arizona.  
  
Q. Today across the country a lot of high school students walked out of
their schools in protest of gun violence and gun control. I wonder, do you
talk with your kids about social justice issues? Do you encourage them to be
involved, be aware, vote, that type of thing?  
SEAN MILLER: Certainly we talk about a lot of different things, not just
basketball but sports related. Off the court you try to teach your players.
You try to allow them to be independent.  
  
If you just think about being on a university's campus, you're there to grow,
and form your own opinions. And that's really what being a student-athlete is
all about, that you get that opportunity. Oftentimes the court is your best
classroom. And then you learn other things.  
  
But clearly those types of topics are always discussed. And at the same time
all of our players come from different families, different walks of life,
backgrounds, that allow them to have their own informed, educated opinion.  
  
Q. While you were preparing for Buffalo and studying the tape, was there
anything that surprised you or jumped out at you with how they played?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Buffalo is a really good team. Any team that you play in this
tournament is capable of beating the other team because of the great parity in
college basketball. If you're from the MAC and you win the regular season
championship and you follow that up with the tournament championship, you're a
really, really good team.  
  
And they have a real confidence about them. They're a tough matchup. They
score the ball as easily as any team that we've played. Oftentimes in that
conference they're guard and forward heavy but they may not have a big guy.
But Buffalo does. Perkins in particular is a center that I think could play at
any program in the country.  
  
We know that it's going to be a difficult challenge, that's what we expect.
And our focus is on that, just trying to play our best.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts in general about the changes
that could be made in a sport where the culture is so much incentive to bend
the rules that the FBI could get involved?  
SEAN MILLER: I've made my statement.  
  
Q. The other day John Calipari said that your grandmother basically
raised him and that your guys's relationship goes way back. Can you talk about
that a little bit.  
SEAN MILLER: He's right. It's really amazing, but his family and my family
have been connected since we were born. And he was an assistant coach at the
University of Pittsburg. When I was recruited there, in large part I went
there because of him. And certainly have a lot of admiration for him, not just
as a coach, but also as a person.  
  
Q. Ben Tucker is a local kid that was born and raised here in Boise. I'm
curious, what do you think of his coaching prospects and his future?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Tuck, he's one of my favorites. He did a great job as a manager
at the University of Arizona, and he's become a coach with us, has left us,
and now he's at Santa Barbara doing an excellent job. But he's a great person,
No. 1. And I think he has a future to be a head coach one day. He'll make
Boise proud, if he hasn't already.  
  
Q. According to a lot of the experts, they projected you being seeded
higher than you actually were. Do you think there was any contributing factor
to that you're being on the West Coast or the FBI investigation?  
SEAN MILLER: No, I think the tournament selection committee has a difficult
job. We're a 4 seed. We're in Boise. Excited to be in Boise.  
  
On a personal note the last time we were in Boise we got to the Sweet 16 when
I was the head coach at Xavier. When you return to a city that you won in,
you're excited even more.  
  
We'll have a lot of fans, and most importantly, it doesn't matter where you're
at or what your seed is, you're going to face a very good team. And if you
don't play well your tournament will end quicker than you want it to. Our
focus isn't on things we can't control, but to be as ready for Buffalo as we
can be.  
  
Q. Considering the distractions the last month or two, as a coach, how
good has it been to see your team respond and play good basketball despite the
distractions surrounding the program?  
SEAN MILLER: I'm incredibly proud of our team, the players on our team, and
the families of the players on our team. Sometimes when adversity strikes it
can really rally a group of people. Can bring out a closeness that maybe you
otherwise would not have felt. And I believe that about our team.  
  
That doesn't mean that because of that we're going to win. There's a lot of
teams in this tournament that feel the same way. But I do think that we've
played our best over the last month. Our defense has improved. And sometimes
the starting point of defense is a closeness and unselfishness. And I believe
our team has grown in both of those areas, and that's a big reason why our
defense has gotten better.  
  
Q. Calipari was in here saying he hasn't watched you guys all season, he
doesn't see anyone except his team and who he's scouting. Do you watch
basketball in your free time? If you have a late tip do you watch games during
the day? Do you watch your brother?  
SEAN MILLER: I watch basketball. But to his point, you're so consumed with
your own team practice that day, the team that you're getting ready to prepare
for. It's like this tournament, you'd be surprised how unaware you are of even
the other 7 teams that are here and who plays who tomorrow because it's for us
about getting ready for Buffalo. And you get that single-mindedness that maybe
takes the ability to really follow people that you care about and other teams.  
  
But that's what I would say. I have a son who is in high school. I have a hard
enough time getting to watch him play, let alone another team in the country.
But you're right, if I would watch one other team or two other teams I would
watch Indiana and Xavier because of my connection to both.  
  
Q. You mentioned how much it means to you to be the head coach of
Arizona. If you could talk about what the last month has been like for you and
just what does it mean to see the support you've gotten from the university
and your players during this time?  
SEAN MILLER: You know, I'm very fortunate. Dave Heeke and Dr. Robbins, our
president and athletic director, that they have been as diligent in listening
and learning and staying with me as they have been. I'm grateful. Our fans are
amazing.  
  
But the two groups of people that I really hone in on right now is my own
family and our team and our program. The parents of our players and our
players. And those are the people that you know love you. Those are the people
that you're the closest to. And whether it's a season that you don't want to
end or having three sons that you don't ever want to see hurt, that's really
what you try to focus and stay in the moment with.  
  
A lot of the other things, they're on the periphery. Everybody learns that
when you go through different things.  
  
Q. Do you have strong opinions on the one-and-done rule?  
SEAN MILLER: I really don't have an opinion one way or the other.  
  
Q. Has all that's gone on over the last several weeks made you like this
profession more or have there been times where you wish you could go to Hawaii
and call it a day?  
SEAN MILLER: You probably know the answer to the question that you asked. Like
I said, I think it's coach-speak to some degree, but there's nobody that will
put what I'm saying in that category, for you to be successful in a high-
pressured environment with a lot at stake, a lot of different things going on,
your emotions have to be aside. It's about what can you control. Who really
matters.  
  
And I think if you focus on the things that you can really control and you
surround yourself with people that really matter, meaning that they love you
unconditionally and that you're in charge of them, whether you be a coach, a
parent, a teacher, then that's going to be your best way. And that's really
what I've attempted to do. And I've probably improved at doing that, as well.  
  
Q. Have you ever been to Boise or Idaho before? Do you feel like a lot
of fans should maybe root for you guys here at the NCAA tournament here in
Boise?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes, I was here a decade ago in the NCAA tournament. We played
Portland State in the first round, Wisconsin in the second. We advanced to the
Sweet 16 when I was the head coach at Xavier.  
  
We were in Providence, Rhode Island a few years ago in the first round of the
NCAA tournament and you could hear the U of A chant. It doesn't matter where
we go our fans will be prevalent. But I would expect we would have fans here.  
  
Q. You're a defensive guy. This team has been different, they haven't
been as good defensively all year. With that plus all that off-court stuff,
how is this manifesting itself with your stress level? Do you feel like you
have more gray hair this season from getting these guys to play defense?  
SEAN MILLER: No. Our defense has improved over the last two or three weeks,
almost astronomical. I think that's a function of the closeness of our group,
the unselfishness of our team. You could sense sometimes in our earlier
practice today if your group wants to continue to play, and we have that.  
  
That doesn't mean that it's going to win out and we're going to beat Buffalo.
But I do think we have a closeness, togetherness, we played our best here at
the end.  
  
And offensively you can look at that question two ways. The other way is, they
also are a really good offensive team. We have some answers on that side of
the basketball. We've played very well as far back as November on offense. And
recently we've really cut our turnovers down, which I hope we can do tomorrow
night, as well.  
  
It's the combination for us of improved defense and continued offensive
excellence that I think is our best recipe to stay in that tournament.  
  
Q. This is kind of a two-part question: Deandre makes up such a large
part of the offense. Do you see that being a potential issue in the tournament
as you progress? And also is there any plans to try to get Allonzo more
involved in the tournament than he was in the PAC 12 tournament?  
SEAN MILLER: That's a good question. We have balance on our team. Allonzo
Trier has had a great season, his defense has been the best it's been all
year. He shoots over 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from the three, 80
percent from the foul line. He averages right below 20 points per game. You
have Rawle that brings a toughness to our team that separates maybe us from
some others. Parker Jackson, Dusan at the center position, they're seniors.
Dusan is the all-time winningest player in Arizona history. When you think of
some of the great players that have played in our program, that's quite a
testament. Parker is now second. They've been involved in a lot of games. We
have some experience, as well.  
  
But Deandre, he stands out because I haven't seen a player like him. And I
think he's the best. He does it on defense. He does it on offensive. As his
coach he does it every day in practice. He has an energy and smile about him
that makes him fun to be around. He's exceptional. And I hope this tournament
gets a chance to see him at his best. If you watched the PAC 12 tournament you
watched a player that played a level that you won't see very often.  
  
Q. Could you talk to me about Allonzo and Deandre as a one-two punch.
How would you defend against that? What do you do with those two?  
SEAN MILLER: The key is for us to get both guys playing well in the same game.
I think that's when we're really tough to deal with. Allonzo can do a lot of
different things offensively. He's not one dimensional. He's a high free throw
attempt player. Gets fouled a lot. Shoots a high percentage at the three. He
has over a hundred assists, which I think is the biggest improvement that he's
made from the time he's walked in the door until now.  
  
With Deandre, he can score a number of ways, as well. He doesn't score just in
the low post. He's averaging I think five or six offensive rebounds a game
over the last five or six games. Makes free throws, gets fouled.  
  
For us it's a matter of playing team basketball, being unselfish. Those two
guys have a way of scoring. You don't have to call their number for them to
score. They're going to score as long as we're an unselfish team. Both of
those players are very unselfish.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Davidson student-athletes.  
  
Q. Someone asked Coach Calipari to size up what a threat Davidson is.
And his quote was to the effect of: They're going to take 35 threes, and they
make 20 of them I'll tell my kids, Well, it's been a terrific season. To what
extent is the three an equalizer in this situation?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Well, they definitely spread the floor at all five positions,
with everybody being able to knock down the three. And we definitely try to
get inside out to get some easy ones to fall early. If we can knock down some
3s, we're tough to beat.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like of the team and what's it like now going
into a conference tournament knowing that you had to win in order to get into
the tournament, and going into the tournament and winning it?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Yeah, going into the tournament we wanted to take it a game
at a time and have as much fun as we could out there. We didn't want to put
any pressure on us, we wanted to take it day-by-day and enjoy the time that we
had left with each other and continue to fight for each other.  
  
Q. You guys have to have been dreaming of this moment, big stage, bright
lights. How do you balance just the joy of knowing that you've made it and
just glad to be here with the focus that's required to survive and advance?  
RUSTY REIGEL: I would say throughout the season Coach has prepared us so well
for this moment. We played in a tournament in Hawaii. And then we had the
experience of playing in this recent tournament that we won in DC. And it's
about taking it day-by-day, game by game, and preparing the same way we have
for all the other games we have this season.  
  
Coach preaches joy in the moment and being happy with playing and loving what
we do. And I think every one of us is happy that we're with this team, with
each other, with the coaches, and it's a family we want to win with.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: This is definitely a dream come true for all of us. There was a
lot of excitement especially after winning the conference tournament, which I
think was expected. But you have to know that we still have more basketball to
play.  
  
And despite all the excitement and the thrill of making the NCAA tournament,
we still have a very good chance of winning tomorrow and we have a game to
play. We're going to play with joy and confidence, but also with focus.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Rusty and I have fortunately had the opportunity to make the
tournament as freshmen. We've been here before. And we believe that's a
learning experience for us, and we have an organization and team that has the
experience of being here.  
  
Like they said, it's a great opportunity and we're happy to be here, but we're
not content with just being here; we want to go and win some games.  
  
Q. This year marks 10 years since Davidson's run to the Elite 8. How
much does that loom over the program and how much does that team inspire you
guys?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: That run ten years ago was incredible. That was a great team.
Obviously Steph Curry, a great player. And a lot of us look up to that and we
see that in the back of our mind.  
  
But we don't really think of it as being ten years ago to this year, and now
we're back in the NCAA tournament. But it definitely is a team that showed
great care for each other. And they didn't want to let each other down, and
that's something we try to back on with this team.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: It's crazy that was ten years ago, but it's definitely
motivation for all of us and we believe we're capable of making a run, as
well. And it's cool to see that Davidson has been successful in the tournament
before. And we believe that under Coach McKillop we'll be able to do the same
this year.  
  
RUSTY REIGEL: That team absolutely left its mark on Davidson and the program
as a whole. And guys like Kellan that chose to be here because of that run.  
  
Growing up I was a Davidson fan, I was at three of those four games. And
looking back it was awesome that we have an opportunity to do something
similar. And I'd love to be a part of something like that.  
  
Q. Today across the country there were a lot of high school kids that
walked out of class in protest to gun violence. As college students have you
thought about the issue of gun violence, and if so, what are your thoughts?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I've never really thought about it too much this year. But
seeing everybody step across the country, it's great to see the unity of
everybody joining together peacefully. Different schools doing different
things. And it's great to see the younger community being together as a whole.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah, we definitely think about it a lot, especially with all
the tragedies that have happened over the last six months or a year. A lot of
people are not happy with the gun laws and how easy it is for some people to
get a gun. To see people be proactive and voice their opinion and step forward
in something they believe in is something cool to see.  
  
RUSTY REIGEL: I agree with everything they said.  
  
Q. Since you've had the long history with Davidson, I'm asking the
underdog teams: Do you count on the neutral fans to join you in an event like
this? What would be your pitch to the people of Boise?  
RUSTY REIGEL: My pitch would be that we're a team that's entertaining, it's
fun to watch. You see the guys play, the smiles on their faces. It's awesome
watching us go out there. To pull off an upset like that would be a cool thing
to happen. Let's hope Peyton can hit six of six 3s. Cheer us on and we'll show
you a good time.  
  
Q. Rusty made a comment that '08 team played a part in you coming to
Davidson. Was that your first exposure to the team?  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah, I was 11, my dad had just given me a magazine article. It
was a picture of Steph Curry shooting, and that's when I got exposed to Steph
and the 2008 team. And he and I and the rest of my family would watch every
game. And in the halftime I'd mimic his shots in the backyard. And ever since
I've followed Davidson and especially Steph. Back in 2008 was when I was first
exposed.  
  
Q. In Kentucky you had this big name school with a bunch of players on
their way to the NBA. How important is it for you guys to show that you can
play with them?  
RUSTY REIGEL: I think it's extremely important. I think we all feel that we
absolutely can play with a team like that. We feel like we've been playing
against teams similar to that caliber throughout the year in UVA and with
Carolina. Players that are very talented.  
  
We're going to come out tomorrow and prove ourselves, not that we haven't done
that throughout this year.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: I agree with Rusty.  
  
Q. So for all of you, is Steph your favorite Davidson player? Isn't
there someone that you love more that is underappreciated?  
KELLAN GRADY: My favorite is Steph Curry. There's been a tremendous amount of
players through Davidson. Steph has always been my favorite.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I have to say Steph as well. But one of my other players is
Tyler Kalinoski. I was fortunate enough to play with him my freshman year. The
way he played the game, everything he did was right, the way he did things.  
  
Q. As you guys were studying film for Kentucky, was there anything that
surprised you about Kentucky when you were studying them?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Well, we knew they were a very athletic, very long team and
that they really crashed the offensive glass and got out in transition and
ran. They are able to spread you out, as well, with different lineups they can
spread the floor and knock down open 3s. It will be a challenge to guard
inside and out if they're knocking down 3s from the outside.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: I was a little bit surprised. They do a lot of baseline down-
screen action. Thinking of Calipari and Kentucky, I thought dribble handoffs
and ball screens and downhill motion. They run a lot of stuff for Kevin Knox
and some of the perimeter guys coming off the baseline. So I was a little bit
surprised by that, watching film on them.  
  
RUSTY REIGEL: I agree.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll wait for Coach McKillop in just a couple of minutes.  
  
Q. Going into the conference tournament you guys probably had a feeling
that you needed to win if you wanted to get into March Madness. What's the
feeling of the team after going out and winning the conference tournament?  
BOB McKILLOP: Mission accomplished. We've had that experience at Davidson for
many years. As members of the Southern Conference it was one big league. We
would go into that weekend in March, no matter what our record was during the
course of the year, knowing that we had to win three games or you were going
home.  
  
Q. When most people think Davidson basketball, obviously they think the
2008 run. Has it hit you that it's been ten years and how much influence did
that team play on the program today?  
BOB McKILLOP: It's hard to believe it is ten years, because it's such a vivid,
treasured memory. It resonates with us every day, that spirit of that team, of
that experience hovers around our campus.  
  
So for me and for many people that have been part of the program for so long
it will never, ever disappear or be such a distant memory.  
  
Q. John Calipari described your team as almost like (inaudible). Do you
believe anything he says about your team?  
BOB McKILLOP: John's first recruit at the University of Massachusetts was a
young man who played for me, and I was a high school coach at the time. So
it's interesting. The boy's name was Kennard Robinson. And John went on to
ensure that that young man graduated with a master's degree from the
University of Massachusetts and played professional basketball in the
Philippines. I trusted one of my quote, unquote, sons with John 30 years ago,
35 years ago, and he honored that trust. So I trust everything John says.  
  
Q. This tournament gives you a chance to expose new people to your
program and your school. And obviously you guys have done this for a while
now. What do you hope people learn about Davidson, see about your program as
you come to new places like this?  
BOB McKILLOP: In 1994 we played in the Albertson's Classic here in Boise. So I
have fond memories of that. Who could not have the greatest admiration for
what Chris Peterson did here with the football program, and Leon Rice, happens
to be a good friend, and Justinian Jessup was a kid we recruited aggressively.  
  
Familiarity with Boise is very, very strong. We're thrilled to be in this
marvelous city. We understand why people want to flock to come and live here.
And of course being on a national stage like we are, and having it in this
venue, which is going to attract a great crowd, is indicative of the athletic
spirit that lives here in Boise.  
  
Q. As you were preparing for Kentucky and watching film and probably the
first thing that pops out is their length and athleticism. How do you slow
down a team like that?  
BOB McKILLOP: What impressed me most is how much they've improved throughout
the season. We've watched tape early and we've watched tape midseason. We
watched tape late. We watched tape conference tournament. And they just seem
to be getting better and better. And that's a statement of the outstanding job
that John has done. John has brought a group of young men in there and molded
them into a team.  
  
That's not easy. Everyone thinks it's, if I had those kind of players I'd have
a great team. It's not easy. And that's why he has done such a marvelous job
as a coach and that's why he's a hall of famer, because he's taken young men
and put them together as a team, even though they were the stars. And I think
he has a host of high school all-Americans, and yet now he has to mold that
talent into a team.  
  
So hats off to John for accomplishing that, not just this year, but that's
been a tradition that John has had wherever he has been.  
  
Q. How much do you guys get Steph Curry around the program? If I'm not
mistaken, I believe Golden State has a night off tomorrow night, do you expect
him to make the trip up here?  
BOB McKILLOP: Steph Curry is around our program 24 hours a day. The imprint
that he put on our program is probably the greatest imprint that any alum
could put on a program or a school.  
  
Davidson College, no matter where you go in the United States or across the
world, the recognizable name is Steph Curry. And what's wonderful about that
is that Steph Curry has taken ownership of that. Steph Curry has never, ever
separated himself from the spirit of Davidson College that was part of his
upbringing. And you could look at article after article about his reference to
that.  
  
And in fact, on the court Sunday, as we had just won the tournament, we're
sitting there on the benches waiting for the awards tables to be set up, Steph
Curry called, FaceTimed, FaceTimed with our bench, and it was game day for the
Golden State warriors. A shout-out to Steph, because it's Steph's 30th
birthday, so happy birthday, Steph.  
  
Q. You've watched how you've built your program from moving conferences
and with the Steph Curry and to situations like this where you could play
against a team like Kentucky, and you're not an unknown. People know about the
program. You've watched all that happen. What sort of pride does that give you
in seeing that during your career?  
BOB McKILLOP: When you're at a program as long as I've been at a program, 28,
29 years, and you become part of that. You become part of that culture. And
not only do you become part of it, because the connection for many of our
players is through the program that I was the head coach in, they become part
of it. So your family grows and grows and grows, and that family has become
like an army.  
  
And to me that is the greatest source of pride that people that were there in
1990, 1992, 1996, they're feeling as much a part of this. And that's the sense
of Davidson College, there's an intimacy there whether you're a basketball
player or not, an intimacy that connects everybody.  
  
You drive down the interstate, you go into a shopping mall, you walk across a
piazza in Europe, and you see the Davidson shirt or sticker on their car, and
you try to pull up fast in that car or try to talk to that person to speak,
because there's somehow a connection. That's the extraordinary aspect of
Davidson College.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE.)  
BOB McKILLOP: I don't know. No, I don't think. He'd have to ask me for
tickets. (Laughter.)

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [CJ Massinburg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35020)

### [Nick Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30768)

### [Wes Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27920)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the student-athletes from University of
Buffalo.  
  
Q. Million dollar question, how do you begin to slow down an athlete
like Deandre?  
WES CLARK: Focus on making the catches hard, making him work for everything.
We know he's a force, one of the best players in the country. But we're not
going to let that deter us from what we're trying to do, where we're trying to
get.  
  
Q. You guys played in this tournament two years ago when you guys went
to Providence. Last year you didn't make the tournament. How gratifying is it
to be back here and how much did you learn from the first time around?  
CJ MASSINBURG: It was definitely an honor getting back to this tournament.
When you begin the season you've got one goal in mind, two goals, actually,
winning the conference tournament, and the second goal, which is more
tournament, is getting to this tournament and trying to get some wins.  
  
We came up short last year, but that made us more hungry to get here this
year.  
  
NICK PERKINS: Pretty much what C.J. said. We came up short last year, and we
worked our butt off all summer and all spring to get back here, and now we're
here.  
  
Q. How are you embracing that underdog role, given the task at hand?  
WES CLARK: I think the No. 1 thing we're doing is just trying to focus on
playing one play at a time. We're used to being the guys with the targets on
our back. So for us to go out and hunt one time is fun.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Definitely. One thing that is circulating in the locker room is
we don't have any pressure on us, we're not expected to win the game. So we
don't have anything to lose. So we're not going out there with a bunch of
pressure like we have to beat this team. We're going to go out there and give
our all. It's March so upsets happen.  
  
NICK PERKINS: To be honest, I wouldn't even call it an upset. We're supposed
to be here. We were winning all year, winning at a high level. We're supposed
to be here. It didn't surprise us. We're supposed to be in this game. I think
it would be great for us if we win. It is what it is.  
  
But we're planning to win. We're ain't here to just say we got here; we are
trying to win the game.  
  
Q. You've known Nate for a long time, you played for him in high school.
Describe the man he is and the type of leader he is for this program.  
WES CLARK: Very confident, man, and a team coach. I've had some coaches where
you felt a disconnect from the coach and the players. Our coach does a great
job connecting all the players. I don't know one guy on the team that he
doesn't have a great bond with.  
  
Just to have that family figure around and that type of effect is a different
type of game. A different type of coach and a different type of team.  
  
Q. Buffalo sports fans are sometimes known to be a little crazy,
especially Bills fans. Is there any crossover with your fans? And if so, will
we see some fun fans here in Boise?  
WES CLARK: Our fans are great. I think they're the same, the Buffalo Bills
fans and the Bulls fans. I can't say they will be any different. They'll be
out and go hard just for us like they are in Buffalo.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: We definitely have the greatest fans in the NCAA. We have one
guy, we have a student section called True Blue. We have one guys that comes
in Speedos and is naked all the whole game. He's called you be naked. He wears
a cape. He shows personality to our fans and stuff and we appreciate him.  
  
Q. Whichever one is the best politician, there will be a ton of neutral
fans in the arena tomorrow. What would be the pitch to Boise to get behind
Buffalo? What stands out in your program and your team that people may like?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Just to the neutral fans, you know, everybody likes, I won't
say a Cinderella story, but people like to root for the underdogs.  
  
Neutral fans, we are hard-nosed, fierce competitors, don't back down to
anybody type of guys, hey, root for us. You'll see what we bring to the table.
We're very easy to cheer for.  
  
WES CLARK: We have a great group of guys. A lot of guys that's handsome,
you'll enjoy coming to watch us. We play hard, we're going to fight, we're
also nice at the same time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I want to hear more about how these guys look when they play.  
  
We'll wait for Coach Oats in just a moment.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ohio State.  
  
Q. What's the excitement level, getting the program from Ohio State back
into the Dance?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: We're excited. The Ohio State program is used to being in
the NCAA tournament. We're excited to be back.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: All the players come to Ohio State to play in March. We had a
couple of down years, but I couldn't ask for a better senior year. I'm going
out with this team in March.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Mike Daum so far, and what are your thoughts
about matching up against him in the first game?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: He's a very good player. Big. Shoots the ball. Makes him
hard to guard. He's a very tough matchup. He's a good player.  
  
Q. You guys had a great season but didn't end it the way you wanted.
Three out of the last five lose, and lost in the Big Ten tournament. What's
the mentality going into this tournament after losing your last game?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Just another opportunity to get the sour taste out of our
mouth. Throughout the season we've shown what it takes to win, and we've shown
what happens when we do those things; we lose. So I think just our ability to
focus on what got us to be No. 2 in the Big Ten and focus on that and just try
to pay attention to the coaching and the scouting and that's going to be the
best thing we can do in this matchup against a very good team.  
  
We fell off toward the end, but we still had a great Big Ten season. We're
capable of winning big games. We're trying to get that taste out of our mouth
and move forward.  
  
Q. Going off of that, a question for both of you guys again. You are in
a class of only four times in the history has a 12 played a 5. What are you
going to have to do to avoid being upset by a South Dakota team that's been in
the Dance three straight years in a row?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Just prepare like we have in the past. And not try to get too
nervous. We know this is a very good team. As long as we listen to coach and
we play for each other and stay together out there, I think we have a good
chance to win the game.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Yeah, definitely. Upsets happen all the time.  
  
Q. Wondering what you guys knew about Boise before you found out you
were coming here?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Not much. I knew you guys were known for potatoes and pretty
much just the blue field. And once I got off the plane I was expecting it to
be a little colder, but it was way more beautiful than Ohio. What was it like
60 yesterday? It was warm. And just the view of the mountains and that. I
didn't expect having that coming off the plane.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I kind of liked the mountains. We don't have that in Ohio.
To see mountains coming off the plane, that was pretty nice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ohio State coach, Chris Holtmann, welcome.  
  
Q. You had an unusually long break going into tomorrow. Are there any
benefits having this break?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: We'll see. I think that's the million dollar question in a lot
of ways. I've been asked that a lot. We'll see. I think it's a question that
all the Big Ten teams are being asked and will eventually answer.  
  
We try to balance rest versus rust. That can be difficult. We also tried to
make sure our guys are conditioned and ready to play. We've been banged up and
we were a little bit fatigued at the end of the year because we had some guys
carrying a pretty heavy load. Hopefully that rest helped.  
  
We went off campus a few times. We had an inter-squad scrimmage at another
site, we changed up the practice times. Had a meal together. And then as
coaches we got a lot of recruiting done.  
  
Q. We know this is your first year, what was kind of your thoughts
heading into the season? Ohio State hasn't been to the Dance in a few
seasons.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: As a coach you always feel, I think we all put tremendous
pressure on ourselves. I think what we felt as a coaching staff in terms of
pressure was we wanted our upperclassmen, our seniors, to experience this
tournament. That's a really unique thing, that we're playing a team that is in
its third straight NCAA tournament and we only have three returning players
that have played in a NCAA tournament game versus a team that has quite a bit
of experience.  
  
I think more than anything you really wanted it for your older guys that
haven't tasted this incredible tournament maybe as much as we would have liked
for them to. So if there was any pressure that's what we felt.  
  
Obviously we understood there were relatively low expectations for us early.
Our guys answered the bell and put us in a position to do this and hopefully
we can make the most of it.  
  
Q. Obviously Bates-Diop is a player that gets a lot of attention. Who
else on the team could be an X factor for you guys in order to make a run?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well, I think our sole focus is on tomorrow, not anything
else. And I think that probably the guys that are always at the top of the
scouting report for us are Bates-Diop, as you mentioned, and Jae'Sean Tate. I
think where we had played well and had success our guards have played well for
us, C.J. Jackson, Kam Williams, Andrew Dakich, those guys have played well for
us. They're going to need to -- listen, I think we're playing the best team
I've played in the opening round as a coach. So we're going to need a lot of
good stuff from a lot of guys.  
  
Q. You guys obviously had a great season, but maybe didn't end the way
you wanted. You lost 3 out of 5, and the Big Ten tournament. What's the
mentality to wash that away and start the new season with this tournament and
get back on track a little bit?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Everybody has a loss or two at the end of the year. So you
could look at a lot of college basketball teams and say that. I think we had a
challenging closing schedule, stretch. I don't think our guys were deterred by
that by any stretch. Obviously you want to stay in this tournament as long as
you can. And that's what we're trying to do.  
  
But I don't sense that they're fragile. I think they've got great respect for
who we're playing. And we had a great closing win in regular season. And
obviously got bounced earlier in the Big Ten tournament earlier than we wanted
to. I think our guys are in a good place and want to play well.  
  
Q. Just going off that a little bit, you are in the classic 12-5
matchup, you are a popular pick. Considering the experience, what are you
going to have to do to get out of this first round and keep your season alive
here?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I get it. I understand why people are picking them a lot. They
have a pro. They have great experience. They've got a really talented team.
It's not just Daum. They have really talented guys around them, a terrific
freshman guard.  
  
People look at not only the 12-5 matchup, and historically what that's been,
but the fact that those guys have great experience being in this thing. When
you have a pro on your roster it makes a big difference.  
  
So I think we know we're going to need to be sharp. We're going to need to
play well. We're going to need to score the ball against their defense and be
able to make them make it difficult for them. They're a very gifted offensive
team. And they play through their guys exceptionally well. They've got
athleticism. They play really well together. You can tell they're an
experienced group, because they play really, really well together.  
  
I think when you get into this thing you realize that any team you play in
this thing is good. But certainly when you get in kind of those middle-seeded
games you're playing a really talented team. And we certainly are.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Gonzaga.  
  
Q. From what you've seen of UNCG so far, what are your plans on how to
break their press and speed up the game from the slow tempo they like to
play?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: We watched them a little bit and they're pretty good. They
have some great shooters. And they basically shoot the ball really well.  
  
As far as their press, just trying to break it, and start offensive right
away. Don't hold the ball and let them set their defense. Once you break the
press, just keep attacking.  
  
Q. As a guy who is a vet and been around the program, how have you seen
it grow in the couple of years you've been there, and what do you think is
next for Gonzaga?  
JOSH PERKINS: I wouldn't say I'm a vet, but thanks for giving me that title.  
  
I feel good being with the guys up here. We've got experience on our team.
Even with Tille and Rui.  
  
As far as that, just knowing that the little things matter in March. Just
preaching that to the guys, taking a charge, diving for the ball or coming
down on the rebounds. Just the little things matter in March and getting that
across to the guys is important.  
  
Q. What were you like in the first NCAA games at the start and how much
different is it now to be at this stage?  
SILAS MELSON: Well, the first tournament games probably speak for all of us, a
lot more nerves than right now. I think as freshmen, our first games we were a
little nervous. But now we have NCAA tournaments under our belt. All of us
here are more comfortable and more experienced with it.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: As a freshman I was real nervous, when I looked at the guys that
were so composed. So just hopefully the young guys seeing how composed we are,
and just knowing we have their backs. And just knowing it's another game at
the end of the day, don't stress too much about it. Just kind of play how we
play and the rest will take care of itself.  
  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: All the freshmen -- last year was my first time having
tournament experience and I feel like it helped a lot going into this year.
I'm not going to be as nervous, just go out to have fun. Things matter in this
month.  
  
Q. You guys are playing at Boise State, a Mountain West school, and you
guys possibly looking to join them out the Mountain West. I'm curious, you're
the only one that might be back next year, what are your thoughts on possibly
joining the Mountain West when you heard about that?  
JOSH PERKINS: I read about, but I haven't heard too much about it. We play who
we play, no matter who is in front of us. If we move, we do. But if we don't,
we don't. We've just got to play our game at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Being so close last year, is that something that's stuck with you
through this year or is it something that you had to erase and just start
over?  
SILAS MELSON: It definitely stuck with us. We all headed into this tournament
with a chip on our shoulder because of last year. And now we haven't been
down, it was more motivating than anything. Coming into this March I think
that's going to be our motivation is to try to get back to the Final Four and
the championship.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: Si nailed it on the head. We just took how close we were last
year, knowing the small things we didn't do in that championship game that we
can just apply to the tournament this year, just doing that.  
  
Like he said, our chip just got bigger coming up short last year. Just hope we
can come up a little bit closer this year.  
  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: Basically it gives motivation. Basically that's what it
is, just motivating us to get back to the Final Four. And little things matter
like taking charges and getting the loose balls. We as a team just want to get
back there.  
  
Q. You play in an event like this, there's a ring of neutral fans, and
what would your pitch be for those neutral fans to root for your team? What
would be your pitch?  
JOSH PERKINS: Spokane is a lot closer than UNC, so please cheer for us
(laughter).  
  
Q. This is like the 20th straight year that Gonzaga has made the
tournament. How much of history are you guys aware of, of the Gonzaga history
going way back, and how big a part of the history is the program today?  
SILAS MELSON: I mean I think as far as history goes, I think we're all pretty
close to the history, just because of the culture, we're all close. Players
from the past are always there around us. We all feel what happened on the
team, we feel what they were going through when they were on the team. The
20th-year milestone is important to us, as it is to the people from the past.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: We're really aware of the history. Guys come back, we build
relationships with the old guys. So for us to just keep fulfilling their
destiny, their history, it feels good to me and to these guys as well. But
we're writing our own piece of it. So it feels good to adding on to that
Gonzaga legacy.  
  
Q. Have you guys seen something similar in this defense and how do you
attack it?  
SILAS MELSON: I don't know if it's at a high level, but Villanova put the
three-quarter press in, and they're obviously the top five in the country so
they're really good at it. That's probably the closest team I can think of.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: I'd say Villanova this year, and we had experience playing them
before. It's our job to take care of the ball. And we need to break their
press. We've just got to play, so I think we're in good hands.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Gonzaga coach, Coach Few.  
  
Q. The big picture question: How much of a challenge for you has it been
to keep last year as a little bit of motivation versus erasing the slate,
realizing you have a new team and going on a new journey?  
MARK FEW: I don't know that we erased anything. I think it was important to be
able to draw off of last year, but it was a journey. We had an almost
undefeated regular season, and the way we handled things.  
  
But this team is just different. And I think at times I needed to take a step
back and be fair to them. And I was holding them to a standard of last year's
team. And again, it was probably very unfair for a couple of months there. I
think I reached a point in January or February to back off a little bit and
let them be who they are. And they've definitely thrived with that.  
  
Q. You have a few connections to Boise. What are your thoughts on being
able to play here in the first round?  
MARK FEW: It's great. The obvious one, just it's in the Northwest so it's easy
for our fans. A lot of travel. We have a lot of fans here in Boise. I have a
ton of family down here and Marcy is from here. And obviously Leon Rice is my
former assistant and he's basically family. So we spend a lot of time down
here in Boise in the off season.  
  
And we've got some great former players, Kore Violett [ph] was one of the guys
who started the whole run from Gonzaga is from here. Kyle Vangenus [ph]
obviously, people remember him, is from here. Then some great ex-players
before the run even started with Jeff Goss and Jarrod Davis, Jamie Dudley all
call this home. So, that's been great.  
  
And there's a small downside of it, I wish my father-in-law was still alive
because he would have gotten the biggest kick out of hosting the Zags down
here, he was kind of a legendary guy down here. That's the only downside. But
pretty cool.  
  
Q. Just wondering how often you stay in touch with Kyle Bankhead and
what do you remember of him as a player?  
MARK FEW: Kyle's obviously close with several of my staff members. They were
in the program together. But he stopped in a lot over the years. And hung out,
watched practice. Kyle was one of the all-time great Zags. He embodied
everything our program is about. He's an incredibly hard worker, incredibly
driven, selfless, did whatever it takes to win. He was one of those guys.  
  
If it meant a charge or getting eight rebounds at 6-1 could barely touch the
net. He'd do that. And then he also wasn't afraid to step up and make a big
three. He did that numerous times for us.  
  
Crazy how it comes full circle, but happy for him that he's in the business
again, and it looks like it's going well.  
  
Q. You mentioned the connections to Boise. There's been some reports
about Mountain West and Gonzaga. Just curious, talking to Leon, he said he
thinks you would be a good fit for the league. Where do the discussions come
from or the possibility you guys would be a fit in that league?  
MARK FEW: I don't want to come in the league, I don't think we could beat
Boise. Leon's got it rolling down here. They had an unbelievable year this
year. I marveled at the job that he did, and the players he did. And the year
Chandler Hutchison had. And they've done a great job developing him. And some
of the crowds you had here were phenomenal.  
  
Look, we've been talking to a lot of people. And this was the one that I guess
leaked out. Somebody leaked it out. I've said all along we're going to do
what's best for Gonzaga and the program moving forward. So whatever that
means, it's not something we're going to spend a lot of thought on this week
or hopefully for a while. But after the dust settles down Mike and I and
President McCulloh will figure out what's best for Gonzaga and go from there.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fans. The word on the street is that there are a
lot of Gonzaga fans making it into Boise. For those of us not familiar with
your fan base, how would you characterize Gonzaga fans and how important have
they been to the success to the program?  
MARK FEW: What's that exactly mean, "word on the street"? Okay. I got you.  
  
Very loyal. Extremely loyal. I'd like to think unconditional with their love
and support for the Zags, that's what's made the job so special. But, yeah,
it's a very strong fan base.  
  
I don't know if you were in Phoenix last year, but I think we had probably the
biggest collection of fans down there out of four teams. And even how it ended
up with us in Carolina at the end.  
  
We have a lot of fans here in Boise. I spend a lot of time in the off season,
and run into people that are huge fans of Gonzaga. And so I expect nothing
less.  
  
Q. Your team has made it to a national championship game, it's
consistently done that. What do you personally see as your vision for that
your next step your program can take? What is your idea where this program
goes from here?  
MARK FEW: I've always just been just to stay in growth mode. We've got to keep
growing and keep not staying still or being content or being content or happy
with where we're at. And I think this year is a product of that.  
  
The fact that we won 30 games, to win 30 is really, really hard in college
basketball. And to do that with the schedule we played, playing in the PK80
and some of the other non-conference games we had. So we'll continue to
schedule at a really high level. We'll continue to hopefully recruit at a
really high level.  
  
The school's done an unbelievable job facility-wise. We just moved into a
brand-new practice facility and finishing up the Hall of Fame which will be
really cool for the people to be able to roll in and see the history of all
the great teams, great players, great people that were involved building this
thing.  
  
And to be honest with you, I mean the greatest thing I think we've done in
this program is the Final Four. It's the 20th straight NCAA tournament
appearances. That shows sustained excellence, in my opinion. Because it's not
easy to do. It's not easy to do.  
  
And I'm really proud of this group for negotiating their way, navigating their
way through all the potholes and everything that happened in college
basketball. And there are times you're kind of wondering, man, I don't know, I
don't know, we might not. This might be the year. But they found a way and
we're playing our best basketball right now.  
  
Q. Another team here in Boise is Davidson. This year marks 10 years
since their run to the Elite 8. When you saw them make that run, did you see
similarities with that team and the early teams for you guys?  
MARK FEW: Some ways. There are some interesting underlying stories there. I
think we were the 7 and they were the 10 and we got shipped out to play 30
minutes from their campus or something. So that was a little rough to handle.  
  
Yeah, we got Steph started, and he was amazing. I mean the performance he put
on down there was simply amazing. We had a freshman that I don't think anybody
remembers that played great named Steven Gray, I think he had seven or eight
3s. If we would have held on to that last one, he would be the story and not
Steph. But they ended up getting the offensive rebound with a minute to go and
threw it out to Steph and he got a big 3 to put him in the lead.  
  
Probably the biggest similarity I see is Coach McKillop has been there this
entire time. So they've been able to build their culture, and have continuity
like that, much like we have.  
  
Q. Leon should be back tonight or tomorrow. Are you going to pick his
brain tonight?  
MARK FEW: We talk constantly. I was with his kids and Robin last night. So,
yeah, I don't know if he'll get back tonight. Hopefully if they win they'll
move on to St. Mary's. Constant contact with him. I can't tell you with how
impressed I am with what he's built down here. He's moved them from the WAC to
the Mountain West, and made them right up at the top of the heap. I was
disappointed it didn't turn out the way they hoped.  
  
But now I see things from a bigger picture, how consistently good they've
become, filling the stands here, which isn't easy. And things like that, how
they recruit, stuff like that.  
  
Q. What have you seen so far from watching UNC Greensboro practice, and
if their style of play might mimic a team you played earlier this season?  
MARK FEW: I haven't watched them practice. Hopefully they haven't watched us
practice. We'll have to check and see if Kyle has got some camera up in the
McCarthy Center.  
  
Really impressed. And again, impressed, anytime you see, I think people see
these seeds and then, yeah, just put those aside. 27 wins is 27 wins. And I
think you can tell a lot about a team when they win the regular season and
they win the conference tournament. That's a team that has a lot of winning
qualities about them.  
  
Obviously the guard Alonso is really dangerous. He's got his hands on the ball
a lot. And he makes a lot of plays. Scores it. Facilitates. He's really
crafty. But then they've got good size and rim protection in the back. Their
defensive numbers jump out at you. They play a three-quarter court press that
slows you down, keeps possessions down. So they play a little slower-paced
game. But we've faced a lot of different stuff.  
  
You get 34 games in you see a lot in the course of a year. So we just have to
draw on all those experiences.  
  
Q. Your team has done yoga for a few years?  
MARK FEW: Heck, yeah, so do I.  
  
Q. Which coach did it and which coach is the best at it?  
MARK FEW: Some of our coaches don't participate, like Donny Daniels isn't a
full participant, which is probably a good thing. And Tommy Lloyd is a
nonparticipant, too.  
  
I don't know if you could have the best when you're the worst, you know what
I'm saying? I can say this, there are some stretches that I can do slightly
better than J-3. J-3 is not the most flexible guy you came across. Sometimes
J-3 and I do some solo stuff with Travis. I always feel good when I'm in there
with Travis and J-3. It's good to not be last in the class.  
  
Q. Wes Miller said when he was looking for his first coaching job, you
allowed him to come watch in practice. Do you remember that? And what were
your impressions of him?  
MARK FEW: I do remember it. And just that we knew he was going to be
successful at whatever he was doing, just talking to him. He was a bright guy
that had a lot of energy, had a plan, was focused enough to go out and take
the time to go and watch other practices and seemed very driven. And had a
great pedigree and good mentors around him. So that's usually a recipe for
success. And lo and behold, here we are. He's done a great job there.  
  
Q. As you've built this program over the years what are the things
you've tried to instill as the things you want to be known for, and you want
your team and your players to be really good at?  
MARK FEW: Just what they are. I mean if you ask anybody from Spokane, they
know our guys aren't just basketball players. I think they're great mentors in
the community for young kids. And I think people respect the fact that our
guys are of high character and value being a student-athlete. I think it's
that term or ideal is under assault right now on the national level. But I can
tell you in our program it rings true and is legit.  
  
I hope people after they watch us and see how we interact on the floor, off
the floor, that they'll say it's a first-class program, because that's what we
want people to think.  
  
Q. On that note that it's under assault a little bit, have you thought
at all about what you would like to see changed?  
MARK FEW: Look, the biggest thing is that I think the idea that this is a
systemic problem across the board is a misnomer. There are obviously some
problems within college basketball, but there's problems within everything
that's that big, whether it's our federal government or professional sports or
anything.  
  
So I think we need to take some proactive steps to help right those and make
them better and adapt probably the model to more reflect what's going on in
society and then also kind of reflect that maybe not all 350 of us are the
same. I mean there are certainly a lot more things and needs and options and
whatever for my guys than there is some of these schools that haven't had the
run Gonzaga has had or Carolina has had or some of us.  
  
So I think we need to probably not treat everybody the same that way. But at
the same time this tournament is going to show like it does every year.
College basketball and this tournament are the greatest sporting event our
country has. And it will prevail like it always does. There's already been a
ton of great games this year. So we need to make some tweaks, we need to open
our mind to them.  
  
But I don't think we need to overreact, and I think we've got a lot of people
-- I've said this about some of the more high-profile people that are
commenting on it, that they're extremely well intentioned but misinformed with
some of the things they're throwing out there.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome University of Kentucky.  
  
Q. Much was made about Coach Calipari with his Boise comment about
asking the team if they heard where Boise was at. Can you elaborate on that
story? Did he ask you if you knew where Boise, Idaho was at?  
KEVIN KNOX: He asked us specifically if we knew where it was at. He kind of
said the answer before he asked. We all got the answer and we kind of looked
at him crazy. But I'm pretty sure most of us knew where it was, we're all
pretty good, smart young men (laughter).  
  
Q. Could you sum up what you've gotten out of this season in college
basketball.  
KEVIN KNOX: Just grown so much as a person and a player. Learned so much on
and off the court. The coaches taught me something new I can take and put into
my game. I put in a lot of work with the assistant coaches in off season or
before practice, just going to the gym, learning how to be a better IQ, be
aggressive, help my teammates out, be more communicative on the court, being
able to talk.  
  
I just learned so much from high school to college. There's a big difference
in my game now.  
  
Q. When you guys were studying the game film for Davidson was there
anything that jumped out or surprised you? Do you see any potential
mismatches?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, they're a really good two-point shooting team.
They shoot great. The coach said in the game this year they've made 50 or some
crazy number, 30 or something like that.  
  
It's going to be tough to cover. But it will be good.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: Yeah, coach said they shot 150 3s, that tells us they try to shoot
a lot of shots off the glass, a lot of cutting, back doors. We worked a lot on
defense, making sure we stay between our man and the basket. No easy layups or
no easy 3-point shots.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: They pretty much said what I was going to say. We've been
working on guarding the three in practice, guarding the basket. We focus on 3
pointers and stuff like that.  
  
Q. It seems like every time Coach Calipari speaks on the podium he talks
about how you try to improve your game by getting in the gym, those early
morning workouts. That's difficult to do. Not everybody would do that. What's
different about you that would make you do something like that?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I just like to get my work out early in the day
before I get tired from other activities. Personally for me it's harder to
work out after practice or after school and stuff like that so I just get it
done first thing in the morning.  
  
Q. What kind of coach is Coach Calipari? Is he as intense as he might
seem to be?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Coach Calipari is crazy, for sure. He's different
from any coach I've ever been coached by. He's intense. He's always on us. We
know he loves us and he's for us, and do anything to get us better. And that's
the best part about it.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: He brings so much passion to the game. He pushes all of us outside
our comfort zone, makes us get to another gear. He tries us to get us to push
each other as teammates. Talk on the floor, off the floor, just be able to
come every day and attack the day. He brings that every day in practice.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: He just wants the best from you. He pushes all of us every day
in practice to be better. He's just a great coach. And he's getting us better
for the next game.  
  
Q. It's no secret that there's a lot of NBA players from Kentucky. Has
any NBA players reached out to you guys and given you any advice? What have
you learned from them from those conversations?  
KEVIN KNOX: In the summer, of course, they were here and worked out in
Kentucky. We were doing a lot of our workouts, they were working out with us.
They were just telling us to be competitive. At the next level everybody is
going to be trying -- you have to be able to have that edge to you, make sure
we communicate as a team.  
  
It was kind of different for us, because they were talking so much on defense
and offense. We weren't used to it, they told us to make sure we keep talking,
because that's a big part of the game.  
  
Q. I know Coach Calipari was afraid this was going to be a six-hour
flight for you guys. How long was it? Now that you're here, what is the
experience being here in the NCAA tournament?  
PJ WASHINGTON: The flight was like four hours, I don't know why he said six.
But it's great being here so far. We have been practicing already. We're just
basically ready to play. We're happy to be here.  
  
Q. Was there any kind of a concern that maybe with Coach Cal's comments
about Boise that the fans maybe wouldn't root for you guys? Your reaction?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: No, we didn't think like that, we just thought he was
just trying to be funny again, like he usually always is. Nothing too serious.  
  
Q. Davidson is probably going to come out with a chip on their shoulder.
They look at Kentucky as the big name program with all of you guys headed
toward the NBA. How are you going to counter that?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I think as of right now we're playing with a chip on
our shoulder. A lot of people think that they can upset us and we're the team
to beat in the first round.  
  
We'll be more than ready for this game coming up.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: Every game we play, we play against somebody that's going to play
their best game. It's not like we're not used to it. Every game we play it's
with people who have a chip on their shoulder and think they're better than
us. We're going to come out and play like we always play. Come out on top and
attack. That's kind of what we're used to so that's how we'll play tomorrow.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: We're going to come out with a chip on our shoulder. We have
just got to keep playing like we played in St. Louis and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Obviously there's a big learning curve for guys in their first year.
What do you think you've gotten better at, the most better at, I guess, if
that's a word, since the season started?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I think learning how to work consistently day in and
day out as hard as you can. In high school you didn't really have to, you were
so much better and bigger than guys you played against, but when you had to
work throughout the whole practice or the whole game, that's probably what I
learned the most.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: For me, probably just to be able to play outside my comfort zone
and be able to fight. When you come from high school in practice you're
messing around, just throwing easy baskets. But here in Kentucky, you're
starting to play against all stars every year. You come out and just play
every day, come out hard, because your spot can be taken.  
  
I learned how to fight and play outside my comfort zone and that's what the
coaches taught me this year.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: I learned how to fight in practice and work for everything you
get. You've got to go out and take what you want. That's what we've been doing
every day in practice.  
  
Q. Have you guys been able to enjoy Boise? What have been some stuff
that you have gone out? What do you think of the city so far?  
PJ WASHINGTON: No, we haven't gone out. But our hotel is nice. The Courtyard
Marriott is kind of good (laughter).  
  
KEVIN KNOX: We haven't really done much. We went out to eat, that's about it.
And went back to the room.  
  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: The restaurant we ate at was pretty good. That's
about it. We didn't do too much. I don't know the name of it.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: It was seafood.  
  
Q. It's no secret you guys had some struggles in SEC play. But can you
point to one game or one day or one specific time that kind of changed things
for you guys and pointed you guys in the right direction?  
PJ WASHINGTON: I think the Alabama game at home, after our four-game losing
streak. That kind of changed things around. We started winning after that. And
everybody started buying into it and we started playing for each other.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: After the Florida game we got kind of smart. So we just came in
together and just decided we've got to step it up before the tournament. So we
just went through the four-game winning streak. We were just playing together
on both ends of the court and just playing as a team.  
  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: The Florida game was the real turnaround for us,
probably our best basketball this season. I think we got exposed that game on
both ends of the floor, and we had to turn it around and we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Calipari.  
  
Q. Now that you are in Boise, how happy are you to be here?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It's been great. Our guys were talking about the mountains and
the views. We went to Owyhee Tavern last night, had a great meal. Stopped at a
couple of Catholic churches in town. And then we went to DK's Donuts. I am not
a donut eater, but I ate some of those donuts.  
  
I've never heard of a place, only in Boise, they're open from 4 a.m. to 9 a.m.
then they're shut down. Who goes at 4 a.m.? So I'm like, policemen, ranchers,
farmers? Who goes at 4 a.m.? Unless you're just getting in. And it doesn't
look like a town like that (laughter).  
  
So we'll figure out something to do tonight.  
  
Q. Today in high schools across the country a lot of students walked out
in protest of gun violence. Do you talk with your guys about social justice
issues, about being involved, and being aware of what's going on in the
community?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I have. We have at different times. The things that have gone
on before them that gave them an opportunity to be who they are, that there
are certain things that if they have an opportunity and they feel like they
want to make a stand, just understand the consequences. Don't be pushed to the
front of the line because of your fame, so to speak. And know that you stand
for everything that they stand for.  
  
So, yeah, we have discussed stuff like that.  
  
Q. Kevin was talking about what he thinks he got out of the season. It
was you challenging him not to be complacent, to be more aggressive, to sort
of stretch his comfort zone. Could you speak to how that fits into your job,
and for him in particular.  
JOHN CALIPARI: All these kids that I get when they're young, some of them stay
one year, some of them stay two or three years, four years. We've graduated 17
players since I've been the coach there. So not all of them leave in one year.  
  
They just did a bracket. How many of you saw the academic bracket? Raise your
hand. We were playing Bucknell in the finals. So it's not just basketball,
it's what we try to do academically.  
  
But here's what I would say: My first job is to get them to understand they
have to conquer themselves first, before they can worry about conquering
anybody else. To get them to think different about how they're going to go
about business, how, if you're undisciplined off the court, you're going to be
undisciplined on the court.  
  
How do you get yourselves to do things that you really don't want to do? How
do you self-evaluate? Because people around you are going to tell you that you
are never wrong. It's always somebody else. They're going to tell you that,
Well, he never takes him out, but he takes you out.  
  
Now, you can buy into all that and never change or you can self-evaluate and
say, I don't like where I am, which then says to you, Now, how do I change? If
I do the same things over and over again I'm not changing.  
  
We had a young man this year on our team, Shai Alexander, who was in the gym
at 7 a.m. shooting, who would come up in the office and want to watch tape of
his turnovers. Who never missed a class. Never missed a tutor. Was always on
time. Worked harder than anybody in every practice. Ready? Robert, who works
the hardest in the weight room? Shai. And it's changed who he is and his
opportunities and all that.  
  
So for me, a lot of this is mental. How I get them to change how they think
about this.  
  
And the other part of this is, how do you get them to understand that they've
got to share? That this is a team sport. That if you don't do this together
none of you will shine. That took us half a year. That a Kevin Knox, okay,
these guys accept that you are going to shoot balls, but you've got to rebound
and defend now. You're not taking bad shots because you're taking shots when
you choose to.  
  
The thing with Kevin is he's the youngest freshman in the country. So he could
still be in high school. Sacha is the youngest sophomore in the country. He
should be a freshman. These kids, because they're 6-9, and you look at him and
say, Wow, he's big, that doesn't mean he's a grown man. They're still
developing who they are and my job is to love them. To hold them accountable.
To keep it real. To make them understand things in no uncertain terms what
works and what doesn't.  
  
Because if my guys choose to leave after a year or two or three, I want them
to have success. Right now I think we have 30-some guys or whatever in the
NBA, who make a billion dollars, not a hundred million, a billion dollars. And
I went in those homes. And those families trusted me with their son. And those
families had dreams and aspirations, and this is an opportunity for them to
realize the American dream.  
  
And I'll say it again, 17 kids have graduated. We've had a thousand on the APR
for the last four or five years, which means that every kid leaves in good
academic standing. Why? Because they have a lifetime scholarship. And four
kids have already started coming back who left early. We had five kids left
with 60 college credits, that's halfway through.  
  
So, you know, I just don't want any of us to devalue education just because a
kid has a genius. When a kid has a genius as a piano player or golfer or
tennis player, it's not a big deal. But when a kid has a genius as a
basketball player, well, he's taking advantage of education. No. I've had four
straight A students. Brandon Knight would go to class and be in the gym at 11
o'clock at night. Why? You're going to leave in a month. Because I don't want
to get a B. I could go on. Great students.  
  
To say these kids don't belong on a college campus is wrong. And when you say
"those kids," who do you mean when you say "those kids" don't belong on a
college campus? Be more specific who you mean. These kids are benefitting by
this experience. And I'll tell you this, I'm benefitting because I'm having a
ball. Coaching these kids, this has been as fun a year as I've had.  
  
Does that thoroughly answer what you asked me? I don't know where that kind of
weaved to, but I kind of liked it (laughter).  
  
Q. Can you give us any update on Jarred Vanderbilt?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, the kid wants to play. I don't think that it's fair to
him or us if he's not able to go in there and compete at a high level. When he
first started playing -- this is what made this year hard. It was hard because
we had all freshmen. We started five freshmen. Five freshmen. I don't know if
it's ever been done, had this kind of inexperience.  
  
But then Jarred joined our team. And then we struggled. And then we started
going good. And all of a sudden Jarred is a Dennis Rodman, 10, 12 rebounds
every game he played, 15, he could have had 20. Passes, runs, athletic. Then
he gets hurt.  
  
Before the tournament, we haven't played a game, we needed our tournament to
figure out how we were going to play in case he cannot play. Now he wants to
play and at the end of the day I've got to make a decision on what I'm
thinking. And right now I just don't think it's in his interests or ours that
unless he's a hundred percent, I would take 97 percent, 95, but you can't take
80. You can't. The games are played at too high a level.  
  
Great kid and I love the kid. But, you know, my guess is that he will not play
tomorrow, didn't practice with us today. So we'll figure out from there.  
  
Q. Two-part question: But have you been to Idaho before? If you could
elaborate more on the story about telling the guys if they even knew where
Boise, Idaho was at?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'll do stuff like that. I'll ask them about players, Do you
know who Wilt Chamberlain was? So I'll ask them questions. And how many of you
know where Boise? What state is Boise in? And a couple of them raised their
hands. And I said, Do you want me to ask you? But I think they all knew.  
  
And I had been to Twin Falls. Great place. I saw Evel Knievel's launching pad.
And I was in the golf course down next to the river. Is it a river? Rapids.
Was it a river? I was down there.  
  
And I hate to tell you, one night I drove to Jackpot, Nevada. I was in
Jackpot, Nevada and there was sawdust on the floors, back then; it was a few
years ago.  
  
But a great campus, College of Southern Idaho. Manicured. I was there for a
week. So I stayed a week. And so, yes, I've been here.  
  
Q. DK Donuts used to be 24 hours, by the way. Thought I'd let you know.
In terms of Davidson's strengths, they obviously seem like a 3-point shooting
team. And you've been good perimeter defensive team. Your thoughts on the
matchup.  
JOHN CALIPARI: They are a really efficient team. They're an execution team.
We're an inexperienced team. We're not an execution team. They're going to
take 30 3-point shots. If they make 20, it has been a heck of a season for us.
They're taking 30.  
  
We've got to make them difficult. But they run some good stuff and they move
that ball. And their assists to baskets made. So in other words, it's not one-
on-one basketball; they're creating shots for each other. This is one of the
most efficient execution teams I've seen in years.  
  
So they're not a 12 seed. They won their tournament. They beat St. Bonaventure
and Rhody back-to-back nights. They're not a 12 seed.  
  
This will be a hard game for us. We know it and our kids know it.  
  
Q. Since you went to DK Donuts, did you try the bacon donut?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I did. It was unbelievable. Here's what I did, I looked at them
and I went, Oh, my gosh. So we did the bacon. And I cut it four ways. So I
didn't have -- it's this big (indicating). I only had like a little bit. And
before I could get another little bit it was gone. We were there with five
guys.  
  
And then I did the bowtie that had the chocolate and maple together dripping
off of it. Is anybody getting hungry right now? There was so much sugar that I
won't sleep tonight. And then I did the apple fritter, and we cut that up. But
I only had a little bit.  
  
Folks, I'm not a donut eater, even though you look at me and say, yes, you are
a donut eater. I'm not a donut eater. The coffee wasn't bad, either.  
  
Q. Is the potato a fruit or vegetable --  
JOHN CALIPARI: You can't ask me those kind of questions. People get mad. Vice
presidents get killed. They spell the thing wrong. Don't ask me; I'm here to
play basketball.  
  
Q. Sorry to get off the donut food train. You were talking about kind of
the history-making nature of your team with all the freshmen. Have you learned
anything from this? I know you do this a lot.  
JOHN CALIPARI: One of the things I tell these guys all the time is I've done
this 30 years so there's nothing I haven't seen or there's nothing that you're
going to do that I haven't had to dealt with. I've done it 35 years.  
  
But what you find out, when we struggled, there was a look in their eye of
fear. And you learn that they're 18- and 19-year-old kids who don't know what
the future holds and are looking to me to help them.  
  
When we lost four in a row, again, they were Tennessee, Auburn -- they were
all NCAA tournament teams that we lost to. Three of them on a road. Normal
teams would have lost four in a row. We had a chance to beat a couple of them.
We had a chance with Tennessee, we could have beaten Auburn on the road.  
  
I got a text from one of the guys, Coach, we need you more than ever now. And
it kind of told me that they're looking at me like, What is this? We need you.
Don't, like, jump ship on us and don't give up on us. And it got me to then
sit back and say at my age losing four in a row is difficult. And I stepped
back and said, What am I worried about how I feel? I've got these kids that
have never experienced this. And I have.  
  
And so it just led me to understand sometimes I get away with they're big and
they're long and they're athletic and they're men. No, they're not. They're
young men. They need this experience. For them to grow they needed to fail,
this team. I had them raise their hand, How many of you -- and I called it a
crap hole -- you go down that crap hole and you're fighting to get out? In
other words, you can't make a shot, you can't make a play, you stink. And
every one of them raised their hand, at one point in the season they were down
in that hole. And they had to figure out how to come back out of it without
being enabled.  
  
Because people enable them. It's not you. It's always somebody else. It's the
story of the marching band, that's a hundred-member marching band in unison,
and 99 turn right and your child turns left and you say, What's wrong with
those 99? These things, it's hard when they go down there because they are so
young that they have to say, This is me, and I've got to get myself out of it.
They needed to fail.  
  
They also needed to fail as a team because we weren't coming together. We
weren't playing it for each other. We had more turnovers than assists, because
everybody was trying to make plays for themselves. But they had to have the
adversity.  
  
And I kept saying, even when I evaluate players, I want to know how he plays
when it's not going good, because if he comes with me to Kentucky there are
times it's not going to be right because the other team's playing like it's a
Super Bowl. And it's a sold-out arena, and they're trying to make their name
at our expense. How do you play when things don't go right?  
  
These kids needed it. It's a great group of kids and their parents who have
entrusted me with their sons, good people, and we've been able to survive it.  
  
Q. Given the nature of this weekend, four-game tournament, you've got to
look ahead a little bit, too. Could you talk about a preliminary scouting
report on Arizona, particularly Deandre Ayton?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, first of all, I'm telling all of you, I didn't know where
we were seeded until I got in my car after the SEC tournament and my phone
started bouncing I was getting so many hits. And then everybody said the same
thing: They did it to you again. You're in a pod that's ridiculous.  
  
And so I know the four teams here, Buffalo and Arizona, Davidson, and us.
That's all. I know Virginia is above us. I don't know who is playing Virginia.
I don't know who else is in our bracket. And I have not looked at another
bracket and won't, could care less.  
  
You're asking me to look ahead? They have good players, a great coach. They've
got veteran guys. They have a possible No. 1 pick with great size. They're
great. Buffalo is good and has had a great year.  
  
And when I tell these guys -- and again, I've done this in this tournament, I
don't know, maybe 20 times, whatever it is, you can't look ahead because a lot
of times you look ahead and the team you're worried about doesn't even
advance. And you spent three days, My god, we're going to have to -- they got
beat. Who am I worried about now?  
  
So I'd rather not move ahead and I'll just stay with the game we've got at
hand, which is going to be very difficult for us to win.  
  
Q. After you lost to Florida at the end of the season and it was not a
good performance, and then Vanderbilt goes out. Were you surprised at how well
your team played at the SEC tournament, putting three straight really good
performances together?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, I knew they were capable of it. But when you say the
Florida game, here was the lesson: I told them prior to the game, when you
play a noon game -- again, I've done this a number of years -- the team that
is more ready to play usually wins the game. If both teams are really ready it
will come down to the last minute. But if one team is more ready at noon, the
other team will let go of the rope. And that's what happened to us. Again,
it's an experience they had to have.  
  
Now tell me, two of the games we played in the tournament were at what time?
Noon. They learned their lesson. Everything here that we've been going through
is like an experience for them to grow. They've not been through anything. I'm
a little worried them walking on to this court. I've tried to build the whole
season towards this, talk about the NCAA tournament all season, but I really
don't know. I have no idea what will happen.  
  
I know we're prepared. I know they're in a great frame of mind. I know I've
got great kids. But this is going to be an unbelievably good execution team.
Do we have the discipline to stay in this dance with 25 seconds each time down
and talk and move? I don't know. But I knew what this team was capable of. I
kept trying to paint that picture in their mind. This is what we are when
we're at our best.  
  
Q. Back to the teams you might face, and I do appreciate that you're not
looking ahead. You gave a broad summary of what Arizona could do that might
concern you. Could you do the same for Buffalo, please?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, because here's what I would say: The only reason I've said
that about Arizona, I have not watched them play a game this year. And I have
not watched Buffalo. I just happen to know a couple of the guys that Sean has.
I haven't watched either team play. I don't know if they play man, zone. I
won't watch any tape on any team until I'm done with this Davidson game. And
the reason is, is if Davidson beats us, why was I watching any other tape? So
I literally don't know a play they run, either team.  
  
Q. The climate of college basketball right now with the FBI
investigation going on, what changes would you like to see being made,
considering you've been in homes with star athletes and the families and the
environments that they come from?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, I'm going to ask you to maybe go back and look at what
I've said in the past. I've been saying the same thing for how many years, you
Lexington guys, four, five, six years. And I haven't changed. And I believe
it. I believe that for college kids, this is an unbelievable experience to
have a gap year if they need it. I think kids should be able to go from high
school to the NBA. I do believe that. But I don't think we should devalue
education. And if the kids do go, so there's 10 that go, 12, why would we
totally change all this?  
  
We just had the highest graduation rate of athletes in basketball and African
American athletes in basketball. We just had the highest graduation rate in
the history of our sport. And we're going to upset this? You devalue education
if you encourage kids. And who are we encouraging? What kids? Are we
encouraging don't worry about education, you don't need education, you become
a pro. So let's say 10,000 9th and 10th graders say, I'm not going to do
education, and who are we talking about? This isn't baseball. This is a
different sport. This isn't tennis. This is a different sport. You don't need
education.  
  
So when I tell you that we've had the highest graduation rate of African
American athletes in basketball, how many of those kids do you think went to
school thinking they're staying one or two years? 90 percent. And they ended
up finishing and getting a college degree.  
  
We've just got to make sure we're taking care of kids. I don't want to get
into it, because this is about this NCAA tournament, but there are things that
we can do to have a combine after the junior year to recommend, you need to go
to the NBA, the rest of you need to go to college. Do we need a basketball
rule? Why? If these 15, 18 kids went to the NBA and the others go to college
they're going to have to stay two or three years or they would have gone to
the NBA. So we don't need all that.  
  
If some kid like Anthony Davis grows from 6-3 to 6-11 and he wants to leave
after a year, okay. What's wrong with that? How do we support these families?
I didn't want to do this, but now that you've got me started. How do you
support these families? I'm in these homes. These families have dignity, they
don't want anybody involved in their lives, they want to do it themselves. But
if you look in that refrigerator and there's a can of corn in there, they may
take something. But if they can do it themselves, they'll do it themselves.
Let them get loans. Let the kids that have loans for their insurance, which we
already give, if you're eligible for that insurance, then you don't need the
money there, we'll loan the money for your families to travel. If your family
wants to move to a town they can take a loan and do it. And then we eliminate
all this stuff.  
  
These families, again, they want their child to have the best opportunity.
They want their child to be with people they trust. And we've just got to help
them. I come back to this, any decision we make, if we say, Is this right for
the kids, you'll be right. If you don't worry about the kids and you worry
about the sport, you don't make the right decisions for the kids. And this is
all about the kids.  
  
I say this with all respect, a 17-year-old going to the D league, who's
overseeing them? What if something happens? Who's responsible now? What
happens for these kids that come to college? They'll tell you it's the best
experience ever. I've never heard a player say, man, what a great year I had
in the G league. Not one. Not one. But they'll come back and say my year at
Kentucky was the best year of my life.  
  
Well, why are we looking at one player and saying this is what college
basketball is? I do have a right to talk about academics, and you know you say
your kids leave early. 17 have graduated. We have a thousand on the APR for
four or five years running. It's us and Bucknell. Please look at that one
there that said when you do by academics it's Kentucky and Bucknell.  
  
Now, I will say Bucknell beats us, but we're right there, fighting hard. And I
just think that we can do stuff. But to say let's throw this stuff away
because of a couple of things, I just don't agree with it.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 86  
  
North Carolina - 65  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: There's a hundred things I could say, and yet there's not a lot
to say. We got beat by a team that played better than we did. Got beat by a
team that the coach, head coach coached better than I did. These two guys up
here have given me so many thrills and taken me on so many unbelievable rides.
That's the overwhelming feeling that I have right now. It's one of sorrow and
sadness because we didn't play as well as we wanted to play. I didn't picture
it ending it like this. I pictured it ending with these guys having a huge
smile on their face, but that's not college basketball.  
  
I congratulate Billy and his club. I told him I was really happy for him
personally, and I meant that from the bottom of my heart. We had a difficult
time. We went about a 6-minute stretch there where I was just figuring it up
in the stat sheet we were 0-6 and three turnovers, 0-7 and three turnovers in
a 6-minute stretch from like 11 minutes down to 1137, down to 6-something and
five to six minute stretch there we weren't very good, and then we were
playing from behind. And I've done a poor job of getting these guys in what
they need to do at that point.  
  
So, it's -- again it's on me, but, you know, in coaching, you have some great,
great moments. You have some tough ones. These two guys right here
particularly been involved in some of the greatest moments I've ever had, and
right now I'm very appreciative for them and I can't -- I can't think of
anytime where I'm sadder. So, if you guys will ask the questions to the
players first so they can hustle on back and get showered, that would be
great.  
  
Q. Actually for both, as you guys know, fans are outpouring their love
for you guys and thanking you for the years that you played. Marcus Paige just
tweeted that, you know, he remembers you guys coming in as freshman, dancing
and yelling and arguing 24/7. He thanked you guys for what you've done for
UNC. What do you say to fans as your last time playing ball for UNC?  
JOEL BERRY II: I wish it wasn't my last time. I've had so much fun here and I
really felt like coming to North Carolina really turned my life around and
changed me into a young man. And I think that's the most important thing, and
just thinking about coming freshman year and, you know, with a short haircut
and not looking good on the court and then to now. I mean, I just got to thank
my teammates and thank my coaches for believing in me and having the
confidence in me. And like I said, just been a lot of fun. But, you know,
everybody sees what happens on the court, but, you know, the biggest thing for
our program is to -- well, for coaches to develop players and make -- get the
best out of them, but also, at the same time, make sure that he's continuing
the morals and values that our parents taught us when we were in high school.
And that was the biggest thing that my mom wanted Coach to do, and I think
that he did that for me. And so more than anything on the basketball court, I
appreciate Coach for doing that.  
  
THEO PINSON: I don't really know what to say. I didn't take any of this for
granted. I came in every day with a smile on my face, wanted everybody to have
a smile on their face, even on the lowest of lows when we were going through
stretches where we losing and always came in to try to be that spark as far as
putting a smile on everybody's faces. I know we don't have that right now, but
that's because the three up here are competitors. Everybody knows me, I'm --
I'm always smiling and stuff, but like this is tough but it's life.  
  
Q. Joel, you guys got off to a strong start and I believe was up 20 --
13. What changed after that and brought on the stretch that Coach was talking
about?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. At the start of the game, we were getting to the basket,
being aggressive, and that's what we wanted to do. And then we just started
settling for outside shots and, you know, the 3 wasn't going in, but every
time like we got the ball inside, we were getting some productive. And then on
the offensive end, on the defense end for us, their big guys got going and it
was just tough. It was tough to stop them and go shoot and outside shot and
miss and come back down and get the ball inside and shoot it right at the
basket. I think we just stopped being aggressive after we got the lead, and
that's why everything turned around.  
  
Q. Roy, I apologize if this is repetitive, just back --  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Does it feels, guys -- I was asking your teammates, they all said it
feels less like the end of a season and more like the end of an era with you
guys walking out. Does it feel that way for you as well?  
THEO PINSON: Just tough because me and Joel, we're the type of guys who really
try to bring joy to everybody and we hope we did that. It wasn't like we was
trying to. We just being ourselves. I want people to know that. It's like hope
nobody thinks this was an act. This is me like. I want everybody to have a
good time, enjoy the moment. Probably the main reason I'm not crying right now
is because I've enjoyed every single moment I had with Coach, Joel, and all my
teammates in the past, teammates in the locker room right now, just -- that's
the hardest thing. I won't be able to get on a plane with them, five hours to
L.A. to spend more time with them. It's over. That's the toughest part. It's
tough.  
  
Q. Just in the locker room talking to Andrew and Brandon Robinson,
Kenny, and some of the guys. They were talking about what they learned from
you guys, seeing you kind of grow -- some of them just one year, some two
years, seeing you guys grow and develop to become what you were going into
this weekend. Do you guys have an understanding of how much you've taught
these other guys, how much you passed on to them these last couple of years
from work ethic to competing and all that kind of stuff?  
JOEL BERRY II: For me personally, I just tried to get them to understand that
you got to put in the time and the work to be able to get what you want out of
being at this program. And, you know, it's hard coming in as a freshman and
trying to adjust to being on your own and trying to just being away from home
and learning how to be an adult. Not everyone can do that. And, you know, you
got freshman year I kind of took it for granted a little bit. Once I started
realizing that I had to put in the time and it's what I love to do, I had to
put in time for it. And that's when everything turned around for me. Hopefully
more than anything, I just hope I can leave for those guys that, you know, if
they want to get the best out of what they want to do, you have to put in the
time and the effort out of anything. That's what I want to leave here and
hopefully they can take that from me.  
  
THEO PINSON: Yeah. Like I said before, Coach -- like I said on senior night,
he let me be me. Learned how to -- as far as when it's game time, I know the
time and place when I need to be serious and the time where I can play around
little bit just to keep everybody loose. I mean, that's not -- hasn't been
that way since I've been here. As y'all say, we always loose. We won a
national championships last year, probably as loose we've ever been. Just have
fun playing the game. That's the biggest thing I try to teach the young guys,
have fun playing the game and play for each other and the coaching staff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel and Theo, thank you. Congratulations on a great year and a
great career. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the attachment to players is beyond evident. Talk about how
this program is bigger than basketball, because even after they graduate they
always gravitate back towards you. It's evident this program is much bigger
than what's on this court. Can you talk about the bond that you built with
these guys?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I hope it is. It's my dream, that's my goal. Best time as a
coach is when you see your players accomplish something. It was really
difficult to see the look on their faces. There's nothing better than that.
Nobody has got any job anywhere anytime that's better than the feeling I have
at those moments.  
  
I do try to coach the game of basketball, but I do try to tell them it's part
of life too. I told them it's the most inadequate feeling I ever felt. Feel it
all the time, last game of the year. I think I felt it more today than any
other time. I'm not ashamed to say I love these kids and if you only had any
idea how much fun that they have been for me, and three of the last four years
have been very difficult and those kids were my salvation. They really were.
Things were not pleasant. I didn't like what people were saying to me. Didn't
like what they were saying about me. I didn't like getting a piece of mail
that was addressed to "Mr. Cheating Bastard." Those kids in the court -- on
the court, excuse me, were my salvation and you have no idea how much fun that
was. And I don't want to be too dramatic, but that was hard for a long time
there and those kids really, really made my day everyday. And I've been the
luckiest man alive because I had kids that made me feel like what I said was
halfway important and, you know, when I was a younger coach, you guys know me,
shoot, I can cry at the drop of a handkerchief. I dropped it just a minute ago
trying to wipe something away.  
  
I had a writer one time say that, you know, I guess we're going to watch Roy
cry today. I told that sucker, "Don't tell me that to my face." He ran his ass
out of the room quickly, too. That doesn't bother me in the least bit.  
  
If you're coaching and you try to give them something that can stick with them
forever. That's always been really important to me. It's corny but that's
always been really important.  
  
Q. Coach, how often do you think of retirement?  
ROY WILLIAMS: The last 30 minutes (laughter). You know, I don't do that, guys.
I think about the next practice, the next game. One of my best friends in the
world, Jerry Green, asked me when I was Coach Smith's assistant, what's your
five-year or ten-year plan. I said never have one, never will have one. I try
to coach and do the best I can today and hopefully get a chance to do the same
thing again tomorrow. I realize I'm 67. I can't run up and down the sidelines,
I can't get out and demonstrate like I used to. And I wasn't a very good
player, but I could demonstrate what I wanted to. No, I don't think about
that. I think about jumping off the top of the building right now, but I don't
think of retirement.  
  
Q. Coach, how much satisfaction do you get out of watching two guys like
that grow and mature and pass that on to the younger guys, the way they were
just talking about in the locker room?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I get satisfaction out of that. I got a lot more satisfaction
out of them talking about those things last year after we won, too. But I want
to give them some things. My high school coach, you coach a guy and you see
some things you gave him 30 minutes later. It's your job to make sure it's
something positive. That's me.  
  
But I have a desperate -- probably not a good word -- I have a desperate
desire to win and to see the looks on their faces and in that locker room as
opposed to what I looked at a few moments ago.  
  
Q. Roy, why did their zone bother you so much? And when they weren't in
it in the second half, did that surprise you a little bit?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it bothered us a great deal, and I was surprised because
we've handled some pretty good zones pretty well and we've shot the ball
really well. I've always talked to you guys about having great balance. I
thought that was the most important thing on the offensive end is being able
to score inside and out. We've been way too far to the perimeter shot. Every
big game in the NCAA Tournament every game gets a little bigger. Last year
people thought it was an ugly game and it was if the only thing you care about
is a field goal percentage. You're playing for the National Championship,
there's a little pressure on the kids and perhaps my guys got a little more
pressure today than I wanted them to have because we had a basketball -- being
a basketball player at North Carolina carries some responsibility with it and
-- no, you go back and look. I don't know that anybody has really hurt us with
the zone. We didn't change anything last 48 hours. When the shots didn't go in
early, I really jumped on them because we had never gotten the basketball
inside and go 1-13 from 3 and then miss a wide open one the first or second
possession of the second half and they make two of them. It's hard to keep the
guys up.  
  
Q. Roy, your last answer sort of gives me a couple of questions. The
first one being, when you talk about the pressure that a Carolina basketball
player is feeling today, are we talking about a pressure that comes from
within or are we talking about a pressure that came from Texas A &M?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Oh, I was talking about pressure comes from within. If we lose
two games, people jumping off the boat and think we're about to go whacko or
something. We stayed the course pretty much the whole time. There is, we've
won. I like that pressure. People ask me does it bother me. Hell, there's no
person ever -- my boss is sitting right down there and Chancellor, they've
never put any pressure on me like I put on myself. No, I think you feel a
responsibility. I feel -- I feel a tremendous responsibility to be successful,
yes, but I do it to myself.  
  
Q. The dynamics that affected the game today, did you see Texas A &M --
did you find that their size affected you?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You watched the game. They blocked 70,000 shots. Come on now. It
was a more difficult game for us inside, which we knew, but, let's make sure
we don't do one thing, let's just don't say North Carolina screwed this up or
North Carolina didn't do that. Texas A&M is pretty doggone good. They did some
good things. What they did to us inside early in the game shocked us even
though we knew they were good, because it shocked us because we weren't making
outside shots and now all of a sudden I felt like I had kids looking at the
scoreboard tonight more than I ever had kids in my life. Let's make sure we
give Texas A&M credit, too.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up on that. Roy, did it feel like yesterday you saw a
little bit of this coming in terms of the matchup for you guys and their size?
I'm sure you take no solace in being right. It did seem like their interior
play got the best of you.  
ROY WILLIAMS: They did. We've beaten people up over the years and the tables
were reversed today. We've been able to mask the problem all year long by
making enough jump shots and getting to the free throw line, doing some
things. We weren't able to do that today. Joe, you see probably most of the
games if not all the games this year. I'd say probably the only game where
somebody just dramatically handled us inside or maybe at a higher level, but
they were good.  
  
I tried to recruit Tyler Davis early and Robert Williams. Nobody jumps any
higher and blocks more shots. I still think that Garrison, Sterling, Huff and
Walker, they are -- those guys are going to be good players. I said a couple
of times the last couple of weeks that the kind of guys we have, when they're
juniors, sophomores, I'll say because that means next year, too, sophomores,
juniors, seniors, they're able to handle some of the more gifted freshmen.
Well, today they had guys that weren't gifted freshmen. Tyler and Robert have
been around awhile. I think our guys are going to be good, but today was a
fear. I guess we dodged it quite a bit all season long.  
  
Q. Coach, you play in a tough conference, one of the toughest
conferences in America, and last week you had a grueling week getting all the
way to the Championships game. Then you have to come back and do it again. Do
you think that ever takes a toll on your team or maybe the teams in the
conference based on what happened to Virginia and what happened to y'all
today?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, I don't know. Maybe because I'm not that deep a
thinker, but I didn't think we were -- we had fresh attitude or fresh legs,
either one today. I told them I hate some things about summer basketball. I
love other things because it gives kids a chance to be seen and far more
positive than they are negative. I watched a game one time where one of my
guys I eventually got made one of the stupidest blankety blankety plays before
the end of the game and they lose. They come over and Coach says all right
guys, grab your stuff, we're on court 3 in one hour. I don't like that because
winning by God is important. If you make mistakes I want you to feel badly
about it. It's more teaching and training, but I did feel like -- and one of
the coaches even said they were acting like it's a summer league game. We got
another game in an hour or so.  
  
I don't have an answer for why we didn't feel like we were at a high level
physically. I don't have an answer for why we didn't feel like we were at a
high level mentally. But I thought they had much more a workmanlike attitude
than we did and really pretty early in the game. And that's my thought as a
Coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Thank you, guys.

### [Barry Brown Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34873)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 50  
  
UMBC - 43  
  
BRUCE WEBER: You know, can't say enough about our guys. Just so proud of them.
I know it was an ugly win and probably hard to watch, but they're perseverance
we talked about, their courage, and just it's gutsy. We just kept saying we
weren't scoring, but we kept guarding, we're still winning. And I don't know
if we lost of the lead the whole second half, but, you know, we talked about
being the best defensive team in the tournament. I guess 59-43 are pretty good
numbers against two really high-powered offensive teams. And then down the
stretch, we didn't have many big plays during the game, but down the stretch
obviously Xavier made some big plays, the tip on, the pull up jumper. Kam had
a little jumper. Barry made a big pull-up jumper. Mark got a layup, several
blocks down the stretch. You know, Xavier had some steals. The steal was
probably the big thing. I think it was one and Xavier cut the middle, got the
steal, drove down and got the dunk, got the 3, and I don't know, they might
only scored one basket after that.  
  
You know, I just, again, go back to their character, their courage and
persistence and they bought in, they care about each other, and, you know,
couldn't be more proud we're going to the Sweet 16.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for Xavier and Barry.  
  
Q. Barry, have you ever been in that hard of a fought game?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, yeah, I've been in some tough games where maybe we
didn't come out the second half and execute like we did, but I think with our
guys the experience of having those losses, those tough losses, prepared us
for this moment right here, and were able to buckle down, stay poised and make
the big plays in the end.  
  
Q. The stats show that the defense was key, but there were probably have
dozen times, maybe more, where they came down with a chance to take the lead
and they never did. You guys really shut them down in critical moments. Talk
about that.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Well, I mean, we had a great scouting report knowing what
they did, and I think all the coaches collaborated on it. I think Cielo
(phonetic) took the head on it. We all bought in and we all watched our
matchups and watched improvement, everyone because we knew we'd be switching a
lot this game. Down the stretch, I mean we buckled down and got some stops.
They had most opportunities, like you said, to take the lead and we were able
to fly around. Even when things broke down, we flew them down and contested
every shot and boxed out.  
  
Q. X, the steal and dunk, did that kind feel like the break-through
moment when you guys shook it loose and finally felt like were you getting
control of it?  
XAVIER SNEED: Definitely. Got the steal and dunk, like you said, and just gave
us a lot of energy and that boost to show us we could win this game, and we
pulled through and got the win.  
  
Q. Barry, I'm just wondering if you can talk about -- if you could go
through the challenge that Lyles presented. And you have to feel pretty happy
with how you contained him defensively today.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Yeah. Like I said, we all watched our matchups and I knew
that was going to be my matchup for most of the game. I watched him. As soon
as I found out we were going to play them, I started watching at 1:00 a.m.,
seeing what he did and seeing what he liked to pick his shots and how the team
gets him open: He's a good player, a plethora of moves and ways of scores and
get to the basket and ways to get his shot off. But I mean, it wasn't just me,
like I said, we did a lot of switching. My teammates contained him as well. We
had each other's back when he got into the lane, didn't let him really get
going all game.  
  
Q. X, if you can believe this, a lot of us never had a dunk in this
crowd. Can you walk us through kind of the process of how you know it's going
to come off and finishing that process.  
XAVIER SNEED: I'm always crushing the glass. Somebody didn't box me up. I saw
the shot go up and did the play with the rest of it.  
  
Q. Barry, this is, you know, two games in three days and you have shut
down a couple of the most dynamic scorers that you're going to find in the
tournament. Can you describe the feeling of satisfaction you have when you do
something like this, you know, is it a point of pride?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, I take a lot of pride in my defense personally. My
coaches know that. They trust me and my teammates trust me to guard the best
guard on each team every game, night in, night out. I mean, I guess they see
the work I put in and the watching the film on them and stuff like that. Plus
the scouting report we're going to have every time to let me know some of the
other stuff that they do. And I mean it's a credit to my coaches and teammates
for having my back and trust me to guard the best player.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: When I get it, I'm happy. I hold them to 4 of 15, I think
that's pretty good. Like I said, my teammates have my back. It wasn't just me,
really all of us containing him and stopping him in the lane when he got to
the lane. He hit some big shots down the stretch. For the most part we
contained him enough to the to let him score in bunches.  
  
Q. Both players, can you just describe the feeling of knowing you've
gotten this far and going to the Sweet 16 and also how did Coach Weber hair
get to be like it is?  
BRUCE WEBER: It's real.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: I'm still taking it all in right now to be in the Sweet 16. It's
been a long time since we've been there, first time under Coach Weber here.
Just a great feeling.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, hats off to Coach, man, hats off to our whole
coaching staff and all the players, all the hard work we put. Been a long time
coming, and I'm just taking it all in like X said. And it's surreal to be in a
position that we are, but I mean with the work we put in, we deserve it and
we're going to show what we can do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take credit for his hair.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We had a little pool party in the locker room (laughter).  
  
Q. Barry, when you were having the defensive moment with Maura when he
started hitting 3s, you ended up coming with a steal that led to kind of a
momentum change. Can you tell me about the excitement when you get a change
like that, what takes place in your mind?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I'm not really sure exactly what play, but I mean just
getting the steal, I know he was hitting a few 3s kind of in the same spot
almost and they kind of had the momentum, but getting it still, kind of
shifted the momentum. I remember kind of going back and forth with each other
a little bit. At that time I kind of knew we kind of had them a little bit. We
were flying around and I think it was frustrating them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Two more questions.  
  
Q. Barry, what was the problem with your offense? I mean you didn't
shoot real well. Was it them or were you guys just cold tonight?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I think we were a little bit cold tonight. They had a great
defensive scheme for us, but I think it was execution and just being -- have a
little bit too many jitters, kind of playing me ball, 1 on 1 and not executing
like the Coach drew the plays up. Over the course of the game, we started
buying in a little bit more and staying poised, control ourselves and
executing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more question for the student-athletes. Anyone interested?
Okay, guys, thanks. Head back to the locker room. Congratulations, keep it
going. Good luck to you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When we talked to you yesterday, I don't know how much you had seen
UMBC or broke them down or talked to your players about them. What did you
have to say to them kind of to make sure they knew they were playing an
opponent that was dangerous and could get after them a little bit, one they
hadn't heard of maybe before?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think if it didn't get their attention that they beat Virginia
by 20, the number 1 team in the ACC, in the conference, that they won the
conference and the tournament that had the most teams in the tournament, it
had to catch their attention. I told you guys yesterday, I called them back
about midnight and we had a little meeting and I just said guys, one, I joked,
I told you Virginia wasn't very good; and then, two, I said this other team is
really good and -- I thought we forced some things early, they jumped on us,
7-0, guys trying to make plays, you know. It was a big game for our guys and,
you know, then we settled down and grinded it out. We got lots of stops after
that 7-0 run. Finally got the lead. Kept the lead at halftime. All we talked
about at halftime was positive energy, you know, stay the course, keep doing
what we do, we got to keep guarding. And then -- in the huddles I kept saying
somebody step up and make a play. And you know Xavier stealing the dunk, the
tip dunk. Kam hit the little pull up, Barry hit a pull up. Cartier got a
steal. And Mak blocked a couple shots in that stretch, and there was a lot of
big plays, and, you know, they're good kids. They really care. They want to do
well and they just stayed the course, and you can't be more proud of them.  
  
Q. Bruce, Barry clearly does not like to talk about himself and his
performance. So could you please speak to the effort that he turned in and how
he ought to feel about it?  
BRUCE WEBER: Yeah. I said since the beginning of the season, he's if not the
best defensive player -- Carter is really good at West Virginia in the Big 12.
You know, maybe one of the best in the country. He takes a lot of pride in it.
He's got a lot of confidence. When he was a freshman, I said who is going to
be our defensive stopper? I would hoping some of the older guys would step,
you know, up and Barry said I am. He's taken on that role. He got crocked a
little bit when he was young. But now he studies the game. To do what he did
to Marcus Foster the overnight is -- it takes energy, it takes courage, but it
also takes being a student of the game. And he knew where he was going.  
  
You know, Lyles is so dynamic, can score in a lot of ways. Got him on the 3.
The other part with Barry he was so tired. He was so, so tired and he kept
fighting it. And we were asking him to make plays on offense, make his free
throws, guard the best guys. You know, he just grinded it out, gutted it out,
and, you know, he's been our leader. When you have great leadership and guys
that care, it makes it so easy for the coaches.  
  
Q. Coach, every time we ask something like this, you always praise the
players and talk about it's for them. I know that's sincere. I'll try it one
more time. For you what does this win mean?  
BRUCE WEBER: Again, I'm happy for these guys because they worked so hard. I
threw this at them way back in April last spring. I said guys, we won a game.
The next step is to get to the Sweet 16. I threw it at them a couple weeks
ago. Again, just put that little vision in there. You know, just obviously we
didn't think 16 was going to make -- beat a 1. You thought it would be a
little different situation, but we just said we could write history tonight.
No 9 has ever beaten a 16 to go to the Sweet 16, so we wrote our own history
tonight. They wrote history the other day. And, you know, our staff an
unbelievable job. I challenge them. I've told you guys my most -- one of my
most disappointing losses was LaSalle for Rodney, for Shane, all those guys, I
didn't think they prepared, I didn't think we did as good a job as we would
should. We had our chances down the stretch, but it was so disappointing and I
just -- I challenged our coaches. They were up till 6:00 yesterday morning. I
went to bed about 4:00, tried to go to bed at 4:00. And they did a great job
and Barry talked about it. They buy into the scouting report, they believe our
coaches. They all had part of it.  
  
So, between the coaches, the players, it's just a nice reward and for our
fans, too. It's great. They all -- always talk about Jacob Pullen going to the
Sweet 16. We got another group that did it without our best player, and I
think you talk about that. That's pretty good that they were able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, was there any point in the second half when you felt the
pressure was getting to your guys, because this was a team that wouldn't go
away. Did you feel like they were feeling a little bit of the pressure of the
world against them?  
BRUCE WEBER: Big thing we tried to do, stay in the huddle, stay confident and
poised. No matter how dumb we played or how bad we played, I just kept saying
we're fine guys, we're still winning, keep guarding and somebody step up and
make some plays and we did down the stretch and we didn't execute a whole
bunch.  
  
You know, the thing you guys, you got to realize, in less than a week we had
to change schemes that we've run for five months. And Xavier sometimes he'll
look at me, I'll call something. He goes, "Coach, I don't know." So in the
middle of the play I have to yell something else. Even today we stayed at
shoot-around about an hour and a half because they kept saying, "Coach, I got
to know the out-of-bounds plays, I got to know this." Even the other guys, not
only Xavier but now you put Kam, Cardy, and Barry together, they haven't run
all the stuff. So, sometimes we looked a little ugly but they found a way to
win.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the unpredictability of a 16 beating a 1.
Obviously that's never happened before this weekend. This will be the first
regional ever where there's no top 4 seeds in Atlanta next weekend.  
BRUCE WEBER: Is that where we're going?  
  
Q. Yes. From that standpoint --  
BRUCE WEBER: I haven't looked at it. I'm being honest.  
  
Q. From that standpoint, what is it about this tournament that just
lends to this or the sort of unpredictability?  
BRUCE WEBER: We told the guys before, look at today alone, Michigan State,
North Carolina at home, basically at home losing today. You know, just shows
the balance in the tournament, the vulnerability ability of every team. You
got to come to play. You got to stay away from injuries. Obviously Virginia
gets an injury, Purdue has and injury, we have an injury. So many injuries
down the stretch here. It's what makes March Madness special and it kills the
coaches because it's so hard and you think you have a great team. Matchups are
important. Making the plays, having the right mojo at the right time. And, you
know, again, why does everyone watch it? It's March Madness and you never know
what's going to happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 18, 2018

  

### [Ryan Odom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35071)

### [K.J. Maura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35073)

### [Jairus Lyles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35075)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 50  
  
UMBC - 43  
  
RYAN ODOM: Obviously congratulations to Coach Weber and Kansas State. I
thought they played excellent defense, you know, throughout the game. Their
athleticism bothered us at times and their switching certainly early in the
game in the first half throughout the first half. I thought we were kind of a
little bit stagnant on the offensive end. We were standing a little bit too
much and they had a lot to do with that. They were switching and staying --
keeping their bodies in front of us.  
  
In the second half we were fortunate to be down 5 actually at half and we felt
like we hadn't played very well, you know, amongst us in the locker room and,
you know, we came out in the second half. We felt like we had a pressure a
little bit more. Obviously we had some success there. We felt like we had to
move the ball and move our bodies a whole lot more than we did in the first
half on offense, and our guys certainly did that. We tried to get multiple
drives into the paint, felt like we did that. And felt like we got some good
shots, you know. When it was 38-37 Jairus went down the lane and got a shot
that he's made a zillion times for us all year and just didn't go down. Wasn't
meant to be there.  
  
But, you know, nothing can take away this -- this loss can't away what these
kids, these two in particular and obviously the rest of our team has been able
to accomplish, you know, throughout this entire season. Certainly in the NCAA
Tournament, just to be here is a blessing for sure. I wrote one word on the
board for these guys, you know, once we got into the locker room at the end
about how I felt about them and just proud, you know, just very proud of these
kids and what they've been able to do as the representatives that they are for
our university and just captured our country and beyond, to be honest, from a
sporting perspective and it's really, really neat to see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for Jairus and K.J.  
  
Q. Jairus, can you talk about what K-State's defense did to slow you
down, both you personally and the team.  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think they did a good job of speeding us up. We had a lot of
turnovers. But for the most part I felt like we got open shots. We didn't make
any shots today. It happens some games. Unfortunately it happened today. I
felt like for the most part we got open shots.  
  
Q. Either student. Despite this loss, do you guys still see the win in
all of this with the shoes from Steph Curry, like your coach said, the world
fell in love you and everyone was really cheering for you. So even though you
lost a really tough game, do you still see the bright spot in this?  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, I think we do. We put our name on the map. We giving hope to
teams that come to the tournament with lower seeds. I think we're giving hope
to guys that are not even that tall like me. So, people that feel like they
underdogs in their life, I think we given the hope to everything they want to
do in life.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah. Of course we had a great season. We made history the other
night. But we wanted to win tonight. We felt like we had a good chance of
winning, but unfortunately we lost. But I felt like overall we understand that
what we did the other night, we understand we had a great season. We did the
unexpected. So, we're proud of each other for that.  
  
Q. I'm curious if there's any fatigue maybe in the second half? I think
you guys missed some free throws that you typically would make, some open
looks. Did that contribute to it at all?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I'm not going to make any excuses. I got to hit those free
throws. I missed a couple shots I usually make. Just, you know, just one of
those days.  
  
Q. The world was looking at you as Cinderella, but I don't think you
guys looked at yourself that way. How did you -- when did you figure out that
it wasn't going to happen? Looked like you were mentally into it the whole
game.  
K.J. MAURA: I think we never lost confidence in ourselves even when they had a
little run and 5-point lead. Still the mentality we're going to win the game.
We didn't execute it down the stretch.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Like he said, we didn't execute enough. We didn't make enough
plays down the stretch to win. We had a couple chances to take the lead with
about I think two minutes left, or two, three minutes left. But we didn't make
shots, like I said before. And they made shots, timely shots. I think they hit
two buzzer-beaters basically at the end of the shot clock and put them up
about 4 points or 5 points.  
  
Q. How would you describe how different your preparation was the past 48
hours given everything you guys had to deal with from anything you've
experienced before? And secondly, did maybe some of that take a little bit out
of you heading into the game?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I mean we knew coming into this tournament that every team we
were going to play was going to be a high major given our seed. So we knew we
had to prepare for bigger people, bigger players, bigger guards, bigger big
men. We knew it was going to be a tough task anytime we stepped on the floor.  
  
Q. K.J., looked like it was about 9 seconds left when y'all got subbed
out of the game. Not only hugging your reserves but hugging the K-State
players. What went into that moment and kind of what that meant to you?  
K.J. MAURA: I think it was mutual respect. It was a good game. We played hard,
both teams played hard. The guard from Kansas State came out, good people from
Baltimore, too. So we had a good relationship. We was talking during the whole
game. They good kids, good guys. I think we got a little emotional, but it was
just encouraging them to make it happy and make a run in the tournament.  
  
Q. I know it's currently Spring Break, but eventually you'll go back to
campus and everyone else will be there. What kind of reception do you hope for
and what kind of reception do you anticipate?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Well, our fans traveled a long way these past few days to come
support us. We've had a tremendous support from our fans all year, people at
the school. I expect them to be very happy with us when we get back, proud of
us. But, you know, of course we wanted to go into the next round. It didn't
happen that way. I expect a warm welcome.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, I expect them to be really proud for what we've done. I
expect a lot of happiness, lot of smiles around campus. I think we've been
given that from the support of the fans came here a long way to see us. That
means a lot for us, and I really expect a lot of smiles when we come back.  
  
Q. Coach, the guys in the locker room were saying --  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first.  
  
Q. I'm sorry. I missed the opening.  
When you guys look back on your time at UMBC and in five years from now, is
this going to be the thing that stands out the most to you or what will you
think about the most?  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: I got here, when I got here first we were a 4-win team that
year, and then the next year we went on to win 7 games. And then Coach Odom
and his staff came in, we won 21 games and this year we had a tremendous
season. This is definitely one of the biggest memories we remember for life.
So, yeah.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think the biggest moment for us was Jairus Lyles's shot against
Vermont. Nothing can top that. But we really enjoyed ourselves after the
Virginia game. I think it was something that nobody expected. Just us inside
the locker room, we expected to win. Outside of ourselves nobody thought we
were going to win. I think both moments are really big for us and it's going
to live forever for UMBC.  
  
Q. Jairus, a lot of people have been comparing you to C.J. McCollum as
far as his play with Lehigh and what he had done with Duke. How do you feel
about that comparison?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Anytime you can compare it to a NBA player as great as he is,
it's a blessing. There's more work to be done. Hopefully I can play in that
league one day. So, you know, it's always a blessing to be compared to a great
NBA player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: You can head back to the locker room. Congratulations on a
great year and great career. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The guys were saying that you told them after the game about friend
of yours in Rome and another in Korea that couldn't stop talking about UMBC.
Obviously the upset win puts you guys on the map. Why do you think that people
resonated with this team or fell in love with them?  
RYAN ODOM: Certainly we were picked -- we were a 16 seed. I think that's where
it all started. When you began to watch this team and how they played, they
play with passion, they play with heart, they play together, you know, which
what is we say when we put our hands in the huddle every time.  
  
We do things together for one another, and obviously when you have a big win
like that and it's so shocking, you know, people love to see that. They love
to see the upset. And our guys handled it with grace and understood the
circumstances. They weren't pounding their chests or anything. They expected
to be here and expected to compete, no different than they did tonight. And
just didn't go our way tonight and Kansas State deserved to win.  
  
But, I'm just really proud of the way these guys handled themselves, you know,
on a daily basis. And from the moment we stepped on campus to now, you know,
the growth that I've seen in each one of them, you know, is monumental, really
special. I mean from a leadership standpoint, from just everything, how they
handle their business. I don't have to worry about very much with this crew.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously these guys hate to lose. You know them as well as
anyone. Do you think it will be easy for them to focus more on the good of the
season, what they did Friday, what they did against Vermont, versus what they
might feel as a missed opportunity by not having a good shooting night
tonight?  
RYAN ODOM: Absolutely. That's what we talked about in the locker room. We
couldn't really talk about that after the Virginia game because we had to play
Kansas State, you know, tonight. And but once your season ends, you know, you
can kind of reflect and look back at all things that happen throughout.  
  
I go back at the Albany game where we got pounded up there and the way -- like
it takes true character to come back from that and, you know, our guys were
able to do that collectively. Wasn't just one person. One person it wouldn't
have happened. You know, my staff, you know, was unbelievable. I have a great
staff and, you know, I'm just so proud of everybody involved in the program.
Because it could have gone down at that moment, and true character is
determined at moments like that when it's, you know, you're at your worst and
you got to answer the bell.  
  
These guys did that throughout the year.  
  
Q. As your starters left the game with 20 seconds to go or something,
lot of K-State players came over and talked to them. What did you see in that
moment? And I mean you don't see that a lot.  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I think exactly what K.J. said. You know, just a mutual
respect. I mean, I think I've heard from so many coaches around the country
that have texted and just been so excited for what has happened for these kids
and seeing them play the way that they played and, you know, over this
tournament and in our conference tournament. And, you know, I think the Kansas
State guys respected how hard our guys tried to win, and likewise we respected
how hard they tried to win and they got it done.  
  
Q. Coach, if you had a message to your fan base or just the whole
country about what you did here this weekend, what would that be?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, I mean just believe in yourself, you know. I think that's the
first thing, you know. People will tell you in life you can't do something and
if you believe them, then you won't. And these kids never wavered, you know,
throughout, and they believed that they could do this and they got it done.  
  
Q. Where do you feel like you lost of this game here tonight?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I think it certainly was the turnovers. We had way too many
turnovers. I couldn't tell you the last time we had 17 turnovers in a game.
K.J. having -- I think he had 6. He's immaculate with the ball. He had 6
turnovers in this game and credit Kansas State for knocking balls away and
having active hands and putting us in some positions that we didn't want to be
in.  
  
So I think it was there. Certainly the free-throw shooting was not what it
needed to be. This is really the first game that that's kind of really hurt
us. We have not been a good free-throw shooting team all year, not from lack
of working on it. But, you know, usually when Jairus gets up there or K.J.
gets up there, those guys shoot the ball really well from the free-throw line.
Even Jairus missed a few in the game today.  
  
Q. The wins obviously have been great, but when you kind of look back on
this particular group what are you going the take away the most from what they
gave you this season?  
RYAN ODOM: How much they gave for one another. Again, it's unselfish. That's
how I describe them. And, you know, Jairus really grew this year from a
leadership standpoint, him coming back. They had a goal. They wanted to win
the championships. They accomplished that. That's what I'm going to remember
most about them. They set out, you know, to win it and they got it done and
they did it through hard work. They did it through loving one another. They
did it through unselfishness and believing in one another. And, you know, that
shot will go down in history at Vermont. Lot of tears that day, everybody was
crying after that win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. So there's a lot of talk around campus about Jairus Lyles being
perhaps the best player in UMBC basketball history. What are your thoughts on
that?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. He's obviously right there. I mean all time -- the most wins
in school history, you know, he broke the single season scoring record. You
know, he's just been an amazing being, amazing player. And, you know, credit
to -- I think Thomas needs credit for this, too, the previous coach and his
staff. I didn't recruit Jairus and they got him to campus. They got him to
come to UMBC and the rest is history.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Back of the room.  
  
Q. Does your job in recruiting and getting people to know about UMBC
become any easier after this weekend?  
RYAN ODOM: Oh, no. We'll see. We have to -- we all have to go out and recruit,
all the universities, and try to get the best student-athletes that we can
get. UMBC is a unique place, you know. Lot of high achieving kids on campus,
and, you know, that's what we want. We want guys that want to be great, you
know, from a basketball perspective and want to play after college. But, at
the same time, we want folks that, you know, are highly motivated academically
that can -- you know, want to do great things past basketball. Because the air
goes out of the ball at some point for everybody and you don't want to have
the "oh boy, what now moment?"  
  
That's why UMBC is so great, you know. It transforms lives, you know. Our
president is right in there with the students. And it's not just the athletes,
it's everybody and, you know, it's a really neat thing to see.  
  
Q. Coach, your dad was telling a story last week about leading up to the
Virginia game, how were you a ball boy. He could remember you riding your bike
to John Paul Jones Arena as a kid when he was coaching. You talked about
sharing this with your team. But being around your parents over the last
couple of days, is there anything that you'll just kind of take with you
forever, whether it was a conversation or just a few minutes together? Is
there anything that stands out from just being able to share this with them?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. Certainly I love my mom and my dad to death. They're so
supportive. They believe in their sons, you know, obviously Lane and myself.
And, you know, they're just so supportive, but the hug after beating UVA was
very, very special. I'll say this, having dad at practice, you know, the last
couple of days has been really neat. He's so good around the kids, you know.
He jokes with them and they love having him around.  
  
Back in October they sang happy birthday to him at one of the practices
because he happened to be there on his birthday and they were messing with his
hair and all that. He's a funny, funny guy. He loves the game and he loves
kids. He loves to help kids and see them, you know, really, really do well.
And my mom is, as anybody will tell you, is the nicest lady on the entire plan
net.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. Ryan, while we're on the subject of connections like that, I'm
curious if you were able to look into the UMBC teammates of yours and what
that meant to you?  
RYAN ODOM: I wasn't able to pick everybody out. I had so many friends, guys
from Hampden-Sydney, guys from RJR that came to the game. It was really,
really special. Colleague teammates of mine and, you know, it's amazing that
we were this close, you know, that all of my close friends could be able to
come to the game and my wife's friends as well and my kids's friends, my
parents' friends, my brother's friends. It was a special, special weekend here
for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, Coach.  
  
RYAN ODOM: Okay. Thanks.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 86  
  
North Carolina - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from the Coach and take
questions first for the student-athletes.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Great win. Great team win. Great a performance from everybody. I
thought once we slowed them up in transition, our zone gave them some
problems. Fortunately they missed some shots. Did a good job of rebounding the
ball and taking care of the ball, especially in the first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tonny, specifically, for you, this is your second trip to the Sweet
16 in two years. What does this mean to you as a senior?  
TONNY TROCHA-MORELOS: Well, it mean a lot, my senior year, I wanted to do
something with the young guys. I mean I did this when I was a sophomore and
great feeling. I talked to the freshmen, it's nothing better than winning a
game in the NCAA Tournament. So it's really good feeling to keep dancing.  
  
Q. Tyler, how did y'all -- why do you think y'all are so dominant inside
and do you think you surprised them with the overall athleticism that y'all
had?  
TYLER DAVIS: We just stuck to the game plan, played to our strengths. We know
we have the advantage on the inside with most teams. We do what we do
everyday, go to the war on the inside and eat glass.  
  
Q. Other than statistically speaking, what did you guys have that UNC
didn't that gave you this dominant win? Whoever can answer.  
TYLER DAVIS: We had a certain togetherness today. We came out there from the
jump, I thought -- we didn't have the fastest start, but we were together the
whole time. We stuck together and got the W.  
  
Q. Tyler, seeing the way that this team performed on the perimeter, was
that something you noted that if you could make them pay beyond the arc that
it would end up turning the tide in your favor?  
TYLER DAVIS: I can't hear, I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Seeing the way they performed against Lipscomb and Coach Williams
noted the other day any team feeling less than confident about their perimeter
game, they need to play Carolina and everything opens. Is there something you
saw and were able to take advantage of that?  
TYLER DAVIS: We knew we would get open looks. I think we took advantage of our
opportunities. We did a great job of moving the ball, playing inside out,
getting great open looks and knocking them down.  
  
Q. For TJ and Admon, defensively you held them scoreless during a key
stretch in the first half, about the middle of the first half, about a
6-minute stretch there where they didn't score the basketball at all and
missed 8 field goals in a row. If you could take us through just defensively
the intensity out there in that key stretch that allowed you to build that
lead?  
TJ STARKS: Coach Kennedy, he preached defense. We knew today we was going to
play against a great offense team. We knew we was going to have to key in on
defense and lock-down, and we knew we wanted to win, we were going to have to
shut their players down at least a couple possessions, so that's exactly what
we did and we just got the win.  
  
ADMON GILDER: What TJ was saying, Coach Kennedy talked about going into this
game, only team that can really beat us is ourself. And then as you see we
played our brand of basketball, which we do on everyday basis. And so like DJ
got a couple steals early for us, Robert used his size and being able to block
shots. That's what we do, force teams to taking tough shots. And give North
Carolina credit, they're a great team, but.  
  
Q. I'm asking DJ, can you talk about early in the game Tyler dominated
inside and that seemed to open up your game in the perimeter game where really
the 3-point shots started falling.  
DJ HOGG: Our offense is inside out. We have the two best bigs in the country.
They draw double teams. Luckily they got the ball out and around and I was
ready to shoot, got it going.  
  
Q. Question for Tyler and DJ, how would you describe the way that upper
size and length had an impact on Carolina?  
DJ HOGG: Size and length. I think was more effort versus size and length. I
mean, because they were big, too, but we just focused on playing harder and
playing more together, staying connected. And then our size and length, I
guess, gave us an advantage, but I think it was more effort.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Definitely effort. We have great size, we did have great length.
I knew this game, I was going to have to work hard to keep their bigs off the
glass. And DJ and Rob and the other guys did a great job of contract the
glass, helping me out on the glass.  
  
Q. TJ or Tyler, both you guys, you guys are now the second team to make
history in Charlotte. UNC never lost a game in Charlotte prior to tonight. Did
you come in -- did know that coming in, or did your Coach talk to you about
that and how do you feel to be the second team to make history in Charlotte?  
TJ STARKS: I didn't know I was -- this is my first time on a --  
  
Could you repeat the question. My bad.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Carolina never -- in the first round. What is it like being a
part of this, beating Carolina for the first time here?  
  
TJ STARKS: It felt good. We was together, like we all said, we were together.
We came to play and ready the play from yesterday. We was talking about this
our whole life, our whole season, basically, so we was ready for the moment.
It is -- it was very challenging because, like I say, North Carolina, they're
a great team, play together, got great offensive threats, defensive threats.
We came together and got the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Historic because it's your first tournament.  
  
Q. Admon, I think that you guys probably expected from the very
beginning of the season that you would be a team that was capable of doing
this but it wasn't always there. Why do you think the team is what you
expected it to be finally now?  
ADMON GILDER: Because Coach Kennedy, he's done a great job of keeping us
altogether. We've been through so much as a team and he's always preached, you
know, staying connected, staying together. And so we got to give him the
credit. So he's been a day one, he's always talked to each one of us everyday
before practice. He's talked to us some of our leaders that we have today and
so he always adds different things, what we can do better as a team. So I can
say Coach Kennedy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Head back to the locker room. Congratulations.
Good luck to you. Questions now for Coach Kennedy.  
  
Q. Coach, you had three players with a double-double tonight. You had
place touch on the need for comradery, that need to stick together tonight. To
have that much on the glass as well as in scoring, what does that say about
this team?  
BILL KENNEDY: We shared the ball. I think we had 7 or 8, I don't know how many
assists we had in the first half. Moved the ball, talked about making one more
pass. Our goal was to defend the 3-point line and make them take tough 2s. You
block 8 shots, there's a lot of tough 2s. Our game plan worked. They didn't
shoot the ball well, we took them out of rhythm, took them out of transition,
and fortunately when they did get some open looks at the free throw line in
the first half against our zone, they missed some shots and -- that they
usually make. And you got to have some of that happen at this time of year to
continue to advance on. I don't think they played their best, but I think
fortunately we were able to get the win and hopefully we had something to do
with that.  
  
Q. That three-game losing streak in February, at that point in the
season, how worried were you about the direction of the season? How worried
were you about your job, and what did you have to do to get this team to
finish strong and play the way it's capable of playing?  
BILL KENNEDY: We always worry when you lose as a coach, and you always know
your job is in jeopardy when you lose games. And so -- I got tremendous faith
and know God has got my back. We never gave up. These guys bought into how we
needed to play and bought into some details that we weren't doing in that
stretch. And we lost I think 1-point game to Missouri. We lost a couple of
close games and really just had one game we didn't play well. But our biggest
problem was the beginning of the SEC play when we had two guys with knee
injuries, and that's where you want to be your best in the beginning of the
conference play, and we weren't our best at that point.  
  
Q. Your zone took them out of their rim rut in the first half,
obviously. Did you anticipate that they were going to go into halftime trying
to scheme the zone? Because you came out of it and didn't play it in the
second half and they just didn't seem to figure that out.  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, when they had certain lineups in the game, we wanted to
play zone. When they had certain lineups in the game, we played man.
Fortunately I think we rattled their confidence being up 14 at half here at
home, the pressure goes -- reverts back to them. And when they did trap us, we
got a couple of dunks. And when you get layups or make open 3s, we're tough to
beat when we make 3s all year. I don't know how many games we've lost when
we've made more than eight 3s. I don't know what our record is. You make ten
3s and have the post guys we have, we're tough to beat.  
  
Q. Coach, come out the second half, they got to start well to get back
in the game. It felt DJ may have played his best basketball since his
suspension. Would you agree with that with everything he was doing?  
BILL KENNEDY: DJ Hogg was tremendous. Aggressive on the defensive end. He had
blocked shots. He got a steal. He got some deflections. He played like a
junior plays in the tournament that's been in a tournament before, and really
proud of him because he's been through some tough stretches, too, shooting the
ball. But did he some other things to help us win tonight that -- today that
were really big.  
  
Q. Billy, I was trying to get something with Admon, but he was pretty
much just heaping the praise on you. I don't know if it's the stage or what it
is, but why is the team playing its best now? You closed the seasoning losing
4 out of 7.  
BILL KENNEDY: We talked about in the beginning of last spring, we struggled
last year and we talked about March Madness all year long. And that was our
goal, and we came to a point in our season where our backs were against the
wall where we knew we had to win games and I really think it changed, our
whole attitude changed, and we played with more of a sense of urgency in
practice, practice habits got better, and we just got better -- we grew up,
you know, like the light came on. We beat Vandy at Vandy, which is a tough
task in our league. And from then on our guys have been different. And when we
prepare well and we're locked in and we play together, we're as good as
advertised.  
  
Q. Billy, about nine minutes or so without Davis really getting going
offensively, but during the 15-0 run, I think he scored 9. How critical was
that to start feeling the big fella and him to start feeling it offensively?  
BILL KENNEDY: His presence, even though we got him the ball, he didn't get
some shots up. I thought he -- he was holding it too long and waiting to see
how they were going if play him. He went and the got it on the glass. He had
some offensive rebounds, some effort plays that really sparked us and sparked
him, the effort plays he made. That's what he's done all year. That's why he's
First Team all SEC. He's been the leader and the most consistent player on our
team all year with his effort and his attitude and his work habits. And that's
why you see the success that he's had and why we've had success.  
  
Q. Billy, you know, you have to dismiss one point guard, another one
gets hurt, you're essentially down to third string point guard that you had to
bench a couple times. Could you have ever envisioned you would be in this
position just about a month or so ago?  
BILL KENNEDY: You know, I never did doubt, I never gave up because I knew we
had talent. We got talent and we got good kids. We got good kids who make
mistakes. Unfortunately, they made more mistakes this year than I'd like. They
came together when they needed to come together. And I really thought that if
we could always make a run because of our talent level and because of the
quality of the kids that we have and they grew up. We only have two seniors,
and one of them got hurt and is not playing for us. We don't have -- everybody
is young, it seems this time of year. Sometimes you can be young and even be
old, immature. I think we grew up some throughout the season, throughout the
adversity.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how you never let North Carolina make a run
to get back in the game? As a matter of fact, you actually increased the lead
every four-minute TV timeout segment in the second half and kept crowd out of
the game.  
BILL KENNEDY: We knew we needed to keep attacking. Sometimes you play back on
your heals. We kept attacking and that's the kind of guys we have, we have
some -- when -- especially when they're as confident as they are right now, we
kept attacking and I thought we moved the ball really good and got a couple
layups. When you're making 3s like we made them and we were open. I mean we
had good shots. We made the shots today and that bred some confidence and we
were able to increase the lead. I was concerned that they double teamed and
double fist would give us some problems. I thought our guys did a good job of
coming to the ball and making the extra pass.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Congratulations. Good luck.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from the University of North
Carolina. We have from left to right, Cameron Johnson; in the middle, Kenny
Williams; to my mediate left, Luke Maye.  
  
Q. This question is for Luke. When we spoke last year, you know, you
were pretty low key and this year is just totally different, like I know you
can't say that you knew this was coming. But were you ever just sitting there,
like you just wait until I get lit and everyone sees how good I really am?  
LUKE MAYE: Did you just say "lit"? (laughter) I thought I heard that
correctly. I thought the biggest thing for me has just kind of been confidence
-- really, coming off of last year and my end of the year meeting with Coach,
we just talked about continuing the play with confidence and knowing how good
you could be. He gave me all the confidence in the world and the coaching
staff. Then just playing with my teammates and having such a core group coming
back. I knew I had to step up a little bit. I felt like us as a group have
stepped up our games and really started to play well at the right time. I
think it's been really beneficial to our success.  
  
Q. Luke, as well. Luke, you have a pretty daunting task coming into this
game going against Texas A &M bigs. Can you talk about that matchup, please?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah. They're both, all three of them that we've kind of scouted
and looked at are both really skilled. They all do different things. I think
we've had experience going against Duke three times, and having teams like
Louisville and Miami who both present a strong front court, but I think it
will be a great test for us. I think we'll be ready for the challenge and our
bigs come off the bench, played outstanding these past couple games, and
they'll just continue to play their games and play to their strengths is going
to be big for us.  
  
Q. Luke, when you came out yesterday, you got the cheer that's usually
associated with Luke Kuechly here. This is truly a home game for you. How many
people do you have here, and did you feel like the crowd was behind you
specifically yesterday?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, I think coming home is definitely a great feeling. I went
home on Wednesday and Thursday to my house. It was great to see my brothers.
Obviously my one brother is playing baseball, so he's not at home. To be home,
have that family feel, and came out and didn't play as well as I would like,
but all that matters is we won. Get another chance to play on Sunday, and it's
going to be a great game for us.  
  
Q. This question is for Kenny. What is going through your mind when
you're shooting your 3s? When you're feeling it, like I see the look on your
face and how like you get your swag whenever you get in your groove. What is
going through your mind at that time?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: You know, once I hit one or two, I feel pretty good, feeling
pretty confident in my jump shot. You know, if I get another one, I'm just
thinking it's going in. You know, once I hit two, three, four -- yesterday I
hit four, you know, at that point I'm feeling it and I think everybody else
knows I'm feeling it, also, and I think they look for me a little bit more.
But, you know, it's the same whether I miss two or make two. I think it's
going in.  
  
Q. Question for Cam Johnson. You've been played an integral role in the
Carolina team. This is your first NCAA Tournament. Can you talk about your
experience, how you feel?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's exciting. We did play in the tournament at Pitt. That's
why they're laughing. We played --  
  
LUKE MAYE: First win.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's exciting to be a part of this team with these guys. I
love going out there, playing and competing with these guys by my side and
wearing the North Carolina across my chest. And it's something that after the
path I've taken to get here kind of means, you know, has a little bit extra
special feeling to it. It's something I really embrace and have fun doing.  
  
Q. What does it feel like being a UNC player at the "house of Jordan"
and knowing that UNC has never lost in Charlotte? You're playing in the "house
of Jordan." What kind of feeling does that give you? Anyone can answer.  
LUKE MAYE: I mean, it's very special. I mean, playing in our home state, being
from North Carolina, it's really cool to go out there and hear the roars and
the cheers from the crowd. I think the crowd plays a huge factor in every
basketball game, and just be able to step out on that floor and have a little
bit of an extra advantage already, and just going out there and just playing
the game of basketball we all love and in this great state is something
special for a home town kid.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: You know, every time we put the jersey on it's a sense of
pride. I think it's a little bit more when we play in North Carolina because
we want to defend our state, really. We just go out there and we're excited.
We ran out and heard the crowd and the reaction. That pumps us up a little bit
more, knowing we have that many people in the crowd with us. And like I said,
that is just a sense of pride when we put the jersey on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cam.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I really agree. I think it gives us a good home feel, you
know, lot of Carolina support in the crowd, and you can see it all over when
you look around. That really kind of picks us up, helps us along. I really
think the crowd can make an impact in the game, and it's pretty positive, you
know, to have it in our home state in the "house of Jordan," like you said.
Just this stage means a lot and to be closer to home, to play in a game with
so much significance and so much, you know, familiarity is really special.  
  
Q. All three of you guys. You know Virginia better than anyone. Played
them the last game before the tournament. How surprised were you watching last
night? What was that like for you? Did the Coach say anything to you about
that game?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I was actually really surprised. You know, UMBC did a great
job doing what they wanted to do, driving and kicking and knocked down their
shots. They executed their game plan perfectly, and, you know, it was just
surprise to go see Virginia give up that many points on defense, honestly.  
  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, I would agree with Kenny. I felt like Virginia coming into
the tournament was the hottest team out of anybody. And I mean obviously to
lose Hunter was really huge for them. He's great on the defensive end, really
makes a lot of key plays for them offensively. When you get to tournament
time, everybody, it could be their last game. You got to give everything you
have and UMBC just played better, and that's what it comes down to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cam.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah. It surprised me, definitely, but I think UMBC just did
a great job of attacking and scoring and it was their night. They hit a lot of
shots. Virginia is a great team, they proved that all throughout the year and
just crazy. Shows you anything can happen in March.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Are any of you familiar with any of the UMBC players? None of their
names or anything in the junior ranks or anything?  
LUKE MAYE: Coach Odom was at Charlotte when I was going through the recruiting
process. He was unbelievable assistant coach, him and Coach Major really came
and watched me play a lot and being from North Carolina. Really got to know
him and the staff really well. And I was just so excited for him to have that
opportunity to really play on the big stage and be successful was really cool
to see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cam or Kenny, any connection?  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Jairus Lyles was at VCU before he went there, so I didn't get
to know him really well but I had spoken to him a couple times.  
  
Q. You guys have this opportunity all the time, every year, you're
expected to be on this stage. What do you think it means to those guys to
first make the tournament and then pull off history?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: They got to be on Cloud 9 right now. To pull out something
like that is pretty historic. They got to be riding high right now, feeling
real good. They got another game coming up soon, so they can't fly too high.
Something you got to enjoy, you know. To win a game like that, to have a
performance like that against a team that's very, very good, shows a lot about
your team and your toughness. I think the guys really stepped up to the
occasion. So it's definitely something they got to enjoy.  
  
Q. I guess this question is moreso for Kenny and Luke. How are you
soaking up these last moments with your seniors, especially Theo and Joel,
enjoying these last couple of weeks that you have for them with them?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I think on the court is going out there and giving everything
I can for them. You know, doing everything I can to make sure that they go out
on a high note, controlling that aspect on the court, and then just spending
time with them off the court. You know, they're two great guys, great to be
around. You want to spend time with those two. Joel and Theo specifically, you
know, it's easy to want to be around them because you always going to laugh,
it's going to be a great time. You know, just living in the moment and just
enjoying whatever time I have with them left.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Luke.  
  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah. I'm not really trying to think about it, honestly. I can't
imagine a team without Joel or Theo. They've been so much to this program and
so much to my improvement and my success. Theo is the best teammate I've ever
been around. He makes everybody better, makes everybody laugh. Makes practice
so much lighter. But he just -- both of them are just -- Joel is the best
worker I've ever been around. It's really cool to have such great seniors who
lead by example and vocally. Both each other are very different but they get
the best out of all of us, which is really important.  
  
Q. Cameron, as I recall last year when you decided to transfer, A &M had
pursued you. Could you take us back to that. How much did it come down to
Carolina? Was A&M in the mix and ultimately why did you choose Carolina?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I never talked to A&M. Ultimately I chose Carolina to be in a
position like this, to have teammates like this, and to be a part of something
that's pretty special and pretty big. It took a long -- lot of talking with my
family and a long process to kind of figure it out, and it was difficult at
times. But I feel like I made a great decision coming here and I couldn't be
happier.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay, guys, thank you. Good job. See you
tomorrow.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, he bogeyed 2 and birdied 3, 4 and 6 and I heard he
bogeyed another one. And that shot he hit on the par 5, I thought that was the
right play before I left the room. Is that enough?  
  
Q. You're in this tournament 30-something times. You figure at one point
or another, you're going to get popped in the first round. It's just simple
math. You never have. When you see something like last night, how do you put
into perspective for yourself that not getting beat in the first round is one
of your accomplishments in your career?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, that was unbelievable. 21 -- 21 at halftime and we're
going into eat and second half is starting. And I said guys, I'm not --
literally, I'm -- not doing anything against Ryan Odom. I love Dave. I almost
went to work for Dave at one time. I'm not watching this. I'm going back to my
room and watch Texas A&M and Providence. There's no way that's going to
happen. So, we have beds over here, there's a phone, TV, and around the corner
we've got a nice room. Around the corner I'm watching the Texas A&M and
Providence and I go back and look. Good gosh, I go back and I go back and look
and I finally watched the last three, four minutes. That was unbelievable.  
  
We always try to just talk about playing one game, just one game. I've never
spoken to our guys about, okay, we're a 2 seed and they're a 15 seed. I don't
really think that I've ever said that to them. I said the better we play, the
better seed we get, the better chance we have of continuing.  
  
Last night I saw the thing up on the TV and I really try not to get caught up
in any records or anything like that, but that's one I've been very proud of.
I thanked the team in the locker room. Pretty good streak, we kept it going.
When I saw it up there, 28-0 in the first round, when we tied Coach Smith's
record I think his was 17. It's something I've been proud of. But other than
that, I really don't get caught up in those record kind of things.  
  
I can tell you all five times I shot 69 and those kind of things, but so the
answer the part of it about saying it to my team, I always try to prepare them
-- I did tell them this, that I may miss a year, 2002, we're in St. Louis and
we were playing Holy Cross was a 16 and they had the lead with five, six
minutes to play, and we came back and won. And then the next game Kirk Hinrich
hurt his foot in the Holy Cross game. He's sitting on the end of the bed with
his leg up there on ice. I didn't know if he was going to play. We got off to
such a great start against Stanford, 18-0. And so I have been aware of it and
I've said some things but never made a big deal of it except, let's do
everything we can, be as successful as we can, because when that big
tournament starts which is what we really aim for, perhaps we'll be little
easier at the start.  
  
But that was -- I was shocked. I kept thinking something April Fool's Day or
something. I didn't know what the crap was going on.  
  
Q. You recruit kids that expect to be on this stage and they are
accustomed to playing and enjoying these moments. What do you think the UMBC
kids are feeling right now and going through and how -- as an educator and
coach, how special is that, do you think, to see those kids have that one
chance?  
ROY WILLIAMS: That's the beauty of the tournament. I mean, it's hard on
coaches, one game, bad, you're gone. That's the beauty of the tournament and
to see those kind of things. As I said, I've been there a couple times when
it's been awfully close, but you have to feel so good -- I watched -- at the
end I have no idea what the guys were saying on TV because I had paid no
attention to them. I was just watching the kids run around. It's called
hugger. You don't care how smelly or sweaty, you run and hug each other.
Seeing the people in the stands and the people they identified as parents. I
was really looking to see if they would show Dave Odom, because he has been a
good friend for a long time. North Carolina guy.  
  
But -- the other thing I was almost as stunned by the way Coach Odom handled
himself. He was so daggone -- Jesus Christ, son, do you realize what just
happened? I'd be running around acting a little crazy or something. I was
really impressed with how he handled it. But the kids -- and I've said many
times and I get corny at times, but the biggest thrill in coaching is seeing
the looks on your kids' faces when they've accomplished something really
important, and especially if it was really hard to do. And that's -- you know,
in basketball, that's Chaminade against Ralph Sampson. I can't even think of
anything else that's close to that. Those UMBC kids, they had a tough time
going to sleep last night and so did Coach Odom, too. He's had -- he had to go
inside and scream for something.  
  
Q. You said to this group they were going to play the small lineup, they
had to rebound if they wanted to stick with it. You guys were second in the
country in rebounding margin, maybe a little bit more unconventional fashion,
how you guys go after on the offensive glass. Did you think this group could
ultimately rebound as well as they have, and does anything change when you've
going up against a team with that much size?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'd mad because we're number 2. We were number 1 for awhile. I
sort of got on them for losing that lead kind of thing. Actually, you've heard
me before, it's the most critical factor in the game, the way we play. Maybe
somebody else plays it differently or they can convince themselves. I knew we
would be a real good rebounding team, because if they didn't rebound and
wouldn't boxout, they won't play. But we also emphasize it so much that they
bought into it.  
  
It's been harder because Kenny Meeks was naturally a great rebounder, so he
could get them. Justin was great, Tony Bradley was a great rebounder. The
surprise of being able to do it at that level is there. But if we don't do it,
we don't win is the way I look at it.  
  
Now you watch Texas A&M and they just -- maybe the biggest team I've ever
looked at. And so we've got to try to do it at a higher level now than anybody
else that we've played. We've had three, four games where the other team out
rebounded us.  
  
Duke outrebounded us, and they've got similar size like that, but A&M got it
through some of their perimeter players as well. It's got to be the primary
focus for us. I thought we would be a good rebounding team and perhaps at the
level we are maybe surprised me.  
  
Q. Roy, when you dive into the tape of A &M, how have they really
changed since TJ Starks really started handling the controls and coming into
his own?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, again, I never watched an A&M tape the until last
night. I didn't see when they've had two point guards that they started with,
one hurt and one suspended. I never saw them when they had those guys. I said
in the press conference last night, I remember watching five, six minutes of
the early game, the one that was -- I keep saying it was outside the country
-- was it Germany? Yeah -- against West Virginia. I remember watching a little
bit of that. I saw them play a little bit against Kentucky and a little bit
against Kansas. And so until yesterday I didn't have enough knowledge to even
talk about them. But that's the way I do everybody. Normally I will watch a
game tape the night before we play someone.  
  
Now, with Lipscomb is a little different. I knew Sunday we were -- so I had
watched three full games on Lipscomb. Well, Brad Frederick had the team, he
watched 12 games. Hubert Davis, A&M, by tomorrow he will have watched 10, 12
games. I'll get more idea. I know Billy. And I said last night, I can't have
anymore respect for anybody than I would him. And I'm not trying to act like
we're bosom buddies. I always say hello. When I heard what was going on with
him a few years back, I said something to him. He's a fantastic guy, fantastic
coach who -- the focus that he has is just incredible to me. I've known little
bit more about them just because trying to see how he's doing.  
  
Q. Roy, Sterling and Garrison over the last two, three weeks have
started playing a little bit more, getting more involved. Is that just a
matter of freshmen developing and now being more confident and ready, and how
much are those two going to have to contribute against that big Texas A &M
team?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'd like to say it's coaching but I think it is as kids
developing. And two months ago, three months ago, whenever it was I decided to
go small, and then all of a sudden later, wait a minute, i got to help these
kids be developed, too. So we're going to give them more opportunities. I'm
not going to forget them completely.  
  
And so we're trying to give them more time. We're putting them in the game in
difficult situations and expecting them to perform. If they don't perform, I
chastise them. If they do perform, I pat them on the back. What they've done
so far has been good. Now this is going to be maybe the biggest challenge
they've had. Similar to Duke, because with Wendell and Marvin, the guys they
play are that size. The difference is going to be the guys that Theo and
Kenny. Williams will guard. They've got to come through for us. They've got to
be big.  
  
Q. How big a deal is it that they've stayed engaged and didn't sulk and
didn't kind of drift off and didn't play much?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm very lucky they're not that kind of kids. That's who I look
for anyway. I tell them, every kid I recruit, every kid, I didn't tell --
Tyler Hansbrough came to North Carolina thinking he was going to play behind
Marvin Williams Sean May. I am not a nice guy. I am going to be hard on you.
I'm going to push you more than you've ever pushed. That part of it I don't
really get into.  
  
Q. For all these years, teams have tried to solve your size. Is there
anything you picked up from them that you can try to solve Texas A &M's
size?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Teams have tried to spread us and milk the clock more is the way
they've gone after us over the years. That doesn't really fit me. I don't
really think I can do it. The other way they've done it is when we've driven
the ball to the basket, they blocked every shot. We tried to make sure we stop
a little short.  
  
No, their size is impressive. I just did an interview with Coach Thompson's
group. He said it may be the biggest team that he's ever seen. It really --
when you look at how big -- look what during the opening tip, look at the guy
that Kenny is going to stand beside and the guy Theo is going to stand beside.
They're big guys. They're as big as some of the other big guys we're playing
against. Their perimeter guys are a lot of size. You got to get them off of
you before you try to take an outside shot, so you got to take -- create some
space with your dribble and try to take them to the basket and go right by
them and not try to stretch it out. Because against a shot blocker, you do all
this dipsy-do stuff and you stretch it out. You just give them space to find
it and block it. Got to hope we get them in foul trouble and get down to some
of the other guys.  
  
But they're here because they're really good and hopefully we're here because
we're really good, too. I didn't sleep really well last night, and it wasn't
just because I was excited about us winning or stunned by Virginia. Sort of
watching that tape right before I went to bed. I have a bad enough time
sleeping and they added to it last night. But we are not going to spread it
and hold it. Give you a clue.  
  
Q. Luke said that when his shot is not falling, you stay on him about
remaining involved in the game in other ways. What is your message to him when
you see maybe he doesn't have it?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, some things are not meant to be shared with everybody.
I chewed his butt out last night. You're one of the best players in the
America, first team all ACC, third team All-American Kansas. Just be Luke.
Quit worrying about things. Just play basketball. Sometimes I get a little
more heated with him, and last night I kept him out a little bit because I
wanted this to see if I could get him simmering over there a little bit. He
can't beat the world by himself. And I love kids who care and Luke Maye really
cares. And I don't have to coach Luke very much. Just push him a little bit
and with a little finger and that's about it.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have had a lot of highlights, A &M hasn't had as
many. One of them was beating North Carolina in 1980. You were a student grad
assistant or assistant coach. Do you remember that game at all?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Part-time assistant. It means full-time job, part-time pay. I
remember that part.  
  
Q. Do you remember the game?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Give you a trivia question. Have you ever seen a game where you
have the last shot to win the game and lose by 17 or 19? Because that was that
game. Was it 17? We had the last shot to win the game in regulation and missed
it and they beat us by 17. I remember that game, yes, walking out of the gym
in Denton, Texas. Eddie Fogler looked to me. We have to get to Albany, New
York, a guy named Sam Perkins up there to help us.  
  
Q. Does Manley have an increased role for tomorrow because of his
size?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Not really. I mean, what I do is I put him in first or Garrison
in first and whoever plays the best the first time, they get in get a little
more time. Last night I thought Sterling defensively would help us a little
bit against Marberry, make it more difficult. But Garrison got in, had three
assists, and did some good things. I went back with him first. So it's a go-
by-the-seat-of-the-pants kind of thing.  
  
I didn't like the way Sterling was a screen and roll, and I didn't like the
way he got back to the roll guy. So I took him out and put Garrison in. The
first play Garrison did it well. When I put Sterling back in, he got three
rebounds in a row. It's more of a seat-of-the-pants kind of thing.  
  
Q. Coach, Cam said yesterday he had 7 rebounds yesterday. He said late
in the game you pulled him one time because he didn't crash the boards. He
said maybe one of the biggest adjustments about playing for you is that
constant mandate of never letting up, even a guy like him who has got 7
boards, banged up, but he didn't do it one time and you pulled him out. How
has he handled transitioning into dealing with the mandate that you give these
guys, regardless of what the circumstances are?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, if he dealt with Jamie and he dealt with Kevin, now he's
dealt with me, he's dealt with Three Stooges. Maybe I'm the worst of the
three. He's already done it. He's in is a demanding family. His dad has pushed
him and he pushes himself. He's dealt with three different personalities in
four years because he red shirted one year.  
  
But I had already taken -- I think I had taken Kenny out for that reason once
as well. I exposed and said it straightforward to Cam about it. I took Cam out
because he didn't go to the boards. Because in the first half I was really
ticked because Luke Maye shot the ball twice and I got four guys standing
outside the 3-point line and not one dadgum guy went to the board. That
happened twice. I ripped all of them at that point. I felt like that should be
enough. The one I took Cam out was in the second half. I'm not going to tell
Luke Maye you can't shoot because we don't have anybody to rebound. Those
other guys better get their butts up there and rebound also. Luke is our best
percentage shooter from 3 and maybe our best from overall as well. His doesn't
go in all the time either. Somebody got to go rebound it. If I'm not mistaken,
we were up rebounding-wise like 3 or 4 in the first half and I think we ended
up being up by 19. 18, 19.  
  
Q. Roy, the last couple years you've been to the tournament, your
program has been under scrutiny for things that happened off the court. Has
life returned to normal this year, and especially given the context of all the
other things going on in college basketball, has that been nice for you that
you haven't had to deal with that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It really has been. The last three, four years I've been on
record saying the kids and my time on the basketball court with the kids has
been -- I'm not trying to be too dramatic -- it's been my salvation. If I
hadn't those, I would have gotten out the door. I felt like I needed to stay
and see the thing through. I didn't feel like I had anything to do with it,
but boy those kids really made me feel good about being with them.  
  
This fall we had couple of guys visit who were Top 10 or Top 15 kids. We
hadn't been able to get those kids on campus for three, four years. That felt
better. There's no question about it. And coming to a press conference when I
say, guys, come on, let's please talk about the tournament and other people
wanted to talk about the other stuff. It wasn't nearly as much fun.  
  
Yeah, it's been more fun. This team has been sort of like the rest of them.
They've really been a salvation for me, even though I've been having more fun
anyway so it hadn't been needed as much. But no, you're exactly right. I think
you said pleasant. I think that's the terminology you used. It's been more
pleasant for me, yes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. What are your feelings on tights-sneaker day in Chapel Hill? Do you
have any?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. There were a lot of other people around. Let's
make sure you understand we're going to talk about tights, not just me and
you.  
  
Q. Do you have any rules as far as what your guys can wear as far as
headbands, tights, any of that kind of stuff? Any feelings on that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Headbands went the way of Gonzaga in 2006 in Madison Square
Garden when I walked out on the court and got five of six guys in headbands.
We got beat. We stunk. There's never been a headband, never will be another
headband on another North Carolina player. Shane Battier, if he wanted to come
back and play, we would talk about it.  
  
Tights, I kid them all the time. "All my coaches wear them out there." I told
them I'm really going the surprise them one day, I'm going to walk out with
tights on and Theo just about puked right there. You know, it's crazy, me
wearing them one leg and not the other. I see that. The next day you may
switch. I tell them, I wouldn't mind wearing them sometimes it's cold. But no,
that is honestly the full extent of our conversation of tights. Make sure we
understand that. Guys, thank you very much.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from Kansas State. We have from
left to right, Xavier Sneed, Barry Brown Jr, and Kam Stokes.  
  
Q. Barry, you guys had a good four days of preparation, watching film
for Creighton, and now you got to turn around on 24 hours and take on a team
that just dismantled one of the best college defenses out there. What are your
early thoughts on this, and how do you approach this? And Xavier, if you could
pipe in on this, too, with getting ready for this game.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Well, I mean they're a great team. They share the ball
really well, especially in transition, get it out, lot of different guys that
can bring the ball up. So -- but the quick turnaround is something we're kind
of used to. We had a Big 12 tournament. We've had games during regular season
where we had the one day turnaround or play back-to-back days. It's nothing
that we haven't seen before.  
  
Q. Is there any similarity between this team and some you've seen in the
Big 12?  
XAVIER SNEED: Definitely Oklahoma. Get up a lot of 3s quick, especially in
transition and they're a fast-paced team. So similar to Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Kam, I'm curious if you guys, you specifically, could walk through
the emotions of last night. You get the win. You know you're moving on to the
second round. I'm sure it's a great celebration. At what point do you realize
what's going on in that Virginia- UMBC game and what the evening was like for
you guys.  
KAMAU STOKES: We got back to the hotel, talking with our family and
everything, and then we turned and looked at the TV and Virginia losing.
Pretty sure nobody expected that, but you can't look past UMBC. They're a real
good team, like Barry said, and share the ball very well.  
  
Q. Would you be expected to march up on Lyles? He's obviously played
really well. He played well against Virginia and he had the big shot in the
conference tournament to win that. You expected to be matched up against him
and have you watched tape on him i?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Yeah, I mean, I watched tape on him already since last night
when I found out we were going to play him because that's going to be my
matchup. That's the guy I'm going to be guarding for most of the game, see
where he picks his spots and what he likes to do and how he likes to score and
help his team win. I've been watching film on him since last night. The
scouting report tonight we're going to have and hopefully I can shut him down.  
  
Q. Any of the three of you, the country is going to be rooting against
you. They're going to be rooting for Cinderella. What's your mindset going in,
saying hey, story time is over, this is basketball?  
THE MODERATOR: Xavier.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: Just come out here and play our game, be focused and be
prepared. I feel like we can come out of here and get the W.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, we know that everyone is kind of looking for that
Cinderella story. We just going to keep playing K-State basketball like all
year and not worry about who they beat or yesterday or two days ago or
whatever. We're going to play K-State basketball and respect our opponent and
play and hope to win.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: You can't look past UMBC, especially in the tournament anything
can happen. You just have to prepare for them and get ready for the game.  
  
Q. Kam, this is for you. You're a Baltimore guy. What do you know about
this school, this program, growing up and coming out of high school?  
KAMAU STOKES: Growing up they recruited me. I know some of the players that's
there. Everybody see they play fast. I knew that. They're a real good team.
Got some guys in this year that can do a lot of good things. We got to be
ready for that game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kam, are you surprised by the contribution the last couple of games
by Mike McGuirl, where his confidence come from, what do you expect from him
moving forward?  
KAMAU STOKES: I'm not surprised at all. He showed that in the Big 12
tournament when he came in the game and made some good plays. He's prepared
for it the whole year. So, I'm not surprised at all.  
  
Q. Barry, they like to spread the floor, dribble, penetrate. Do you see
any similarities in how they attack with their guards, attack the rim kind of
like what you guys do?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Yeah, they like to get in the lane and kick a lot of roll
backs and try to make the next defender help and trying to get wide open 3s.
Shoot a lot of 3s. It's a big chunk of their offense and a big chunk of their
points, game in and game out. We just have to contain, play some good
individual defense, but still have our brother's back when they get beat, have
high close-outs being put on the floor and not get the wide open 3s.  
  
Q. Kam, just curious, their point guard, K.J., is 5'8 ", 140. You don't
really see that too much at the division one level, quite frankly. What do you
think about him as a player? Why is he able to play with the big boys of
Virginia, and would it be possible for you to post him up low, given the size
advantage?  
KAMAU STOKES: I mean, that's all within our system. I'm going to make plays
still running the system. He's a good player, you know. That's obviously why
he's at the Division 1 level. Can't look past him or underestimate him. He
works well with their team.  
  
Q. I'm curious, how different is your role from the 3 to the 4 spot? Is
it significantly different and which one do you enjoy playing more?  
XAVIER SNEED: Interchangeable, really. I made the 4 a lot last year as well,
and it's nothing really different for me and like playing different teams like
this. They space out the floor. It's a little bit easier for me. I feel like
it's better for the matchups for us.  
  
Q. Barry, forgive me if this was like one of the first questions because
I arrived a little bit late, but I think that 9 seeds make it to the Sweet 16
maybe 4 percent of the time. Of course, usually there's a number 1 in the way.
How do you guys look at this opportunity to maybe get into a Sweet 16?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It's a big-time opportunity for us. We still have a team in
our way right now. We're not looking towards the Sweet 16 because we have to
worry about the 32 that we're in right now. UMBC is in our way. All our focus,
all our efforts and energy is on beating them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. Okay. Guys, thank you. Good job. See you
tomorrow.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Coach, just first your reaction. I mean, I don't think anybody really
expected to see what happened there with UMBC last night and, you know, I'm
not sure if you guys were already scouting Virginia film or what was going on.
What was reaction to what happened and your thoughts heading into Sunday?  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously it's history. It's never been done before. And not only
when you think about the magnitude of it, how Virginia's year and how they
dominated what I guess -- we feel like we had a good conference, but obviously
they had more teams in the NCAA Tournament and they won the league and won the
tournament and played at such a high level. Obviously, they lost an important
player, but you think they'd be able to -- be able to survive that, but, you
know, they didn't.  
  
I told our guys, the best team on the court won. They controlled the whole
second half. And I kind of beforehand, you know, motivation stuff, you know,
when we talked about our bracket, Virginia is really not that good. The
coaches looked at me like I was crazy. So last night after -- it was kind of a
neat situation, Embassy Suites and all our fans, family, our players, all kind
of watching the game when we got back and lots of cheering and stuff, and I
just made sure we got them together and make sure that we understand how good
they are and we got a big challenge in front of us tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Bruce, I don't know if the parallel is exact, but back in 2002 nobody
really knew who you were, you beat Texas Tech, Georgia in the tournament. How
did that change your career, how did that change your life, and can you sort
of sympathize with what Ryan has gone through the last 24 hours?  
BRUCE WEBER: Well, one they got back really late and so many things going
through, I'm sure -- I know one day I did 25 different interviews, radio stuff
and different stuff. And at that time you just say yes to everything. You want
some exposure for your program. And you got to give him credit. But he's been
around it. Obviously I've known his dad forever. He's been around high level
basketball program, high level players. He's been through the tournament. And
I'm sure he'll handle it well. But it is daunting. When you do something like
that, everybody wants to talk to you and have a piece of you. And I told our
guys, most important thing for us, we got to be prepared. We can't worry who
we play. We got to be worried about our preparation.  
  
Q. Coach, you said a couple times this year about Mike being kind of the
surprise of the summer. With that quote in mind, I'm curious about his
recruiting process and then what that surprise was, what you didn't know about
him when you got him on campus.  
BRUCE WEBER: It was more I asked the players who was the surprise. I always
say who worked the hardest. We always have our summer ending meetings and go
through some stuff and who worked the hardest, who made the most improvement,
who has been the biggest surprise. To the man, every player said Mike McGuirl
is a surprise. I guess they -- part of it again is recruiting. They didn't
much about him, wasn't as much hype. Coach Frazier kind of discovered him. We
watched him that summer before his senior year. He had some recruitment but
not at a high level. Picked up, he had a really good summer, got better and
better. Loves his explosion, his athleticism. He's got a little bit of the
cockiness to him, as you saw last night. And I just -- as I've said before, I
have felt bad for him on his year. From injuries to red shirt to go not red
shirting to not getting a lot of minutes that he wanted, and it's great for
him to have the opportunity in Kansas game here to show what he could do and
he rose up. He took advantage of the opportunity. We talk about that all the
time. You never know when you're going to be called upon. You got to be ready
to do it, and obviously he was last night.  
  
Q. First of all, which of your assistants has the scout for this game?
And with that, watching what they did offensively to a very good defensive
team last night, what are the challenges in trying to slow down this team?  
BRUCE WEBER: You know, the good thing is we face some of the best offensive
teams in the country from last night Creighton to the Kansas game to TCU to
Oklahoma. And so we face some of those teams so we're familiar. It starts with
transition defense. They're so good in transition. Last night they had four
guys that could bring it up. Now it's probably more two guys or three that can
bring the ball up, but those two are really good and cause havoc for you
because they can get to the paint. They're good at flipping, flipping it back
for 3s. Put a lot of pressure on the defense. I thought last night was one of
their better things, we grind it out on offense and played great transition
defense.  
  
Now, the little difference maybe between these guys and Creighton, they attack
the paint on the close-outs. We're going to have to really do a good job of
containing when -- we call it rope action or dribble action -- when they get
in the paint kick and they got good 3-point shooters and again we just faced
TCU, Kansas, Creighton, three in a row that are -- and these guys are three of
the -- four of the top 3-point shooting teams in the country. Did a good job
last night. Got to do it again tonight. For the scout we divided it up on
Sunday. Coach Korn and a coach took the first game Creighton. Coach Frazier
was going to help us with somebody. I said Coach Lowery, you can kind of cover
everybody including UMBC. We had a little bit of stuff, but we had to work
hard last night. You know, I went -- probably 3:30, 4:00 I went to bed. I know
when I left, they were still up working. I think a lot of them stayed 5:00,
6:00 in the morning. But we were ready for the players when we got to
breakfast. We had clip tape, we were ready for them. We started going on
personnel and making sure -- the one thing I did last night and after we all
-- all watching the game. I called them back to a meeting room. I had told
them they could go to bed after meeting with their families and eating. I
wanted them to make sure they understood the task they had and how good they
were.  
  
Q. I have a couple questions for you, Bruce. First of all, status of
Dean Wade? And I have a follow-up.  
BRUCE WEBER: What else? Dean did some stuff today again. You know, just little
bit on the court. Just kind of see what happens. Again, I think -- if he
plays, it would be a limited basis probably. But, you know, never know,
miracles happen and it would be nice to have him. Obviously, we would have a
nice matchup advantage if we had him inside, but we don't and it's next man
up. Michael was it last night. Mak was it against Kansas. We got to have
somebody else step up tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Follow-up question. Everybody in the country is going to be rooting
against you, rooting for Cinderella. How do you handle that, being the
villain?  
BRUCE WEBER: The coaches talked to the players about that last night, about
how they wrote history. And we actually had a little saying this week is the
person who wins the war, gets to write their own history. Now we kind of --
they wrote their own history last night.  
  
Now we've talked about us. We're going to have to -- that task, we have a
battle and I was a little surprised at game time, and I don't know all the
logistics how they decide that, but obviously, you know, Prime Time on Sunday
night, they put our game there. So like you said, I think a lot of people will
be cheering for them.  
  
Q. Opposite 60 Minutes, I think. Bruce, Greg McDermott suggested
yesterday not having Dean in the lineup kind of affected them, changed you
defensively and affected them. And of course you'd rather have been Dean, but
are there some attributes to your defense when Dean is not on the floor in
terms of perimeter defense?  
BRUCE WEBER: You saw it with Virginia last night. If you play two bigs against
a team that's small, you know, it's tough to matchup and they got it moving
all around and they do a great job moving the basketball, getting into the
paint, like we talked about.  
  
Dean still has been -- I've said many times, he's one of our best defenders,
one of our smartest defenders. The one thing we had when we played Kansas,
playing small ball, we could matchup. Last night we could matchup and again I
think tomorrow night we can matchup. It gives us a little bit of quickness. We
actually put Kam on their 4 man yesterday but their 4 man was really -- he's a
perimeter guy and he picked and popped a lot. And so in some ways we have
better quickness, we have opportunity to switch things that we normally
wouldn't if Dean was in there. But I promise you, the players would love to
have Dean back and I know the coaches would.  
  
Q. Coach, I wonder if you could address UMBC's backcourt with Lyles and
Maura. What do you think of those two? And second part of that, with Maura
being 5'8 ", 140 and I may be oversimplifying the game, but why don't teams
just throw a point guard down there and back him down on the low post and
would that be part of your strategy?  
BRUCE WEBER: If you got a big enough point guard, you can get mismatches. I
suppose you can do that. And I'm not sure in their league if you have big body
guys that can do that -- you know, last night Tony, they run their offense and
they just kept running it and they didn't have that opportunity to do that. So
if we get some mismatches, we might look at that. You know, but those two
guards are very good. They always say guards win in the tournament and Lyles
is very similar to Marcus Foster. A guy that can create. He scores on all
three levels, jump up and make the 3, get to the point, shoot a pull up. He
can get to the hoop and make plays. He had some nice passes. That's the thing
we showed our guys. If we overdo our help on him, he'll make the right pass.  
  
And Morris is -- he's one of those guys you hate to play against. He pestered
the heck out of Virginia, their point guards and made it tough. They had them
-- they couldn't run their offense in comfort zones because that first pass
was way out on the court. And so the good thing with us, hopefully, we have
three different ball handlers with our lineup now, so I said this is not an
ego thing, this is a smart thing. Whoever he's guarding, get down the court
and let somebody else bring the ball up. We'll have to deal with them, but
he's so clever, he can score, he's a great distributor, he creates and gets in
the paint and causes problems. He's definitely a little pest that you got to
deal with.  
  
Q. If I understood you correctly, you said earlier in the week as kind
of a motivational point with the team, you told them Virginia is not that
good. And then for them last night you're calling the team back in after
Virginia loses. How is that tinkered with or does it tinker in any way with
just motivation, psychology?  
BRUCE WEBER: I actually told them, I said it last night, I'm pretty smart. I
told you Virginia is not very good (laughter). I just played off of it. I'm
not sure all of them got it, but -- you know, you're looking for things. I was
staying up Sunday night after the pairings, and they had George Mason and CVU
and talked about a lot of psychological things they did beforehand and just
kind of prepping them. And I said we got to focus on Creighton. If we don't
beat Creighton, it doesn't do any good. If we get there, I just said I don't
think they're that good. The coaches are like throwing things at me and stuff.  
  
You just kind of play with their minds a little bit and last night I did
again. Hey, they're not that good, but this other team is really good. We got
to be ready for them.  
  
Q. Coach, I imagine Barry is going to have the assignment of stopping
Lyles. What do you see in that? Is he close enough to Foster that Barry can do
the job? What's your expectation of that matchup?  
BRUCE WEBER: Like I said, they are very similar. The older guards that know
how to create and they got that step back 3, they can get from the paint. They
use isos him. He's good in transition. So, it's similar. Barry stayed up last
night, he wanted to watch tape. We sent him some synergy stuff. We wanted him
to go to bed. This morning he put a little time in watching again. And that's
why we've been successful is that our guys prepare and they care and want to
do a good job. Hopefully they're all cut in. That will be the big thing. We
had great team defense last night. Barry was big time and Xavier was big time
on Thomas, but they had a lot of help from a lot of guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it say overall that it actually happened that a 16th
seed has beaten a number 1? Has the parity gotten that much better and why?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think there's no doubt the parity and somebody brought up my
Southern Illinois team and that -- I think since that time, you know, the
early 2000s, you know, everybody has jumped up and some of it you could say
the one-and-dones, losing some of the top kids, you know, early that aren't
getting the opportunity to play. Older players win, they got older guys, you,
know, and they got athleticism and quickness and great guards. I said it
before, you know, always been said, guards win in the tournament and make the
plays. When you have experience, older guards, guys that can make plays, gives
you a chance.  
  
But it had to be the right story. I think obviously it doesn't happen, first
time in whatever it is, 300-some games. It had to be the right story. Virginia
loses somebody. The matchups, again, you talk about when you get in a
tournament how are your matchups. And there's no doubt there's more and more
parity in college basketball. You see Buffalo, Arizona, whatever, there's
always Loyola winning the other day, so it's fun. It's what makes March
Madness special.  
  
Q. Bruce, their point guard, I would assume would, be the smallest
player in the Big 12 at least in terms of height. Did you scout that in any
way? Did you prepare the guys for that size?  
BRUCE WEBER: I said before kind of -- it's that little pest, the guy you go on
the playground you hate to play against because he's everywhere and makes
plays and he'll steal the ball off you, he'll drive you, flip it back over his
shoulder for a 3. He just does a lot of different things. We said you look at
him, you got to respect him because he can play. It's going to be a key
matchup for us tomorrow, how we deal with him, and obviously Lyles is really
good but Maura definitely creates for everybody else and makes them go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from UMBC. We have from left to
right, Joe Sherbourn, junior; Jairus Lyles, a senior; and to my mediate left,
K.J. Maury.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, how was the party? What did you do last night after that
victory?  
K.J. MAURA: We got back to the hotel and all our fans were waiting in the
lobby, a great feeling. After that, coaches encouraged us to go back to the
room and I couldn't sleep. I was up until like 5:00 in the morning.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like K.J. said, our fans and family were waiting for us.
We shared a little moment with them. Then our coaches told us to go upstairs
and get some rest. We tried to go to sleep, but I don't think anybody really
got to sleep until about 4:00 a.m.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: Exact same answer (laughter).  
  
Q. With that in mind, is there any chance of a let-down? Have you
achieved your goal at this point? Are you satisfied or is there a chance for a
let-down?  
JOE SHERBURNE: Of course not. We want to win every game we're playing, and we
think we have just as good a chance at winning this game as the last game and
the game before that.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like Joe said, we don't really want to get too high on
ourselves. We made history but we -- I encourage my teammates to try to block
out everything. We've got a tough team we have to play on Sunday. We're
preparing for that right now. I think we'll be ready.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, we're not satisfied. We go in tomorrow with the mentality
we're going to win another game. Yeah, we never satisfied. We hungry for more.  
  
Q. Jairus, this would be for you. I'm curious how much you have looked
at Kansas State, what your initial thoughts are of their team?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I haven't really -- we haven't really watched film on them yet.
Our coaching staff has. We saw them playing yesterday for a little bit, about
three minutes. They're pretty big. Their guards like to attack the rim. We get
back to the hotel and watch film. I'm probably go back the my room and watch
more film when I'm by myself.  
  
Q. I was just going to ask one more. I got to see you guys play for the
first time last night. Do you play like that all the time?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah (laughter).  
  
Q. Two different questions. You guys just got a new arena February 3rd,
5,000 seats. It's a really big deal for you guys. What is that like? And then
getting out here on the Hornets arena against the No. 1 seed, is it a totally
different world?  
THE MODERATOR: K.J.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think it got us a little bit prepared because it definitely is
not compared to all this. But it was a great experience for us to have that
new arena and feel the environment we needed to feel coming up to March. This
is a whole different world to me.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think playing Arizona in the beginning of the year, they got a
really big arena. Playing SMU and going to Maryland. We were kind of prepared
coming into this. Most of our team has been in big games like this. Wasn't
really that new to us.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: The new arena helps helped us a lot because of the of adjusting
to the shooting background when we came into that arena is big background with
seats, big giant wall. We come from the small field house. So it helped us get
used to shooting in big open spaces.  
  
Q. Completely unrelated. Of the most of the guys that come through this
room prepared for this moment, been on this stage before. This is your guys'
first time on this stage. You're now America's sweethearts. This is your
party. What do each of you want America to know about you? How did you get to
this school? Do you guys play chess? Sport night? Tell us about you guys.  
JOE SHERBURNE: We're the Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, not Golden Retrievers. I
saw that on Sports Center. They had that. That's the state dog of Maryland.
That's what you should know (laughter).  
  
After I hit my first 3 of the second half, I did a big championship belt for
Aaron Rogers because I'm his biggest fan. I want him to see it on TV. They
didn't get the shot. I was just out of frame. If anybody knows him, I've been
trying to tag him.  
  
Q. I know them very well.  
JOE SHERBURNE: You talk to her.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: One thing, I think everybody on our team can probably have a job
at being a comedian. We're a really funny team. That's all I got right now.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think we probably the funniest team in the country. We Top 10
for sure. I always have a smile on me. You see me in the court, I'm always
smiling. I think that comes from where I'm from, Puerto Rico. I play for them
and my guys. I want to make everybody proud.  
  
Q. K.J., when you see guys listed and you see their heights and weights,
it's usually a little fabricated, 6'2 " guys suddenly become 6'4". You're
listed at 5'8", 140, are you that or even smaller than that, just curious. And
Coach Weber just referred to you as -- affectionately, I guess -- a little
pest that he would never want to play in a playground because you're the type
of guy, stealing the ball away from him. Tell me about your style of play, and
if you can answer the first question as well.  
K.J. MAURA: I'm 5'5" on a good day, but I'm 5'7" most of the time. Yeah. I
took a lot of notes on short players like Muggsey Bogues, JJ Barea, one of my
heroes, of course. I had to play like that. If I want to be successful in the
court, I got to be a pest. I got to bother the ball and make them
uncomfortable. I think my size is an advantage because a lot of guys are
taller than me and they don't expect me to be pressuring the ball at that high
level. So, I think I use my size as an advantage.  
  
Q. I wonder if each of you could sort of describe the thing or things
that stood out to you in terms of reaction, what it seems to mean to people,
whether it's your fans or even nationally, media, social media.  
K.J. MAURA: I think this is the biggest win in school history. Our president
went to the locker room and said it's the biggest moment in school history. I
think this is a very special moment for the country and for our school, most
likely.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Like K.J. said, very special moment for UMBC, our team, our
coaching staff, the players, our families. We're just trying to soak it all in
right now.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: What got to me the most, like my friends who are telling me
back home in Wisconsin they have entire bars rooting for you in BC, entire
houses rooting for us and nobody believes them when they're wearing my UMBC
practice jersey that they know me or that have a connection to the school. I
think for now people -- I never heard of UMBC before I came here. Nobody in
Wisconsin knows what it is. So now everybody knows, I hope.  
  
Q. You were very specific about the Chesapeake Bay Retrievers. What
distinguishes the Chesapeake Bay Retriever? What is it that stands out about
that as opposed to the Golden?  
JOE SHERBURNE: They are a dark brown. They have a thick waterproof coat of
fur. And I'm not sure about what else.  
  
Q. Last night Coach Bennett said that your 4 guard lineup really messed
with them. Kansas State plays a 4 guard lineup. How do you see that matchup?  
K.J. MAURA: I think it's a hard matchup for us, but I think we're going to use
our size in the 3 guard and in the 4 position. We going to run our stuff and
it's going to be a fun matchup.  
  
Q. Jairus, after you guys knocked off Virginia, Virginia Tech is out, no
other D.C. teams have made the tournament. As someone who went to high school
De Matha, how much does that mean to you to go forward?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I know everybody on the team from Maryland. We have a lot of
guys from the area. It means a lot. We've been getting texts, social media
posts, just people we don't even know from Maryland just saying how excited
they are for us, how they're rooting for us. It's very special.  
  
Q. I know you said you're trying to block everything out now and not let
the moment get too much for you. How do you actually do that? Y'all seem
really calm and composed right now, considering how historic last night was.  
JOE SHERBURNE: Luckily for some people like K.J., they're getting so many
notifications, their phone doesn't work. That's a good thing, I guess.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Like Joe say, my phone is not working so I put that past me
already.  
  
Q. What happened to your phone?  
K.J. MAURA: I'm getting so many notifications that my phone froze. And it does
that every time I open an application, so I just can text.  
  
Q. For any of you. Last night you took apart one of the best defenses in
college basketball and tomorrow night you'll face another team that likes to
play really good defense, takes a lot of pride in it. What exactly did you do
to Virginia and at what point in the game did you know these guys can't stop
us?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think it started on the defensive end for us. We pressured
their guards a lot of. Didn't give them any open looks. We made their bigs
work and they got frustrated and it helped us on our offensive end because
they kind of got distracted, got inside them so they're not hitting shots and
running their offense like they usually do. They had defensive breakdowns and
we kind of took advantage of that.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think we studied them well. Our preparation was the best we had
all year and we had good tips to what to do on offense against their defense.
And Jairus sent us a video the night before the game how to beat Virginia,
what we got to do against their defense. And I think we have the guards to
beat almost everybody off the dribble and create plays for our teammates.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: Once we started hitting 3s, we were able to get inside past
them even more and kick it right back out for 3 again. So we know we were
going to have the make a lot of 3s. We were 12 for 24 in 3s. That was really
huge.  
  
Q. Jairus, for those of us who don't know your complete background
story, you have graduated, correct? And did you have chances to go other
places to play? And I guess you have a relationship, pretty close
relationship, with the president. I wonder if you can take us through why you
ended up staying there and who else was interested in you and why did you stay
at UMBC?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Well, I won't get into too much of who else was interested in
me, but I kind of made a quick decision of staying at UMBC. Wasn't really a
decision for me. I knew I was going to stay there all along. This is my
family. I created a legacy here. I knew we could do things like this. This is
one of the reasons I came back. I have a great relationship with our
president. Last year I got to spend a day with him. The first time I met him,
I got to spend one -- like a whole day with him. It was very special to see
how he operates on the campus, just follow him around.  
  
Q. What is it you like about him?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Authentic he was. He was honest with me. We got to talk about
more than basketball. We weren't just talking about basketball, talked about
life after basketball, his story, my story. So we kind of connected real
quick.  
  
Q. Question is all three of you. So many teams come through here and
they say we just have to be better for 40 minutes and we can win this and
nobody really believes them. You guys believe that you can do this and you are
only here because of a late basket in your conference championships. What
makes all three of you and your whole team believe that you can and will
win?  
JOE SHERBURNE: Go ahead.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think the trust we got in each other is what gives us that
little boost. Play for 40 minutes or to hit a game-winning basket. We trust
each other so much that Coach called a play against Vermont, me and Jairus
waived him off. We said we got this. We know what to do. So I think yeah, the
confidence we got in each other and the trust is a key for our success right
now.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like K.J. said, we're very connected as a team. We're very
close with our coaching staff. The players on and off the court very close. We
just trust each other. Every decision we make on the court, we're encouraging
guys to shoot the ball like we don't really ever want him to pass when he gets
it. We're just very connected as a team.  
  
Q. This is for Jairus or K.J. I was talking with one of your assistant
coaches outside and I was talking about your head coach, Coach Odom. He stated
he's very even-keeled and as you guys were going on that run, his kind of
demeanor helps keep you guys calm. Can you talk about him and that and going
into this game and how he's helping you guys manage kind of the emotion and
how big this moment is for y'all?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Well, he has a great role model in his dad who coached at the
biggest stage on this level. So he does a great job of bringing to us what his
dad brought to him. He keeps us even-keeled. We keep him even-keeled. He never
really gets too angry with us. He doesn't really yell at us like that. He's a
player's coach. We kind of like that as players.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think he brings a winning mentality to our team. Since he
touched campus, he told us we're not underdogs, we step on the court to win a
game. Even when we was up 16-14 with four minutes left, he kept us on track,
like don't get too confident. Finish the game the right way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question?  
  
Q. The call against Vermont that you guys waved off, it wasn't the game
winning shot, was it?  
K.J. MAURA: Yes, it was.  
  
Q. So what was the call? You guys just waved it off and you two just
knew what to do.  
K.J. MAURA: He looked at me and said run -- I can't say the play. Run a
handoff play. And it was like no, we wanted to isolate Jairus and let him take
him. Then he called another play and we also said no, we don't want to screen.
Jairus one-on-one. We knew he was going the take the shot and make it.  
  
Q. It was a 3, right?  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. Okay, guys. Thank you.  
  
RYAN ODOM: I'll just take questions.  
  
Q. Ryan, your dad outside said that when you started your coaching
career, he did not want to put you on his coaching staff, wanted to sort of
let you find your own way. What were sort of the good things and the bad
things for you about that path and what impact do you think it might have had
on where you are now?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, I think it's only negative I would say is that we didn't have
that experience together, father and son, you know, coaching together. I think
that could be -- it has been for others a special, special thing.  
  
But, you know, I think it was best for me, you know, without a doubt. Dad, you
know how it is, your dad knows best. For me, it allowed me to experience
basketball and allowed me to experience coaching under other great coaches.
And I've worked for some great coaches along the way and to gain new
experience and new ideas, new styles, which has helped me in this moment right
now for sure.  
  
Q. Players said that they didn't get to sleep until 5:00 or 6:00. It's
certainly understandable. How concerned are you there will be a let-down that
maybe they accomplished everything and be a let-down against Kansas State?  
RYAN ODOM: It's always a concern. This is a historic event. And our guys, we
knew that would be an issue. I'm not the type guy that's going to take their
phone. That's just not how I do things. It's more about they've got do the
right thing, learn how to do the right thing. And, you know, for us, we
experienced this on a much smaller scale when Jairus hit the shot at Vermont.
You know, there was a ton of focus, you know, on us at that point that we
weren't really used to, mostly within the UMBC community, greater Baltimore
area, everybody was excited about going to the dance.  
  
Now this is a little bit different story here. We've got to encourage our
guys, and I already have, you know, to kind of turn the page and we got to
focus here. The biggest thing is, do you want to be done now or do you want to
try to put your best foot forward and continue on? We're playing an excellent
team, all right, that easily could dismantle us. We've got to do a great job
of focusing, just like we have every other game that we've played this season
to put our best foot forward to have a chance.  
  
Q. This is really oversimplification. But do you ever a sense of being
America's team right now and just the idea of the country getting behind
this?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, when you see Sports Center talking about other events and
comparing the game yesterday to other historic events in sports, it's pretty
special, it really is. We certainly understand that. I want our guys to soak
that in, without a doubt. But there are two sides to it, too, for me. It's
obviously a bittersweet moment because I have so much respect for Tony
Bennett, his staff and team, you know. We've got this major emotional high and
obviously they've got this emotional low, you know, at this point. And it's
two different things going on and it's life, you know, it is. It's life.  
  
Q. I did want to ask you about Tony. He was so gracious after really a
rotten situation for him last night. I wonder if you could elaborate on your
sense of him and your appreciation of how he handled it?  
RYAN ODOM: To me he's the best coach in the country. He's a great father
figure, great mentor to his team, not only his players but his staff. He's a
great representative of the university and college basketball in general. I
said it before we played them. They're what college basketball should be all
about and they have high character kids, they have great students, they
compete, you know, to the bitter end in every game, and they don't pat
themselves on the back after they get a win and they do special things.  
  
You know, they understand that they're in this situation for a reason and, you
know, there should be a lot of programs modeling themselves after what he's
been able to do.  
  
Q. Ryan, obviously a few years ago you were put in a difficult situation
here taking over for Allen. What did you learn from that experience? And then
kind of looking back on it, obviously I would imagine there's disappointment
in how it ended. How would you characterize what you learned and where you
went from here?  
RYAN ODOM: Just to be ready at all times, you know. There's going to be --
life is going to throw you some things, you know, that you have to adjust to.
And certainly that was the situation where our primary concern was Allen's
health. And thankfully he's good to go now, and I spoke to him prior to the
NCAA Tournament and he's doing really well.  
  
But, I mean what I did learn most? It was faith. That's what I learned most
during that time. It was a dark moment, certainly for me and others. And, you
know, if you don't have faith you're not going to be able to get through it.
If you don't have your family to help you through those tough times, you're
not going to get through it.  
  
I'm fortunate that I have both and, you know, the good Lord looked out for me
and my family. My son was sick at the time, and so we had a lot of stuff going
on. And, you know, to be sitting in this situation right now, I mean it's a
blessing. It's not me, it's a blessing.  
  
Q. Coach, you played a team last night that prides itself on defense and
you're going to run into that again tomorrow night. Give me how these two
teams are similar defensively and how much they're differently, do this
different?  
RYAN ODOM: Repeat that.  
  
Q. How are these two teams similar defensively and how are they
different?  
RYAN ODOM: I think they are very similar. I think they're very balanced on
both sides of the ball. You know, I think Virginia in terms of ball screens
when they're facing ball screens is very aggressive and they know exactly what
they're doing. They step out hard. Kansas State does it a little bit
differently, but it's a similar effect in that they don't let you inside of
the 3-point line and we're going to have to find ways to still get in there.
That's what we do. We kind of are who we are. We drive the ball. We try to get
inside the defense to be able to kick the ball out or finish at the rim like
Jairus was able to do last night. They are very similar in that they're very
stingy in the half court. I think offensively they're a little bit different.
That's where the major differences are between the two teams.  
  
Q. I know you said you're trying to get your guys to turn the page. Roy
Williams was in here earlier. He said if it was him, he would have to scream
at some point last night to sort of acknowledge it all happened. What was your
night like last night? Did you ever have any sort of release and how are you
trying to get the guys to turn the next page and really focus?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean, obviously it's a tremendous moment, you know, for
basketball in general, tremendous moment for UMBC. We have a great university,
you know. I'm so excited for our kids to be in this moment, but I'm so excited
-- I'm equally excited for UMBC. And we've got a great institution. We have
great leadership, starting from Dr. Hrabowshi to my AD sitting in the room
here, Tim Hall. So many great people. And, you know, for UMBC to be able to
tell its own story now across the world is really, really exciting for me.  
  
What was your other question?  
  
Q. How do you keep the kids focused?  
RYAN ODOM: It's just -- we got to do what we got to do at this point. We're
going to turn the page to Kansas State and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. Some of the Virginia players were saying last night that the way you
defended them reminded them in some ways of what Virginia Tech did to them in
their only ACC loss of the season. Was that part of the preparation footage of
that, and if so, what did you take from that?  
RYAN ODOM: I watched the last five or six ACC games, plus the conference
tournament. We felt like our only chance was to pressure their guards. We had
to outplay their guards in order to have a chance and we had to hold our own
inside. And we felt like if we allowed them -- whoever had the ball up top to
just direct. Like I would equate it to like a quarterback. If you don't put
any pressure on the quarterback, then he's going the see wherever he needs to
see. And guy comes open on the wing, oop, he can make the pass.  
  
So our focus was totally on disrupt the ball handler up top, disrupt their
timing, and that was kind of our focus throughout. And I thought it put us in
position. Our guys were tremendously tough getting through screens. They set a
ton of screens and really hard to guard. And they tire you out, you know, with
that screening. I thought our guys played really, really tough and the
rebounding was critical for us.  
  
Q. Offbeat question, but you had mentioned UMBC and kind of getting your
brand out there worldwide and certainly nationwide. In the niche community of
chess, you guys have been known for a long time. When did you become familiar
with the program history with chess and that niche community and have you had
any overlap at all in the past?  
RYAN ODOM: They won a national championship. We're obviously equally proud of
them, you know, as we are of winning this game. That's the great thing about
UMBC. Everybody cheers for one another across campus. There's so many
different things going on on campus that, you know, it creates a great
environment, you know to learn in. Lot of great mentors. None better than our
president. His relationship with Jairus is -- he's the best president in the
country. I've been fortunate that I've been around lot of different places and
he's -- to be as active as he is and within our teams and not just men's
basketball, it's all the teams, you know, is really, really special. And it's
not just -- obviously athletics. He's so -- and STEM is huge and they're
patterning programs, copying programs that UMBC is doing across the country.  
  
Q. Ryan, for many coaches who pull big upsets in the tournament it's a
life-changing, career-changing type of moment. Have you had a sense in the
last 18 hours how maybe -- how your life is going to change going forward
based on what happened last night?  
RYAN ODOM: No. I'm just totally focused right now on our team, you know, and
where we're at in this moment. This is such a special moment. I'm so excited
for them to be able to play, you know, for an opportunity to go to the Sweet
16. That's mind-boggling to me. I'm going to do my best to help coach them and
mentor them through this, and hopefully we'll put our best foot forward and
have a chance.  
  
Q. Ryan, great first name. My question is, it's obvious that all the
casual viewers who tune in tomorrow's game on TV will be cheering for you. How
much does it mean to you, knowing anyone in here that's not wearing K-State
colors, who maybe only heard about you in the last 48 hours are going to be on
your side the whole time?  
RYAN ODOM: It's huge. I think Jairus mentioned it last night. He was so
excited about all the UMBC folks that traveled down here for the game. We had
a pretty big contingent here. And to hear them cheering for the guys and --
gave them a lot of energy and that's what March Madness is all about, and
we're just happy that we're a part of it.  
  
Q. Ryan, I've had the pleasure of meeting your father, and when this
conversation started, you talked about not coaching with him. But I am curious
as to even though you didn't, what you've learned the most about the game from
your dad?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. Certainly just to be passionate and to be all for these kids.
That's what he did. His entire career was never about him, you know. His focus
was totally on his players and helping them become the best that they could
be, both on and off the court. That's why I do this. And I'm very fortunate
that I'm able to do it at UMBC with these tremendous kids.  
  
Q. Coach, the challenge of preparing for Kansas State when most of their
film has Dean Wade on it as a traditional big 4 and now they're having to play
small without him. How much does that change them offensively and
defensively?  
RYAN ODOM: I haven't watched them a ton with him at this point. Yeah, I think
it definitely changes. They're certainly very athletic when they play that
smaller lineup. Their ability to get inside of the defense worries me. Their
athleticism, their bodies against our guards. We're going to have to do a
tremendous job of trying to keep them out of the paint. Our big guys are going
to have to really fight. They're very opportunistic in transition. So when
their defense is really going and they're knocking balls loose, they're
excellent at finishing ahead. I watched the Kansas game this morning, and that
was a knockdown, drag-out, closer than the final score indicated at the end
there, but, you know, we're excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. As a follow-up with that, Dean Wade is a first team all Big 12 guy.
In some strange way, losing him, does that make them pair better against you
now that their 4 guards are very similar to what you do?  
RYAN ODOM: We'll see. I don't know. I think certainly bigger guys can
sometimes struggle against us. I think that's what you're saying there in
terms of spacing and having to guard the line, you know, but 40 minutes. You
got to play it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you.  
  
RYAN ODOM: Thanks.

### [TJ Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35140)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from Texas A&M. We have from
left to right, TJ Starks, who is a freshman; Admon Gilder, junior; Tyler
Davis, junior; and Robert Williams to my immediate left, sophomore.  
  
Q. Tyler and Admon, if you could take us through the opportunity of
going up against the defending champs, basically in their backyard, and the
excitement for that.  
TYLER DAVIS: It's a blessing to be able to compete against such a great coach
and team. It's was a lot work done for, you live for these opportunities.
We're all excited and ready to play.  
  
ADMON GILDER: Like Tyler says, a blessing to be playing against a winning
organization. Each one of us are ready to play. Give it our best effort.  
  
Q. There's this is a question for TJ. I don't know how much you expected
that you would be playing during this season when it began, but can you tell
us a little bit about like what you thought was going to happen and how it
sort of evolved into you playing such an important role?  
TJ STARKS: At the beginning of the season, I knew I was going to contribute to
the team, but I didn't know that I was going to take on a great role the way I
am right now. So, I just put in a lot of work and I knew my time was going to
come eventually, so I was really prepared for the moment.  
  
Q. Robert or Tyler, I don't know how much you know about Carolina, but
they have a different lineup this year. They're not as big as they've been in
previous years. How do you guys feel like you match up with them? Do you feel
like you do have an advantage on the inside against them?  
THE MODERATOR: Robert.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: Yeah, we definitely feel like we have an advantage obviously
against anybody on the inside because of what we do. Carolina is a different
matchup. Their bigs, 1 through 5, shoot. It's going to be a difficult task for
us. But our coaches are putting together a good game plan and hope we'll beat
them.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: I feel like we always have the advantage on the inside, but their
bigs are really talented. It's going to be a different way to guard them.
Going to be tough to guard, but I feel like we have the versatility to guard
any position.  
  
Q. Robert and Tyler, you guys have had a few different starting point
guards during this season. Is having the point guard changing, does that force
you guys to adjust or do the point guards sort of play up -- play a particular
style in a system? Tell us about adjusting to different guys at the point.  
TYLER DAVIS: We just -- we play to the system, but I mean not every point
guard is the same. TJ, he's a scoring point, but, you know, we play to his
strengths and he plays our strengths. I think we did a good job of that.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: Like TJ is a scoring point guard and with that ability, he
opens up a lot of stuff for the team of the guards and we use it to our
strength.  
  
Q. Tyler and for TJ. TJ, if you could speak to the challenge of going up
against Joel Barry. And then defensively, Tyler, they've got Maye at the 5,
how difficult of a challenge that is?  
TJ STARKS: Joel Barry, he's a senior guard. Of course, he has good experience,
so I just have to come ready to play. I know he's going to give me a good
challenge. We have to stay focused and stick to the game plan.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Luke is really good. I know what kind of player he is and what
kind of mindset he has. He has the worker's mindset. He's going to come at me
hard like he does everybody else, from what I've seen. It's going to be a fun
matchup. It's going to be a lot of fun having to guard him.  
  
Q. The veterans for Carolina have played 13 games I guess now, in this
tournament over the last three seasons. How do you guys combat that experience
edge that they have, and how have you prepared for the tournament setting
where you're getting ready for a game 48 hours after you had played another
game against a team that you don't see regularly?  
THE MODERATOR: Admon.  
  
ADMON GILDER: We just stick to the Coach's plan. We try to play our brand of
basketball each and every game. And like we've seen last night on the TV, it's
anybody's game. So as long as we come out and play hard and play aggressive,
it's anybody's game.  
  
Q. If I could, I'd like to go one each for TJ and Admon. TJ, when you
got handed the keys to the car, what was that conversation like with Coach?
Probably wasn't something that you initially were expecting. Tell us about
what that dialogue was like.  
TJ STARKS: He just tell me to play my game, just do what I know how to do.
Told me to stay poised and just control the game, control the tempo. And he
tell me that I don't play like a freshman, I don't act like a freshman. So he
just tell me to be mature about the situation and handle it the right way. And
I feel like that's what I've been doing this whole time, and I just keep
believing in him and he believing in me and we just going to keep rolling.  
  
Q. Admon, after a couple of different people have played point guard, TJ
steps into the role and you guys end up being successful. How important was it
that he was there to sort of step in there? If you don't have TJ, how do you
think the arc of the season might have gone?  
ADMON GILDER: I know TJ is a hard worker. I say that each and every day. He's
in the gym every day before and after practice. And I guess, you know, if he
wasn't there, I guess we'd know he's the next man up. That's how this program
is. So I think everybody on this team has done a great job of being ready to
play. And so, like we said, we just go out there and do what we do.  
  
Q. Guys talk about it, I guess this is for Tyler, Robert. This is
essentially a home game for Carolina. Talk about playing in this type of
environment, and do you think the fans going against you will kind of fuel you
or work against you?  
THE MODERATOR: Tyler.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: We've done pretty well on the road in neutral court games. So,
they're going to have a really good crowd, lot of fun, lot of energy. But we
know it's going to be us out there battling against everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Robert.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: We know they're going to have a big crowd out there. We know,
we live for the moment, we play and impact the way of games. We feel like
there's nothing but fuel. We don't fear it at all.  
  
Q. Admon, you touched on this a minute ago, what was it like for you as
a basketball player, even though they're in the opposite pod, watching the
UMBC game last night?  
ADMON GILDER: We were watching at the hotel. It was just amazing to see how
UMBC came and they played, brought it to them. They played hard, they played
their brand of basketball. That's what we try to put our hats on playing our
brand of basketball wherever we play. And so we have great bigs. We have great
guards who play different positions. Just knowing that -- seeing that, it
gives -- gives teams around the country knowing it's anybody's game in any
given night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay, guys. Thank
you. Good job.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Excited to have advanced in the tournament. That's what it's all
about, and makes you feel a big part of it when you win a game and you can
kind of follow how the tournament goes. And to play against a Carolina team
here in Charlotte is something that every coach and every player would be
looking forward to. So we're really excited to be playing against a really
good team. Know we'll have to play really well to get the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the arc of your season to arrive here, how much of
that do you think had to do with the depth that you had at point guard on this
roster this season?  
BILL KENNEDY: You know, I think we played a lot of different lineups, we've
gone through a lot of different things. And I think just the experience of
playing TJ starks at the 2 earlier in the year and he played -- backed up the
1 against some really good preseason teams that we played, he's been -- his
first start was at Kansas, I think helped get him ready for this moment. I
think that's a good point. I think that's one of the reasons why we're here
today is because he's been through some different things and our team has been
through some different things. We've weathered the storm and been pretty
resilient through it.  
  
Q. Just to follow-up on that, yes, you did weather the storm. What was
it like being the coach in the storm?  
BILL KENNEDY: It wasn't a dream situation. some of the things we went through.
One of my toughest years as a coach because we had such great expectations and
started off so well. We started out 11-1, fifth in the country, and rose up
real fast and we did it with a broken lineup even then. Robert Williams didn't
play against West Virginia in the beginning of the year. We added him to the
team in Brooklyn and we continued to win and we continued to press on, and I
thought we got better and then we had the injuries. The injuries were the
biggest problem. When you lose Duane Wilson, who is an older senior for us and
experienced, one of the true experienced guys that we had, that's been in the
NCAA Tournament, that's played in the Big East, played -- we lost of him. That
was a big loss. Losing Admon Gilder the first, I think, four games of
conference play is not when you want to lose a guy to injury. He had had knee
surgery and came back and really muffled up our lineup, muffled up our
rotations. We started one group one way and then next week we started the
older guys and went back and forth. So, hopefully that we survived it, it made
us tougher. Our guys hung in there and believed what we were telling them and
thankfully we're in this position today.  
  
Q. I came in a couple minutes late from your locker room. I've sorry if
this was asked before. The challenge Joe Barry presents your freshman point
guard when North Carolina has the ball, but then also when they run Maye at
the 5, which they've been doing, the challenge that that presents
defensively.  
BILL KENNEDY: No question. He's the most experienced, probably best point
guard in Roy Williams's system in a long time. When you look at the games
they've won and what he's done. I saw him in high school, he's a five-star
player, won a State Championship. The kid is about winning. The kid -- he
understands how Coach Williams wants to play and it will be a tough matchup.
But TJ hasn't surprised me. There are no surprises with TJ. He can make two
great plays, he can make two plays and I'm pulling my hair out. So, I don't
think there's anything that TJ is afraid of. That's the one thing we like
about him. He doesn't lack any confidence and that's a good guy to have in
your fox hole when you're going against Carolina in Charlotte, to have
somebody who is not afraid.  
  
So, hopefully he won't get caught up in the transition game and we won't just
run up and down with them because that's not something we want to do. We want
to wait on our bigs. It will be a new experience for him, but I like our
chances because of his confidence and what he's been through already.  
  
Q. With Maye?  
BILL KENNEDY: With Luke Maye, that's a tough matchup with anybody. That's why
they've won so many games, because he's an experienced post guy who goes on
the floor and push it on the break. I knew they were really good. I knew their
personnel before. I was sort of watching them on tape. As you watch them on
tape, you see Theo Pinson pushing the ball in transition one minute and Luke
Maye the next play and back to Joel Barry. That's what makes them so good in
transition. You can prepare for it but -- in a short amount of time, but you
don't know how good until you see it.  
  
Q. Coach, we saw history last night. It's known that Carolina has never
lot of a game in Charlotte. Is that something you talk to your team about, you
know, let's do something else, let's make more history here in Charlotte as
you head into this?  
BILL KENNEDY: That just motivates me a little bit more. I didn't know that.
We'll use that as motivation. We've got -- we're going to come in here loose
and play. That's the thing, we come in here and have fun and enjoy the
experience. And we're here to win. We're not here to just show up. We've
talked about this moment from the spring on last year. The Final Four is in
San Antonio. We don't want to go there to eat chips and salsa. We want to
play. In order to play, you got to be able to beat Carolina or beat good teams
that are in your way. We'll use that as motivation. And we know it's a tough
task because Coach Williams is a great coach and Carolina is Carolina
basketball. You just know it's going to be a challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the challenges that Joel Barry and Luke may
present. What about this matchup gives you confidence? What are the things you
like before you go into this next game?  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, we've got five guys who can get you double figures
anytime, also. At the 3, 4, 5, and our length and size is something they've
not seen a whole lot of. I thought Providence, Coach Cooley made an
interesting comment that our length really bothered them. Until you go through
it and see it, you know, it's a tough experience. So, hopefully our inside
play and our size will be a factor and our guards will make shots. When our
guards make shots and take care of the ball, we're hard to beat because Robert
Williams and Tyler Davis are a load in the post.  
  
Q. Playing with motivation and playing with momentum is a great thing
and a bad thing. How do you hone in that motivation into something great
instead of it's overwhelming your players into making mistakes to where it
causes a problem?  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, again, you hope preseason experience and the teams we've
played, you look at who we played against and playing at Kentucky and playing
against a good Arizona team on the West Coast, Kansas. We've seen a lot of
different things. You hope your experience prepares you for this moment. But
you never know until you go through it. That's the one advantage Carolina has
over probably anybody else. They'll play all year and they've had it all
season long, they've experienced a national championship and experienced it
moreso than any other team left playing.  
  
So, if you're going to get past that, it's good to play -- now is as good a
time to go through it.  
  
Q. Coach, there's only a limited number of hours that you get to prepare
for this game. Can you sort of give us an idea about how much of the time is
spent focusing on the things that you guys have done and how much of it is
taking a look at Carolina and what you can do to them?  
BILL KENNEDY: We do transition defensive drills everyday. So I mean, we spend
-- from the beginning of the year to this time of the year, even today we
practiced, we work on transition defense. That's an emphasis. But in the short
amount of time -- we got to watch them play the first ten minutes here and
then we went back at the hotel. And not knocking Lipscomb, because we know
anybody can win, but we started watching Carolina right away. And the thing
about Carolina, I've been watching them my whole life. So, I think we'll know
more about them than they'll know about us. I hope that's an advantage.  
  
You know, you see them all the time. You don't see Texas A&M on television
every night or hopefully you're starting to see us more and more. It is
different. Yesterday, yesterday that's all I did. I was locked in my hotel
room watching film, trying to get as familiar with their personnel as
possible. Today we're going to go through it, show film tonight, and then
we'll just go play. But you got to hope that your body of work in practice
throughout the season prepared you for this and not just this last day and a
half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions.  
  
Q. Billy, I don't know if you heard Roy Williams' comments yesterday,
but he called you one of his heroes because of what you've had to go through
as a coach and through seven years and maintaining strength and overcoming a
lot with your health situation. What did that mean to you when you heard
that?  
BILL KENNEDY: It's obviously special because I got so much respect for Coach
Williams and we've talked about it on the road some, because he's had some
health issues and he knows some people that have had Parkinson's Disease. He
understands that it's a challenge, and he's really been supportive. Every time
I see him, Roy is Roy, he's a special man, he's a special coach. And for him
to say something like that it's definitely touching and encouraging.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions at all? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Thank you.

ROY WILLIAMS: I'm not going to start out by telling you how Tiger stands
because I don't know how Tiger stands. I'm very appreciative of these guys up
here with me and very appreciative of the guys in the locker room. We didn't
play our best. Lipscomb was more active than we were early. We had I think
five turnovers in the first eight minutes and they had more points off
turnovers at half and ended up with more points off turnovers than we did. I
looked down at the stat sheet and we have five guys in double figures. We
shoot almost 52 percent, hold them to 36 percent.  
  
So, there were a lot of good things. I think late in the first half, I yelled
at them in the huddle and they tried to show me how dumb I was and they went
out and played very well the last four minutes and got us a little bit of a
margin and then just kept playing and making plays. Theo was 15 points, 10
rebounds, 7 assists. I love that. Kenny being 4 of 5 from 3-point line. So,
you got to win one to be able to stay around and so we won one, and I'm
pleased for the guys up here and the guys in the locker room.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kenny and Theo.  
  
Q. Kenny, just talk about how special today was for you.  
KENNY WILLIAMS: It was very special. I was excited all week to come to play.
My first game playing heavy minutes in the NCAA Tournament. So, you know, this
is what you look forward to growing up. So, you know, I was a little bit more
excited about that.  
  
Q. Theo, what was your preparation for Garrison Mathews?  
THEO PINSON: Just to make everything tough. I mean watching clip tape, you
thought everything he was going to throw up go in. So, we just wanted the make
everything tough, and we knew we couldn't support the that much on him. Once
he gets going, he gets going. I remember I was watching because Mike was my
teammate, so I was watching the championships game and I saw he had like 39 or
36 or something like that. I knew if he got going it could be a long night for
us.  
  
Q. Theo, can you tell me when you incorporated the coast-to-coast part
of your game and why exactly that happened? Did you get the Coach's
permission? Did you see the floor open? When was that and why was that?  
THEO PINSON: I think I got coast-to-coast when I was five. I remember when I
was five, they got mad at me because we was doing jump balls and I just
grabbed the ball and tried to go coast-to-coast and lay the ball up. It didn't
start now. Building confidence and understanding that I have a gift and I
could put pressure on the defense, especially playing at the 4 position, I'm
the trailing big so it gives me a little more room to operate and make plays
for my teammates and myself.  
  
Q. Theo, you just said you're the 4, yet you've become the main
distributor ever since went with the small lineup. How have you embraced that
role, and have you had to change your game to adapt to it?  
THEO PINSON: It's just -- that's something I've been doing since I've been
here, trying to make plays and give get my teammates open and open shots. At
the same time I'm more -- I'm a focal point now. People want to stop that, of
course, but at the same time, I think if I can get into the paint or I can
draw somebody's defender and we got great shooters, like Coach said, we got
really good shooting team Cam, Joel, Luke and Kenny. We even had a
conversation during the game. I tried to get Kenny's man to draw to me a
little bit longer, which I could have picked to him, but just trying to make a
play and get his defender to come off so I can kick it to the great shooters
we have.  
  
Q. Kenny, you guys had some trouble getting clear of them the first
half, but was it a matter of just not turning the ball over and did you feel
like once you kind of took care of that, you'd be okay?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Yeah. We were turning the ball over. That's what kind of gave
them confidence. I think they had 13 points off turnovers in the first half.
That gave them a little confidence and let them stick around. We were beating
ourselves. Once we got over that hump, we were all right from there and we
just had to get stops and finish on the other end.  
  
Q. This is almost the same question. But Theo, why do you think you guys
started so slow and was that a product of whatever?  
THEO PINSON: I don't really know. I guess just trying to get your feet wet.
It's a big time game. You win or go home. It's the bottom line. If you don't
have jitters, you're not human. We needed to get our feet wet, and once you
saw we got going, we got going and I think we responded well.  
  
Q. Question for Theo -- actually I'm going take one for each. Theo,
question for you is, Kenny was really good on the 3 point arc today. When you
guys were in Brooklyn, he did a lot of finishing the break. What part of his
game do you really, really impresses you the most?  
THEO PINSON: He's a basketball player. That's the biggest thing. People want
to just call him one thing and that's a shooter. I mean today he made a left-
hand floater, left-hand floater. Wasn't it left hand? He's just not --  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: That was a bad shot. That was a bad shot.  
  
THEO PINSON: But he showed them he can make it. So maybe he got an opportunity
to do it again. Kenny is a basketball player. That's the type of players Coach
recruit that they can do more than one thing. Just showed today.  
  
Q. Kenny, since it became the post-season you've been playing really
well. Is there something about the big games that you think maybe stirs
something inside of you?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: You know, I think so. I'm competitive, so I think that's just
the competitive nature of me wants to step up when the games get bigger. And
also know now it's do or die, win or lose, win or you go home. I know I had to
step up my play going into the post-season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Kenny or Theo?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Before they leave, let's get this straight. That was a bad shot.
You guys need some coaching. Why was it a bad shot?  
  
THEO PINSON: I don't know.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I don't know.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: He doesn't practice it during practice games. I'm dumbfounded,
this rascal doesn't have the answer. He was standing under the basket. All he
had to do was bounce, pass, layup.  
  
THEO PINSON: I clapped like you did.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Theo is always ready to stay longer if you need him.  
  
Q. Roy, can you speak to the way that Kenny has played here down in the
post-season?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, he has had some good games. He's had a pretty doggone good
year. I think he's one of the five best defensive players in our league. He
led our team in charges, he's really good defensively. Today, he picked up the
two early fouls but he made two 3s, but he's had a pretty doggone good year
all year.  
  
Now, one thing, the team the other night when he got somebody else asked a
question about his layups -- you or Roger or somebody else? Makes no
difference. The other night they were trying to press us. So Theo broke the
press and threw it to Kenny because we do believe in attacking against the
press. He's a really good basketball who is hungry. Last year he got hurt and
didn't play all that time period. His freshman year, he was 1 for 13 from 3.
He likes having success. But he has had really a good year for us all year.
He's been our most consistent defender. And I'm not sure who is the leading
3-point shooter, either he or Luke. They shot it pretty well. He's taking it
to a little bit of a different level, which is okay for me.  
  
Q. Roy, you said yesterday you wanted the team to have fun here and
enjoy themselves. Was your pregame routine chilling with your grandson there
on the bench, was that part of your effort to have fun?  
ROY WILLIAMS: No. The kids grow old so quickly. I used to get Courtney on the
bench if I could, mostly at home. I never let Scott come down to the bench.
That's one of the things I regret. So later on after he got older, Neil was my
assistant, even I got Neil to have his sons down on the bench. We came back to
Chapel Hill and I got Coach Robinson and his sons and the same thing for Coach
Davis. I love the picture a hundred years ago. You guys never saw the picture.
I saw a picture of Tark sitting on the bench and his son Danny was sitting on
the bench with a coat and tie on. Danny will hate me saying that looked like a
sweet little kid. I've always remembered that. I know I didn't have that neat
memory with my own son.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you've been successful at a lot of places. You're
now 15-0 in this building, 12-0 in Charlotte. What about Charlotte brings out
the best in the Tar Heels?  
ROY WILLIAMS: We have good players who have really played well. The fans do
help us, and I'm willing to see if we can pass a law that says we play all the
NCAA games here. I'd be willing to go for that. But usually we played really
well here. '05 -- excuse me, '05 particularly I thought we played great here.
So, players play. I've never lost to a building, but this has been very
comfortable for us. Hopefully, it will last one more game.  
  
Q. Roy, Joel Berry passes Michael Jordan on the all time scoring list. I
know Michael didn't play four years, but is that a line of demarcation for a
Carolina player? How would you put that into perspective when you pass him in
the record book in that way?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm sure every kid, you know, you say something like that, I
start grinning. I mean, my gosh, but the 23 was pretty good. Having that extra
year probably would have helped him, too. But you still, you're ahead of
Michael Jordan in something. Lot of guys aren't ahead of Michael Jordan in
anything. I'm happy for Joel. But also I've never had a point guard goal tend
a shot that was not going to go in. Let's remember that's one thing I told him
on the bench and in the locker room, to goal tend a shot that is not going in
was not the smartest point guard play I ever had.  
  
Q. Roy, you're going to go up against a big strong team Sunday. Have you
seen a team like that this year? How will you matchup with Texas A &M?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm sitting on the fence with it because I haven't seen them
very much. Maybe it was the ACC tournament. I watch a lot of games, but it's
games against people we're getting ready to play. I watch 10 or 15 minutes of
an NBA game if one of our guys is in there. I saw a few minutes -- I think,
who did they play first game of the year, some other country? West Virginia.
Wasn't it out of our country? I watched that. That was the first game. Watched
a little bit of that.  
  
I saw them play a little bit of Kansas for about 6, 7 minutes. So I really --
I know Davis is a heck of a tough kid around the basket. I know Williams -- I
wish I were related because he's as good an athlete as I've seen. His dunks,
he dunks them straight down. His dunks don't go in sideways.  
  
Billy, just think about what that guy has gone through physically and mentally
over the last five or six or seven years. I'm a big fan of his. I'm a big
admirer, the health problems that he's had and still doing what he's doing the
way he's done it. I really am. I'm a big hero. He's one of my big heroes
because he's handled some tough stuff. But I don't know that much about their
team, and I need to find out a lot more in the next 48 hours. I know a lot
about their head coach and I'm a great admirer of his.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Three more questions.  
  
Q. Roy, Scott tells people he's really pissed off at you for sitting him
on the bench.  
ROY WILLIAMS: I offered it to him, but I let him get a little bit too old. He
said he would rather sit with his buddies. I know he has not said what you
just said, either.  
  
Q. Same thing about Theo, the busting out, is that the alignment or his
maturity or you just saying take the dadgone ball to the basket? How did that
happen?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's something that's been happening since Theo started playing,
number one. But this year it stands out more because he is the 4 man. The 4
man has got to try to pick him up. Every year even, Theo's freshman year, for
Justin Jackson, for Harrison Barnes, every perimeter player I've ever coached,
I said if you get the ball off the board, I want you to bust out on the break
because I'm old school, old guy. The best fast break basketball I ever saw in
my life was Magic Johnson getting the ball off the backboard. It wasn't when
Kareem got it and made an outlet pass or James Worthy made an outlet pass.
It's when Magic got it off. He busted out on the break and already left two
defensive players behind. He made good decisions on the other end and could
take it to the basket himself and lay it up.  
  
I'm not trying to say that Theo it is Magic Johnson, but that's been in my
brain for a long time. I coached that same way at Kansas, I've coached it that
way at North Carolina every year. The perimeter player gets the ball, busts it
out on the break. I think it's the best fast break there is.  
  
And Theo, his freshman year he had a bad assist to error ratio. His assist to
error ratio has been really good. A couple of his turnovers were offensive
fouls I thought were questionable. He's a play maker. I like for him to do
that. If he doesn't get the rebound, I want him to run to the low post on the
other end. Because again, the guy that's going to have to guard him is a 4
man, he's going to come and set a rear screen on the lob, gets him out on
court against a 4 man. It's been more evident because he's attempting it more
and the 4 guys are trying to pick him up.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your perimeter defense. You
took away your 3-point game today and really did a good job with that.  
ROY WILLIAMS: It was one of the three things I put up on the board. We put up
three things before every game. And it didn't have to be a nuclear physicist
to figure out we needed to stop them or try to hold they percentage down. We
really wanted them to not shoot a good percentage from 3-point line. That was
one of the things we put up. But you know, with our guys, we're the biggest
remedy for anybody that's got 3-point shooting woes. I'm telling you what, let
me make sure, Kenny Cooper was a 1-55 before tonight, so we decided to help
off in the post. He makes three of them. Another guy that made one at the end.
And I don't mean to pick on somebody that was 6-36. Like several years ago we
didn't go into Kentucky and play them they can't make a 3. Shoot, against us
they make every daggone one they look at. If you have a bad 3-shooting team,
just play us and you're percentage will go up quite a bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. UNC since the tournament kind of have rocky starts in the beginning.
How did you plan to combat that going throughout the tournament?  
ROY WILLIAMS: First of all, it's hard for me to answer when I disagree with
what your question is. Last year we played Texas Southern. We won by 40 or 50
or something. Justin made five 3s in the first half. Back in 1982 before you
were born, we had Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins, James Worthy and we blew out
James Madison in the first round 52-50. There have been some struggles there.
You just got to play. I've never thought we struggled in the first round. I've
always thought we struggled more each and every round we go. But winner stays,
loser goes home. That's the way we try to approach it. Thank you guys very
much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Barry Brown Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34873)

### [Kamau Stokes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32973)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 69  
  
Creighton - 59  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously we're so thrilled for our guys. You know, since day one
last spring when we got back, after, you know, we lost in the NCAA, took our
couple weeks off, Barry took leadership. They didn't question anything. They
came everyday, worked their tails off. And we said this is what you work for
to get this opportunity and thought they took advantage of it. We were very
well prepared. We said we have to guard them, they're one of the best
offensive teams in the country. Some of the best offensive players in the
country. We did a great job defensively, made it really tough on them.  
  
Obviously Barry did a great job on Marcus, who is a really good player. But
all our guys, it was a team defense and you hold them to 59, I don't know if
anyone has done that all year. I've looked at that closely, but it's pretty
impressive. And then, you know, we always talk about somebody stepping up and
having a special moment and obviously Mike McGuirl since the beginning, I
thought he was the surprise of our summer. And then he had injuries, and to
his credit, you know, he's been very, very patient. Took himself out of red
shirt when Cam got hurt and came back. He got his chance the last couple games
and rose up and plays like a veteran. Played a lot of big plays. Cam got us
off going, it was good for him to get his shot going. You could see a little
smile on his face. He had his struggles, but I thought both ends of the game,
and then Barry kind of took it over in the second half, you know, made the
plays we needed to make. So it was a great, great win for our guys. So happy
for them, and now we get to move on and, you know, see who we play on Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Cam and Barry, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Cam, for you specifically, how big a relief was it to come out, make
your first three shots, get your team the lead you guys pretty much held
throughout the game?  
KAMAU STOKES: Seeing the ball go, it really felt good. It all came down to
focusing on making a shot. And like I said, seeing the ball go through the
hoop felt really good.  
  
Q. Barkry, what was the key to shutting down Marcus? I know it's a team
thing, but you were on him most of the day.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Just I watched a lot of film with him -- I meant on him with
Coach Frazier, just trying to see where he picks his spots, what he likes to
do on offense, and kind of memorizing their plays a little bit. So I kind of
knew the play before they ran it through and so I was just jumping a lot of
stuff and kind of denying him a little bit and it worked out. My teammates had
my back, back doors and stuff like that, especially on switches and hedges and
ball screens. It worked out.  
  
Q. Barry, what was different about the way you guys operated without
Dean Wade tonight?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I felt like it was -- we had our backs against the wall
knowing D wasn't going to play. Like Coach said, credit to Mike. He stepped up
big time, gave us a big lift off the bench we needed. I mean, we missed some
of the stuff that D does. Some of the guys stepped up and rebound and defended
like it was our last game, and that's our mindset going through this turn.  
  
Q. When did you find out Dean wasn't going to play?  
THE MODERATOR: Cam.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: Game-time decision. We didn't know. Yeah, it was just a game-
time decision.  
  
Q. Can either one of you talk about the contributions of Mike McGuirl?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Mike he played his butt off today, 6 for 10 from the field,
3 of 5 from three. But all the little stuff you don't see. He had some great
defense. He might not have got a steal, but he had some great defensive
contributions, switches and talking and knowing where to be and helps out. He
had a great game today.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you --  
THE MODERATOR: Players first.  
  
Q. Barry then Cam, is this the most rewarding win you've been a part of
at K-State?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It's very rewarding to show what we're about, and we can not
only make the tournament win a game against a top offensive team, hold them to
59 points when they're averaging way more than that. It's very wonderful for
our guys to know how we worked in the off-season to be to this point.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: It's very rewarding knowing how hard we worked to get to this
point. We wanted to get here and win a game, and winning the game is
rewarding, but we still got work to do.  
  
Q. Barry, can you describe what it was like when Coach told you Wade
wasn't going to play? And for Cam, what did that make -- how did that make you
feel?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We knew -- like I said, we had our backs against the wall
without Dean and we huddled up and we had guys that stepped up. Mike stepped
up, like I said. Cam hit some shots. Cartier hit some shots. Everybody stepped
up and contributed a little more to make up with what Dean brings to the
table.  
  
Q. Told you in the locker room?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It was a game-time decision.  
  
Q. Cam, you were in the middle of a dynamic play towards of end of the
first half. Cartier blocked, you get the ball, alley ooped to Xavier. Talk
about how it helped you guys keep going with the momentum?  
KAMAU STOKES: A play like that is a momentum changer. Makes you feel good and
your energy goes up. Credit Xavier for running the floor. He always does that,
been doing that this whole year. It was an energy booster for us.  
  
Q. Barry, Creighton never led this game. That's not the first time
you've done that lead from wire to wire. Every time they made a push at you,
you guys pushed back. What's different about this team and how good are you at
maintaining leads like that?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, I think the Big 12 kind of prepared us for this time
and I think it's just we have a little bit more poise. Lot of guys played in
this situation before last year and we weren't able to pull it through, but I
think that year of experience helped us to stay poised and stay calm and
confident when they made that push. I think they cut it to like 2, and so we
were able to make the plays and defend and come out with a win.  
  
Q. Barry, I don't misquote you. You said something earlier this year
about riding with your Coach and how much he meant to you. Did you want to get
this win for him tonight?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I wanted to get this win for Coach. I know how much he cares
about it and how much times he puts into this basketball program when he could
be with his family. I really wanted to get it for him and our fans, just the
whole Wild Cat Nation. I want to get it for our players, myself, everyone.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more question for the student-athletes if anyone has one.
Nope. Okay. Thank you, Cam and Barry. You guys head back to the locker room.
Good job. We'll now take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sorry, Bruce. Could you, if you can, tell us what you said to Marcus
as he walked off the floor for the last time tonight?  
BRUCE WEBER: I just congratulated him. I said all along, you know, I have
nothing against him. I'm in this for -- I started years ago. I was a fifth
grade teacher. I coached kids on the playground and that. It's about kids and
that's why I've stayed in it. And I want guys to be successful and if he -- I
just said congratulations. I'm happy. I hope you got your head-on straight.
And he had a heck of a career.  
  
So, I mean I told him the same thing and asked about his mom. Got a great mom
and family. You know, again, I'm proud that I recruited him, coached him, and
I'm proud that, you know, I maybe helped him get in the right path or right
direction.  
  
Q. Coach, that was a season low for them, tied a season low, 59 points.
What was your strategy going in and how were you able to contain Foster?  
BRUCE WEBER: Barry is one of the better defenders in the country, and from day
one I asked when he was a freshman, I said who is going to be our stopper. He
raised his hand and he said I am. I just kind of blew it off. He's taken that
role, he loves it, he's -- and the thing he talked about, he has been in the
office every day since, you know, since Monday watching film on them. And
because we knew how good he was and what he did and you can take away a couple
of the quick hitters, where they get them on the back doors where he can get a
couple easy ones, you know, it makes it tougher on him on the tough shots to
contest it.  
  
The other thing we talked which was just stay in on him a lot, like Trae Young
we talked about, when he drove, we told him to call, to stay there, make him
make tough shots. He never -- he made one at the end, but other than that he
never really got going. So it was -- we've been good on defense. Plays some of
the best offensive teams in the country. We told the guys that this was
probably more like Kansas and Oklahoma or TCU, but, you know, they rose to the
occasion and they took the challenge on. And beside Barry, Xavier was really,
really effective, because Thomas is really good player, too, and Xavier did a
great job on him, gave us great energy, hit a big 3 when they kind of made a
run. Somebody asked about the question about seemed like every time they made
a run, we made the big plays. Xavier got some big rebounds. Obviously the free
throws was the one thing we could have been even a bigger margin. Just happy
to win and advance.  
  
Q. Bruce, in terms of when you're replacing Wade and dribbling his
minutes and responsibilities, I mean was McGuirl the like Option A or how --
what was the thought process by which you ended up with him taking those
minutes?  
BRUCE WEBER: We've been through this before when Kamau Stokes got hurt in the
third game at Big 12, breaks his foot at Texas Tech. That's when Barry showed
great leadership, called his own team practice, got with Dean, said hey, we've
got to take this team on our back. So they've been through it. Word I put on
the board today was "persistence." There's nothing more important in this
world than being persistent. You got to -- we told them we can't replace
Dean's scoring, but we can guard them. If we keep them at a minimum, then
somebody else has to step up. I guess the best thing was Mike and Amaad and
some of those guys got a chance against Kansas last Friday to get in there and
get a little confidence and feel good about themself. And so when they got in,
I mean obviously Mike didn't hesitate. It looked like he's been a starter or
played many minutes all year. So, you know, it had to be a team effort. I
thought we made some tough shots early, you know, but we kept making big plays
and Barry got going on some of those ball screen actions and in the second
half. Just a great team effort. You can't replace Dean. He's one of the best
players in the country. But you had to do it with great team work, great team
defense, and some people stepping up.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you talked about being happy for the guys, but how
gratifying is this for you? Does this relieve any pressure for you?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't worry about that. I'll be honest. It's just helping the
guys and preparing them and I put my heart and soul into everyday. I love
coaching, passion for coaching young men and watching them develop. And, you
know, it's about them having the experiences. I've had these experiences. Do I
want to go to the Final Four? Heck yeah, that was an unbelievable ride. It
would be fun to do something like that again. But, at the same time, for those
guys to experience this, it's special and they're pretty focused. They were
excited in the locker room, but they know obviously we're going to have a
tough task on Sunday.  
  
Q. Can you just take us through the decision process with Dean?  
BRUCE WEBER: Dean tried to do some stuff on Wednesday before we left, little
more active stuff. Then yesterday we got him more involved with some stuff and
we just wanted to see how he would be after. And today we went to shoot around
and, you know, he just said, "Coach, it still hurts. I don't think I have the
mobility. I don't know if I can do some things." You know, so Dr. Macatee
(phonetic), Luke Saber (phonetic), and myself met with Dean. We talked about
still being ready if we needed to have him take the ball inbounds or an
emergency thing. You know, he's so smart, if it came down to one reply and
getting the ball, I'm putting Dean in there and he was willing to do that. I
talked to his parents right when I got on the bus and told them I didn't think
he was going to play and they understood. You know, I love -- Dean, we
couldn't get him to talk, but in the first huddle when we were going on the
court, Dean was up talking. He was talking to Mac the whole time. He's really
grown up. And it's sad he's not part of it, but it's still great for our other
guys that they were able to rise up and find a way to win.  
  
Q. Coach, follow-up, is there any chance he plays on Sunday or are you
ruling him out?  
BRUCE WEBER: We told -- Dr. Macatee, we talked to Dean. We said come back
tomorrow and we're going to go back and do some treatment on him. We'll have a
short practice, you know, see if it improves and he wants to go and give it a
shot and we need him, I don't think it's going to be major minutes, but, you
know, he wants to be part of it. If it helps us have success and move on, I'm
sure Dean will be there giving his all.  
  
Q. Coach, you put "persistence" on the board. Was this -- is that
exactly what your team did and won this game with a great deal of persistence
and tenacity?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't think there's any doubt. Resilience. Whatever the words
are. I look for the quotes for the week and the game. There's nothing more
important in this world than persistence, and it can overcome talent and the
intelligence. That's what they are. Barry is probably as persistent as anyone.
Little stubborn, but he's very persistent. And I thought our guys really --
every time -- obviously that shot at the end of the half was huge. Then we
came out, made the run, and they make the run and we come right back and make
plays. And, you know, I'm just proud of them because they've been very
resilient, persistent throughout the year.  
  
It hasn't been a smooth sail the whole time. We've had to deal with injuries
and tough losses and a lot of the different things, but they've stayed the
course and really bought in and listened to the coaches and can't be more
proud.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 69  
  
Creighton - 59  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Congratulations to Kansas State. I thought they played a heck
of a game and defensively were very disruptive early in the game and I thought
forced us into some uncharacteristic decisions. Rather than maybe using the
pressure against them, we probably fell into the trap of trying to beat it too
early in the possession and probably didn't get as good a shots as we'd like,
especially early in the game.  
  
Defensively they had 32 points at the half, they hit two 3s as the shot clock
was running down and their center who has made 2 all year hits one. I really
felt like defensively we did what we needed to do to be in a good position. We
just weren't very good offensively and K-State certainly had a lot to do with
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: The questions are now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcus, why was it important for you to give Coach Weber a quick hug
before you left the floor after a tough night?  
MARCUS FOSTER: He called me over there. I was going to give him a hug after
the game anyway. He called me over there and told me he loved me and proud of
everything I accomplished.  
  
Q. Any of the players, on the defensive end, as the game wore on, how
deflating was Kansas State's ability to make tough plays even when -- even in
situations where you were in the right position to defend it?  
THE MODERATOR: Toby.  
  
TOBY HEGNER: I mean, you got to give Kansas State a lot of credit. They made
tough spots when they needed. We were in the right spot a lot of times.
Sometimes tough shots go in and you got to give credit to them and wish the
best for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Marcus.  
  
MARCUS FOSTER: Xavier Sneed, he hasn't been shooting the ball that well. He
hit a couple 3s that got them going. And McGuirl, he got going, too, and we
never seen him play. And they just did a lot of things to get us out of rhythm
and really couldn't get our rhythm back on. We got it down to 2 points and we
couldn't get over that hump.  
  
Q. This is for Marcus. Great scorer such as yourself to have this kind
of night, what are you trying to do during the game to maybe get yourself
going and why weren't you able to get any sort of rhythm?  
MARCUS FOSTER: I was really just trying to get my teammates involved more. I
seen they were collapsing the paint hard when I drove and they were attaching
to me as soon as I crossed half court so I couldn't get the ball. You know, it
was just giving me hard looks all night and I really just couldn't find my
rhythm.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Toby, Tyler, or Marcus?  
  
Q. I guess Marcus, given how much pressure you were under all week and
given how it ended, what are you going to think about the most, your Creighton
career this season despite having kind of a sour ending to the story?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Just a family bond that I built with these guys and how they
taught me how to be unselfish by their attitudes day in and out. I'm just
going to remember all the trips that we took, and I'm just going to miss going
to practice every day with my guys, you know. I'm sad we lost the game. I'm
even more hurt that I won't be able to spend as much time with my guys like I
usually do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay guys,
thanks. You guys head back to the locker room. Congratulations on a great
year. Questions for Coach McDermott.  
  
Q. Specifically what did K-State do to take Marcus out of his game so
much?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: They met him early and made his catches very difficult and
then obviously anytime he put it on the floor they were really rotating with
help. They're very physical and Marcus at times can overwhelm you with his
physicality and they were able to match that.  
  
We were trying to maybe try too hard to try to get Marcus something easy to
get him going, and unfortunately we could never get him started.  
  
Q. How tough is it as a coach to see a player end his career with a game
like that when obviously he's capable of playing much better?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I mean, you play a lot of games and games like this are going
to happen. Just a reality. As I told Marcus in the locker room, a lot has been
made this week about what Marcus -- what Creighton has done for Marcus Foster.
What hasn't been talked about is what Marcus Foster has done for Creighton.
The changes he made in his life to become the person and the player that he is
today certainly have benefited him. We've been the recipient of a great person
and a great player and back to back NCAA Tournament appearances because he's
made those decisions in his life.  
  
So, I wanted to make sure he understood how much we appreciate what he's done
for us.  
  
Q. I missed your opening statement. Sorry if you addressed it. You knew
K-State would be pretty physical and aggressive defensively. Why do you think
the guys weren't able to adjust in the moment?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: In some ways defensively without Wade, you know, they can
switch everything four ways and because of that, we weren't able to get in the
teeth of the defense. And they're extremely athletic across that guard court,
very physical, and when we had good shots early, we didn't make them and
really that 10-2, 12-2, whatever we were down early, that pretty much ended up
being the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Just in the huddles reading the players' body language and things
like that, how I guess constantly deflating was Kansas State's ability to
always just keep you close enough to think you got a shot but then make enough
tough shots to put some separation between you guys?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I thought we weathered it pretty well the first half because a
couple of those were back breakers. The one they hit at the end of the shot
clock, Mawien hits the one in transition and hit two all year and then of
course the one at the end of the half. We were able to bounce back from all
those, and that's 9 points. And in a game like today, 9 points is like 20
points because it was such a low possession, grind-it-out game. I thought our
guys were able to keep their senses about them and because -- because we had
some really good defensive possessions that ended with them hitting some tough
shots.  
  
And sometimes you have to tip your hat to them. You know, as you look at the
stat sheet, we had more points in the paint, points off turnovers were the
same, we had more second chance points, fast break points were the same. They
just -- they made more shots than us and were able to get to the free throw
line quite a bit more than we were.  
  
Q. Greg, it's easy from my vantage point to draw parallels between last
year and this year NCAA Tournament games. I guess from where you sit, are
there things that showed up a year ago that maybe showed up this year as well
in terms of the preparation or getting ready for a game and the way it
unfolded?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Our preparation was really good this week. Obviously it's
difficult to simulate what they do because they're so physical and they've got
some length in the guard court and our prep was with Wade playing. They're
quite a bit different without him. Some ways better defensively. Obviously you
take him off the offensive end, it's a totally different team because a lot of
what they did was to get him the basketball. So in some ways our plan was
thrown out the window because he didn't play. Like I said, defensively we
played well enough to win. We just -- we didn't make shots today and -- but
Kansas State deserves a fair amount of credit. They made some tough shots at
the end of some good defensive possessions and we missed some tough shots at
the end of some defensive possessions, and sometimes that's the way it goes.  
  
Q. There are obviously some emotional embraces with the seniors. This is
probably a loaded question. But what did you say to each of them as they
walked off the floor? And then also Khyri is in an interesting situation
because his future is kind of up in the air based on what he hears this
summer. What did you tell him as you took him off the floor for the last time
tonight?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I told him no matter what he decides, I'll love him just the
same. I'm here to support him and we said we'd wait until the end of the
season. And that's now, so we have to start having some conversations. But
Toby and Marcus, I told them how much I appreciated them. Toby has been
through -- his first year was Doug's, Grant and Ethan, his senior year we were
at the top of the mountain. The next year we went 4-14 in the Big East.
They've seen the program at a high and then as low as it's been and now back
to the point where we're in back to play NCAA tournaments. Tyler and Toby have
been an important part of that because of their leadership, because of their
unselfish attitude, and obviously Toby had a tough six weeks with his mom's
diagnosis. He hasn't really let it impact his ability to do his job in
practice and be the teammate and the leader we need him to be.  
  
I told Marcus how proud I am of him. It's a great story because not every
young person that gets lost ends up finding their way. And it took the effort
and patience of a lot of people. The most important person in that process was
Marcus. Marcus is the one that had to decide, you know what, enough is enough,
I'm going to make the changes in my life and get back to the person that I
know I can be. And I'm proud of that, extremely proud of that. Proud to have a
hand in that, proud to try to be a mentor for him and show him the right way
and let him know when I'm disappointed and when he makes a poor decision but
also celebrate the good times.  
  
Because he had had enough of people telling him what he was doing wrong. He
was well aware of what he was doing wrong. So, it's one of the neatest stories
that I've been a part of in my 30 years, to see someone really do a 360 in
their life and to have a hand in that, it's way more important than winning or
losing a basketball game.  
  
Q. Greg, your players at times this year talked a little bit about
toughness and needing to, I don't know, just kind of match the physicality or
toughness of the opponent. How big of a concern was it through the course of
the season? And going into today, were you concerned about just being tough
enough to compete?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I think anytime you play a team like K-State you're concerned
with toughness. We were plenty tough tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you.  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Jairus Lyles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35075)

### [K.J. Maura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35073)

### [Ryan Odom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35071)

### [Joe Sherburne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35074)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
UMBC - 74  
  
Virginia - 54  
  
RYAN ODOM: Obviously historic game, you know, for UMBC. Unbelievable. So proud
of these kids. I take so much joy in watching them smile and not just at the
end there but throughout the game. You know, I think it's pretty easy to tell,
everybody in the arena, these guys have passion, these guys love to play this
game. This game means a lot to them and, you know, just a special, special
effort. You know, particularly the game, I thought our defense, you know, in
the first half really helped us out to go in 21- 21 at halftime after not
really shooting it particularly well, you know. Obviously Virginia has a lot
to do with that. You know, was tremendous. Gave our guys some life there. They
felt like they could play, you know, with them.  
  
Then the second half, you know, we continued to get stops, and then all of a
sudden we began to run much better than we did in the first half and our
spacing was tremendous and we were able to get some shots off in transition
that would not normally happen had we not been able to get a stop. You know,
obviously, you know, these guys right here, Arkel was tremendous, Jordan was
tremendous. Throughout the game, our big guys came in and did what they
typically do and defending, you know, really well and rebounded.  
  
But, you know, I'm so happy for the three seniors. Obviously Joe is getting
ready to be a graduate here soon, too. He's getting ready to be a senior.  
  
But the other thing I would say is Virginia, an amazing year. Coach Bennett,
amazing Coach. Their staff unbelievable. You know, I love Orlando Vandross
like he's my brother. And obviously you could see the pain, you know, after
the game once it settled in there. You know, you feel for them. But, certainly
doesn't take away the happiness that I have for these guys right here. These
guys have worked extremely hard to earn a moment like this, and to have two
back-to-back moments, you know, America East championship with our backs
against the wall, down 9, to come back and win that game and then, you know,
just to go toe to toe with the number 1 team in the country, I mean,
unbelievable is all you can say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jairus, we were having discussion before, are your parents UA
graduates?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yes.  
  
Q. Lester Lyles, is that correct?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Lester Lyles and Carol Motley.  
  
Q. Will that be any subject of conversation in your family?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think they wanted us to get the win most importantly, but it
probably will be a topic of discussion for a little while.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned being tied at halftime as giving you kind of some
confidence. Was there a moment for each of you where you felt like hey, this
was going to be your night?  
THE MODERATOR: K.J.  
  
K.J. MAURA: We started getting stopped on a constant in the first half and
that give us the confidence to get going on offense. The first half was low
scoring game, but we knew it was getting the shots we wanted. We wasn't making
it the first half, but the second half we shot the ball with more confidence
and that gave us a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think at halftime when we were tied at 21 and we hadn't shot
particularly well, we made some silly turnovers, then we felt there's no way
we're not going to win this game. All we have to do is start hitting shots.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think we had the confidence coming into the game. I don't
think there was any point in the game that we thought we couldn't play with
them. We knew we could play with them before the game. Tying up with them at
halftime definitely gave us more confidence. And like Joe said, like K.J.
said, we didn't have a lot of shots, we had a lot of turnovers, me myself
included. We definitely went into the second half with a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. I saw you checking your phone on the way in. Are you already starting
to get texts from friends about this? Second part of the question is, can you
put in perspective the magnitude of this upset, number 16 seeds have been
0-135 in the NCAA Tournament.  
JAIRUS LYLES: Of course we just made history tonight. It's always exciting to
make history. It's a very exciting moment for us in UMBC especially.  
  
Q. It seemed like at some point in the second half you couldn't miss.
You had that running one-handed 3-pointer. When did you realize that this was
a night you just sort of had to take over?  
JAIRUS LYLES: They did a really good job of me in the first half, but I had to
be patient and slow down, read the plays better. And I did that in the second
half and my shot was falling. So, credit to my teammates for finding me.  
  
Q. I know that you came back to UMBC with a goal to win an America East
title. Could you ever envision yourself in the position you are right now when
you came back?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Definitely moments you dream of. We didn't know what seed we
would be when we won America East championships. Once we saw that 16 seed we
knew we had a chance to make history. It's a very surreal moment.  
  
Q. Jairus, you and Jourdan were there in the final seconds drilling out
the clock. Just what was that like as you looked around and saw all of this
finishing?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I just wanted to give credit to our fans. They traveled a long
way to come here and support us. They were in the game the whole time. It
really helped us throughout the game. Credit to them. We were just having a
moment saying we did it. We knew we could do it. It's a special moment we
shared right there.  
  
Q. This question is for K.J. Just for a point of clarification, was that
your family holding the large head of you and the Puerto Rican flag as well?  
K.J. MAURA: Yes, that's my family. They've been watching the last couple
games, especially the championship game of the America East.  
  
Q. So my question for you on that is, I guess how much significance does
the Puerto Rican flag or heritage and the family being here for this
tournament run mean to you, not just in this win but in all you've
accomplished in your career so far?  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, I carry Puerto Rico in my heart. It's a very special moment
for them right now, making history as a team, but I'm also making history for
my country. I play for them, especially after what happened with the hurricane
and all that stuff. We've been hurting lately. This moment give them a little
bit of life to my country, and I'm very proud and happy for that.  
  
Q. Any of the players, to beat the number 1 team overall seed, I know
you said it hasn't totally sunk in yet. Does that change or alter maybe your
outlook of what you can get done in this tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I don't think so. We go into every game thinking we have a
chance to win. Kansas State won, right? They're a really good team too. We
have another big challenge ahead of us on Sunday.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like he said, a big challenge on Sunday. Kansas State,
very good team. But beating the number 1 team definitely gives us confidence
going into that game. We've got to stay level-headed and focus us, execute the
coach's plan read the scouting report, go from there.  
  
Q. This question is for Joe. You had the first 6 points in the second
half to give the team the lead. What was going through your mind and the
team's mind when you knocked down those shots?  
JOE SHERBURNE: In the first half I passed up a couple 3s and that really
angered my teammates. So in the second half, I made sure I got some off. And
there was one I missed and Arkel got the rebound, passed it right back to me.
I thought about doing an extra pass over to K.J., but I knew everybody was
going to yell at me if I didn't shoot that one, too. I just let it go.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you guys. Could you sense at any point in
the game like was there a shift where could you feel like Virginia knew what
was going to happen? Did you ever feel like you sort of took the spirit away
from them?  
K.J. MAURA: I think the first media time out we took 7-point lead. I think at
that moment we started believing more in ourselves and gave us confidence to
keep getting the shot selection we needed and put them in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think we were up 6 right away early in the second half and --
7 right away in the second half, and we were getting real excited on the bench
but there was still like 16 minutes left in the second half. I personally was
trying to stay really level-headed and you know that they can come right back
right away real quick because they're the number 1 team in the country for a
reason.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, you guys realize you've just inked your names
in college basketball history forever, right?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, definitely. We were talking about it before the game, just
trying to go out here and make history, doing it for our program, our
teammates, our coaching staff. We just wanted to make history today.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think we kind of all wanted to be in the One Shiny Moment
video. We were all in the locker room singing the first line because that's
all we know, but I think we're going to have to learn the rest of the song,
too.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I haven't seen it actually yet. It's still an undescribable
feeling. Maybe it will sink it when I get back to the locker room.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Congratulations. You can head out to the locker
room. Questions for Coach Odom.  
  
Q. Yesterday the players described going up against K.J. in practice as
very annoying. Clearly his defensive style is good enough to make him
Defensive Player of the Year in the Conference. So what you saw from K.J.
today, was that same old K.J. or do you think he just went up another level
during this game?  
RYAN ODOM: To me it was pretty much same old K.J. He's a pest. That's what we
encourage him to do each and every night. Obviously he's giving up a ton of
size, ton of weight, but his heart is as big as there is in this country and
he's not afraid of anything and -- or anyone and he just attacks. We felt like
from a pressure standpoint, that was the key to the game for us going in. We
had to try to wear them down and pressure their guards. And they're really
good at getting under the basket and coming off of screens, and their big guys
are very good as timing when to screen. And that can wear you down, and we
felt like we had to wear them down more in the full court, you know, before
they got to half court, and K.J. is a big reason why we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Can you put this win in perspective given your family's history with
Virginia, the way you're feeling right now?  
RYAN ODOM: Obviously Virginia is a special place. I mean, it's a special
place. It was a special time for the Odom family when we were there. You know,
so many high level people, so many high character people, so many successful
people, and we were just fortunate to be a part of it. And, you know, for us
to be able to beat a Virginia basketball team that's had an amazing season. I
know that they just lost one of their best players, so that is a factor as
well.  
  
You know, they probably will not say that because that's who they are, but
Hunter is a big, big player for them and -- but, you know, take nothing away
from our guys. Our guys just battled throughout.  
  
Q. You've expressed kind of your respect for Coach Bennett. I'm curious
if you'd share, what did he say to you after the game?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, he just said "Congratulations." He said, "You guys did an
unbelievable job." That was pretty much it.  
  
Q. Kind of the mirror image of that earlier question, but given your
many connections to Charlotte, was it special to do that here?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean certainly, you know, my family and I, we had an
unbelievable experience here in Charlotte because so many friends and family
here, not just at the university obviously at UNC Charlotte, but just in
general. My brother still lives here. My parents live in Winston-Salem. My two
best high school friends live here. You know, so absolutely it's special to
win here for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, against the best defensive team in the country, talk to us
about how your basketball team was able to shoot 19 for 28 from the floor,
almost 68 percent and score 53 points against the best defensive team in
America.  
RYAN ODOM: I think it starts with our defense. We were able to get stops, and
when we're able to get stops, our guys are able to run and push the ball. And
K.J. and Jairus are very, very good in transition, and we're hard to match up
with, you know, when the guys -- they're sprinting it up the court. He's a
little wizard with the ball and finding guys and, you know, our guys are in
sync, you know, right now. They know where each other are going to be on the
court. And we knew going into the game, you know, a big key was going to be
the 3-point line. For us, we had to dominate that stat right there in order to
even have a chance and, you know, certainly that proved to be true. Our
defense, while the shots were great, our defense was magnificent.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had some stints at UNC Charlotte with Nolan Ryan. Can
you talk about your coaching journey and your stints.  
RYAN ODOM: It's a blessing, you know. My time at Charlotte was tremendous. We
had great family-type atmosphere that was created there. Judy is right here
and Ken, just great people. And, you know, it started with them. And Allen
obviously got sick in the middle of that year, and that was our main concern
was his health. And that certainly helped me -- you know, the confidence that
Allen had in me, the confidence that Judy had in me, to finish the year there
was tremendous and it gave me on-the-job training.  
  
You know, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Neil Mackey (phonetic) who passed
away this year. He took a shot on me at Lenoir Rhyne. And the kids that I
coached there, I've talked about it ad nauseam to my guys at UMBC. I had some
of them in the stands tonight from LR, quite a few people came to support.
And, you know, that season was magical. It really was. The amount of passion
that those kids had, you know, for the game was unbelievable.  
  
Then to get the opportunity at UMBC, Tim Hall who is here, you know, gave me
an opportunity there or here. And, you know, these kids have been equally
unbelievable and, you know, from day one. They've just bought in and, you
know, they believe in themselves. We've taken our lumps, but at the same time,
we've just persevered and we have a very resilient group.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to know when Jairus Lyles in the first half had 5
points and then in the second half scored over 20 plus, when he gets on a roll
like that, that he did in the second half, do you just let him play it or do
you call any plays?  
RYAN ODOM: I always let him play. I never try to hold him back at all. With
Jairus it's all about just reading the plays. He's got an amazing nose to
score the ball. He's unbelievable. But his teammates have so much confidence
in him, and when he gets going like that, it breeds confidence into the other
guys and I think you saw that tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Billy Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30583)

### [Robert Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35095)

### [Tyler Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30813)

### [Admon Gilder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30841)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 73  
  
Providence - 69  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Good to win a hard fought, physical game against a well-coached
team like Providence. I thought we played through our post guys and did a good
job of getting it inside and did a good job of rebounding for the most part.
And I thought Admon Gilder the first half was tremendous. When we really
struggled scoring, he made some big plays for us posting up and scoring in a
variety of ways.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now raise your hand.  
  
Q. Both you guys, Tyler and Admon, you missed your first ten shots. You
go 633 without scoring. How good was the defense intensity there to keep
yourself in the game when you weren't scoring a basket?  
ADMON GILDER: We put our heads on playing defense. Coach Kennedy tells us
everyday that's where we're the best. Having the bigs, Tyler and Robert, with
the shot-blocking ability they have and the keeping the guards out of the
lane. Just we just kept on fighting and that's what we did today.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: We just played defense, man we played hard. You know it's going
to be stretches where they make their runs offensively. We hang our hat on
defense. That's what we've done all year.  
  
Q. Admon, you're usually pretty businesslike. When you hit that 3 late,
that was a little bit of draining there, can you tell me what went through
your mind there?  
ADMON GILDER: I new it was a gig shot. TJ drove in the lane, does a great job
of getting in the lane. Once I fit the 3, I felt good and all the emotion came
out of me, so --  
  
Q. This is for Robert and Tyler, just the importance of rebounding the
way you did, how much of an advantage is that in any game you play, much less
against a team that maybe doesn't have your size?  
THE MODERATOR: Robert.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: It's something we take pride in every game. Our coaches
stress to us before the game, the other team emphasize hitting us, boxing us
out. We wanted to guard them and show them and be more aggressive doing what
they do.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: We're out there doing our jobs. We know we have the advantage
inside most games, so this is just another game where we came out and gave a
hundred percent effort on the glass.  
  
Q. Robert, what were you thinking on the dunk like you tried to size up
a highlight reel moment and late in the game?  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: Actually wanted to go through my legs, but I thought the
Coach would take me out.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: He can't go between his legs, believe me.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: I thought he was going to take me out. Highlight moment, like
you said, to create memories.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Admon, how about TJ, especially in the second half where he was
scoreless in the first, this guy has so much confidence. How big was he in the
second half with 15 after the break?  
ADMON GILDER: He did a really great job of keeping his composure. He kind of
struggled a little bit, and in the second half he got it going for us inside
the lane. He started hitting the 3s. He started running our team like we know
he's capable of doing.  
  
Q. Talked about rebounding, you two out-rebounded their whole team. You
couldn't have even thought that would happen before the game started.  
TYLER DAVIS: We got a lot of help from our guards, too. Our guards put bodies
on the outside so we can play one-on-one on the inside. It was really a team
effort. We were able to snag a couple boards.  
  
Q. Robert and Tyler, Providence does a decent percentage of its scoring
slash to the basket with the ball. Your size seemed to really be a counter on
it.  
Are you the kind of team that you know neutralizes teams that go to the
basket?  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: We're the type of team that tries to execute the Coach's game
plan and scout. We figured Providence is a slashing team. They play small, try
to take advantage of the bigs so me and Tyler had to move our feet, get dirty
with the guards, I guess you can say that, any way to help our team win.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Just doing our job. Rob got it.  
  
Q. Admon, I'm curious, first half 33 percent, second half 68 percent.
Any difference? What led to that difference?  
ADMON GILDER: Came out and played hard. We was up by one at the halftime. We
know we said in the locker room, Coach said to keep your foot on the gas.
We're here to have fun and enjoy the experience.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Admon, Coach already talked about what you did in the first half, you
know, especially offensively kind of brought you guys back into the game. Did
you feel like that needed to be done with the start that you guys got off
to?  
ADMON GILDER: You can say that, but like I say, I said, we said we had the
size advantage and luckily I got going in the paint. That's something you
don't see everyday. Like I said, we execute the game plan and got it done.  
  
Q. Admon, I know that you talked a little bit about how Starks played
today. But generally speaking, the way that he's come along during the season
to be the guy he was today, can you describe what you see in the way that he's
developed?  
ADMON GILDER: He's developed like extremely -- I know everyday -- he's one of
our hardest workers. He's in the gym every day, putting up shots, working out
before and after practice. I'm not surprised of what he's accomplishing right
now. I think he has more to come. And so as long as he keep his composure,
keep his mind right, he's going to be a great player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more question for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler or Admon or Robert, whoever wants to take it. I'm curious, can
you talk about what the -- I guess for lack ever a better word -- the mood or
atmosphere was like in the locker room halftime. Surely you don't feel like
you didn't play well, yet when you go in with a lead after the slow start that
you had.  
TYLER DAVIS: We just stressed staying together. We know there's going to be
ups and downs in the game, but at halftime we knew we had to stay together,
talk things out, what do we see on the court, and come out and win the first
five minutes of the second half.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: I say a lot of reassurance, just letting your teammates know
and coaches know we're supposed to be here, we deserve to be here and we have
a mission and go out and destroy the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Admon, Tyler and Robert, good jobs. You guys head back to the
locker room, which is still open. We'll take questions for Coach Kennedy.  
  
Q. You guys were tied I think 50 all with 9 minutes left, went on a 12-2
run during a critical sequence. What went right for you guys when you finally
wrestled some control away?  
BILL KENNEDY: I thought we made some blocks and shots and got some run outs.
We were able to get some easy baskets in transition to play. Tyler got -- the
intentional foul was a big play that separated us in that possession but I
thought we did a better job of getting stops and breaking. Look at Diallo and
Bullock, they both had 22 and 21 points at that position, they started making
3s. We had to start switching ball screens late and, I thought that helped us.
Robert switched out. We blocked some shots on the mismatches when they went
one-on-one and that broke us open, broke the game open with some freelance
plays.  
  
Q. Billy, when you weren't scoring, 633 without a point and missed your
first ten shots, how good were you defensively? Can you just speak to that
stretch where you guys didn't get down on the defensive end?  
BILL KENNEDY: We started out the game in zone, something we haven't done all
year, just to try to throw something at them a little bit different. They were
prepared for it. But I thought we got the ball inside, we just missed some
shots. I thought Tyler had some opportunities around the basket with his jump
hook. If we can get him one-on-one on the block, most times we're going to
live with that.  
  
I thought we had some good looks. We just didn't score. That's what I told the
guys at half, guys, we missed shots, we got the ball where we wanted to. As
long as we keep taking care of the ball and keep going inside out, we'll be
right to break the game open, and fortunately we were able to do that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what Admon meant to you defensively
when you're playing man-to-man. When Chandler was in there, he's got Diallo,
and when he wasn't, he's covering Cartwright. Those are two completely
different type players. He's covering them both.  
BILL KENNEDY: Yeah, he was tremendous. I think. I think having a week to rest
his knee some and get him up close -- he's almost a hundred percent healthy.
That's it. He played the whole game, and coaches kept saying do we want to
give him a break. I said no, we're going to go as long as we have to go with
him. He's played 40-minute games for us in the past last year and he plays
both ends of the floor, and that was critical for us in winning this game.  
  
Q. Billy, I'm curious when you went man what your defensive focus was.
Was it Cartwright? He never really seemed to get going.  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, it was Diallo and Bullock were our game plan to matchup
with them the right way, and early on we didn't switch ball screens. I think
when we did start switching ball screens, it kept Cartwright in front of us
and I think we blocked the shot, one of his shots in the lane was big. And
then Robert Williams guarding Bullock did some good things late and sort of
getting out on him quicker and blocked some shots for us. It was big for us.  
  
Q. Billy, how big was the early Starks 3 kind of got him going and I
think you had three straight possessions with an assist in there, then made a
layup. How important were the first few minutes of the second half for him?  
BILL KENNEDY: We've learned you got to take the good with the bad with him,
you know, because as a freshman he can get streaky and offensively be
dominant, and then he can try to do too much at times, which I thought he was
right on the edge of doing too much part for me, but we got him out of the
game and recomposed and our guys did a good job of lifting him and standing
together and act encouraging him through times where he got frustrated, he
thought he got fouled a few times and got frustrated. His play in going
downhill he's really hard to stop once he gets going.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the way that that front line works, I mean you
were talking about it a little bit yesterday that 6' 9 ", 6'10", 6'10", how
unique a thing do you think you have here and how big a difference did it
make?  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, obviously when it's good defensively it's really good for
us, and I thought we did a good job. Robert was more active offensively than
he's been in a awhile. He's raised his game up a level, knowing he's got to
play more aggressive this week. And first five minutes of the game, he got the
ball twice and he missed shots, but he was aggressive going to the basket.
When he's aggressive like that, he's as good as anybody in the country and
that was big for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Kennedy? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Thanks.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 73  
  
Providence - 69  
  
ED COOLEY: I appreciate you guys waiting. Lot of emotions go through your head
in those types of games. First you got to give credit to Texas A&M. They
played well when they had to, so congratulations to them and good luck in
their next round.  
  
As far as Providence, I don't think we played well and I think that had a lot
to do with it. I just didn't feel my team played with the purpose and energy
that we've played with in the past. I thought we did a great job coming out of
the gate in particular in the first half, but we couldn't throw the ball in
the basket so defensively I thought we did a good job. Halftime we're right
where we needed to be. Cut the lead to one couple of times in the second half
and couldn't get over the hump.  
  
But when you look at the big picture, I'm really proud of the group. It's
really sad that I have to see these seniors leave and, you know, do what
they've done at Providence College over four years getting to the tournament.
I feel like I let them down. Hopefully, I do a better job with the next group
if we're fortunate to get into this game again. It's just sad. It's the
finality. You don't have any more games with these guys, and I couldn't be
more proud of them. But give credit to Texas A&M, they did a really good job.  
  
I thought their length, it bothered us particularly around the rim in the
second half, but I didn't -- I don't think we played the way we wanted to play
and then we tried to hold on for dear life and we weren't fortunate to move
on. But, you know, it's part of life. You win and you lose and you learn from
the losses.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alpha, how would you describe the impact that their front line size
had on the way that you guys wanted to play the game?  
ALPHA DIALLO: Their length really bothered us inside. They would throw the
ball in almost every possession and when doubled they would get tough layups.
We tried to limit their second shot opportunities, but as good as a team they
was, they got some, got some crucial ones, too. So --  
  
Q. Rodney, in the second half you guys finally made some shots. You made
two back-to-back 3s. How frustrating was it in the first half to just not to
be able to make some shots?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: I mean it was frustrating not to make shots, but at the end of
the day we were still in the game to win it and a few balls didn't bounce our
way and they had the last punch.  
  
Q. Jalen and Rodney, with your time here in Friar Town done, when you
look back on your time as a Friar, what are you going to think about?  
JALEN LINDSEY: I just think about the great memories I've had with the players
that have been through here that I've played with and the players I'm
currently playing with. And honestly, man, at Providence College is more than
just basketball, and I think they helped me become a man and taught me life
lessons along with how to be a better player. So, you know, I'm blessed to
have the opportunity to go to Providence College. I'm definitely going to miss
it, so --  
  
RODNEY BULLOCK: The experience that I've had here, I've grown up and became a
man. And it's just been great with all the experience playing in the Big East
tournament, playing in the NCAA Tournament, feel how it feels to win. And be
here five times in a row, it's something nobody will ever be able to do and
it's rare. It's just been great for five years here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alpha, in the second half A &M shot 68 percent Did they do anything
differently in the second half offensively?  
ALPHA DIALLO: I wouldn't say they did anything differently. We tried to limit
them, limit their shot attempts and contest most of their shots. They're
definitely getting a lot of 50/50 balls and then those led to easy 3s for
them, which hurt us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Alpha, this team had some ups and downs throughout the middle of the
season but stayed up and had a great Big East tournament run. As a sophomore
with this team, can you speak to what the senior class meant to getting you
guys to peak at the right time this season?  
ALPHA DIALLO: With the leadership of these guys -- without the leadership of
these guys, I don't think we'll be anywhere close to where we are now. Kyron
does a great job. Rodney, Jalen, and other guys in the locker room, they do a
great job of basically leading us on and off court, telling us what to do and
not to do and it sucks to lose in the First Round and having these guys, their
last time here. But we're definitely going to be in the gym this summer and
work on all our flaws and hopefully get back here next year for a 6th
straight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rodney, they missed their first ten shots, but I think in that
stretch you guys only got off to a 6-0 lead. Was that a little frustrating to
maybe not create a little more distance at that point, even though it was
fairly early?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: In the game I thought we did come out with low energy. I feel
like we did have a few shots there that just didn't go in. It happens at the
beginning of the game. I mean, just didn't roll the way we wanted them to
roll. We still had a chance to win the game, so that's it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Rodney, Alpha, Jalen, thank you. You guys head back to
the locker room. Congratulations on a great season. We'll now take questions
for Coach Cooley. Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Ed, all season long it's been tough to find the pulse of this team.
Did you think that they came out the way they needed to? Obviously
offensively, as you talked about you, just missed some shots, but overall,
were they ready to go?  
ED COOLEY: You know, normally when we're getting stops, that's when we're
really efficient offensively and we just couldn't find that -- we had great
shots, looks at the basket, whether it was zone or man, we were getting the
shots we wanted. But part of our Achilles Heel this entire year was not being
able to complete an assignment and that's missing shots. Definitely was
frustrating, but at the same time, I still thought we were where we needed to
be in striking distance of winning the game. And I thought Alpha hit it right
on the head. Two stretches in this game that I thought was -- it was death to
us. There was a 10-point swing. We missed a 3, they get a 50/50 ball, of which
they had five out of seven possessions when they scored five times. That was
critical. We miss a 3, they make a 3. We miss a layup, they get and a 1, game,
set, match. Now you're trying to play catch-up and hoping to get a call here
or there. That's the most frustrating part for me, because I don't think we
played nearly as well as we needed to or had to in order to advance in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Ed, how much are you encouraged by the way that Alpha progressed this
season and what he can be for the future of the program?  
ED COOLEY: Alpha is a very competitive young man, very prideful, very proud of
him and his development and how far he's come in a short period of time. He'll
be one of the better players in the Big East, if not the best player in the
Big East in time to come. This year is a great learning experience for him. I
thought he grew up a lot last year as a freshman and definitely took a big,
big leap this year. He'll be one of the veterans we look forward to, to lead
us back next year.  
  
Q. Ed, in terms of the Aggies' front line, 6'9 ", 6'10", 6'10", how
unique is that and how impactful is that?  
ED COOLEY: Their length was very impressive. Definitely bothered us around the
rim. They blocked four, five jump shots that I haven't seen anybody in our
league do. But, you know, their length was big, but at the same time
Providence didn't play the game it needed to. I didn't coach the game I needed
to. Hopefully, again I said next year we get an opportunity to be in this game
again. Their length is pretty impressive and definitely bothered us.  
  
Q. You talked about needing to boxout to get those rebounds and
everything. Big difference in the rebound totals today. What was -- was it
that, was it something else that kind of caused it?  
ED COOLEY: We missed a lot of shots in the second half. That was for sure.
Even though we were checking out and I thought we did a decent job, they had
length rebounds, you know, they had length rebounds. There's really nothing
you can do. That's God's gift to them. It's really nothing you can do about
it. You keep encouraging your kids but you know when you got 7-6 wing length
and 7-5 wing length, that's genetics. It's like you. You're short, I'm tall.
That's your problem. That was our problem today. We weren't long enough in
some of the balls they got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
ED COOLEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
UMBC - 74  
  
Virginia - 54  
  
TONY BENNETT: First, hats off to Coach Odom and his staff and UMBC. They
played a terrific game. They thoroughly outplayed us and they did a heck of a
job. Very hard to guard offensively and they defended us well. I was concerned
with the 4 guard or a 4 perimeter offense heading into this, and we didn't do
the job. And I told these guys in the locker room, you know, a week ago we
were cutting down the nets at ACC Tournament and how good that felt and they
had a historic season, they really did. I said that to Tracy, CBS, after the
game, in terms of ACC wins and ACC Conference Tournament Championship and then
we had a historic loss being the first 1 seed to lose.  
  
So, that's life. We talk about it all the time. The adulation, the praise, it
comes and we got a lot of that this year. Then on the other side, they'll be
blame and people pointing that out. That can't, in the end, you know, define
these guys and our team or us, because it was a remarkable season but we got
thoroughly outplayed. That's the reality of it. And I hate for this team, the
way they played to lose like this, but for Devon and Isaiah to go out like
that and Nigel being a fifth year for us.  
  
So, with that, if you play this game and you step into the arena, this stuff
can happen. And those who haven't been in the arena or in the competition,
maybe they don't understand that. But there's chances for wonderful things to
happen, but when you're in the arena, stuff like this can happen and all those
who compete take that on. And so we'll accept it. And again I want to
congratulate the job that Ryan and his staff did. They played well and we did
not.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kyle or Ty, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, what was UMBC doing effectively really at both ends
of the floor and then especially at the start of the second half?  
TY JEROME: They spread the floor, they made shots. I don't think we defended
well. We didn't pass the ball well. We didn't come off screens well. We didn't
do anything well tonight, to be honest. And give credit to them, too, because
they played well. They're a good team, but we didn't do anything well.  
  
KYLE GUY: Defensively they were very quick and were beating the screens and
were cutting and stuff. Just hard to get in a rhythm. Once we got down 8 or 10
we we're trying to make home run plays because you don't want to be in this
position and so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Kyle or Ty?  
  
Q. Ty, you know, you listed a bunch of things that sort of were
happening about why you guys didn't -- about how you guys didn't play that
well. Do you have any idea why it happens that way?  
TY JEROME: You know, it's basketball. You're not going -- I mean, I don't know
why. I don't know why, no. I guess we didn't -- maybe we didn't come ready to
play today. We didn't shoot well, that definitely doesn't help. But to only
have five total assists as a team is pretty bad. So, I guess we didn't move
the ball well, didn't shoot well. We probably should have gone into the post
more. I don't have the answers.  
  
Q. Both you guys, obviously it's a tough spot to come in here and answer
questions. I'm curious what have you learned from Coach Bennett that prepares
you for this part of basketball?  
KYLE GUY: You know, I love Coach Bennett, but there's not really a whole lot
that can prepare you for this kind of feeling. He has instilled a lot of
humility and unity throughout our team. So it will be easy for us to bounce
back, but there's not really any answer to make you feel better in this
situation.  
  
Q. This question is for either one of you. What did you guys talk about
at halftime being tied 21-21? What did you think you needed to do in the
second half to sort of swing things back in your favor?  
THE MODERATOR: Ty.  
  
TY JEROME: It's tough to remember but I think we just said every possession
was going to matter. It was 21-21 and they had a 3 off an offensive rebound
and a 3 when we didn't scramble correctly and make a right rotation. That's 6
of their 21 points. Every possession is going to be matter, we're going to be
in for a battle and we had to buckle down, especially defensively, and
offensively just be more aggressive, spread the floor a little more. And we
didn't do either one of those things.  
  
Q. Kyle, Lyles had taken only two shots in the first half, I believe,
scored 5 points. Then gets 23 after intermission. What did they do differently
and what made it so difficult to check him after halftime?  
KYLE GUY: He was, you know, a tough player to guard. He's very shifty and
could hit tough shots. And the first half, honestly he wasn't being all that
aggressive. You know, Devon was playing pretty good defense but other guys
were hitting shots so didn't need to do much. The second half he got it going,
and, you know, Coach said when you let a team hang around for awhile, they get
a lot of confidence and he definitely had that.  
  
Q. Ty, were you aware that a 16 had never won before and did you just
kind of dismiss that ahead of time?  
TY JEROME: I think everyone is aware of that. Thanks for bringing that up
again. But, you know, I was aware of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Last question for student-athletes.  
  
Q. What kind of life lessons does this teach both of you?  
TY JEROME: I mean, if you're worried about the outside world, Coach Bennett
and the staff told us earlier in the year that it's a flip of a coin. It's the
same people that will tell you how great you are and praise you, you know,
when you're on top, you feel like you're on top of the world, will the same
people are going to kill you when you're at this point.  
  
But to be honest, I don't think this team has never been worried about you
guys, the media, the outside world. But it just shows you that really anybody
can beat anybody and if you don't come to play you're going to get beat. It's
basketball.  
  
KYLE GUY: You know, it's all a blur right now. It's really hard to answer
these questions as you guys know. And one thing this team is really good at
and built on is resiliency. I think bouncing back from something that's so
heartbreaking will be a huge key for us. I just, you know, just feel so bad
for Isaiah and Devon and Nigel because it's not how we wanted to send them
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. You can head back to the locker room. We
appreciate you being here. Congratulations on a great year. Questions for
Coach Bennett.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's got to be difficult for you to tell these guys
really anything to sort of comfort them now, but in the locker room post game,
what do you try and tell them?  
TONY BENNETT: There's not a whole lot you can say right now. We talked about a
few things, but, you know, heads are down. And again that's the reality of it.
You can say all the soothing things or whatever and time will heal. And I did
share with them what I started my opening statement with, that's life. This is
not the end of the world, okay? This is not -- there's a lot of worse things
that can happen. It's the first time it happened, but this is a possibility.
We knew that.  
  
Again, we had a remarkable year, but we also knew our margin for error wasn't
huge and they just played. They were so good. I was so sad that now we're done
with this group because they did everything I asked. And when we weren't quite
right, we couldn't keep them out of the paint. And you ask that question
whoever did about Lyles coming off the ball screen, 33 or 13 are both 4 men
who can really shoot. So I think at times we were worried about we got to get
back to the shooter and didn't stop the ball. They had us in no man's land.
They put pressure on us in ways they did.  
  
But back to the deal. There's not much you can say. I think they're strong
character guys and have to bounce back. Like he said, resiliency has been
their strength. Now it will be tested in a way I don't think they thought it
would be tested.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier in the week that you've seen Lyles at your
camp. Son of UVA alumni, what did you remember?  
TONY BENNETT: Not much. I mean, he's really great. He went to VCU, obviously.
I think he came back for his fifth year. I wish he wouldn't have done that
now. But really good. One heck of a senior year or fifth year and dangerous.
You saw the shot he hit to get them into the NCAA Tournament and again the way
they play with the 4 guards and the spread and the quickness and that's --
their point guard did a heck of a job.  
  
K.J., he was so quick and he managed the game. They really defended. So that
quickness with a 4 separate ball screen has always been an issue if you can't
switch it. And they put us in a tough spot and we didn't do a great job with
it.  
  
Q. You alluded to it earlier about them being uniquely gifted with the
4-guard system. Is there another team that you've seen in the last two years
that kind of reminds you of them? They're very --  
TONY BENNETT: We've at times had a little trouble with 4 perimeter teams, 4
guard teams. And this is not an excuse, but without De'Andre, I thought we had
enough with what we had, but that allowed us to sometimes switch and he could
-- his versatility helped us. When we didn't have that, we were always a
little nervous. I think again their quickness -- their size is small and we
couldn't -- couple times we couldn't take enough advantage of that. They did a
great job blocking out, but again they put a lot of pressure on you with that
and they run their offense. That's why I wanted to give credit to Ryan. They
run their offense so fast. That ball just pop, pop, pop and they do the
dribble handoffs, keeping it and moving it. If you're not really disciplined
and really sound -- and we worked as hard as we could preparing for it, but
it's like you can't mimic that until you go against it.  
  
We lost our way. I think it was a good point, tried to get it back in one shot
and got out of character. And I'm sure I'll look at the tape and I probably
made a lot of poor adjustments and that's part of it. I'll grow from it as a
coach, but our young men tried. They battled. It wasn't a lack of effort, but
it was a hard team for us once they got ahead of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Bennett?  
  
Q. Tony, in the steps you've taken to build this program, how will you
view this season given that, as you said, you guys achieved a lot getting to
number 1 but to have it end this way?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah. That's a good question. I don't know. Remarkable 31 wins.
I think this team maxed out as much as any team that I've had. We were so
healthy and so good up until this last game, so we needed all hands on deck.
You'll remember this. It will sting. Maybe a 1 seed will get beat again, maybe
not. Maybe we'll be the only No. 1 seed to ever lose. It's life. It goes on.
We'll have to get past that. For some reason this is what we've got to deal
with, and my job now will be to say hey, how do we bounce back, our players
and all that. But a life lesson is sitting there about defining yourself by
maybe not what the world says, but there's other things that matter and then
you get back to it.  
  
Phenomenal year. Can't take away an ACC Championship, can't take away the most
wins, can't take away an ACC Conference Tournament, and can't take away so far
being the first 1 seed to get beat and lose.  
  
I grew up, played at Wisconsin-Green Bay, the hyphenated schools. I know how
good they are. Said it yesterday, good basketball knows no divisions or limits
or qualities. And they played. All that matters is who plays the best. They
earned their right to play in this tournament. They earned their right to move
on. It's who played the best for 40 minutes, and they absolutely did. Won't
take away from some of the things, but it certainly stings. You know, I'll --
ask me that maybe next year or another time. We'll see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
TONY BENNETT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Casey Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35041)

### [Garrison Mathews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35039)

### [Kenny Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35037)

### [Rob Marberry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35038)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 84  
  
Lipscomb - 66  
  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Congratulations to Carolina. Everybody knows it takes a
magical performance from somebody like us to beat somebody like them and we
didn't get that, and so we were fighting uphill all afternoon it felt like.
So, I thought our guys really competed and continued to play all 40 minutes.
Just couldn't get enough balls to drop. Couldn't create enough of our own
momentum to really give us a chance. Tip our hat and we'll go home and start
over.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rob, Kenny, and Garrison.  
  
Q. Kenny can answer this question. To have such a historical moment for
the school, what is it like for you to be part of this history?  
KENNY COOPER: It's an honor just to be a part of this Lipscomb basketball team
and where the program has come. So, to make our first tournament appearance,
being a part of that is -- just exceeds expectations that we have and so we
plan on being back, that's for sure. We're going to work our tails off this
upcoming off-season to get back, and hopefully this is just a start and we can
build on to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Rob, you want the answer that as well.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: It's a great accolade to have for this team, for Lipscomb, and
the community around us. We played our butts off all season, and we've made
history throughout the whole season. Beating Belmont twice was a big accolade
for us, having the 21 season again, back to back, that's a record for us.
Making it to the tournament, winning the conference. We had so many great
things happening. This one loss doesn't determine, doesn't make our season. We
had so many wins, so many great accolades throughout the whole season. We're
going to hold our heads high and just --  
  
Q. Casey, you got the bulk of this team coming back so you don't have to
worry about recruiting yet, but when you get around to worrying about
recruiting --  
THE MODERATOR: Just for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Garrison, can you talk about the players coming back, what kind of
team you have guys coming back?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: We're going to have a great team next year. Obviously we're
going to miss the guys that are leaving. They've been a huge part of this
program and getting us here. First senior class to get us here, so we're going
to miss them a ton. But I love these guys right here and the guys we have
coming back. It's going to be huge for us next year. We've got a lot of
experience. So it's going to be good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Rob, Kenny or Garrison?  
  
Q. Rob, how do you enjoy the moment of going with this team for the
first time without losing focus on getting ready for this game or --  
ROB MARBERRY: We enjoyed it just as a team throughout the whole season, too.
We knew we had one objective and that's make the dance. So I mean everybody
loved each other, everybody did it for each other. So, that's how you enjoy
it. I mean knowing all the hard work is paying off, you know, going 3-0 in our
tournament, having ten good practices before this game. We did it or each
other and the coaching staff, all the administration behind us. We had fun
with it throughout the whole process. We also knew we had to come out here and
play our butts off.  
  
Q. Garrison, North Carolina talked about how you were a focal point
coming into this game, kind of slowing you down. They mentioned your 39-point
game against Florida Gulf Coast. Can you talk about how they disrupted your
game offensively today?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It was for sure tough to get shots off there, hard close-
outs and had some good guys down low, they were interfering with my layups and
stuff. It was tough. They played great. Defensively Pinson and Williams, they
played great. It was tough to get shots off for sure. It was unacceptable the
way I played. I take full responsibility and will work hard this off-season
for next year.  
  
Q. Kenny, talk about that stretch late in the first half, you guys were
leading 33-31. How did it feel during that stretch and then what do you think
happened during their 10-1 run?  
KENNY COOPER: I think things were flowing for us. We were making shots. Not
quite get as many shots as I would have liked, but they were scoring. But we
were kind of trading baskets for awhile, and then shots stopped falling for us
for a little bit and they went on a little run because they continued to
score. So, again, they're a great team. So, it's hard to slow them down when
you're not scoring and they're so good in transition. That's one of the things
that kind of let them extend the lead a little bit.  
  
Q. Rob, what did you make of the big Lipscomb contingency that made the
trip to Charlotte and all the other thousands that tuned in on CBS?  
ROB MARBERRY: We loved it. Pretty much the City of Nashville behind us right
there showing out. To see those guys and the fans, see them in the hotel
cheering for us, it's an incredible feeling. Next season we're going to build
off that, and if we have one more fan in the stand next season, it's a win for
us. So, we were super excited about that when we saw everybody. Means a lot
that we worked so hard throughout the season, and to have those guys show up
and cheer for us, it means a lot to us and to the coaching staff, the families
that are involved with all this, because it looks like we're paying off
finally.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay. Rob, Kenny,
Garrison, you guys can head back to the locker room. Congratulations on a
great year. Questions for Coach Alexander.  
  
Q. What I was going to ask, how will recruiting be different now? How
will this program be different now that it's an NCAA Tournament team?  
CASEY ALEXANDER: That's the job of our staff. We have great short-term
benefits for winning, coming -- you get to come play, you get to experience
it, you create a lot of excitement for yourself. But the residual effect, the
long-term effect, is where our staff has to get to work and capitalize on it
and continue to grow incrementally. We're not going to just all of a sudden be
somebody we haven't been, but we can continue to take the next step and knock
on some doors we haven't knocked on in the past and let that continue to help
our program get better.  
  
Q. I'd like your take on the stretch at the end of the half. Obviously
you had the lead with three minutes left in the half and it didn't seem like
the stage was too big for you, but they just had -- ran away from you during
that stretch.  
CASEY ALEXANDER: We lost a little bit of momentum when Garrison got his second
foul. He didn't play the last probably 6, 7 minutes of the half because he had
been playing pretty well up until that point. And then we had one very
specific possession, I remember, where we had subbed at a free throw. We made
a free throw, and the next possession they come down, we weren't matched up.
Pinson got and 1. That was a real tough break because it was a mistake that we
made that shouldn't have happened. Then it was really just -- they scored five
out of the last seven possessions, I think, and we scored zero out of the last
seven possessions to end the half.  
  
I felt like we lost our poise a little bit offensively, kind of gave into the
momentum offensively and therefore we had the margin that we did. I was
disappointed for sure because I felt like we really competed and had a lot of
really good moments in that first half. To go into the break down 9 was tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, what adjustments did you make to try and hang around as it
started to gradually slip away?  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Nothing significant, honestly. I felt like big picture we
were doing okay. There were some subtle things that, you know, that we work on
all the time, ball screen coverage, you know, the communication problem we had
at that free throw time. Things like that were the things I felt like we
needed to eliminate. I didn't feel like there was just anything that we had to
change significantly. We did make one adjustment in the second half
offensively. We went to a different style of offense where we had a lot more
player movement. Felt that might open some good things for us. Got a couple of
good looks out of it.  
  
Q. Casey, go through and talk about the team you've got coming back. Who
do you lose and talk about who comes back for this team.  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, as Garrison mentioned we lose three seniors that gave a
lot to this program. But for people that are just looking at stats, they
weren't significant contributors. We return all five starters. We return Matt
Rose who was a really good scorer for us off the bench, and we'll earn return
Nathan Moran, a three-year starter for us and thousand point scorer almost
that didn't play a single game this season. And so we do have a really good
group coming back. We're not going to be so talented at all where we could
just show up and win, but between the experience that we have and the quality
of depth that we have, then we should walk into the off-season with some
expectations.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the historical significance for you. We talked
about with the players. What about this moment for you being on the stage and
what it means for this program going forward.  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Yeah, I hope it means we'll be back on this stage going
forward. That's the goal. For me personally, you know, I get the most joy just
out of sharing it with my family and all of the Lipscomb community that
supports us. You know, when somebody gives you a chance to be their coach and
they give you the resources you need and the support that you need, the love
that you need to go do your job, it's awesome to be able to hand something
back over to them and see them experience this moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. All right. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Joel and Theo.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel any less pressure this year?  
THE MODERATOR: Joel.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: I mean that's a hard question. I mean I don't feel any
pressure. You know, this is our last one, and we just want to enjoy it as much
as we can and just do like we did last year and take it one game at a time and
make sure we're focusing on the game that's coming up. We don't want to look
ahead. I know everybody, you know, the question is do we want to make it back
to the Final Four. I mean that's the ultimate goal, but right now we just have
to make sure we're taking it one at a time and just focusing in on that game.  
  
THEO PINSON: I agree with what Joel said. We'll take it one game at a time. I
think my biggest thing is living it up right now, just enjoying the process,
enjoying this, all the practice coming up, all that type of stuff. Staying in
the moment. I think that's the biggest thing for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please address your questions to a specific student-athlete.  
  
Q. This is for both you guys. You've been to a few NCAA Tournament games
before, you've been here before. What are you guys doing to try to help the
freshmen grasp what's getting ready to happen?  
THEO PINSON: I think we're just being ourselves. I mean going around,
laughing, having fun with each other, and taking it as a regular game. We know
it's not a regular game. Everybody understands what's going on, but at the
same time, we want everybody to be relaxed and just know that we need to just
take it one game at a time. I think we're doing a good job of that right now,
just making sure the young guys understand you can't win it all until you win
the first one. We have to take it one game at a time and see what happens.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. I think what helped us out the last couple of years is
just us coming into, you know, doing the interviews and going out to the
court. Every time you see us, we're always laughing and joking around. That's
how you have to be. If you sit around and think about the game too much and
think about if you lose you go home, that kind gets to you a little bit. So
just us -- with our personalities ad; the way this team has been over the last
couple of years of us just going out and just always having fun and laughing
and joking, I think that kind of relaxes everybody and you get your mind off
of, you know, the one game and you go home. It just gives you a chance to
relax and enjoy the moment. I think that's helped us.  
  
Q. Question for Theo. Apologies if it's a bit of an essay question. You
and Mike Buckland from Lipscomb, high school teammates, two State titles,
right?  
THEO PINSON: Yep.  
  
Q. Can you describe for us what the relationship between the two of you
is like, what it was like when were you playing in high school ball, and if
you guys have had any communication since you guys got paired?  
THEO PINSON: Me and Mike are really good friends. In high school he was always
that guy to look up to the older guys. He always listened, he always tried to
learn from us, even though he wasn't as big of a freshman -- I mean as big of
a player as all of us were. We were all highly ranked and stuff like that. He
was always under the radar. But he always worked hard and always wanted to get
better. I haven't talked to him that much since I've been at college because,
I mean, I've been where I am and where he is. We're not the same age or
whatever. But he's a really good dude and I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. This is to either one. Lot of people want to can call this a rebuild
year for you guys. Do you guys feel like that way, or do you feel like you
have a solid identity on who you are going to the tournament?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think this year was kind of a rebuilding year, but I knew we
were going to have our ups and downs with the young players that we have. But
to make it as far as we have and to be at the point where we are now as a
team, I wouldn't have thought we would have been this good.  
  
Like I said, we're having the young players and guys from this team who are
stepping into different roles from last year. You know, it was really only me
and Theo the ones that were returning from the run last year that actually got
a chance to play in the game and got some good minutes. Everybody else, you
know, Luke, Kenny, you know, they weren't playing as much, and so even those
guys are stepping into different roles this year.  
  
So, you know, it's been an up-and-down year, but towards the end, you know,
for some reason we always end up clicking and that's when you want to be
playing your best basketball. And I think that when we went up to the ACC
Tournament, even though we wanted to win, we made some strides and, you know,
showed ourselves that we can be as good as any team in the country. We just
have to put our mind to it.  
  
You know, it is a rebuilding year, but I think we've done a great job of
getting the young guys to buy into the system and the older guys to play a
little bit better, and me and Theo led this team and, like I said, we made
some strides this year.  
  
Q. Both players, how important is it to have a healthy Cameron Johnson
in the lineup for you guys? And as guys who have been through this before
couple of times, does it give you a rush to see an older guy like that going
through this for the first time and kind of discovering all things you already
knew about this tournament?  
THEO PINSON: I think, like I said, with Cam being on the floor, it's another
threat. You have to be aware of him being on the floor because he's such a
good shooter and he can open up the court. And even if he's not moving well,
with him being on the court it opens up driving lanes because you don't want
to help off of him because he will still knock down the shot that's not going
nowhere. That's a big thing for us.  
  
Yeah, I mean, at the same time, I just try to make sure everybody knows just
be in the moment, enjoy the moment. You never know when it's going to be the
-- you don't know if you're going to come back here at all. You want to enjoy
every moment.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Basically what Theo said. Cam is a great shooter, and you know
that's what he does, and if we can have him out on the court, regardless it
opens up the court. We want to be able to drive the ball and get it into the
lane. Even though this year we've taken a lot of 3-pointers, we still want to
get the ball down low, and still get in the paint and get some driving lanes.
So having him out on the court spaces out the court to where you have to
respect him as a shooter. And so we need him to be out on the court, and he's
doing everything he can to get his body right and I'm sure he will play, you
know, with. You know, with him being the older guy, he won't sit out the
tournament. He's pretty excited, you know, coming from a team who didn't make
the tournament, and so I think that he's pretty excited to be in this and we
want him to be able to enjoy it as much as possible. So they're doing
everything in -- our trainers are doing everything in their will to help him
get out there on the court and play.  
  
Q. Both players. Before Sunday, how aware were you of Lipscomb? Did you
even know Lipscomb was a team and what have you learned since then, since
preparation has begun, about them?  
THEO PINSON: I did, of course, because my old teammate went there. But also I
remember we was looking at film on Tennessee and they played Tennessee right
before we did, so we saw a couple clips on them before. I mean that's about
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel?  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. I've heard of the school before, but, you know, I really
didn't get a chance to see them play much. But we've been watching film and
been watching tape. They're a good team. They like to get out and play a fast
pace like we do. I think they average more points per game than we do. So, we
know it's going to be a fast-paced game, which we like. We got to make sure
that they're not playing it better than us.  
  
Q. Theo, you're such a catalyst for this team. When you look back at the
Virginia Championship game, what went wrong in that game and what do you think
your role in this tournament should be for this team?  
THEO PINSON: Well, me going 1 for 10 wasn't good at all. Also, just -- they
made big-time plays, big-time shots at the end of the game. Kyle made some
big-time shots. Those are the ones that you just got to tip your hat to them.
Those are huge. We were right there, we made a couple plays at the end and
made a turnover that tried to throw to Garrison that was terrible, speaking
personally.  
  
Other than that, I mean in the tournament just be Theo. Do what I've been
doing pretty much the whole season. Get my teammates the ball, staying
aggressive and doing it on defensive end also. Just doing whatever it takes to
win games is the biggest thing for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Time for two more questions. Anybody else?  
  
Q. Are you guys doing anything differently going into the tournament
this year to try to avoid any complacency or anything like that?  
THEO PINSON: We just lost so it's not really any complacency as all. That adds
a little more fire to us. Just the fact -- we went four days in a row of
playing quality teams and had a chance to get a championships and we fell
short. So, if that doesn't get everybody motivated I don't know what will. And
it's the NCAA Tournament. We've been here before. We're excited and we want to
go out on top.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Middle of the room.  
  
Q. After being in the ACC wars for the last two months, how does it feel
to get a chance to play some different teams for now?  
JOEL BERRY II: That's what Coach was stressing in practice today and practice
the other day before we left, is that now we're getting a chance to play
against different teams who necessarily don't know our offense as much as a
conference team would. We have to make sure that we're going out there,
executing what we're doing and what we want to do. You know, it's hard in the
conference when every team knows exactly what you're about to run and know,
you know, every single play that you have, and now you're going against teams
who don't know us.  
  
We have to make sure we're executing and doing -- running the plays that we
want to run because they're going to work and eventually the teams catch on to
it in the game. But right now, you know, we're going against teams who don't
know us as well, so that's a great thing, being able to go against another
team from another conference that, you know, we don't know each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. This is a question for both guys. Can you describe in what ways you
feel like this game against number 15, Lipscomb, feels dangerous?  
THEO PINSON: I think anybody can be beat. I think we saw last year, I think it
was Middle Tennessee State beat Michigan State or something like that. I mean,
it can happen. But, at the same time, we're focused. We know they can score
the ball. They scored 106 points in their championships game. I mean, I don't
know if we hit that this year or not. They can score the ball, great shooters
and so we're mentally prepared and we'll be ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. I mean we're coming into the tournament. We want just do
what we have to do regardless of what team it is. I mean, we can't look down
on any team. They call it March Madness for a reason. Anything can happen. All
it takes is for one team to play great that day, and I mean that's all it
takes and the next thing you know, you're going home.  
  
We have to make sure regardless of who it is, 1, 16, you just got to come out
and play basketball. If you're a competitor you don't worry about the runs,
just go out there and do what you do on as a basketball player and compete on
every single play. I know personally I will do it that and I'll do my best to
try to help my teammates to understand that if we want to be the best that we
want to be, regardless of what seed they are, we just got to be out and got to
play Carolina basketball and do what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks guys.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Opening statement would be see that Tiger Woods just birdied a
hole. He's the sole leader now at 4 under par through 16 holes. That's all I
got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions about that or anything else?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: He doubled bogied a hole, two. He's 4 under with a double bogey.  
  
Q. We've been over the Luke story before, but I feel like there is this
misconception that he was sleeping on the sidewalk outside your office begging
for a roster spot when really he was pursued by a number of different teams in
your league. And what did you have to say to him to turn down those
scholarship offers from other schools? I know eventually he's always been on
scholarship, but when were you recruiting him, that wasn't the case.  
ROY WILLIAMS: You're exactly right, Joe. A funny story. I go see him play in
the spring of his junior year, I think it was, and at an event in Myrtle
Beach. And I was there, head coach at North Carolina State was there, the head
coach at Clemson was there, the head coach at Virginia was there, the head
coach of Notre Dame day was there, the head coach at Davidson was there. It
was perhaps the worst basketball game I've ever seen in my life. And Luke fit
right in, but everybody had seen him before that time as well, but no, he
could have gone anyplace he wanted to go, really. I mean Notre Dame offered,
Clemson offered, Virginia I think had offered. He could have gone anywhere.  
  
What I had to do is just convince him that you're going to be treated just
like a scholarship guy. You'll never have anything different. If the
scholarship guys run ten sprints, you'll run it. If they get filet mignon,
you'll get if filet mignon. The only thing, because we don't have a
scholarship, your first year mom and dad are going to have to pay the bills.  
  
I want you here. I think you fit in here. I think you're going to be
successful here. You're going to surprise people here. I really did believe
that. He had been to our camp two years or maybe three, and so I felt that
strongly that he would be successful and both mom and dad being North Carolina
parents and graduating from our place was pretty good, too.  
  
Q. Roy, do you have an update on Cameron Johnson's health? And how
important is it to what you do to have him out there and functioning, you
know, close to a hundred percent?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think at this time of the year, you need everybody that's been
important to you all year to function at a high level. You need those guys
coming off the bench to be able to do and step up their play a little bit
more. Cam practiced this morning. We've already had practice. He got through
it, didn't seem to have any problems. Unless he's laying back in there on the
floor that I don't know about it, I would feel that he would be fine.  
  
He adds another shooter from the outside. He's a good basketball player. He
can make plays, too. He's got to get better defensively and all those kind of
things. But no, he's important to us and I expect him to be full go.  
  
Q. Quick question. How are you soaking up these last moments with
Theo?  
ROY WILLIAMS: How am I soaking up these last moments with Theo, I'm really
sort of counting down when I'll get rid of the rascal (laughter). What are you
thinking? He's a unique young man that I've really, really, really enjoyed. In
some basket ball games, he's dominated the game without being a great scorer.
He's one of the best leaders in practices, one of the best talkers I've ever
seen on the court, when it's very appropriate to talk. He talks a lot of other
times, sometimes when it's not appropriate, I guess. But no, he's a unique
individual. He really is. I'll miss the sucker so I hope we get to play a few
more weeks.  
  
Q. Aaron Rohlman is a guy you took a chance on last year. He's now a
senior, chance to go 2 for 2 in this event. What does it that mean to you?  
ROY WILLIAMS: If he can pull that off, he'll be one of the greatest players in
North Carolina history. I don't think there's anybody that's been there two
years and won two. Aaron is a fantastic kid. I don't know what's wrong with my
throat. But a fantastic kid, been a great addition to our team. Everybody else
on the team just adopted him immediately. He takes kidding very well because
they kid him, I kid him, but he's been a pleasure to coach as well. Great
young man. He's going to be very successful some day. He'll be my boss one
day.  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen from Lipscomb? Is there anything -- what's
the one thing that sticks out at you that they could possibly give you trouble
with?  
ROY WILLIAMS: There's a lot of things that stick out that could give us
problems. But their ability to shoot the ball, ability to score, the pace they
play. One thing that really jumps out at me is Mathews has shot, I think -- I
don't have the stats up here in front me -- I think he shot 130 or 140 more
free throws than anybody on our team. I mean, that's remarkable. Tiger may
have made another birdie. My phone is buzzing.  
  
But it is something, they do a great job of getting to the free throw line.
That means the team they're playing is in foul trouble a lot. So we got to
play defense without fouling. We always go up and down every practice so we're
used to running, but this is a team that's going to run back at us. Yesterday
in practice we had two different occasions where we didn't get good defensive
balance and the blue team lays it up. That's what we're going to face
tomorrow. We can't give up -- they have scorers who are expected to score and
come through for them every time. They have rebounders, defenders, guys who
set screens. Casey has done a nice job. It's a very well-coached team. The
thing that jumps out at me is how many times -- because everybody talks about
a shooter. He can really shoot the ball, but my gosh, he's not just a shooter,
they don't foul too many of those 3s.  
  
Q. So just to be clear you get Tiger updates sent to your phone
immediately. Is this going to be a distraction for you, this Tiger comeback
that seems to be enthralling the country?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I was looking around. Taylor Czar (phonetic) was at the Final
Four that -- that was not, somebody wanting tickets (laughter). Why even check
the doggone thing? Taylor Czar said one time at the Final Four, "Where does
Tiger stand today?l" right before I walked in. I'm a huge fan. Michael Jordan
and Tiger Woods to me are the guys that I really have a great deal of respect
for because they were the best and nobody had better focus, nobody had better
work habits and all that. I'm amazed by those kind of guys. Michael -- I'm
pretty close to Michael and I've seen it up close and personal. I met Tiger
one time, I talked to him on the phone. He's surprised me. I never thought he
would get back here. I really didn't. I did not have the faith, but I am a fan
so I enjoy -- what else will I do, sit here and wait for 30 minutes until I
talk to you guys? Come on.  
  
Q. Two?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Two formers players are asking for tickets tomorrow.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think we're getting recognition. It's what we deserve. We
didn't win the regular season or the tournament. We're a pretty doggone good
basketball team. I believe if we play well and do the right things, that we
can play a lot and so that's probably the way people are treating us. I heard
Jay and Seth, and I forget who else it was, nobody picked us to go to the
Final Four. Michael Wilbon did. I'm not saying he's a lot smarter than the
rest of those guys. What we try to do really is just enjoy the experience. I
want our guys to enjoy this today. Then I want them to play their tail off and
enjoy the locker room tomorrow. And if we play well enough, perhaps somebody
will let us stay around and play again. And that's the reason we do all the
stuff on putting in how many teams are left. I know it's a thing you guys
don't like to hear, but we really do take it one game at a time. Somebody
let's us play again, that's great.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked your players this question, I'm ask you, too. Your
thoughts, you've been playing ACC teams the last two months. Getting to play
somebody different for a change?  
ROY WILLIAMS: We talked about it with the team, that there may be some things
we'll do in the game tomorrow they may not recognize before we do it. Once you
get in the league and playing people 18 times and things like we do in your
own TV every game, if we call "box right," the coaches on the other staff they
yell "box right." So, perhaps we might get something that they're not familiar
with and the same thing. We showed our team clips yesterday on Lipscomb the
first time. I started watching tape -- I can't even remember -- I guess Monday
night, but throughout the course of the year you're playing people, you watch
tape, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 weeks, see them play 8, 10 times. We've been in some
tough, tough first round games. I mean I've been in some really tough ones.
Kansas one time we were the No. 1 seed and Holy Cross had us beat, we're down
9 with five minutes to play. Kirk Hinrich hurt his ankle. He's sitting on the
end of the bench with a ice wrap. Two years ago Florida Gulf Coast. A really
good basketball game. We probably blew them out by 5 or 6. I can't remember,
but it was something like that.  
  
So, we do try to realize that we've got a target on our back. And that's okay,
I like that.  
  
Q. Coach, has there been a player maybe behind the sense in practice who
has really made a post-season leap, you know, ever since the regular season
ended in practice or whatnot?  
ROY WILLIAMS: If you were to ask each one of them, they probably say it was
them. I don't think so. Our guys, those other guys that don't get all the
minutes, they've been pretty steady for us all year long. I think K.J. Smith
has gotten better all along as we go. Aaron Rohlman that we talked about a
minute ago, just does a marvelous job. He can play the 5, the 4, the 3 with
the scout team. I don't see anybody that's jumped out. I know for awhile there
Garrison Brooks, his minutes and production slowed down a little bit. I think
he played better in the ACC Tournament. But other than that, nobody jumps out
at me.  
  
Q. Roy, anybody this year or in recent history that Lipscomb really
reminds you of that you've played against?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, two bad memories, Belmont and Wofford. Belmont beat a
pretty good team in the Smith Center a few years ago and Wofford beat a pretty
good team in there this year. Mathews can shoot the ball. Marberry gives them
another guy up front. Little more balanced than people think I would hope that
they think those are compliments because both those teams beat us. That's
exactly who it looks like to me. One of our coaches said it reminds us of
looking at ourselves because they do push the ball, they do share the ball,
shoot from the outside, they do score inside. So -- but I think those two
games.  
  
Q. Someone asked Joel about this being a down year. He said it kind of
was a down year and he didn't expect this team to be where they are now. What
are your thoughts on that? Would you reflect his answer or did you expect your
team to be where they are now?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I expect to win every game, I really do. Start the season, first
meeting I told them, I'm standing here looking at guys that are good enough to
win the whole blessed thing. You got to play. You got to buy in. You got to
wish -- we saw tape on Virginia, not just from the game but this is the way we
want to play, I think that should be very flattering to Tony and his team.
2005, middle of the season I brought in tape of Illinois to show our team how
unselfish Illinois were. They were the number 1 team in the country that time.
They were playing better than anybody. We ended up playing them. We beat them.
I don't really try to figure out where we can be and be up or down myself. I
just think let's practice every day, work every day, try to be better every
day. And that sounds corny as all get out, but that's exactly what we do.
Today I said let's get better, let's get better.  
  
Coach Wooden told me one time that at the start of the season he would get his
schedule and mark down which games he thought they would win and which games
he thought may lose. And put it in an envelope and put it in his desk and
wouldn't get it out until the season is over. He would get it out. Coach, I
can't do that. I can't even remember who we played the second game. That is
true. But I said, "Coach I'm sure you're pretty close all the time to what you
expect."  
  
For Joel to say that, he was looking at Justin was gone, Kennedy was gone,
Isaiah was gone, Nate Britt was gone, who is going to take those guy's places.
I'm sure there were doubts, but I really don't try to look down the road to
figure out what what we would be.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Dean Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30501)

### [Barry Brown Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34873)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome juniors from left to right, Barry Brown, junior and
Dean Wade, student-athletes from Kansas State. We'll have about 15 minutes.
Ask you to raise your hand, let us get the handheld mike do you. Let us know
who you are, who you're with, and please direct your question to the specific
student-athlete.  
  
Q. Dean, I'm sure you didn't expect this question today, but how are you
doing physically with your foot?  
DEAN WADE: I'm doing good. Gets better everyday. So, it's doing better.  
  
Q. Are you expected to play?  
DEAN WADE: Just a game-time decision.  
  
Q. You shut down some pretty good scorers. What are your plans, if
you're the one guarding Marcus Foster, what do you plan to do with him?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We have a good team defense and we have a particular way
we're going to try and guard him and contain him and not let him and some of
the other scorers get loose. It's going to be my responsibility, but I mean my
teammates going to have my back and I'm going to have theirs.  
  
Q. Barry, you look a lot better than the last time we saw you. How is
the eye? What went through your head as were you laying on the Sprint Center
floor?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: My eye is pretty good. Maybe 98 percent., I guess. It's
doing good right now. I can see pretty much a hundred percent almost. I mean
-- but when it happened, I was just kind of in shock. It was just scary to see
a lot of blood in my eye and I really wanted to get back there on the floor to
help my teammates out. Ultimately I couldn't, so I just tried to cheer from
the bench.  
  
Q. Dean, you said it's a game-time decision, but the fact it's lose-and-
go-home-type situation, how likely are you to play?  
DEAN WADE: Depends how I feel. I would love to be to be out there. This is
what you dream of as a little kid, being in March Madness, everything like
that. I'm itching to get out there. We'll see what happens. If I can't, I'm
going to be the best cheerleader we got, not -- our actual cheerleaders are
pretty good. I'll be on the bench and I'll be cheering them on.  
  
Q. Dean, not playing in Kansas City in the play, talked about how Mark
played and how important it was to see him step up into that kind of role?  
DEAN WADE: He played amazing. Ton of energy on the floor. Was very focused,
very motivated. He played physically but he was also under control the whole
time. Just a technician down there. They couldn't stop him. Him playing that
well boosts his confidence a ton, and just seeing him fight like that I think
gives our team a little more confidence in him. And, you know, they thought
hard. That was the best fight I've seen out of him this year, and we're going
to need that in the tournament so hopefully we keep that rolling.  
  
Q. Barry, you've played and defended a lot of really good guards in the
Big 12. Are there any that you think are somewhat similar to what you'll face
in the game tomorrow night?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I can't even think about that now. I'm sure it is. He's a
scorer. Kind of a lead scorer, 20 points a game for his team. And so I've been
watching him a lot these past few days since we found out who we're playing. I
kind of know what he wants to pick his shots at and where he likes to get his
shots off now. I'm going to do my best on him.  
  
Q. For either one of you. The chances we'll see the two-one throw backs
tomorrow night?  
DEAN WADE: I wish.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I wish. I don't know. I don't think the NCAA allows it in
March Madness. So, I mean, I wish they did but I don't think it's going to
happen.  
  
Q. Dean, of all the things you've accomplished this year, in particular
inference play, I'm just curious where you feel like your game has grown the
most over the course of this conference season?  
DEAN WADE: You know, I've grown as a player. I think most of that has to do
with my maturity mentally and just how I approach the game. You know, every
game is a do-or-die situation in the Big 12. That's how I thought about it,
and I just wanted to be aggressive a little more consistent than I was the
past couple years and I think that had a lot to do with my teammates just
keeping me going, keeping me -- keeping my confidence up when I was down. And
I think it's just a combination of a lot of hard work in the off-season that's
paying off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Both of you, how important is it for this program to get this win, to
get through the round of 64 and kind of get that monkey off the program's
back?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It's very important for us. We are really trying to not only
get into the tournament, which is one of our goals as a team, but win some
games in the tournament. And so to get this first win will mean a lot for our
program and fans, our coaches and even us as players. We made it here last
year. Unfortunately we got knocked off in the first round. Hopefully we're
ready and little more mature to handle this first round.  
  
DEAN WADE: I mean it would be huge for us, just shows like we're picked low in
the Big 12, it would be big come out and prove some people wrong and so it
would be big for our program.  
  
Q. I know you're not sure on your status yet. Assuming perhaps did you
play tomorrow, would you have any concern about conditioning, your rhythm with
the team being away from practice for a little bit?  
DEAN WADE: Yeah, I'd be pretty concerned with it. I just focus on defense. I
haven't really been out there with them guys practicing, keeping the condition
up, but I just focus on defense and doing what I can do which is defense,
playing hard, and rebounding.  
  
Q. This question is for both of you because it's about both of you. You
two seem to have grown really close as the season gone on, not that you
weren't close before, but there seems to be a real bond, something about being
the two guys that has really clicked with you guys. Am I accurate in that, or
do you really hate each other when you walk away from the podium?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I think we've grown a little bit closer, just trying to
rally our guys together early in the season, trying to boost our stock in the
Big 12 and ultimately in the seeding for the tournament. We kind of just try
to take the team under our wing and be the best players we can be on and off
the court, be vocal leaders and lead on and off court, in the weight room,
class, all kind of stuff. And I think that kind of jelled us together, brought
us together a little bit. I think teammates are kind of following our lead.  
  
DEAN WADE: Just off what Barry said, we're the older guys, we have a lot of
new guys, young guys haven't really been through the fire, I guess you could
say. Kind of took it under ourselves to take them under our wing and just
really show them through the ways and, you know, how to keep stay focused
through the Big 12 season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll see you tomorrow
night.  
  
We welcome Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you just update us on Dean Wade's, how he's doing?  
BRUCE WEBER: We had him in the boot basically all week. You know, during
practice he would do treatment and some running in the pool, some different
things, and today is probably the first day let him do a little bit. We were
in another gym, just let him get some shooting and moving around. We'll let
him shoot this afternoon and just see how he feels. Probably be a game-time
decision tomorrow with him. Barry is fine, Barry -- he was back in practice on
Monday. I don't think he had total a hundred percent vision on Monday,
Tuesday, but he's back to normal right now, no problem with him at all.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what was your first reaction when you saw this draw kind
of come out and obviously Marcus and also Nigel Johnson of Virginia?  
BRUCE WEBER: Kind of laughed about it. You know, to me the most important
thing, we got in the tournament. My second wish was maybe for Dean's sake to
play Friday and get to play Friday night and get a little bit of rest. Marcus
is a very good player, good offensive player. Proud that we -- our staff found
him, helped with the development. Obviously he had some -- I don't know if you
call it setbacks or whatever, some different situations came up and he's done
a great job for Creighton and Coach Mac. And then Nigel obviously had some
different things with him but we can't worry about that. All we're worried
about is playing Creighton and seeing if we can stop them and one of the key
players will be obviously Marcus as their leading scorer.  
  
Q. Coach, with all the attention on Marcus, not just off the floor but
on it, does a guy like Khyri Thomas seem like someone who might not be getting
enough attention this week.  
BRUCE WEBER: I said the first day after we got the Selection Sunday night when
we had the little media get together that Marcus is very good at scoring but
Thomas overall all around he might be a better player. I don't think there's
any -- he does so much for them. He's a lock-down defender, he's strong, he
can post up. He plays a little bit of point, little bit of 3, 2, for them.
He's shooting the 3 ball well. Just he's a good compliment to Marcus and their
team. He's a good player. There's no doubt about it. You look at the potential
draft boards and pops up on there so he must be very good if he's there.  
  
Q. Does it make preparation more challenging not knowing if Dean is
going to play or not, I mean as far as putting in sets and how you're going to
play, not being aware whether or not you're going to have him?  
BRUCE WEBER: All we can -- we kind of prepared without him. We did stuff
without him, and I guess it helps because they've been playing small ball for
the most part. So kind of when we played Kansas, when -- welcome to 6'5" and
under. It's similar to -- give us -- if they were big now, we might have a
little bit of an issue, but it's going to be tough no matter what. But we've
been dealing with it. Obviously if Dean is there, it gives us a little bit of
a big guy that can score inside with Mac. Hopefully that will give us an
advantage.  
  
Q. Bruce, just if you could sort of give some insight into how the
decision is going to be made with Wade. Is this going to mostly be about how
he feels working out on it, or is it possible there's a component of this
decision that's going to be you throttling back his enthusiasm and in his own
best interest?  
BRUCE WEBER: The most important thing is his best interest for his future.
Obviously he's one of the better players. He's got not only a future with
K-State but hopefully in the NBA and we can't let that -- we don't want to
harm him where something would happen he couldn't play in the future. So,
we're relying on our team doctors and trainer. Dean wants to play. He wanted
to play against Kansas on Friday night, and we just said for your future and
to have a chance to play this week, we needed to sit him and rest him. And
we'll just -- we'll see how he feels and then, you know, talking to the
doctors and the trainers, we'll make the final decision.  
  
Q. Based on the information that you already have, are you predisposed
to leaning one way or another?  
BRUCE WEBER: We've gone without him all week so we're prepared that way. If he
plays, obviously you got one of the best players in the Big 12, one of the
better power forwards in the country. It would be a nice addition to us. We've
got to see what happens and can't always plan. I didn't plan to have Barry
Brown only one minute the other night either. You expect the unexpected. You
just got to play.  
  
Q. Coach, sticking with Dean, you've been at this a long time. When you
watch Dean Wade play, he's not a highlight reel. He's kind of the opposite.
He's fundamentally sound, almost a coach's dream to work with?  
BRUCE WEBER: Yeah. There's no doubt. And his improvement from -- you guys have
seen it that cover us from day one, from high school, the guy -- if you saw
him in high school, his confidence, his strength, he's really intelligent as a
player, he's so versatile and he does stuff on both ends of the court. He's
one of the better defenders for big guys. He knows ball screen schemes. He's
probably one of the best passers for a big guy. We almost kind of joke, if he
was at maybe some other place besides Manhattan, Kansas he would be getting a
lot more attention nationally. I think that will come in the future. I know as
the season went on, a lot of NBA calls, lot of agent calls, all that so he's
got a future and it's been fun to coach him, watch his development. And the
best thing about him his character. He wants to win. He's so humble and it is,
as you said kind of a dream come true for a coach .  
  
Q. At some point you're going to have a conversation with Marcus, if not
before the handshake after the game. Do you have any idea what you might say
to him?  
BRUCE WEBER: I'm just happy for him. If he's successful and he's doing things
the right way, that's great. And if I'm part of that, that's even better. I
said it over and over, you know, it's my job to help them, help them. There's
more than just basketball. There's school, basketball, and there's also life
and doing things right. And, you know, if he's making progress in all those
things and I had something to do with it, that's great.  
  
Q. Bruce, I'm just wondering how big are you a proponent if Wade is only
shooting for the first time this week? Maybe he's been in film sessions and
understands the game plan, he hasn't been out there executing and practicing
it. Does that have anything to do with your decision at all he hasn't had --  
BRUCE WEBER: Not really. We played all year. If this was week two or
something, I'd be a little bit hesitant on it. And what we just talked about.
He's so smart and he knows where everyone should be and that was our biggest
fear against Kansas because he's kind of -- I don't want to call it the
football free safety. He kind of sees it all and he's there in the right spots
and covering up for when guys make mistakes. So that part I wouldn't have --
getting his rhythm, his explosion, and it's like Kam was out three, four
weeks. When you're out that long and don't play basketball, it takes a little
bit of time. But obviously he gives you a big body, smarts, he does so many
things for us. He still can help us. I really believe that.  
  
Q. Coach, addressing nobody in particular, you had to hit the reset year
three after things happened, you lost seven underclassmen under that group.
When you went back to do the rebuild, how much did character play into when
you looked at guys like Dean and Barry because they're high character guys
that are accountable and hold themselves accountable?  
BRUCE WEBER: It was very important. That and we talked a lot about getting
guys that have won. If you look at Barry Brown, he took his team to the Final
Four. Dean Wade won a bunch of State Championships. Kamau won State
Championships, City Championships. Levi won State Championships. You get guys
that care about winning. It's important. Talent is one thing and it's great
and you need talent, but if you can find guys that care and they want to do
things the right way and give you great leadership, it's probably the best
thing about our team is the leadership. It's made it so much easier. It
definitely helps and it's something that we did address as a staff.  
  
Q. Bruce, you told us Sunday when you had the conversation with Kam when
he was -- when you had been shooting free throws, told him to relax. Has he
responded the way you would like to at this point?  
BRUCE WEBER: The nice thing we actually had practice this week. He hasn't had
practice. You know, when he came back during the middle of the games, you
maybe had one practice a week, you got preparation, you got a game, and then
you got the day after where you're just kind of going through things and
shooting. So we had really three good days of practice. I thought he did well.  
  
Q. You know, I told him to focus on all the little things that can help
our team, whether it's getting us into the offense, guarding, you know, if he
makes an open shot, that's fine. But, you know, think about it, last year the
st game of the NCAA he had 24 against Wade. He's got experience. He's been
through it. Hopefully all that will add up and he'll have -- it would be nice
for him to see a smile on his face and help us get -- be successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Thank you.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from UMBC. Senior Jourdan
Grant, senior Jairus Lyles, senior K.J. Maura, and junior Joe Sherburne.  
  
Q. Jairus, I believe you started your career at VCU. Could you talk
about your time there and what happened, the moves you made to eventually get
to UMBC?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I played under a great coaching staff, Shaka Smart. I learned a
lot from them. Lot of pros on that team that are currently in e NBA right now,
one that plays on this team, Charlotte Hornets, Treveon Graham. I learned a
lot. A great experience for me. It didn't work out unfortunately and that led
me to Robert Morris where I stayed for a semester then I transferred to UMBC.  
  
Q. Jairus, you know, Virginia has done a really good job this season of
just keying in on a team's best scorers, especially when the offense is keyed
around one player. When you've watched tape this season -- or of their games
this season, how do you feel like they've kind of defended teams' best scorers
and how do you kind of plan to maybe get around that?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Got a great overall defense, number one defense if the country
for a reason. I fully expect them to try to take me out of the game. I got to
get my teammates involved and do a great job of moving the ball and making
them chase us.  
  
Q. Jairus, you were there under the previous coach and then when Coach
Odom in at UMBC, how quickly did you realize that things may change under his
regime?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Immediately. He came in a with different mindset than our last
coaches had. We immediately clicked as a team. What he wanted us to do we
bought in immediately. So last year we learned a lot, lot of growing pains,
but we eventually came together. So I think this year kind of like a testament
to what him and his staff brought.  
  
Q. Jairus, were you surprised as you brought the ball up court for the
last possession against Vermont that Coach Odom call timeout and when he
didn't, did that give you confidence to know that he believed in you guys to
execute it properly?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I wasn't surprised. I know how he trusts us as a team. We trust
him as a coach. He knew that we would make the right play ultimately and
that's what happened. We weren't really surprised. But yeah, just shows the
trust we have in each other as the team and coaching staff.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I'm curious, you guys made a tremendous
strides defensively this season improving. What is it that has made your
defense better this season?  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think right in the summer before this season that was our
first focus. Last summer, their first time here, our coaches, the first thing
we did all summer was work on our offensive fast break and plays. But this
summer all we did was focus mainly on defense with some drills that just is
basic as sliding and keeping your hands in the right position. Right from the
bat this year they really set that tone.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Their point of emphasis was to play great defense and pressure the
ball so we can get out and run and make our transition offense better. He
talked to me a lot this summer about pressuring the ball full court no matter
how quick is the guard so I can make him uncomfortable.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: One of the biggest emphasis was just like Joe said, sliding and
guarding without our hands, not putting our hands on guys and guarding them
with the chest and keeping ourselves in front of the ball, keeping us in
between the ball and the basket.  
  
Q. This can go to any player on the panel up there, I don't know if
y'all are familiar, but there is a statistic out there that measures luck of a
particular basketball. Basically it just kind of measures like how lucky you
are to win a close game based on your winning percentage. I was just wondering
if I could first off get your initial thoughts on there being a number that
calls you guys like the luckiest team in the country or also talk about how
your tournament journey has been, I guess, a little bit more than just about
luck.  
THE MODERATOR: Jairus.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: We don't think anything we've done this year has been luck. We
put in the work since the coaching staff got here last year. The testament to
our hard work. We had a great season last year coming from 7 wins two years
ago, going to 21 and 24, 67, 89 working for our 25th win. We have a tough task
on Friday and we have to go out and compete.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jourdan, want to take a crack at that?  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: We've worked for everything we've earned. It's a tough task on
Friday and ready to attack it.  
  
Q. Jairus, it's been made about how you're a grad transfer this year and
had an opportunity to go play someplace else. When you hit that shot against
Vermont, did you think in this moment or even in the moments after, you made
the right choice if for nothing else because you sent the team to the
tournament with that type of play?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I knew I made the right choice as soon as I made the choice. It
was never really a choice with me. I knew I was going to stay all along. It
just shows you that that's why I came back. I didn't came back to win the
championship and we did that. I'm grateful for it.  
  
Q. I know that there's been a lot of talk about the shot and obviously
it's gotten a lot of replays and everything. Have you guys sort of moved past
it or something you're still thinking about and using as sort of motivation or
anything else?  
JAIRUS LYLES: We definitely moved past it. Of course it will go down in
history and we'll relive that moment forever, but we definitely moved past it
because we know we got to play Virginia on Friday, not Vermont. It's Virginia.
We got to prepare and focus up on that game.  
  
Q. Jairus, Coach Bennett mentioned the other day he had seen you at
their camp. Was that a team camp? What do you remember about it, and did it
show you much about their program?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I don't even remember. That was probably so long ago. It's funny
because my mom and dad attended Virginia, so I'm kind of familiar with the
campus but not that familiar.  
  
Q. Just want to ask you about the challenge of being a 16 seed and then
ask if you watched any of Penn State with Kansas for a little bit earlier
today?  
K.J. MAURA: We felt we could have been a higher seed an 16. We don't feel like
the underdogs. We saw a little bit of the game of Penn and Kansas. They stayed
in the game for a long time. We're here to compete and not afraid of the
challenge. We think it's going to be a good game.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: Coach emphasized they're just numbers, 16, 1, 15, 2. Either way
it's going to be us playing a really good team, so take that for what it's
worth, I guess.  
  
Q. I'm curious, because of your defensive focus this year, is there
something special about playing Virginia since they lead the nation in
defense? Is that a cool matchup for you guys because of that focus?  
K.J. MAURA: I think it's a good matchup for us. Their emphasis is getting
stops. I think if we get a good game offensively we can subtract their defense
a little bit. In our end we got the make sure we pressure the ball and keep
them uncomfortable so they don't get good looks at the basket.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I don't know about any connection about your question but I
think it's a cool to play them just because they're the number one seed
overall. I think that's really cool.  
  
Q. Jairus, I'm curious, have you told your teammates what they might
expect when they play against Virginia, specifically what they do?  
JAIRUS LYLES: We have actually sent them some film on how they guard a lot of
ball screens and how we play. So I sent them some film. We watched some film
together. Yeah, we definitely discussed that.  
  
Q. Anyone on the panel, what is it exactly, what do y'all believe it is
about UMBC basketball style of play that could potentially give your team a
run in the tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: This year Coach Odom had a big emphasize on finding a way to
win games. Sometimes we don't shoot the ball well and sometimes we don't get
as many stops as we need to. When it comes down to it, it's just finding a way
to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think we're really unselfish and it doesn't matter who is
scoring. Jairus scores most of the points a lot of time. So many guys on the
team have led the team in scoring. We just play for each other all the time.  
  
Q. Jordan, what is it about Coach Odom? This is his third year as a head
coach. He's won 20 games each place. What is it about him that makes him so
successful?  
JOURDAN GRANT: He came in from day one and really implemented the offense that
really gave us the freedom to shoot the ball at will, and he just really
believes in us. We believe in him. When we step on the floor, he just says go
have fun and believe in yourself. I think that's a big key to our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have about four minutes left. Other questions? Front row.  
  
Q. Offensively Virginia, Kyle Guy, what do you see from their offense
and their outside shooting for any of the guys?  
THE MODERATOR: K.J.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think the emphasis for us is to stay attached to their man when
they're coming out of pin downs and down screens. They run a lot of sets for
-- to get him open especially for Guy and Jerome. We got to arrive on the
catch and make sure he doesn't get a good look at the basket.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Like he said, they do a good job of making you work the whole
shot clock. We've got to stay patient and be discipline and not try to rush
it. Speed them up. Definitely make them uncomfortable, but just be patient.  
  
Q. Jordan, going off your last answer there, what does it do to you to
have a coach like that that gives you the freedom to kind of be yourselves, I
guess?  
JOURDAN GRANT: Man, with Coach Odom it just -- it really gives us the
confidence to play the way we play and be ourselves out on the court is
probably the best thing that he can do for us. I mean, we play a lot in
transition and he trust us with the reads we make with our offense. Lot of our
offense is based off of reads. He just says go out there and make the right
play. We've won 24 games. We've made a lot of right reads this year.  
  
Q. Follow up on that. I guess that's why it's not a surprise when he
let's Jairus dribble the ball up with the court with 20 seconds left and make
a play?  
JOURDAN GRANT: Jairus is a big shot maker. He's been hitting those shots all
summer on us in pickups. We just believed in him. He actually waved him off to
-- Coach Odom was calling a play and waved off. I'll take it myself. We all
believe in him.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think a lot of us waved; him off.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: All of us did wave him off.  
  
Q. As players who have had to probably go up against K.J. in practice,
what is it about his style of defense that just makes him so great to the
point where he can win Defense Player of the Year.  
JAIRUS LYLES: He's annoying. He's always in you. He makes you work for
everything. Even if you can -- the height advantage we have, we can see over
him. He's still up in you. It's making you uncomfortable whatever you do,
wherever you go. He's always there, never not on you. That's kind of annoying
when you're dribbling the ball and trying to get your shot off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: I can agree with that. Going against this guy everyday in
practice has been a blessing and a curse because he's annoying, as Jairus
said. But like he said, just being on his hip and ball pressure really gets to
people sometimes. That's what he gets for being Defensive Player of the Year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One final question. Anyone? Okay. Thanks, guys.  
  
Here we go with Coach Odom from UMBC.  
  
RYAN ODOM: How is everyone? Jim Miller.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what was the play that you had called for Jairus that
you called off?  
RYAN ODOM: It was a play actually for him to get the ball back eventually, but
he would have to give it up to get it back. And his call was the right one.
Let's just keep it. We got it in our best player's hands. And you know, kind
of the rest is history. My total focus at that point was -- you got to think
quick. I wasn't calling a time out. You got two seconds to decide okay, what
am I going to do here?  
  
My goal was to make sure that everybody was kind of out of his way and get
guys in position in position so he could do what he did. What an amazing shot
for him. What an amazing moment. His moment became our moment and just really,
really special. For him to come back to school as a graduate student and have
the ball in his hands on the last possession, to go to the NCAA Tournament.
That's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you talk about your early days in Charlottesville and
growing up sort of with the UVA program and what that meant to you?  
RYAN ODOM: Just a special time, you know, in our lives. We moved there I'd say
I was in third grade, something like that. Stayed there, you know until about
you know, 10th grade, going into 10th grade. We left that summer when dad went
back to Wake Forest. Just around so many highly successful people. And
everything started with Coach Holland and how he created that family
atmosphere around his program. And I just think about it, you know, and how
lucky -- I didn't realize it at the time, obviously when you're going through
it sometimes you don't really recognize it until you're out of it, but I'd get
home from school, ride my bike across that bridge, we lived two doors down
from the Hollands, and I'd go over there and watch practice. I would sit on
the side with Jeff Jones who had just graduated. He was just out of college a
couple years and wasn't allowed to be on the court at that time. So he and I
would sit on the side and dribble the ball between our legs and watch these
great players and coaches go at it. You think about Coach Holland and all of
his assistants that he had that have all been successful in their own way and
gone out and done amazing things. The players that have gone on, you know, to
be successful in life. Just I feel very blessed to have been a part of it.  
  
Q. Seth Greenberg described you the other day as his roommate. Were you
ever --  
RYAN ODOM: I was. I was. That was right when we moved there. And so I guess
Ralph graduated was that '82? Right, '82, '83? Okay. So that next year Final
Four year obviously Coach Greenberg was on the staff. When he first came on
staff, he stayed with us a little bit and so we had two little twin beds and
so he was in the room with me for a bit. I guess, you know, he was forced to
hire me at the end, you know, when I got into coaching at South Florida.  
  
Q. It seems like from talking to the players that if you had of called a
timeout and kind of told Jairus what to run, that goes against everything
you've done there for two years with just letting the players be themselves.
Give you a chance to elaborate on that.  
RYAN ODOM: Absolutely. I knew I was not calling timeout. As soon as I looked
up at the clock and we had the ball, you know, and the shot clock was off, I
was not going to give them the opportunity to set up what they wanted to do
defensively. You know, it played out right for us and obviously I'd be remiss
if I didn't say Vermont has had two exceptional years. I mean unreal. Not
covered enough nationally. To go undefeated las t year, go into the NCAA
Tournament and then -- yup -- I'm sorry. Were you lifting your hand there. And
then this year only lose one game and then lose to us in the finals. Just an
amazing, amazing job by John Becker and his staff and players. But yeah.  
  
Q. I was wondering, as you look at the players that are on your team
that are reaching the end of their collegiate career, if you could talk about
what exactly they have done to embody what UMBC basketball is all about and
how they've liked translated that on to the court.  
RYAN ODOM: First and foremost, they're high character kids. Everybody on our
team is like that. They're all great students. They're there for a reason.
UMBC is a tremendous academic institution and you have to be really, really
good in that area to succeed there and they understand the importance of it.
It's not just about basketball, it's about the whole experience while they're
there.  
  
This particular senior crew, they've been there from day one when I first got
there and they've been very, very coachable. The one word I would use you
know, to describe our team is they're very unselfish. I don't know how we'll
play tomorrow but I know that they'll pass the ball to one another, they'll
look out for one another, love each other while they're out there and give
their best. That's what they've done for two years for me.  
  
My comfy blanket will be gone at the end of this year. I'll have to find a new
one.  
  
Q. Ryan, continuing with the throwback Thursday theme, we've been told
today that you were officially a ballboy at UVA.  
RYAN ODOM: I was.  
  
Q. What do you remember from being on the floor and could you have
forecast down the road coaching against this team you saw growing up?  
RYAN ODOM: Definitely couldn't have forecasted coaching against this team
because when I was growing up I didn't want to coach. I actually wanted to --
wanted to get into banking world and that's kind of what was my focus. I love
playing the game and I was fortunate to go on to Hampden Sydney and played for
an amazing Coach with Tony Shavers, got the Carolina ties with Dean Smith. Had
amazing friends there.  
  
It wasn't until I got out of college that it was time get the air was out of
the ball at that point, to try to decide what I wanted to do. That's where
Coach Greenberg came into play and my brother was coaching at the time, dad
was kind of at the height of his tenure at Wake Forest. Seemed like the right
thing to do. I wasn't ready to give it up.  
  
Going back to Charlottesville in the early days, I was on the basket. I was
sitting on the basket when Ralph was shooting his last free throw and the ball
bounced off, I think, and he gets the rebound and puts it back in. That was
the last shot he made, I think in U Hall.  
  
So, that's where I started, I was on the basket and run out on the court when
the team was on the other side and wipe it, wipe up the sweat and get off the
court. Try to stay out there a little bit longer, you know, so everybody could
see the little kid.  
  
And then I graduated to honestly sitting behind the opposing team's bench and
so I would hand the opposing team's players water behind the bench. I saw them
all come through there, I saw Dean come through, and Coach K and Jim Valvano,
Bobby Cremins, Lefty Driesell.  
  
I sat right behind all of them. I would rebound with our players prior to the
game, sometimes go in the other end and passing it back to MJ on occasion when
they were in town. Just -- it's some amazing memories. Just very, very
fortunate.  
  
Q. Your father the other day said that you're much more like your mother
than you are like him. What have you gotten from him?  
RYAN ODOM: Well, probably that long-winded answers right there (laughter).
That's the first thing. We don't speak in very are sucise (sic) statements.  
  
Patience, I would say. My players will probably tell you I have a pretty easy
way, laid back, you know, style when I coach. Hopefully that gives them some
calmness when they're in tough and tight situations.  
  
But, you know, what do I get from my dad? I think it's the passion, you know,
for the game to do things the right way. The game is meant so much to our
family and you know we just want -- each group that comes through, each player
that we're fortunate enough to coach, you know, that's their moment and their
time in college and so our job as coaches is to make it the best that it can
possibly be and that's the way he approached his job each and everyday and
that's the way I try to do it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Five more minutes. Next question.  
  
Q. Your dad also said that in the situation you were in against Vermont
he would have called two timeouts, drawn up the wrong play twice Jairus still
would have made the shot.  
Do you feel it's come full circle because he said when he comes to Baltimore
to visit he comes to your practices now and he watches.  
  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I was crazy watching his game. I'll be dead honest with you.
I used to throw stuff watching his teams play when I was watching it on TV.  
  
When you're out of control, like it's not within your control, so much harder
to watch a loved one do this and I remember last year watching, you know,
Chris Collins and his father and his reactions and that just struck a cord
with me because I used to do it as a kid watching dad and now he's definitely
doing it watching me and mom just has to sit there and, of course, calm him
down or get away from him.  
  
Q. We asked you back up on campus a couple days ago if you were going to
show your players footage of the Chaminade victory? It might come out. I don't
know if you plan to show that as kind of motivation at all?  
RYAN ODOM: It hasn't yet. That was certainly an amazing game for Chaminade. I
was actually a part of that because dad was there so probably steer clear of
that one.  
  
Q. You talked about how amazing that shot was and how historic it was
and sort of has become this team's moment.  
Has there been any difficulty at all with sort of getting the team to
refocus and say, okay, we do have a game tomorrow, we're playing Virginia and
what are you expecting out of the game tomorrow?  
  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean I gave them two days off, know so Sunday was kind of a
celebration day for us and our campus and community. Then I gave them the next
day as well.  
  
We had a meeting, you know, at noon or so, that's about the time we practice.
My whole focus there was just to try to get the focus off of the shot and kind
of what had happened and we've got to prepare for the next opponent.  
  
It's a tremendous opponent, the best in the country, most disciplined team on
both sides of the ball. We're going to have to play lights out basketball just
to be in the game.  
  
Our guys understand that but, at the same time, I want them to be confident
because they haven't won 24 games for a reason. I want them to go in there
freed up and follow exactly what the game plan is and we're trying to win.  
  
Q. Building off of what were you talking about of the day dedicated to
celebrate with the campus and facility, what does it mean to the team, the
campus and community to be the representative from the State of Maryland for
the national tournament?  
RYAN ODOM: It's huge. Certainly we'd love to have more teams in the tournament
from the State of Maryland. We're obviously the last team remaining and we're
excited about that.  
  
But, you know, I think most important for me is seeing these kids smile. The
experience that they're having right now, you know, is unlike any. The
greatest show on earth. They're getting excited about we got Cokes in the
locker room. They got everything. They're not used to that.  
  
They're certainly not used to this and I want them to soak everything in and
enjoy every moment because it literally is, it's hard to win -- if you're a
one bid league it's hard to win that tournament. Everything has got to go
right for you to be able to experience this.  
  
And these kids, you know, worked tirelessly to make this happen. We have a
saying that's up in our locker room, "The work you do in the dark will reveal
itself in the light." They've worked extremely hard the last two years to make
this a reality.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Couple more.  
  
Q. Ryan, you mentioned that your father is a little high-strung watching
games. Can you imagine him in the NIT Selection Committee room when Lyles's
shot goes in and his reaction and he's screaming and high-fiving everyone in
the room?  
RYAN ODOM: Oh, yeah, I can definitely imagine that. He was probably crying. He
probably had plenty of tears there, when you're able to watch your son.  
  
I have a hard time watching my son play. Now, obviously, I know what that
feels like and it's a special feeling to watch your young one do something
like this. I'm sure he's taken a lot of pride, as is mom.  
  
My wife -- I would be remiss if I didn't mention her. She's the rock of
everything in our family. She's amazing. The two boys. Had a great moment with
my son right after the game when we won. Somehow he just found his way to me.
That it was literally the first guy I saw. I had a great hug with Conner.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Take one more. Last question.  
  
Q. So I brought this up to your players but I don't know if you're aware
that there is a Ken Pom statistic that mentions luck for a team, basically.  
RYAN ODOM: We're the luckiest.  
  
Q. Yeah. I was wondering if you kind of share your thoughts on there
being a quantifiable fact that your team is supposedly lucky to be here at
this tournament.  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean for sure. We follow Ken Pom, obviously, and take pride
in moving Ken Pom's work when he choosing somebody else or the numbers choose
somebody else.  
  
But our guys are excited about the opportunity. Absolutely we feel lucky, for
sure. We're very fortunate to be here and our guys understand that and they're
going to do their best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to start our interviews with the student-athletes
from Creighton. We have from left to right, senior Marcus Foster, junior Khyri
Thomas, senior Toby Hegner, and senior Tyler Clement. We'll have 15 minutes.
Please raise your hand.  
  
Q. Marcus, I know you probably talked a lot about extra motivation
facing Kansas State and as a follow-up, how did your two years in Manhattan
affect the way you are as a player and as a man now?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It really just made me learn. You know, things I went through I
had to grow up and mature, and now I'm in a spot now I'm the man I wanted to
become and just a little learning curve I had to go through. Everybody has to
go through things, but you face adversity and you get over it and move on.  
  
Q. Motivation?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Extra motivation for me is this could be my last game. There's
not any other way I can put it. I have to put everything on the line so I can
be able to play until it's all over.  
  
Q. Marcus, I'm curious if you've had any relationship with Nigel
Johnson. He's also kind of playing here and if you guys have spoken or plan to
speak at all?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Me and Nigel talked the night we found out there's a
possibility we could play each other. He was my roommate for two years at
Kansas State. We've been talking throughout the years. Me and him are
definitely excited to be able to play each other, you know, on different teams
this time.  
  
Q. Obviously you can't reveal specific like tactics or plays and
whatnot. What has Coach exactly helped emphasize in practice like even
anecdotally to prepare you for the upcoming matchup?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Kind of the same things we've been going over and over this
season. We struggle on the defensive end and teams are going to try to punk
us. You watch Kansas State play and that's what they're real good at. They're
good at stopping teams and being tougher than teams. We have to bring a
another other level of toughness. Try to keep them out of the paint a little
bit. They are good shooters, so we have to be able the contain the 3 point
line and also keep them out of the paint.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Khyri?  
  
KHYRI THOMAS: Marcus kind of just really put everything out there on the line.
Just really focus on the level of toughness to match theirs or be a little
better than theirs. That's one thing. And really just getting those guys a
little frustrated with whether we trap or what our game plan is. Just really
to kind of get in their heads a little bit, because I know they're going to do
the same to us. But at the same time, you know, maintain our focus but to get
them riled up and cause them turnovers which will eventually lead us to our
game, which is a fast pace and knocking down 3s.  
  
Q. What was your reaction when you found out you were going to play K
State? Was it kind of a roll of the eyes or anybody but them? What was your
reaction when that happened?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It was kind of different, you know. I mean, I was just happy
for our name to be called, but, you know, I wasn't expecting to play them. I
knew coming in there's going to be a lot of media attention towards it. That's
the one thing I wanted to stay away from just because I'm so locked into this
last game that I have to play and I want to be at my best and I don't want to
have to worry about other things rather than just going out there and giving
it my all.  
  
Q. I guess this is for any of you guys. When you found out you were
coming to Charlotte, what was the reaction from Davion and Ty-Shon? What did
they tell you about Charlotte?  
TOBY HEGNER: They were really excited. We were just as excited for them, as
you know, going back to we're in the tournament and we were all excited at the
moment, but it meant a little bit more to them to come home and play in front
of some of their friends and family. They were pretty excited. Pretty good
feeling to witness that.  
  
Q. Any of the players. Every team's goal at the beginning of the year is
to make it to the big dance. What's your feelings now that you're in the big
dance with a chance to play in a national championship?  
TYLER CLEMENT: Yeah, that was one of our main goals coming into the season was
getting back to the tournament. We talked about how we've gotten to the
tournament five of seven years but not necessarily happy just to be here
anymore, we want to make some noise and win a couple games for sure. I guess
our whole sentiment, we're happy we're here, we're not satisfied with that. We
want to keep rolling and keep extending our season. We're trying to make some
noise.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Toby.  
  
TOBY HEGNER: The big thing for this team and especially for us, no Creighton
team ever made it past the first and second round. Our goal going into the
season was to make a run, like Tyler said earlier. And that's something that
we can do, but we got the take it one game at a time, and right now our focus
is on K State and what we have to do to win that game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Khyri, your turn.  
  
KHYRI THOMAS: Toby just hit it right on the nail. Not just to be here and get
past that first and second round, you know, we did it last year, kind of
looked past the Rhode Island game. Unfortunately we lost the first round. To
get past the first and second round will mean a lot to us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Marcus.  
  
MARCUS FOSTER: All year we talked about how we can exceed our expectations and
at the beginning of the season, we weren't the team we were supposed to be and
lot of people doubted us, and over the season we got better and better. The
more we started talking about the tournament, we were like we're not going to
be happy to be in there. We're going to try to make some noise, like Tyler
said, and want to leave our mark on our school by making history by making it
to the Sweet 16. We have to take it one game at a time, unlike we did last
year.  
  
Q. Toby, in watching film of Dean Wade, what exactly do you see from
him? Give me your breakdown of Dean.  
TOBY HEGNER: Dean is a great player. You ask anybody in the Big 12, they'll
tell you he can do it on both ends of the floor. One of our focuses is post up
game and transition is very, very good. And we're going to have to do whatever
it takes to keep the ball out of his hands and make someone else put it on the
floor and score.  
  
So, we've got a lot of things on our mind to take Dean Wade out of the game,
but it -- it's a team effort no matter the situation and that's what we
prepared.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question? Anyone else before we let them go?  
  
Q. What's been the top song in the tournament play list rotation that's
been going on in the locker room, just for anybody?  
TYLER CLEMENT: Martin has been playing "The Middle." I don't know who sings
that. We're getting kind of sick of it because he keeps singing it. We don't
have a song that's kind of fueling us. We're tired of "The Middle." "God's
Plan," maybe.  
  
TOBY HEGNER: There's a lot of different songs going through our locker room
right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thanks, guys.  
  
We're ready to start with Coach McDermott from Creighton.  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Well, we're thrilled to be back in the NCAA Tournament. You
know, this is the second year in a row that we've had a pretty serious injury
to one of our key guys that has ended his season and had to figure out a way
to rally around that. And I'm really proud of the way this team has functioned
since we lost Martin Krampelj. Guys had to play different roles. We had to
have some guys step up, even a red shirt that wasn't playing that had the red
shirted pulled in Jacob Epperson. We had to kind of reinvent ourselves after
that injury and it took a little time. We certainly have moved the right
direction and extremely proud of those four guys you just talked to because
their leadership has been critical in us sitting here today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Marcus answered the question the way you would hope he would. It's
just another game, NCAA Tournament, all the pressure on survive and advance.
Do you sense there's any extra with him because he played at K State?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: You know, it wasn't probably his top choice of who he would
like to play when the pairings came out. But he and I had -- because we're
playing K State, it gave us an opportunity this week to have a lot of
conversation about it. And I don't know how Marcus answered your questions,
but in my conversations with him, you know, we all make mistakes when we're
18, 19 years old and he's taken ownership of those mistakes. And to his
credit, he's made the changes in his life to be the person that he is today
and be the leader and the teammate that he is today, and that may or may not
have happened had he not made those mistakes when he was 18 and 19.  
  
So, while I'm very proud of what the stat sheet says about Marcus Foster this
year, that doesn't hold a candle to how proud I am of who he's become off the
court, the friend, the teammate, the father that he is today is a very
different person than the one that first met with me when he left Kansas
State.  
  
That's why I do this, that's why Bruce does it, and to see guys grow and
hopefully move on to bigger and better things in their life, and the
combination of the two experiences have led him down this path and in the
landing spot that he is today. I'm extremely proud of him.  
  
Q. Greg, what adjustments, if any, have you made in preparation leading
up to this week, things maybe you've gathered from your last couple of
experiences here?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: You know, we've had a little more time. Last year we played in
the finals of the Big East tournament on Saturday and get turned around on
Tuesday and jumped on a plane for the West Coast. We've had a little more time
to really get our legs under us. I think from that standpoint I think we're a
fresher team than we were a year ago.  
  
But we've had enough guys that have been here and they've done a really good
job throughout the season in helping our freshmen move along when we really
needed them. And they've done that this week in helping prepare them for
what's ahead this week. And it's the biggest stage in college basketball, but
at the end of the day you go out and do what you do.  
  
There's not a lot of surprises and secrets that you're going to pull out in
the middle of March. You try to execute your stuff as well as you can and try
to disrupt what the other team is going to do.  
  
So I think we're in a good place and I think the guys are really anxious to
get out on the floor tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, when I say "Dean Wade," what do you think?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I like the vision of him with the boot on instead of the boot
off (laughter). No, honestly I hope he's healthy and he's able to play, but I
had a chance to watch Dean in high school and we recruited him a little bit
but probably were too late. He committed to K State shortly there after. But
his development since I saw him in high school is really incredible. I've seen
him play a little over the course ever his career. I haven't studied him like
I have this week. He shoots a 3 point shot extremely well. He can beat you on
the block. He's got great pace to his game when he catches it on the block but
also catch it off the block and face you or back you down.  
  
Having said all that, what makes him dangerous is his ability to pass the ball
if you attempt to come with some help. He can make some of those other guys
very, very efficient, very, very effective with his ability to pass the
basketball. I've been incredibly impressed with him. I think he's a really
good player. I think he's got a bright future ahead after college.  
  
Q. I guess just going back to the freshman a little bit, they've had two
kind of big stages away from home that they've had to play well against,
obviously the Villanova one at home. What about those three players gives you
the confidence that extend their minutes, extend the rotations in big
situations when you need important play from your team?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Number one, they've earned it with their play in the practice
floor. Even when they -- when Mitch and Ty-Shon weren't shooting it great in
games, they continued to shoot it in practice and continued to spend the time
off the practice floor preparing themselves. I had lunch with those three the
other day, and one of the things I talked about and actually thanked them for
is they've all had to play a role different than probably what they
anticipated. You know, Ty-Shon really got thrust into the point guard role
because of Caleb's injuries and he did a good job so we left him there. That's
not his true position. Ronnie recently goes down late in the year when we're
playing the three most important games of the year to try to get into this
tournament and we slide Mitch Ballock full-time to the power forward position,
a position he never really played except for a few minutes with us early in
the season. And Jacob Epperson was going to red shirt. He's sitting there in
the middle of January just icing his knee, taking his time before gets back to
the practice floor after the meniscus surgery, and all of a sudden on January
27th he gets thrown to the wolves because of Martin's injury. They've all --
it wasn't a typical freshman year because we really asked them to get out of
their comfort zone and do different things. And if one of them fights us on
there or one of them can't embrace the role we've asked them to play, we're
not here today. You know, what made me really think about it, I rewatch the
Providence game and looked at the start of overtime. We've got Khyri and
Marcus and three freshmen on the floor to start that overtime. So I think that
speaks volumes to the progress that they've made.  
  
Q. As a coach, what does it mean to you having your team back in the
NCAA Tournament?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: You know, it never gets old. I've been fortunate to do it
quite a few times now, and it's the same level of excitement when your name is
called as it was the first time. You're just as happy for your guys because
it's so hard to get into this tournament. I've watched a few NIT games the
last few days as you're trying to kill some time and get to the game and those
are really good teams playing. And, you know, you can't ever take for granted
the fact that you're here because things have to go right. You need the bounce
of the ball some and you've got to have a pretty good basketball team. And for
that reason, I'm really proud of our team to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question?  
  
Q. Coach, as the mentor of Marcus Foster, when you saw this pairing, did
you think it was an unfortunate set of circumstances that he has to talk about
all this in the final weeks of his college career?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I would say it would have been unfortunate if he's not
prepared to talk about it. But I think it's important that K State fans
understand that the person that Marcus Foster was as a freshman, guy that's
hungry to play and great teammate and always in the gym, he's back now and
there was a lot of bumps in the road, some in Manhattan and it wasn't always
rosy in Omaha for that first year, especially. But because of the fact that
he's matured enough that I think he can address it as someone that recognizes
that you know a lot of what happened was my fault and decisions I made put me
in this position, and decisions that I've made since then have put me in the
position I'm in today.  
  
So, you know, because he's grown so much, I think it's healthy for him to have
to be able to answer it, because he let down some people and let down his
family and that was one of his motivating factors to get his life back on
track. He's got a wonderful family and he really disappointed them and now
they're pretty happy, as you can imagine.  
  
Q. You remember a time that you realized, okay we're going to get
through this, like you said, the first year Creighton was a little bit of a
challenge. Do you remember a breakthrough, Marcus is going to be fine?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I don't know if there was ever one particular time. I was
seeing -- I was seeing constant growth. Sometimes it was very slow, sometimes
it was a little bit more rapid, but just some of the decisions he would make
and some of his interaction was his teammates. I recruited him out of high
school. I've known him since he was 15 or 16 years old and knew his family I
knew what he was like back then. I knew the Marcus Foster y'all saw as a
freshman at Kansas State. I really felt he was still in there, we had to bring
him back out. And with the help of his family, we were able to do that.  
  
His decisions got better and his -- I think once he recognized, you know what,
I'm in this position and I'm sitting out this year at Creighton because of
decisions I made at Kansas State. Once he grasped that, I think he was able to
move forward quicker.  
  
Q. The first time you spoke to Bruce, I imagine you spoke to Bruce when
were you talking about taking on Marcus, do you remember what that
conversation was about, what Bruce said about Marcus and where they were at?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I remember exactly the conversation, but I'm not going to
discuss in it this room. Bruce was very honest and up-front and open like I
would be if the shoe was on the other foot. And he called me. He let me know
exactly what I was dealing with, and I appreciated that and we moved on after
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Bill Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20715)

### [Admon Gilder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30841)

### [Tyler Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30813)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has our first question?  
  
Q. This question is for Admon. You've done a great job all year of
guarding the opponent's best scorer. What do you know about Diallo, who has
been Providence's leading scorer, and how are you going to defend him?  
ADMON GILDER: We watched a whole lot of film on him. He's a big guard, about
6' 7". I know they punch it in to him a lot. Just know, stick to our bigs, we
front the post from the guard's standpoint, and we have a great bigs who will
be able to help us on the help side and come over and even block a shot for
them. I think it's a good match for me, not just me but the whole entire team.
Looking forward to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: What was the next question?  
  
Q. Tyler, you have a size advantage in the post. You've had a size
advantage for a lot of years. What is it going to take to get you involved,
one, and also to take advantage of that size on offense and defense?  
TYLER DAVIS: I just need to do my job like I have been all year. Coach Kennedy
is going to get the ball into me. I got to make the right play, make the
basketball play. Use my size to the my advantage. Seal inside, be a force in
the paint, do my job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question?  
  
Q. I'm curious, have you guys watched Providence on TV at all, all
season long?  
TYLER DAVIS: Not on TV. This past week. We feel like we know them well.  
  
Q. Follow-up. Your size has been a big advantage all season long. Looks
like it could be in this game as well. I imagine could you just talk about how
difficult your practices are practicing against each other?  
TYLER DAVIS: It's fun. Playing against Rob, Tonny, Isiah, and we have a guy
that's not playing, next year he'll be good. You got to get ready to go every
single day, go to war. It gets you better and I love the competition.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Guys, thank you.  
  
Questions for Coach Kennedy, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the way that Providence is, they have a lot of
players who can be installed at different positions on the floor with the
exception of the point guard who is always the point guard.  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: Right.  
  
Q. Is there some aspect of preparing for a team that has that level of
versatility, that is different or more difficult than someone who plays a lot
of people at traditional positions?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: It's definitely different. You know, playing a Carolina
East Coast style of basketball, we're taking advantage of people one-on-one.
Got to be able to make physical plays on the defensive end. Hopefully we won't
get our guards in foul trouble. Their size on the perimeter is an advantage
with their team, and I think our size with our post guys is an advantage with
us, but it's definitely different style of play. We've practiced against a lot
of different teams this year, played Penn State probably closest to a similar
as Providence when we played Penn State earlier in the year.  
  
Q. Billy, your thoughts on the matchup on Kyron with TJ, guy has been a
senior that's been in this tournament a lot, against a guy that's only started
about half the year, and do you think that the last two games going up against
Sexton prepared him for the moment?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: I don't think he could have gotten better training by
guarding Collin Sexton the last couple of games and going what we went through
with that. There's a lot of drama involved in that matchup, so I don't think
he could get any bigger than that from that standpoint. The difference is
Cartwright has got a lot of leadership qualities with this team and has been
in this tournament before. It will be interesting to see how that matchup
plays out. But I like TJ. He's very confident. He'll come in here if we can
keep him within confines of the offense and taking care of the ball, something
we've been emphasizing all year. I think he'll play well. I expect him to play
well.  
  
Q. Coach, you have brought three, four guys from the 2016 team that went
to the Sweet 16. How do you think their experience has helped the younger guys
in preparation for this week?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: They know what they're playing for, the sense of urgency,
they've been through it before. All the media and the different things that
come with the NCAA Tournament, they've experienced. I think you'll see them
comfortable in this situation. It will be Tyler Davis and Admon Gilder for us
who provide the type of leadership. Tonny Trocha played big in the NCAA
Tournament. DJ Hogg. We have some guys that have experience. It's the biggest
thing is them understanding that you can't change anything for this
tournament. You got to be who you are, stay together and do the things that
got you here, and that's something I hope those guys are able to relay to the
rest of our guys.  
  
Q. What do you need out of Robert tomorrow to sort of swing the matchup
your way? What are you expecting from him and what is it about him that makes
him such a special player?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: His ability defensively to block shots is something that
can cause some problems for anybody, especially 15 feet into the basket. They
run a flex offense, very good around the basket his ability to block shots, if
we can get him to block shots, i Think that's something that's changed the
game for us. We're getting easy transition baskets when he blocks shots. On
the offensive end we need him to be more aggressive. We will go to him a
little bit more. The last couple of games we tried to go to him more. We want
him to be more of a scoring threat because he has some abilities we don't
always get out of him. We want him to be more of a scoring threat around the
basket.  
  
Q. Billy, why do you think Admon has been so successful defensively
against some of the guys y'all put him on that are high scorers, he's been
able to contain them. How do you think he's going to match up in that role
against Diallo?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: He takes it as a challenge when he knows he's guarding one
of the guys best players. He understands how important defense is. He's been
that way from his freshman year. We've made him a defensive stopper. He buys
into that role. He's guarded a lot of different guys. He may guard Diallo, so
it will be a little bit different guard, defensive responsibility for him
because both of these guys are 6' 7" and power guys who like to post up. Most
of the guards he's guarded are perimeter guys. Be interesting to see but I
know he'll fight. That's the one thing, he buys into that role and that's been
big for us.  
  
Q. In terms of the way that Providence's style plays, on defense they
get a lot of deflections because of their length. You guys have had issues at
times with possessions and turnovers. Do you envision that as being a
potentially volatile mix?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: That's something we're concerned about, definitely. When
we have taken care of the ball, we've been very hard to beat because of the
second chance points we get on the glass and our ability around the basket.
But they do, they get a lot of deflections. They bump you, they're physical
defensively. You got to be able to play through that to be ball tough.
Something we've talked about all week is taking care of the ball and being
strong with the ball and being able to handle contact, play through contact is
something that they're good at. And we've got -- that is something we've got
-- that's a big key to the game is our ability to handle the ball and get
shots at the basket when we can go chase the misses when we did miss it and
not turn the ball over and lead to transition baskets for them.  
  
Q. On the other side of that same coin, Providence comes from a
conference where they are known for the physical nature of the play. But you
have a lot of strong, big guys on your front line that you were talking about.
Do you think in some ways your club is well-suited to take on a team that
plays that style?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: I think it's -- that's what makes it a great matchup., is
that we're both physically dominant at times, and when we are physically
dominant we're tough to beat. We hope our size and length is something they
haven't seen a whole lot of. That usually gives people problems because we go
6'10", 6'10", 6'9" at the front line and at times play some zone, and that
will be able to bother them some hopefully, also.  
  
Q. Your size that you just spoke of, it seems to be the basketball is
going away from that or the big guys certainly have to have an awful lot of
versatility. Tyler, for example, is more of a traditional low post guy. Why do
you favor this current collection of guys, or is it just you've been fortunate
in recruiting?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: We've been fortunate in recruiting. It is different. We
can basically play two 5 men at times with him and Robert. It is different,
and at times we've had problems going out guarding a perimeter 4. We've been
able to play small, Tonny Trocha is really a 4, 3 and DJ Hogg can play the 4,
also. We've been able to go small, but we like the fact that people sometimes
have to matchup with our size and that's been a plus for us most nights.  
  
Q. Coach Cooley talked about "boxing out" was their key word. He's even
put signs up on their lockers and all that stuff. What's the one thing that
you've emphasized this whole week towards your players?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: We've emphasized the same thing. You know, I probably need
to take that and steal that and use that tomorrow, put a sign on everybody's
hotel room tomorrow morning when they wake up and they know to block out.
Because that's something we're concerned about, too, is blocking out. I talked
about earlier the other thing is taking care of the ball and our guard play
being efficient offensively, shooting the ball when we're open, making the
right plays and being ball tough and taking care of the ball. That and being
physical are the two things we've emphasized all week.  
  
Q. Also mentioned he respects you, a man of faith. He said tomorrow he's
going to pray a little bit harder than you. Is that possible?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: Whoever is going to pray the hardest, I don't think it's
going to matter either way. But I know we both -- that's important part of my
life, my faith is important. I wouldn't be here today without God's help. Our
team wouldn't be here. We've had some ups and downs, but we've been blessed to
get through it. We've known each other awhile. Ed is a good man and a heck of
a coach. I look forward to the challenge. If it's just about praying, I think
we're both in good shape.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: All right. Thanks.

### [Alpha Diallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34878)

### [Rodney Bullock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30774)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Kyron, and Jalen, you both part of a group that has made four
straight tournaments in your times here, and you guys have had significant
time during that period. What does that mean to you being a member of the
Providence Friers?  
JALEN LINDSEY: I think it's a testament to the program, coaching, staff and
the players that have come through here. We've put in a lot of work in the
past four years to get this, and we couldn't have done it without our
teammates that have been along side with us this entire time and the players
that were here. So, you know, me and Kyron, we're still grateful to be here
again and we hope to make a run in this tournament.  
  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Just been fun. You know, a long time coming. It's what you
dream about, just been fortunate to be here for four years and, you know,
starts every summer, you know. It's what we've been working hard for and our
teammates have been working hard as well, and it was just fun this year to
make history.  
  
Q. Questions for Nate. Has it sunk in as a freshman you're about to play
in the NCAA Tournament and what is that feeling like?  
NATE WATSON: It's a great feeling. A lot of good teams out there and just
feels great.  
  
Q. Rodney, I'm curious how often do you think about the lay-up against
Southern Cal a couple years ago. How much will the experience of playing in
these games help tomorrow?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: Thinking about the lay-up, I mean, it feels like it happened
like yesterday and it was a great moment, and just to have the experience to
come and play here another year is just going to help me and our team, and
hopefully it shows throughout the time that we're here.  
  
Q. This question be directed towards Alpha. What kind of changes have
you seen around your team last week before the Big East tournament before you
guys went on the run versus this week? Have you seen anything noticeable from
your team mates?  
ALPHA DIALLO: Yeah, definitely. Lot more confident, playing two number one
seeds back to back and taking them into overtime was definitely a confidence
boost for the guys and us. We're happy to be here, and we feel like we can put
our foot down and make an imprint in this tournament.  
  
Q. Kyron. The other day you said it's a completely different atmosphere
between the NCAAs and the Big East tournament. Can you specifically define
what the difference is in the atmospheres between those two and how you expect
to raise your game to that level?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I would guess, you know, it's always a familiar location
when it comes to the Big East tournament. Playing there every year, you know
where it's going to be. You pretty much know who your matchup is going to be
before you start based off seedings, standings in conference. And playing in
the NCAA Tournament, lot of times it's a lot of fresh faces, teams you haven't
played before. Gives you a fresh perspective. The team doesn't know you as
well, you don't know them as well. It's more fun to play against those types
of teams you don't get a chance to normally due to scheduling and stuff like
that. Just the overall excitement, the atmosphere, and as you guys know, you
watch basketball every year, lot of crazy stuffs happens in March out there.  
  
Q. This is for Rodney and Nate. What do y'all know about Admon, Tyler
Davis and Robert Williams?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: We know they're a great rebounding team and have to keep them
off the boards. We got to plan and just hopefully box them out and try to
limit as much offensive rebounds as they can get, and they'll have to guard us
on the other side of the floor. We both got to think we got to take care of --  
  
NATE WATSON: They're definitely a big team, get a lot of points off the second
shots. Got to come under a box out, be big in there and try to stop them.  
  
Q. This question can be for Kyron. Just kind of talk about the momentum
you guys built in the Big East tournament and how you plan to carry that into
your game tomorrow.  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I felt our momentum in the Big East tournament, we were
playing just as well as anybody in the country. Even with shots not falling we
were still right there in every game and, you know, it gave us a lot of
confidence knowing that we can play with those top teams if those two teams
were number 1 seeds but, at the same time, you know, that stuff that we did in
the Big East tournament doesn't matter anymore. Every game is you win or you
pack your stuff up and go home. We got to lock in this game, try to take care
of business and at the same time try to enjoy the moment and have fun.  
  
Q. Questions for Jalen. Jalen, what have you and the seniors kind of
told the young guys like Nate or some of the other freshmen about playing in
the NCAA Tournament since it's an experience they've never had before?  
JALEN LINDSEY: Yeah. We just tell them to have fun with it, you know, it's
definitely something that is exciting. You know, you can get a bunch of
jitters and be nervous. You got to enjoy the experience. When you get out
there, don't let the crowd get to you and stuff like that. Just keep enjoying
it and just play your game, just stay focused and listen to what the Coach has
got to stay, trust what they're saying and trust the older guys in what we're
telling them and learn and just get better from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Kyron, can you talk about your matchup with TJ Starks, a freshman,
and Admon, what you plan to do there, how to attack him, how you'll attack him
or what your experience will help you against a freshman?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: You know, I'm going to go out there, step on the court and
be holding the ball, look straight to the bench. Coach Cooley is going to call
a play, and I'm going to look at my teammates and yell out and run the play,
try to play as hard as I can on defense, try to get a lot of stops and just
try to bring some energy to my guys.  
  
Q. Rodney, how is this team this year's Friars team different or maybe
some comparisons that you've seen to some of the other teams you've come to
March Madness with, you've been here four, five times.  
RODNEY BULLOCK: Well, Friers, I mean, this year I feel like we have more depth
and we have this year little bit more than the past couple years. We got a
little bit more chemistry and I feel like it showed in the Big East tournament
when everybody was healthy and nobody was ill, and I mean it shows we can play
with anybody.  
  
Q. Rodney and Kyron, you were talking about the differences between
playing in the Big East conference tournament and playing here in the NCAA. In
the Big East tournament you got a body of knowledge, you really know the
opponents that you're playing against because you've already faced them a
couple of times.  
In a situation where you're playing against a team that doesn't know you and
that you don't really know, in your mind do you think you guys have an
advantage?  
  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Advantage, I mean not really.  
  
Q. Are you harder to prepare for?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Are we harder to prepare for?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: It's up for the coaches who prepare to decide that. We play
a lot of positionless basketball. A number for our team is just a spot on the
floor. We got guys that can play. Besides me I'm the only person with a set
position, you know. We got Alpha up here who can play any big from the 2 to
the 4 and Jalen from the 2 to the 5 at times if we need him to. And the same
with Rodney. I just think we're a very versatile team.  
  
RODNEY BULLOCK: We got a lot of positionless players. It's hard to film us.
We've got so many plays. Going to take a long time to scout us. We do have a
huge advantage in that standpoint.  
  
Q. Kyron, what is the scouting report on Texas A &M?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: What's the scouting report on Texas A&M? You know, they got
bigs, two bigs, two traditional bigs, and when we woke up this morning
everybody saw what the scouting report was in their room, big yellow paper
right in front of the TV that says "box out." That's the scouting report, box
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thanks guys.  
  
COACH ED COOLEY: I can't tell you how happy Providence College is to be here,
exciting time for us and our program, exciting time to be one of the
representatives of the Big East. Really proud of our staff, our players to get
to this moment here and eagerly waiting to play against a very talented Texas
A&M team. But to be on this stage and to be sitting on this podium here, it's
a dream for all of us and hopefully we can make this a magical year for
Providence College and the Big East.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you speak so highly of Coach Gavitt, so when you found out
that you had matched his record for most NCAA appearances by a Providence head
coach what did that mean to you in?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think it's a good question. I don't think about it as much,
but at the same time, it's an honor. It says the stability of our program,
talks about the leadership from our athletic director and our president and
our staff and the job that they've done and we've done collectively. It's an
honor but it's just a number. Doesn't mean much as far as the number. I'm just
-- hopefully there's many more to come.  
  
Q. Coach, Rodney has started 100 or 101 consecutive games for you guys.
How has he grown and matured over these years both on and off the floor?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I'm really proud of Rodney Bullock. He's a graduate first and
foremost, I'm really proud of that. Feels like Rodney has been here since I've
been here. He's gone through a lot of practices, he's gone through a very
turbulent time early in his career. The fact that he can respond from that,
become a graduate and lead us to a record, for his class, the only recruiting
class in the history of the school to come to four consecutive tournaments is
a testament to his mental toughness and fortitude. I couldn't be more proud of
Rodney representing Providence College.  
  
Q. Ed, looking for something on Alpha's growth in the two years he's
been here. If you think back when you were recruiting him, I know you liked
his flexibility and that's really played out especially here in the latter
half of the sophomore zone.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Coach Thomas and myself, Coach Battle, when we went up to
watch Alpha play at Brewster Academy, what stood out to us was versatility.
Alpha can play five positions and really embraced that role. You can post him,
you can put him in a ball screen, you can use him as a secondary ball handler.
I think his versatility has allowed his growth. But his biggest growth is him
trusting what we're teaching and what we're doing and that's been a great
thing to see, his maturity. His versatility, being that Swiss Army knife has
been something that's really helped our program. Alpha is a physical young
man. He's embraced that role as trying to get the ball in the post as well.
It's good for him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please wait for the mikes, please.  
  
Q. Kyron told us that a big part of the scouting report was a big yellow
piece of paper that said "box out." Could you speak to that in terms of the
importance of that for y'all tomorrow?  
COACH ED COOLEY: It's no secret, you know, Texas A&M is a very physical team,
they're a powerful team, they have NBA size in a lot of different positions.
And we feel if you allow them second, third and fourth opportunities, they're
going to have a chance to really beat you. So high alert on checking out -- it
was definitely talked about in everything that we do. You may have a block out
sign on your back right now and don't even know it (laughter).  
  
Q. What do you feel y'all match well against A &M?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Can you ask the question again.  
  
Q. Where do you match up well against A &M?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Where do we match up well? We're still in our preparation. I
don't know where we match up. I just know we're matched up to play each other.
They have a lot of size where we're concerned with that. The point guard play
has been very, very good as of late. I don't know where we match up with them.
All I know is the ball is going up tomorrow at noon and we got to hoop. I
don't know. That may be a question for them, not for me.  
  
Q. Ed, with the grind of the Big East tournament having to play three
overtime teams, two against number one seeds in this tournament, how do you
refuel the gas tank in time to get yourselves as prepared as possible for this
tournament as well?  
COACH ED COOLEY: We're ready to play Sunday. We're ready to play the next day,
you know. We have young kids who are passionate, they're hungry, the 18 to 22
years old. We have no time to be tired. This stage not about being tired. It's
about opportunity to advance. Having a senior like Kyron, Jalen and Rodney,
they've been in this situation before and all we're trying to do is get to the
next game. We have to be disciplined in our approach to the first one, but how
we advance, right now we're not talking about fatigue, we're talking about
opportunity.  
  
Q. For us not seen y'all play --  
COACH ED COOLEY: You don't know anything about us. I like that, though.  
  
Q. What did y'all do last week in the tournament so well as opposed to
earlier in the zone when you are struggling a little bit? What have y'all done
better?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think it's a great question. We trust each other a little
bit more. As I always tell the players, it's a long season that goes fast and
a lot of ups and downs. It's not how we start, it's how we finish. You got to
see what guys can do, what roles -- what role fits the player to help the team
win, and then you got to get a little bit lucky. I think all those came at the
right time. Anytime you have a chance to play in the Big East tournament and
the energy that's in New York City and the energy that's in Madison Square
Garden, it somehow brings the best out of all teams. That's why to me it's the
best conference tournament in America. I think that sets all our teams up for
success in this tournament that we're fortunate to move on. We just came
together at the right time.  
  
Q. Ed, you mentioned that this team has gone through a lot of ups and
downs this year and you're playing your best ball late in the season. What was
the turning point for this group?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I would say the turning point was us having more fun. We as a
coaching staff not being as angry with the little things, smiling a little bit
more. At the end of the day, it is a game. But really trying to have some fun
with the guys being in their world, not us being 45 to 50 years old, but
trying to be 18 to 22 year olds with them as far as enjoying what we're doing.
Sometimes in coaching you don't enjoy what you do because you're worried about
the unknown. My job is to try to stay in the present and enjoy the moment and
let the players see that. Once the players saw that, I think we played at a
different level.  
  
Q. When was that?  
COACH ED COOLEY: You asked when was that in the season? I would say JB a
couple of weeks ago, three weeks ago, we kind of turned that page a little
bit. And Coach Battle would always tell me, you got to enjoy the moment. And
it's hard to when you're a Nervous Nelly like I am. I appreciated our staff
for saying that and trying to enjoy the process.  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen maybe that's a little bit different about
your team on Monday of last week before the Big East tournament and then fast-
forward to this week when you're getting ready for the NCAA Tournament after
the success that you had in New York this past week?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think the players are feeling a little bit more confident.
We played some tough games, as you all of us do in the country. I think having
some success has given our guys some confidence they can play with anybody in
the country, and that's what that tournament can do for you. I just feel our
guys are a lot more confident, little bit more energetic. This time of the
year when you're able to get to this tournament, it gives you a different
energy, focus. And obviously our job as a staff is to try to get our group to
believe that they are better than they are to advance.  
  
Q. Ed, I guess how have you personally grown or changed as the head
coach and the leader of this program since this NCAA Tournament run first
started?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I feel I've grown a lot. I think it's been something to me,
it's still a dream for me, you know. I can't believe I'm on this stage talking
to you, to be honest with you. I feel very blessed and very fortunate. But
having been to this tournament and what you have to do to try to advance, how
lucky you have to be. I think I've grown as a game coach as far as preparation
with our staff. I think our staff does an amazing job. I think our staff are
all head coaches, and I think they've helped me grow in the process of not
being too nervous all the time but try to smell the roses sometimes, and it's
hard for us to do that. But I feel I've grown a lot in a lot of different
ways, and I give all the credit to our staff to help me.  
  
Q. Ed, is there another team that compares to A &M that you faced this
year?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Georgetown has a really big front line and versatility with
their small forward. They would probably be close. We played Minnesota early,
I think game 2. They would simulate the size the strength and the brawn of a
front line of Texas A&M. Those two teams come to mind right away with their
length in front of the rim and their athleticism and their guard play. Those
two teams would be very similar.  
  
Q. Coach, preparing for a big game like this what tools do you use other
than watching video of the other team?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Pray. Pray, man. I believe. It's not where can you get a
basket when you need it when you're scouting. A lot of these tournament games
come down to last second plays, special situations, are you prepared for that,
is your team prepared for that? Those are the things we're trying to prepare
for, because it does come down to little things in these tournament games.  
  
Q. Coach, are Nate, Kalif, and Rodney ready to match up with the size A
&M has?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Are they ready? If they're not, there's a problem. My babies
are ready for sure. Those kids are ready to play, you know. If they're not,
there's a problem. They're more than ready to play. We're excited. Our kids
are so energetic right now, I can't wait to get out on the floor and practice
with them today. Our kids are living the dream. We don't want that dream to
come to an end anytime soon.  
  
Q. With Kyron's experience, how much do you feel he can take advantage
of that, being a veteran going against a true freshman point guard in TJ
Starks at Texas A &M?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think once you get to this time of the year, these kids
aren't freshman anymore. He's played 30-some-odd games. He's been coached by
one of the best coaches in the country. He's in the a freshman. Hopefully some
of Kyron's game experience can help us down the stretch. This is all about how
you get to the end, not so much how you start, how you get to the end. And
Kyron has had some big, big games late in games. He's made big shots, big free
throws. I'm just hoping his experience can help us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Ed, a lot of your players were sort of talking about the team's
versatility when they were up there, guys who can play a 2, 3, 4 and maybe
even the numbers don't mean that much in your scheme.  
Do you think that because of the versatility, you are a harder team for an
opponent to scout and prepare for because guys do so many different things?  
  
COACH ED COOLEY: We love versatility. And when we go out to recruit, we look
for multi-positional players other than if you have a 7-footer or a Mighty
Mike with the ball. At the same time, the way the game has changed, you know,
we've kind of evolved with the changing of the game and just get multiple
players that can make plays, pass, catch, shoot, defend. It's not about our
size. It's versatility puts a lot of coaches in a stuff spots. That's why you
have these preseason games. You look to guard that, look to schedule games,
schedule early games to see where are you in your season and then post-season.
Our versatility has been our greatest asset. And one of the greatest strengths
of this program is guys that can play multiple positions. So we go out and
recruit guys, you're not going to play just one position, you're going to play
multiple positions for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. I was going to say there's going to be an awful lot of praying
between you and Billy Kennedy. You mentioned him being a top coach. How well
do you know him and what is y'all's relationship?  
COACH ED COOLEY: We don't have a relationship where we call each other every
day to see what foods we're eating. I've seen him in our business for a long
time. Always praying for his health. Watch his teams played. They do a really
good job, they're organized. I just respect the job that he's done. Really
great league that he plays in. I hope my prayers are a little bit stronger
than his tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Virginia seniors, Isaiah Wilkins and Devon Hall.  
  
Q. You're the number one team in the country, the number one seed in the
tournament. Does that put additional pressure on you or do you look at it more
as respect?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, I think all the unnecessary pressure you guys make those.
We just try to get better every single day. Coach preaches that. Not really
worried about the pressures or the target on our back. We know every team is
going to come after us. We have to be ready.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I think he covered most of it. I just think that at this point
in the year none of that even matters anymore. If you're here, you won. It's
time to show up and play.  
  
Q. Do you guys -- kind of going off what the question just asked about
the number 1, would you guys say there's any added pressure or are you just
kind of used to maybe being so highly ranked since you guys have been up there
in the rankings throughout the season?  
DEVON HALL: I think that was kind of similar to what he was asking, and I
don't think there's too much added pressure. I think what really matters is
what we've got going on inside the locker room and practice. To add more
pressure to ourselves, I think -- I don't think it's anything that's going out
inside our locker room. We want to get better as a group.  
  
Q. Obviously it's been beaten to death you -- your team was picked to
finish 6th in the ACC and clearly that didn't happen. So at what point do you
think this season was the switch flipped that y'all realized that your team
could really not just build something special for a tournament run but build
somebody special to be the best team in the country?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I never thought or I didn't think that was our mindset at all,
like we never looked at it like yeah, let's try to finish 6th. We're a
confident group and we believe in each other. I mean all that. Like we said
earlier, that stuff doesn't matter now and didn't matter before the season to
us. It is what it is that the point.  
  
DEVON HALL: I agree with him. I don't think our confidence wavered at any
point this season. We knew maybe some bumps and bruises, but we learned as a
group every single day. I think that we just had the most confidence in
ourselves.  
  
Q. Isaiah, talk about how big a surprise was it when you found out
De'Andre was out and how much of a blow has it been?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: We knew that he was playing hurt, guys knew that he was
struggling a little bit even before that game. So it was a game-time decision
for him. And he decided to play and it was huge, but it hurts and we're sad
for him. I like for him to be able to play. But, at the same time, nobody --
like nobody else is going to care that he's hurt. At this point you got to
step up, next man up and be ready to play. Feel bad for him, but we got ball
to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like the style of ball that you play is an advantage
in a tournament setting like this? And I'm curious what you think about fans
-- obviously not Virginia fans, but fans in general who kind of feel like it's
a less fun style of basketball to watch?  
DEVON HALL: I don't think we necessarily have to apologize for the way we play
or try to be favored by everyone else. If you like us, then you like us. If
not, I mean so be it. I think the way we play helps us win and we enjoy
playing that way. We play great that way as a group. So I don't think we
necessarily have to, you know, help everybody like us or make everybody like
us. That's the nature of the beast.  
  
Q. It's the dream of every college player to get to play in the NCAA
Tournament. Tell me how y'all feel about getting to play.  
ISAIAH WILKINS: It's exciting. You want to play ball, a lot of people come up
and watch this as they play and they want the play on the stage. We're here
and thankful for that for sure. Yeah, excited.  
  
DEVON HALL: Heck of an experience. I'm looking forward to it. Should be a lot
of fun. When -- like you were saying, when you're younger you watching us and
to be able to play on this stage is really fun.  
  
Q. Isaiah, have you done anything different in preparation physically
for this tournament or late season as opposed to last year when you obviously
missed a game?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: When I was sick? No. I eat more vegetables (laughter). That's
it. That's all I got for you. I'm healthy this year.  
  
Q. Guys, having been through this a few times already, when you look
back at your previous experiences, how much does it change this time of the
year in terms of what you need to do, and what are the biggest keys in the
single elimination kind of format?  
DEVON HALL: I think preparation is really, really big when it comes to this,
because you have one -- you have a couple days coming into it to prepare, and
then depending on how you do, you may have one day just to prepare for it. So,
I think that preparation and film and making sure you're locked in on every
aspect in this setting.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I feel like we got to punch first or try to punch first at
least. It's hard to play from behind in this format because everybody is
revved up and ready to play.  
  
Q. Devon, with De'Andre not available, will you expect to see more time
filling that role that he played in the small lineup as the nominally the 4?  
DEVON HALL: Maybe so, depending on what matchups are in or if it -- may be to
our advantage, then maybe so, I'll play some 4 or maybe we may go more
traditional at times. We'll see. I mean, I'm comfortable playing. I played a
little bit last year, so I enjoy playing that position anyway, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else?  
  
Q. Devon, did you guys watch a lot of these games that have been held up
to this point? And if so, have you learned anything?  
DEVON HALL: What do you mean?  
  
Q. The NCAA games to this point.  
DEVON HALL: We were just watching Rhode Island and Oklahoma. That was a good
one, went into OT. Watching the Gonzaga game in the locker room before we
walked in here. This is a competitive nature -- I mean this competitive
nature. Who doesn't want to play in this atmosphere. And I know every player
across the country playing in this is excited right now and amped up.  
  
Q. You guys have always been a chip on the shoulder kind of team and the
program sort of been defined by the underdog mentality. How hard is that to
maintain when you're a one seed and do you get a little extra bit of that now
with De'Andre out and some doubters kind creeping in again?  
DEVON HALL: I think it's more of us challenging each other in practice and
make sure we keep our humble mindset going into the game, knowing that -- I
mean any given day we don't come out to play, we can be beat. I think that we
have that mindset of knowing we have to fight, be continuous and be relentless
and own every possession. It definitely helps us keep that underdog mentality.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think there was ever a point where we won a game or
something and we all got together yes, like now we have arrived, we're here.
That's not how it goes. So, we're getting after it every single day. If
seeding mattered, the tournament wouldn't be a thing. Just whatever.  
  
DEVON HALL: I think we most definitely have room to improve and we're trying
to keep improving every single day. We watch so much film and we learn, you
know, from each other, learn from Coach Bennett and his staff. I think the
room for improvement is definitely there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else?  
  
Q. What are some things you as the older players are doing to calm the
nerves of the younger guys?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think we're a super uptight team anyway. We play
around and stuff like that. Dev does a really good job of like filling the
guys with confidence and things like that. We're still holding each other
accountable. We played North Carolina before. It's basketball. Show up.  
  
DEVON HALL: At the end of the day, we try to keep the guys loose and keep
confidence with the team. But at the end of the day, what it boils down to the
nerves get settled and it's time to really sit down and play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thank you, guys.  
  
We're about to start with Virginia Coach, Tony Bennett. Welcome Virginia
Coach, Tony Bennett.  
  
Q. What's your reaction to De'Andre and talking to Marco he said he was
taken off the green team and -- do you kind of anticipate him getting some
more minutes in this game?  
TONY BENNETT: I think the game will dictate that and obviously I was really
discouraged for De'Andre and for us. He had a heck of a year. I thought he
really developed and, you know, helped us so much with his versatility,
offensively and defensively. We talked a lot about that. But that's -- you
can't control the timing. Those things happen. I think there's enough in that
room, and of course as the old saying goes, next man up, you step up and guys
like Marco have to be ready. And just depending on how the game goes, you see
how it goes but it was -- yeah, an unfortunate thing and he seems to be
handling it well and I think the guys, everybody wanted him to be part of
this. But we're glad he's here and we're going to have to fight like crazy to
keep going.  
  
Q. What do you see Mamadi's role now that De'Andre won't be available,
and what do you anticipate from him going forward?  
TONY BENNETT: The game will dictate what you do, whether you're playing more
traditional. And guys like Mamadi and Marco, you mentioned Nigel, those guys
who have come off the bench for us, and De'Andre before, certainly have to be
ready. And with the team that we're playing and UMBC, they spread the floor
and shoot the ball very well. Their 4 men can play almost like a perimeter. It
will be how we're defending and how they're guarding us. You can't say until
the game gets going but hope that guys like Mamadi and Nigel and Marco will
seize the opportunity and the guys in the starting lineup will continue on.  
  
Q. Tony, seeing as De'Andre hit 6 free throws in the final minute
against Carolina, when did the injury occur? Was it in the Clemson game?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah. He had sprained his right wrist. I can't remember when did
he that. That was taped for awhile, but in the Clemson game I think, you know,
it was when he went to the basket and then he ended up playing. He had x-rays
and everything was looking good. And it wasn't until when we got back and it
still was bothering him and then he had an MRI, which was the definitive
thing. A real slight, slight crack but on his left, and your job as the coach
certainly and with these young men is to protect them. And he has such a nice
future and I think De'Andre would have tried to play, but long-term that's not
the wise thing. It's to get this taken care of and do it the right way and
give him the best chance for a full recovery, which is certainly what we
expect. But it was -- I believe it was in that Clemson game, I think when he
landed.  
  
Q. Tony, obviously you guys have been a No. 1 seed before, you've been
good for a long time. Given the season you've had, how do you access the
opportunity in front of your team going into this tournament? And also do you
need to break through to a Final Four to kind of get rid of maybe the final
narratives that hang onto your program?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think -- well, first of all, you know, to be given a No.
1 seed it's kind of a reflection of the year that we had and that's -- it's an
honor. But really what it does, it earns you the right to play one game and
we've earned that right just as UMBC did and play and earn the right to get a
next game. But it was a heck of a year, you know, and I think our guys -- of
course every program wants to win a national championships and get a Final
Four bid, those kinds of things. I was fortunate to be with my father when his
program at Wisconsin went there and that was a great run. But, you know, as
far as our program, I'd love it, but I know the way to do that is to lock in
and say all right, earn the right to get to the next game.  
  
There's so many good things have happened this year that won't be taken away,
but how you choose to judge your program, I look in our league, look at the
programs like Duke and Carolina and the national championship, they've done
that. That's why we're continuing to try to knock. We got a door knocker in
our locker room. Keep knocking and a step at a time. Tremendous opportunity,
certainly. We received the opportunity to compete against UMBC. I told our
guys maybe a month ago, I mentioned it to our media many times to not
overcomplicate it. Don't worry about seedings, how far you go, what happens.
Just have a mindset we're going to improve, we're going to play to win, and
we're going to be ready to go. And I think that not complicating is the best
way for us to have as much success as we can.  
  
Q. We talked about this a few years ago when you guys were playing here,
former Charlotte Hornet coming back. What are your memories from the city,
what's it like coming back and your thoughts on it?  
TONY BENNETT: This has been -- I have wonderful memories of Charlotte. It's
where a couple dreams come true. Happened one -- I had a dream as I young boy
that one day could I play in the NBA, and I was given that opportunity by the
Hornets. Dave Twardzik, maybe he was the one in the war room saying we should
draft the little lefty from Wisconsin Green Bay. But to play on that Hornets
team, to be part of a playoff team and some special years here with great,
great teammates was a dream come true for me. And I got to meet my wife here.
She's not from here, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana but she was an assistant
youth director at the church, Forest Hill that I went to. You meet your wife
and get to play in the NBA -- it's more important to meet your wife, let's get
that straight. Those are two pretty awesome things that happened here. And got
to meet wonderful people that I was part of this community when the Charlotte
Hornets, the hive was alive, the Coliseum was great. I cherish those memories
and thankful where this road has taken me.  
  
Q. Tony, a lot of players never get to play in the tournament, lot of
coaches never make it to the tournament. You've done both. What does it mean
to you now to get to be a coach and bring your team back to the tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: It's great. When I played at Wisconsin Green Bay, you know, that
was such -- we'd have to win our conference tournament and then get the chance
to do that. I remember how exciting that was for our city and our university
and the NCAA Tournament is amazing. The regular season championships is
amazing, the conference tournament and then the NCAA Tournament. So much has
been made of it and rightly so. I think it's the most exciting sporting event
going, little bias of course, but to be able to do it as a player and get the
perspective to watch your young men have the excitement and the opportunities
to play is great and step into it in arenas like this and just gotten more
coverage, more excitement, I think is wonderful.  
  
Q. Other than the dramatic way that UMBC sort of made it into the
tournament, what have you learned about them from watching the film and what
are you expecting tomorrow?  
TONY BENNETT: I think Coach Odom, both of us being coaches' sons, in two years
what he's done with that program is terrific, how they've played and just I've
been really impressed in watching them on tape. They shoot almost 40 percent,
39 percent from 3, they shoot 20 plus, make 10, and they spread the floor,
their 4 man can shoot. Jairus Lyles is a heck of a player. I think he had 31
against Arizona. I didn't realize their point guard was Defensive Player of
the Year. I can see it because he's quick. They really spread the floor and
attack and play hard and are well coached. And that's the thing. You know,
when I was at Green Bay we always talked about this. Good basketball knows no
limits, knows no divisions. Doesn't matter what conference you're from, what
your seeding is. Good basketball sticks and it shows. I think for them to go
into Vermont and beat them in the ball they played is very good. That's --
again as I get back to like we said, you don't overcomplicate it. Try to
improve and you play it to win and you just -- you prepare well and you have
to prepare well to play UMBC because of their uniqueness and spacing and all
of those things, run very good offense.  
  
Q. As you may have heard Ryan Odom is a former UVA ball boy. Were you
ever a ball boy?  
TONY BENNETT: I was something called -- my dad was the coach at University of
Wisconsin, Stevens Point. I was what they called a "pointer pup." We'd go in
at halftime and get to do -- actually you'll see when -- not that you guys
will watch, when we go out there to warm up, we do a little ball handling
routine, Pete Maravich, the ball in a circle. The pointer pups would go out
there at halftime, right leg, left leg, dribble it high and low at halftime in
front of the crowd. Kind of that. And a lot of times I sit right behind the
bench and did some things for my dad's team. That's when Terry Porter and Brad
Soderberg, one of my assistants, they were playing for my father but a pointer
pickup. I know only Coach Odom when he was at UVA and Ryan was at Virginia
Tech, lot of good places.  
  
Q. I wasn't sure if you were using that as an analogy. Do you really
have a door knocker back in Virginia?  
TONY BENNETT: Ever since I've been coaching, not to make a big deal out of it,
even at Washington State, I think we acknowledged that you just -- that's the
way to touch something special. You keep knocking and sometimes the door gets
slammed in your face and sometimes you knock and it opens an inch and try to
put your foot and shoulder in there and keep knocking and trying to bust
through that door. That's the mentality. So we had that at Washington State
all my years, got a doorknocker and have it at Virginia just as a symbol. So
many programs have different things. That symbolized that. As a matter of
fact, I get a lot of texts from former players and lot of times "keep
knocking, Coach." And I think that's a great way to describe a program that
is, you know we're trying to be as blue collar as we can but pursue excellence
in the better manner we know how and it's our way. It's not other ways and
wherever that takes us, it takes us.  
  
Q. Tony, as I walked in you were talking about offensively, defensively,
they seem very multiple. In terms of prepping for their defense, what do you
see and what's allowed them to improve on that end this season?  
TONY BENNETT: Ryan is a good coach and they have some quickness and they can
go down the floor and put some pressure on you, whether it's three-quarter
court or make it hard for you, and then they played some good zone and again
they can pressure the ball with their quickness and their versatility. You
have to be ready and be sound with the ball. They turned -- I thought they
turned the game around Vermont, got after it and showed them a few different
looks. Very capable. And again being a coach's son you have to make your team
play defense or your dad disowns you. That's one of the rules of being a
coach's son.  
  
Q. Tony, as a shooter from your background, when you look at a player
like Kyle Guy, first of all, he's had a special year, but secondly is his
release among the fastest that you've ever seen as a player or coach?  
TONY BENNETT: Dell Curry had a pretty quick release when I played with him,
just a wrist flip and off. Kyle has a very quick release, quick set-up and
sometimes he can even adjust in the air. He's got live legs. Joe Harris played
for us, he had a quick release. Fortunate enough to coach Klay Thompson, one
of the quickest release. He really does have a quick release and again a good
foot work and moves hard without the ball and sometimes he'll adjust in the
air and turn a little bit which lot of guys can't. JJ Reddick could do it, Rip
Hamilton. Some of those guys you watch and they have them. Kyle has that kind
of foot work and ability to get it off. At his size, that's good. He gets off
the floor a little more than you think. If you saw his two dunks in the ACC
tournament, you know that.  
  
Q. Tony, I know you're a man of strong faith. How has your faith been
important in your coaching?  
TONY BENNETT: It's for me, everybody believes what they're going to believe,
but that has been my foundation in my life for so long. It gives me a peace
and perspective that really helps me and guides me in terms of how to treat
these young men, how to coach, how to honor the opportunity that I've been
given. Because I look at being a coach as a tremendous opportunity, as a gift
really to try to influence young men to be all they can be. Obviously as
players, as a team and sports gives you great lessons, but if there's life
lessons after. We have some pillars we talk about that are about humility,
passion, unity, servanthood that I think so make for a great team. There's
some life lessons in there, too. It's number one in my life. What matters most
without a doubt, then my relationship with my wife and my family and then the
opportunity to be with young men and coach. So, very thankful to certainly
have that as my rock.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Last two.  
  
Q. Tony, just to go back to the keep knocking theme. After the Syracuse
game, I was there in Chicago, you kind of freaked me out with how calm you
were. You didn't seem to be phased at all by what happened there. As you went
into that to reform the program to have the team you have now, was that just
sort of the perspective that you had to take on it was we knocked once, didn't
break it down, got to go try again? Was that kind of how you thought of it?  
TONY BENNETT: I think that mentality, and as the gentleman just asked, my
faith helps me in situations like that to see a bigger picture and
perspective. Doesn't mean it doesn't sting and you don't want to be there.
That's life. You're not always going to get what you want. We were on the
doorstep of perhaps advancing. And then you advance and there's always going
to be what's next, what's next? Nothing is ever enough, I understand that. All
these things are going to fade, but that idea of knocking after that game, we
addressed how can we improve. Every tough defeat, every tough loss, I think
brings incredible wisdom and that's one of our pillars about thankfulness is
will you be thankful for what adversity or losing teaches you. If you're able
to look at it as not enjoyable as it is and really glean from it, I think you
can grow in ways you probably wouldn't grow in success. And of course after
that, you look at things how to improve your program. I've been fortunate to
have the right kind of guys this year no one expected us to be in this spot.
But guys just have come together and they're so connected and so unified, and
now we've lost a key player. So we'll have to remain that way and even more
so. But that tough loss, yeah, I think it helped. But a lot of these players
weren't even a part of that. Devon, right? Correct me if I'm wrong -- Isaiah
-- Devon and Isaiah, get mad at me. Those guys, this is a different time, it's
a different year, and I think that's important to not dwell too much on the
past.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. As you've seen your team transition from the regular season to the
post-season, has there been any particular player that you've seen maybe
behind the sense in practice really make a post-season leap, or do you think
it's just kind of continued a season long progression?  
TONY BENNETT: I think it's been a season long progression. What's made this
team thus far be where they've been at is that they've improved in the off-
season, had good off seasons with their individual skill development and their
weight room stuff. All those things have mattered, and I think collectively
that's lifted them up. There's some guys with uncertainty. We were unproven.
They've stepped up well. And again there's been a unique chemistry in how
they've played. I think that's continued on, and it will have to obviously
keep continuing for sure.  
  
But different guys at different times, you know, De'Andre when we played at
Virginia Tech, he was a catalyst like he kind of came on. Mamadi, Jack,
different guys -- that's been unique about this team -- have stepped up when
called upon or when needed. You can't put your finger on one guy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Any of the guys, when you have the title game against Florida Gulf
Coast, what sticks with you more, the hot shooting in the first half or trying
to hold them off in the second half going into this tournament?  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Definitely the hot shooting from the first half. The first
half was a dream. The second half felt more of a nightmare but then it
finished with a dream. You're always going to remember the dream, not
nightmare.  
  
KENNY COOPER: The way we played the game was with a lot of joy and passion. We
played for each other in the first half, like we did in the second half. For
the most part, the fact that we won that first half really, really sticks.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: The first half was a great first half for us. Second half showed
our resiliency throughout the whole 20 minutes and showed we can get the job
done even with a lot of pressure.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I think the first half is what you remember for sure. You
got to use the second half to learn from it. Obviously North Carolina is
probably going to look at that film and see what they can do to speed us up
and press us. We need to learn from that as well.  
  
ELI PEPPER: I wish the first half stuck with me more, but the second half does
because it reminds me we're about this close not being able to sit right here
and be in this tournament.  
  
Q. Garrison, you mentioned the fast pace. How do you guys play against
the fast pace and how much of a challenge does that pose against a team like
North Carolina who likes to speed up the tempo?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It's going to be tough for sure. Obviously it's one of the
better teams in the nation. Kenny has done a great job all year of breaking
presses and stuff. It hurt us in the second half having him out. Buckland is
not a true point guard, but he's done a great job stepping into that role when
Kenny is out. It's hurt with us Nate. Those two guys are the key for us going
against a defense like that for sure.  
  
Q. I'm wondering what it's been like since you guys made the tournament,
reaction on campus, all of that, and then to get seeded against North
Carolina, do the emotions and all, I'm wondering if you can take me through
the whole week.  
ELI PEPPER: It's been incredible, the support of the campus, everybody is
coming up and saying things. It's a fun time but when you get seeded with
somebody like North Carolina, it's even better because we're here to win a
game and play the best first. That's the best case we can get.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Garrison.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It's been an amazing feeling being around campus with
everybody and celebrating with them. It's not just about us, it's about the
whole community. And obviously it's the first time, so it's been a great
feeling.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: Talking about community, Belmont, Vanderbilt, MTSU, they're not
in the tournament. TSU is not in the tournament. All eyes in Nashville are on
us. That's a great feeling to have that we're kind of the center of attention
right now. Obviously have Tennessee being a 3 seed, but locally in Nashville
we've got all the attention. So it's nice to have that and obviously the fans
of Lipscomb, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kenny.  
  
KENNY COOPER: Like Rob said, we have a ton of local guys. The City of
Nashville is behind us, and also Eli said we're going in here to win a game,
we're not just happy to be here, we're not dissatisfied with this, but we want
to make some noise.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Really put in perspective for me when we got back to campus
and there was 500-plus students waiting up for us at 11:00 at night in the
pouring rain. So, it really put in perspective how big of a deal it is, not
just for us but for the school and the community of Nashville and ultimately
we're representing our school.  
  
Q. We hear a lot about the 2-15 upsets, Gulf Coast beating Georgetown, a
team you guys beat, Lehigh and Duke. Is it something you talk about in the
locker room?  
ROB MARBERRY: It's something we always talk about. We're not here just to have
fun and shoot around with the UNC team. We always have it in the back of our
heads and always going to practice like we're going to win. That's what we're
going to come out and do.  
  
KENNY COOPER: It's good to have that in the back of our minds. It's very
doable. Like Rob said, again, we're not here to just for the experience or
just to play. We're here to compete and win a game.  
  
Q. Along those lines, in 2010 Lipscomb took North Carolina to the second
half, 59-56. You guys closed the gap by 3 points. Do you gain any confidence
from that? Has that come up at all, anybody?  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: That was a long time ago. A completely different team put
together right now. Two completely different teams. I don't think it has much
to do with tomorrow's game, but we'll take the confidence that we were there
then and we can be there now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Eli.  
  
ELI PEPPER: I think we take all of our confidence from this past season and
just winning the championships. That game that you just spoke of, it's not
going to gain us one point in this game we play, so we're going to take our
confidence from our past this season.  
  
Q. This can be for Eli, or if Michael wants to touch on it. It's Spring
Break this week and how nice is that not to have to worry about school and
kind of enjoy the moment and soak it all in?  
ELI PEPPER: This is the best spring break I could have ever asked for.  
  
THE MODERATOR: They're all enjoying their spring break.  
  
Q. You guys mentioned how Nashville is supporting you. Will the City of
Nashville show up, is there any fear of you going into what's essentially a
Carolina home game?  
KENNY COOPER: I think Lipscomb got a bunch of tickets, and they've all bought.
We're sold out of tickets, fan tickets. That's a sign to know that we'll have
a section cheering for us, rooting for us. We know like this will be
essentially a Carolina home game being so close to their campus, but we're
excited, we're really excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: It puts the odds more against us knowing there's going to be
a lot of Carolina Blue out there in the stands. At the same time, we're going
to have our people and the people that care about us most in the stands, and
that's what matters to me the most is that people that care about me and the
rest of the guys in the locker room are going to be out there cheering for us.
That's all we need.  
  
Q. You guys talked about upsetting North Carolina at the selection show.
Address to this Garrison, I guess. What's the strength you guys have? What's
something North Carolina is going to have to worry about against you guys?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I would say our 3-point shot. I don't think they defend very
well on the perimeter. That's going to be a huge key for us. Obviously pay a
huge amount of mind to Rob. When you have a post like him, they bring help
side and everything which opens up the outside. It's going to be tough to
guard the inside out for sure.  
  
Q. Michael, you're from High Point, right?  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Tell me about your recruiting process, how you ended up at Lipscomb
as opposed to any of the basketball schools in North Carolina?  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Throughout my whole recruiting process, I would have never
told you I'd leave more than three hours from home. I'm a big homebody guy.
Definitely grew up around here, wanting to go to school around here at one of
the big schools but ultimately what made the decision for me was the faith-
based community in Lipscomb. Not just with the school but with the basketball
program in general, and that had a big influence on where I ended up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Rob, can you talk about the matchup in the paint with Maye and some
of their bigs.  
ROB MARBERRY: Luke Maye, big player, really athletic. Going to be tough
keeping him off the glass and the offensive rebounds. Try to isolate him as
much as possible in that aspect and just try to stay consistent on offense and
stay in my rhythm ad get some shots up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? We have plenty of time. No one else.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask Garrison and Eli, just when you guys are playing at
your best, what distinguishes you from other teams?  
ELI PEPPER: I think when we're playing with a lot of speed and rhythm, that's
when we're at our best, got people firing on all cylinders. We struggle
sometimes when there's a press. Lot of people like to blame our second half on
Florida Gulf's press. Tell a lot of people that you don't beat a team that
good without putting two halves together. You look at the Oklahoma State game
with Florida Gulf Coast, they start press, Oklahoma state is up 15 and all of
a sudden down 4 points. They're a good team. We figured out a way to get that
done. We practiced on it all week and we're ready for it now, too.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I think what starts us off on the defensive end, we've shown
when we can get it down on defense, it fuels our offense and get out in
transition and push the ball. That's when we're at our best for sure.  
  
Q. For the panel, can you compare -- you guys played a strong non-
conference schedule but you also -- the conference had some good teams. Does
North Carolina remind you of anybody you've already played?  
THE MODERATOR: Kenny.  
  
KENNY COOPER: It's hard to put them in the category of one team, but I believe
they're going to beat Tennessee where they have a lot of good players, but if
we come to play, we can compete and that's our whole mindset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Going to be like all other high majors we played and they're
going to be more athletic, more skilled, more highly touted players than we
have but at the same time they have five guys on the court and we have five
guys on the court. If we out-execute them and play our game better than they
play their game, we'll have a shot to win at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Kenny, the video feature on you guys just came out. You guys are
eating pizza and playing Fortnite. Is that kind fun to show what life is like
off the court in the midst of all this craziness?  
KENNY COOPER: Puts perspective that we're still human, that we're still just
average students on campus but we just play basketball. It's kind of cool for
them to come video us just living our normal lives.  
  
Q. Are you relishing the role as kind of being underdoing against a team
like North Carolina coming in here? Lot of people say they're a powerhouse
program. You guys are kind of the underdog. Is that exciting to in that
role?  
ROB MARBERRY: When we played Gulf Coast in the Championship game, we were also
the underdogs. We take it and run with it, honestly. We can play with any
team, we can compete with any team. Having them as a powerhouse and having us
as the underdog really doesn't matter to us. We're going to practice all week
like we're going to beat them. We're going to play the 40 minutes like they
play the 40 minutes. All that talk before the game doesn't matter. We're going
to practice and win.  
  
KENNY COOPER: Kind of go into this game like we have nothing to lose but
everything to gain, you know. We can go out here and play hard, compete and
win a game, then that builds our culture at Lipscomb, builds a better
basketball program within itself and become more known. I'm just going into
this game trying to better the name of Lipscomb and get the name of Lipscomb
out there.  
  
Q. You guys are on a pretty solid win streak here to end the season.
Does that help give you guys any confidence going into the first tournament in
school history?  
THE MODERATOR: Eli.  
  
ELI PEPPER: It helps a ton. If you want to peak at anytime during the season
it's, right now. That helps us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Garrison.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It for sure does. North Carolina is not like any other team
we played in our conference. Big time school. If we want to compete with them,
we've got to bring our A game for sure.  
  
Q. Do you guys have any pregame rituals that you do before something of
this magnitude?  
ROB MARBERRY: Play a little Fortnite in the hotel. That's about it. Get a win
in Fortnite.  
  
Q. For any of the players, North Carolina doesn't start a big lineup but
they do play a lot of bigs. What does that matchup do for you guys as far as
their size?  
KENNY COOPER: All week we've been practicing on boxing out. They're one of the
best offensive rebounding teams in the country. So that will pose a little bit
of a problem for us. We just have to be willing to go get boards more than
usual. And I mean, they're a big team, but we're also a good rebounding team
as well. We've got Eli, Rob, Gary, Buck, they're all good rebounders. I didn't
include myself, but they're great rebounders. I have all the confidence in the
world that we can out-rebound if we have the will to go get the ball.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: They've got a huge lineup, 1 through 5, we'll play defense as a
unit. We'll be fine. We have Kenny and Buck on the backside, Gary on the
backside. So I think we'll be fine. I front the post and we've got backside
help from the paint. When Luke Maye gets it one-on-one, that will be my
hardest job to do. But if we isolate him and keep them off the boards, I think
we'll be fine throughout the 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Any of the players, did any of you watch the ACC final that Carolina
played in? Familiar with them at all from watching on TV?  
THE MODERATOR: Garrison.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I watched a little bit of it the overnight on ESPN. Coach
had mentioned in practice the other day that somebody that scouted them said
they're a lot faster in person than they are on film. That's obviously
something that's going to be huge for us to try to stop them in transition,
but I watched a little bit. Luke Maye is a great player and Barry. We need to
key in on them.  
  
ELI PEPPER: I didn't watch much of that game. We watched a ton of film on
them. They're a lot faster in person. But that coach also said they're a lot
more relentless in person than you thing. The first minute and a half we'll
have to try to shut it down in transition as much as we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? To our left.  
  
Q. Questions for Rob and Kenny. I think that people sort of from the
outside, you know, people who watch on TV, they take a look at a 15-2 game,
they don't see the two teams as being that close. How would you explain to
them that the gap between a North Carolina and a Lipscomb really isn't that
big.  
ROB MARBERRY: It's really not that big in the sense we've played Top 25 teams,
we played Tennessee and Purdue. We've competed with the best. We've prepared
all season for it, too. Even with preseason, we practiced like we're going to
play against UNC at the end of the season. We're ready for it. The 15-2 gap
you've seen throughout the years of Lehigh, Duke, obviously they're beatable.
I don't think people should look away from a 15 -- 2 upset.  
  
KENNY COOPER: Just a mindset thing. We're going into this game to win and our
playing styles are kind of similar we like to get out and run, they like to
get out and run. It's going to be a guns-a-blazing game. Whole bunch of fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.  
  
Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Casey, what more have you learned about North Carolina since we last
spoke, kind of validated what you already knew and then what else?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, I'll say our respect level continues to rise, not
that it wasn't already high, but, you know, I don't know if we've learned
anything new, but we've certainly fine-tuned some things, the intricacies sees
of how they work and why and so forth. Really good team. We knew that to start
with.  
  
Q. I look back at that 2010 game and Lipscomb cut it to 3 points late in
the second half. I know that didn't have anything to do with this team and
anything to do with you, you were across the boulevard at the time. Can some
confidence be gleaned from that? That was not a great Lipscomb team, it was a
great North Carolina team. I mean, this program is better now.  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I didn't even remember we played in 2010 and so we
haven't talked about that. I think our experience this year will help us, you
know, play four teams in the tournament, Alabama, Texas, Tennessee, Purdue,
all of which present different problems, all of which are really talented
teams. We'll use those experiences to help us here. We have talked about the
teams in our league that have had success, the Dunk City story that everybody
is well aware of. Mercer the following year was in our league when they beat
Duke in the first round. They were a 15 seed. We talked about those things.
Again we've drawn upon the experiences of this year more than anything. We
played Purdue, that was the last of those four games and it was a post-
Christmas game, maybe December 30th or something like that. I really felt like
we played well. The final margin was 30 or something, but I felt like we
played well for the first 25 or 30 minutes. And so we left the locker room
that day, my message to them was that is the team you're going to see in the
NCAA Tournament, not Purdue specifically, but a team like that in the NCAA
Tournament. And you need to know right now that when you walk on the floor,
you can compete and you can expect to win even though we know it will be very
difficult.  
  
Q. Coach, what matchup with Carolina concerns you the most individually
or area?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, we're concerned about all of them without a
doubt. The one that concerns the most probably is Maye inside, honestly. Barry
makes them go. There's no doubt about that, his experience and toughness, his
willingness to help them win. But Maye is a tough cover because of his ability
to play out on the floor and to use screens and to shoot it quickly and that's
a situation that even though our guys are undersized in the post, we're not
used to guarding in the post. So that would be the most specific thing that I
could give you as far as personnel goes. What I'm worried the most about is
just their relentlessness on that end of the floor. They totally know that
they're Carolina and totally know that Carolina plays a certain way and they
embrace that and really good at it.  
  
Q. Coach, what's all the extra media attention been like and how do you
balance that trying to get Lipscomb's name out there but obviously stay on
focused at the task in hand?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Nothing is more important than making sure our team is
ready. They know that. I'm kind of a no frills kind of guy anyway. Our
players, we've prepared for this game like every other game. We've even had
more time to do it. The media attention has been great for Lipscomb. That's
one of the benefits both short-term and long-term that playing in the NCAA
Tournament does for a school like ours, especially for the first time. You
know, we've been places that we've never been before as far as attention goes,
national exposure, CBS tomorrow, blue blood program like North Carolina.
That's an unbelievable experience for everything that is Lipscomb. The long-
term, the residuals may even be more important, how we can take this and use
it in recruiting, how we can continue to build our program, how we can make
this a somewhat frequent event for our program, as a coach is what I'm most
concerned about.  
  
Q. How daunting is the task just like taking on Carolina and what's
going to essentially be a home game?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: It's daunting because they're really good, you know.
They always are, and this is just to show up and play another game for them,
where it's not for us. This is a first time for us. We don't have a single
player in the locker room. Got a couple of coaches that coached in the NCAA
Tournament but no players. And so that's what's daunting. But out message to
them will be we get to the first media timeout, I promise you it will feel
like every other game you've ever played. Just recognize that, be ready to
kind of withstand those first few minutes, and then go with it.  
  
Q. Sort of to follow up on what your point was about once you're in a
game it feels like a game, is the first tournament as much about dealing with
all the stuff that comes before the game like the attention, the added
interview sessions, all those things that you have to manage moreso than the
idea of playing a game, these guys have done that a bunch of times.  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: For sure. That's the biggest difference. We don't have
anything like this anytime during the year, you know. So that's what's so
different and that's what we're having to kind learn on the go. But again, we
recognize how important this is. We recognize what this exposure means to the
Lipscomb community and so we embrace that, we celebrate it, have some fun with
it but at the same time the game what is we're here for and that's kind much
-- it's been important to keep that in perspective throughout the last couple
of weeks that everything has occurred because we've got a game to play
tomorrow afternoon against a really good team.  
  
Q. Coach, after the title game, do you talk more with the team about the
first half when you couldn't miss or the second half?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I don't even remember the second half. I tried to
forget that entirely. We played pretty flawless in the first half and pretty
terrible in the second half. We've got to learn from the mistakes we made and
so forth. What mattered the most on that day was that we win the game,
whatever form and fashion it came in, we needed to win the game so that we
could be here today, and we did that.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you guys are very high scoring team, 108 points in
your last game. In fact, almost 200 points total in that game. Are you taking
that as momentum into this game and are you planning on just going wide open
with hopes of scoring at the normal pace that you have been scoring?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Yes and yes and yes. You know, I anticipate that
Carolina is going to score plenty, so we better score enough to keep up with
them right, is the way I'm looking at it. That's really how we play. I'm not
good enough coach to change that now and try to do something different. If
we're going to have a chance to win the game, we have to be the best version
of ourselves that we can be. We can't show up here and be somebody that we
haven't been all season long and expect to play with North Carolina and give
ourselves a chance to win. That's what we'll do. It will be a fun know game to
watch from that perspective, I anticipate. But even then, you never know. We
may have trouble scoring, they may have trouble scoring. It may be a turnover
game. Coaches prepare to do it one way, but then that's what we get paid for,
you got to make adjustments as you go.  
  
Q. Coach, you seem to have a good perspective on a lot of things because
you played several teams that are in the tournament already. So I wonder if
you could talk about how much, if any, talent disparity there is between your
average 15 and 2 seeds, the type of players you recruit versus a North
Carolina and yet we see these upsets come fairly regularly.  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, there's undoubtedly talent disparity player by
player. We don't have a single player on our team that was even considered to
be a player for North Carolina and we didn't recruit a single player on their
team because we didn't think we would go very far. It's understandable that
there's a big difference. Sometimes you can look at this moment and you could
draw upon our experience or having a bunch of four-year guys or something like
that, but that's not the case here, either. They bring as much experience into
this game as anybody in the country, you know, starting two, three seniors and
two, three juniors and a lot of guys that have won national championships and
played a ton of post-season games. The key is what I tell our team, we're not
here to -- for Lipscomb to be better than North Carolina. I mean, we
understand the differences. We're not going to walk out of here with people
putting our programs in the same breath. We are where we are for a reason. We
understand that.  
  
The key -- we have to be better than them for 40 minutes one time, that's it.
One time for 40 minutes. That's how we'll approach it.  
  
Q. Coach, similarly to the previous question I asked your players about
the 2-15 upsets, Gulf Coast over Georgetown, Lehigh over Duke, and he spoke
very confidently about them not just coming here to practice against North
Carolina or them just coming here to shoot around with North Carolina. Do you
talk about those upsets, and what do you guys think -- what do you think your
players get that confidence from as younger guys?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I don't know if it's so much confidence. It's probably
them just regurgitating to you what I've told them more than anything,
thankfully. We make no mistake, it's going to be really tough. We're going to
have to play great for it to happen. But you have to draw upon the experiences
of others and understand that the game can be won, and we didn't come here
just to show up, you know. We want to play our best game tomorrow. Win or
lose, we want to play our best game tomorrow. We want to make sure we play
with incredible effort, togetherness tomorrow. We have one chance to play this
game. That's really been the message all along and I do believe with great
performance, great execution, a couple of bounces that go our way, that we can
be in the game. I'm not going to sit up here and tell you we're going to win
the game. That's the reason we came over here was to win the game, and we've
seen that it's happened other places. I sat on a bench at a 15-1 game myself a
few years ago, Belmont, Duke, we were one possession away from winning that
game. I personally withdraw upon that experience.  
  
Q. You mentioned how just being in the tournament, like what the has
done for your team. What do you want people to know about Lipscomb going into
the game about your team, about your players?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I think people will see real quickly how much our team
loves each other, plays well together, embraces each other, plays for each
other. Those are the things that every coach wants to say, and it's the best
way to win. There are a lot of ways to win. Different styles, different kinds
of players, different philosophies. Ours is to go get a bunch of like-minded
guys who love playing at Lipscomb, would have considered going to school at
Lipscomb anyway even if they weren't playing basketball, bunch of guys that
would have gone to college anyway, would have graduated from college anyway,
that come from great families, great programs, put all that together and you
got the mix of a pretty good team. That's what I want people to see and I
think that they will.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 69, Florida - 66  
  
MIKE WHITE: Obviously really competitive game, high-level basketball game. I
thought congrats to Texas Tech. They're a terrific team. They made big plays.
They made the plays down the stretch, of course, and got the defensive stop
when they needed one.  
  
Coach Beard and his staff and his team have had a great year, and we wish them
luck moving forward.  
  
I thought Keenan Evans was terrific. They got downhill a bunch. They cut
really well. They drove it well, of course, defended at a high level. They
really defended us from the three at a high level. Zhaire Smith I thought was
terrific with 18, 9 and 7 assists to one turnover. I thought he was really,
really good.  
  
I thought they hit timely shots, especially in the first half, late shot clock
shots, and hit a couple there in the second half, as well. I know Evans hit a
huge contested three by, I think Chris was on him late, opposite their bench,
was a huge shot.  
  
Tough deal for us. I thought we played well enough to have a chance. I've said
this a bunch to our local media over the past couple weeks: I've been really
proud of the way this team has evolved and developed and how we finished the
season beating Auburn, winning at Alabama, beating Kentucky. I thought we got
a little bit out of character in the SEC tournament, and then we turned right
back around, and I thought in this tournament, we were really good the other
night. And I thought we were pretty good tonight and just got beat by a team
who's probably just a little bit better, at least they were tonight.  
  
That said, this is a very tough night for myself and my staff as we lose these
two guys to my left, who have meant a lot to this program, to this team, but
more importantly to this program, two guys who are terrific players and better
people, two of the toughest guys in college basketball.  
  
If all 13 of my guys were as tough as these two, we'd still be playing. Some
of those young guys are going to continue to develop, but these guys pound for
pound are absolute warriors. They've given us every ounce of energy and focus
and work ethic that we could possibly ask for.  
  
I'm sad for these two guys that they don't have another opportunity, but I'm
really proud of them, and the year that Egor had and the career that Chris
Chiozza had.  
  
Q. Chris, just how difficult is it to kind of end your career in this
fashion, with a chance to tie it, last second shot at the end of the game?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It's tough to go out that way. I don't think it's hit me fully
yet. As soon as the buzzer sounded, I felt it a little bit, but so far I don't
think it's hit me fully yet that my college career is over.  
  
But we've had some games like this where we would have made that shot, a
couple times where we had a couple big shots earlier in the season and stuff
like that, and we just couldn't get this one to go down. We had two chances.
But that's the way the game goes sometimes. We got what we wanted, and we just
didn't make it.  
  
Q. Chris, what was the defensive game plan to try to stop or slow down
Keenan Evans tonight?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Just not let him get any easy looks early. He had some tough
shots. A couple guys hit a couple tough shots late in the clock. I felt like
we did a good job of defending them. But he's a good player, so he's going to
get his points. We just tried to limit the damage he could do.  
  
Q. Egor, tell me about the look that you had at the end of the game, and
also what you saw in the scramble situation and the look that KeVaughn had, as
well?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah. We pressed. We got the turnover we needed, was kind of
ready to shoot there in the corner. I bobbled the ball a little bit, and then
I saw the guy kind of fell down or kind of trip. That threw me off. It was a
good look. I had a good look earlier, too, with the shot clock winding down.
You know, it's tough. It's tough.  
  
Sometimes you hit those shots. I didn't come through for my team today, but
you know, just how it is sometimes. Earlier in the year, we hit some big-time
ones, and we just couldn't come through today.  
  
Q. Egor, obviously this was your only season at Florida, but can you
talk a little bit about how much it meant to you and what your feelings are,
obviously emotional as you are, as it comes to an end tonight?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah, sure. Like Chris, I don't think it's like fully hit me
yet that this is over. I mean, it's sad. It's really sad because the whole
year we've been -- we've grew so much throughout the year as a team, as
people.  
  
It's been a lot of fun being around this program, just around the coaching
staff and players, I mean, the managers, everybody who works for the
University of Florida. It's been a blessing for me because when I made my
decision, I said I'm not going to look back and just go with it, and I'm just
-- I couldn't be happier that I came to the University of Florida, even if
it's for one year.  
  
Q. Chris, I know it's a little sudden question for you, but how do you
reflect on your career at Florida and everything you managed to accomplish?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It was a fun ride. It was wild. I had a lot of ups and downs.
You know, but I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. I'm glad that I chose
to come here and stay here with the coaching change, and it's probably the
best decision I made in my whole life, just sticking through that process and
just staying with my team and just forming a brotherhood and gaining new
family members.  
  
It's just something I'm never going to forget. It didn't end the way I wanted
it, but I'm not going to look back and say I didn't have any regrets. I played
as hard as I could, and we just came up a little short today.  
  
Q. Mike, Evans was obviously a huge factor in this stretch. Was there
anything you felt like you could have done differently with regards to some of
his play making and what he was able to do down the stretch?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, they do such a good job with their random movement, with
their motion. I don't know what Chris calls it. We consider it a freelance
passing game motion type offense. We call it motion, à la Arkansas. They
really move it well. The ball changes from side to side, of course. Screens
are so random, players and pin-downs and away screens and cross screens and
back screens. And when we moved with the basketball, when we loaded to the
basketball, all five guys, one guy being on Evans, the other four moving to
the basketball, we did a decent job.  
  
We had some breakdown with all of that ball movement at times where we have a
guy or two, whether he got out of his stance or not, he didn't move to the
ball. We didn't load to Keenan Evans a couple times when we needed that, at
least a couple times. He got to the rim too much, of course.  
  
We got straight line driven, just one-on-one, just Keenan Evans versus a
defender, like he's at the park one-on-one, he's at the rim. That can't happen
to get to the Sweet 16. That said, it's very difficult to contain him. He's
big. He's strong. He's physical. And he's got a really explosive first step.
It reminds me of Jalen in person. I didn't know he was quite that explosive.  
  
I thought we did a good job of going under ball screens when we switched to
zone, doing a better job of, again, just keeping him out of the paint. And
again, all that said, he goes three of four from three, as well, so he hurt us
from everywhere.  
  
Q. A lot of people will say that your team lives and dies by the three,
but it seemed more with Chris Chiozza out after he picked up his fourth foul.
Would you say it's more accurate your team lives and dies by Chris's play?  
MIKE WHITE: At times. We've been effective with him out of the game a few
times, of course. Obviously with Chris in the game, we are better both
offensively and defensively. He's our best defender, recognized by getting
that award, deservedly so. Offensively, he's arguably the best passer in
college basketball.  
  
I don't know if he stacked up with all those numbers, but taking care of the
basketball, getting guys shots, we weren't the best shooting team, the best
scoring team. Otherwise his numbers would have been inflated even more. But we
do play through him. When he's out of the game, we have a tendency to call
more stuff. We're a little bit less freelance. And so yeah, at times we have
been stagnant with him out of the game. We're going to miss him dearly, of
course.  
  
Q. You had a time-out left, but the floor was scrambled. Did you like
how it looked at the end there?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, you know, I'm going back and forth in my mind, of course, do
we call one, do we call one. They're terrific defensively, and we had a good
offensive lineup out there. The ball is in Chris Chiozza's hands with the
floor spread, and I'm not sure we would have drawn up anything better in a
couple looks we got.  
  
I'm pleased with those looks, of course. Chris got to the rim. I thought Keith
Stone made a great decision when he got -- he got a tough rebound and hit
KeVaughn, and just unfortunate they didn't go for us. But you know how it is.
If we had made a few earlier in the game or gotten a couple stops or kept
Keenan Evans out of the paint or bum rushed him, late clock, you know, when we
allowed him to get a couple of those threes off, and we're up five right
there, we don't need those shots to go. So we were in a position. We had to
hit a huge one, and they got a stop when they needed one.  
  
Q. Zone defense was really effective at the point --  
MIKE WHITE: The first time all year. How about that?  
  
Q. You had to use it because of the foul situation, right?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, fouls and just the flow of the game. We were afraid that it
was going to get away from us. They were scoring at a high clip. It was a
tough decision. I'm glad we went with it. It obviously gave us a chance.  
  
We've worked on it all year, and we've thrown it out there at times for
whatever reason, probably because it's very average. We've gotten torched with
it. Tonight it was pretty good. It was good for us. I thought that we
communicated pretty well. Our attention to detail was decent. We struggled to
rebound out of it, of course. They got a big offensive rebound, extra
possession versus it, if memory serves correct. But I thought our guys made a
pretty good adjustment.  
  
Q. Coach Beard said he wanted to keep this game in the 60s and limit the
pace. Did you want to play it in the 70s or 80s or even higher, and if so, how
did Texas Tech slow the game down or keep you in a lower scoring game?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, first off, we always -- we want to play in the 80s, but we
want our opponent in the 50s. Every team, every coach wants that. If you've
got to choose a ton of possessions versus very little possessions, we'd rather
more, but we've also fallen into a trap because we've been so prolific at
times in transition offense and inefficient in transition defense where we've
been taken advantage of in terms of falling into a trap of shooting it quick
and having teams grind us out defensively.  
  
Four or five games this year, the time of possession for us, kind of like a
football game, was very, very lopsided. It's hard to make shots when you play
three fourths of the game on defense. So we've had to evolve as a team. I
don't know if you saw us earlier in the year, but when we were playing with
teams that wanted to run with us or teams that -- you say whether it had to do
with us or not, teams that were playing really fast, our guys liked that, and
we were pretty good with it. And then we ran into some teams that were making
us defend for most of the game and weren't really as effective.  
  
Getting back to your second question, how did they do that, I think that -- I
think Chris has got a disciplined team first off. I thought their transition
defense was good. I thought their floor balance was good. They're really,
really fast. They're as fast as I've seen this year at changing ends, both
offensively and defensively. And then I thought they grinded us out.  
  
You can hear them over there demanding some passes and some movement, and they
-- a part of our 6 of 22 from three is probably having to do with the fact
that we're in a stance and we're negotiating screens and playing long
stretches on defense, and I thought they did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Just how difficult was it navigating the foul trouble? You had Jalen
with three fouls, had to sit him for about five minutes in the second half,
and Chris, bringing him in and out, and how much did you wrestle with bringing
either back sooner?  
MIKE WHITE: A bunch. The whole second half, it was just probably the biggest
topic of conversation amongst the staff, whether we were in time-outs or not,
when do we get this guy back in, what's your gut feeling, what do we do
without Chris on the floor, when do we go back with Jalen.  
  
Some of that had to do with the decision to go zone, too. We threw it at the
wall and it happened to work, and we considered another zone that we've dinked
with a little bit. But yeah, it's no fun dealing with foul trouble, of course,
but we've put ourselves in that situation. Overall, I don't think it was a
huge factor. I think Texas Tech was just good, and I thought the environment
was great, so hats off to their crowd and the way that they brought it. It was
a great college basketball environment.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola - 63, Tennessee - 62  
  
PORTER MOSER: I first want to say all glory and thankfulness goes to God. He's
been so good to this group, me, this University, and the glory goes to him,
first and foremost.  
  
Second, just it's amazing when you have a group of people who believe. I mean,
just this group is resilient. They believe. We've come back from deficits.
We've lost leads and found ways to win games. You know, they just kept
believing, and then -- this group has been ultra resilient, and I'm blessed to
coach them, and I just thank Clay, thank you, it was a great shot. I'll leave
it at that.  
  
Q. Clayton, can you just describe what you saw on that shot and what you
were thinking as the ball bounces up off the rim? Probably seemed like it took
a while to get back to the rim.  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, Coach put me in a position to make a play at the end,
and I'm very appreciative of that. I mean, the only thing I can say is glory
to God for that one. I mean, the ball bounced up on the rim, and I got a good
bounce like that. But the only thing I could think about after the game is
that that's all the hard work that I put -- like that you put in to get in a
situation like this, and all those hours, those waking up early in the morning
and working out. For all that hard work to come up to that lucky bounce is
worth it, and I think all the hard work, the basketball gods helped that one
go in, and I'm just super blessed to be in this situation right now.  
  
Q. Aundre and Ben, what does this win mean for your team, advancing to
the Sweet 16, for your team and your school as a whole?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It just means our season is not over. We reach no finish line.
We just took another step in getting where we want to get, so we're going to
go back and get ready for the next game.  
  
BEN RICHARDSON: I would say the same thing. It's great to get some exposure
for our school and our fans. And on the national stage, we know there's so
many loyal fans that have come up to us, that have been fans since '63, the
National Championship team, and they're so proud of us, and it just means the
world to us to bring that pride back to this program.  
  
You know, it's just a tribute to all these guys, all the guys in the locker
room, Coach, and all the administrators that have supported us. Like Dre said,
this is just another step, and we're planning to advance, and we want to win
every game we're in.  
  
Q. Clayton, what was discussed during that time-out with ten seconds
left? What was the plan or the play?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, it was just we ran like a safety to get it into me,
and then Krutwig, I was going to kind of dribble over to the left kind of, and
then Krutwig was going to come up and act like he was going to set a screen
and then drop it and kind of just let me go like with my right hand, went
towards my right hand, kind of felt that -- kind of got him going fast so he
wasn't going to be able to contest my shot when I shot it, and just elevated
and shot it, and I got a good bounce.  
  
PORTER MOSER: We've still got another game. You can go left.  
  
Q. Ben, what's it like watching your best friend since the third grade
hit that shot to go to the Sweet 16?  
BEN RICHARDSON: You know, like he was talking about earlier, I've seen him
make one, two dribble, one-two pull-up probably a million times. And I have so
much faith in that shot just because I've seen him make it -- like when we're
just working out and stuff, he makes it like a 98 percent clip.  
  
So before games, I'm always just like, get to that one-two pull-up, get to
that one-two pull-up. We try to tell him because it is such a high-percentage
shot for him. He knocks it down so much. It is fitting that he hits a big shot
going one-two pull-up like we've been doing in the gym for our whole lives
working on that shot. I'm so happy for him in this moment. It's something I'll
never forget.  
  
Q. You guys have talked about the idea of every game could be a
different guy, and it seems like it's coming true. Like these last two games,
it's been a different hero at the end. What does that say about your team just
the other night it's Donte hitting the big shot, and tonight it's you?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I think that that just speaks to the culture in our program.
We don't care about -- some nights some people get more shots than other
nights. There's some nights where Dre might only shoot four or five shots, and
I might shoot 12. And there's some nights where Dre will find himself open
more than I find myself open, so he shoots the ball 12 times and I shoot the
ball five times, and we don't care how many shots we are going to get on any
given night.  
  
The ball is going to find you if you're open, and we trust -- we have so many
weapons that we trust that people are going to make plays. I mean, yesterday
-- a couple days ago Donte hit the shot and today I hit the shot, but anybody
on our team could make a big shot down the stretch. I think it just speaks to
the culture that we have in our program.  
  
Q. Aundre, what does it mean to you to have this moment back here in DFW
with friends and family, get to share it with them?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It's just an amazing feeling. I spotted out all my friends and
family out in the crowd. And once I had a good game and then once we won the
game, I went up to them, and it was just crazy. It was an unbelievable
feeling.  
  
Q. No offense, but when you guys take the court, you're not the most
imposing-looking team. Does that sort of play to your advantage in some ways?
Do you exploit that in some ways? Does that work to your advantage in some
ways?  
BEN RICHARDSON: We're not scary looking?  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: We don't scare you? I think we're pretty scary.  
  
BEN RICHARDSON: I mean, you know, it's no secret we're not the biggest team,
but Coach teaches and he's been preaching since I got here just principles and
culture and things that you can reference on every little part of a
possession.  
  
I mean, before the game, Coach was always saying, he was preaching before the
game, it's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in
the dog. I know that's cliché, but that's something we've really embraced, and
we've embraced every part of our culture well this year, and that's why we've
gotten to where we are because you don't need to be the biggest guy when
you're guarding the  
  
SEC Player of the Year down there. You just have to fight harder, and you've
got to have help from the rest of your team.  
  
It takes five guys out there, and we've been connected very well this year,
and I think that's why we've been able to compete and rebound and get stops
because it's been five guys connected and linked together.  
  
And then we just executed and kind of bought into the culture that Coach has
been preaching all year, wall of culture. We've bought into all that stuff.  
  
Q. Coach, when are you going to shed this image of the underdog, and do
you think Vegas is going to make you the favorite the next four days?  
PORTER MOSER: You know what, can't talk about Vegas up here, but I say it
every press conference, listen to these guys. How unbelievable. You heard
Donte the other day say anybody can make it. You saw how genuinely happy Ben
was for Clay making that shot.  
  
I mean, it's amazing what you can do when you get a group of people believing
and that are really tight. I said that since day one. I've said it for years
now. The guys -- we have a close-knit culture, and the guys in the locker room
pull for each other. They share the ball. It's just amazing. They really -- we
all, we really believe.  
  
Q. A lot of times after a big win like you had on Thursday, teams have a
letdown and they come out flat the next game. What did you do to keep that
from happening today?  
PORTER MOSER: Well, we came out struggling on defense. I think they had 15
points in the first five minutes. And we called a time-out, and then they had
ten points the last 15 minutes of the half.  
  
I think one of the things we talk about, we've been doing it now for about a
month or two, is that we knew we were having to win and win the conference and
then get to the conference tournament, and it's been this mentality of you
win, enjoy the moment.  
  
I've been asked a million times, are you letting the guys enjoy it. I'm like,
heck yeah, I'm letting them enjoy it because it's a mature, close group. And I
want them to enjoy it. Then the next day, we all say put it in the bank, next
one up. You heard one of them reference it right there.  
  
These guys after we beat Miami, it was great. We had a great meal just our
team at the hotel. It was just really a special team meal, and then they had
some rest, and the coaches went to work. And we talked a little bit before
they went to bed. The next day, it was completely locked in, the film
sessions, the walk-through in the ball rooms. We came here and shot.  
  
They had put it behind you, and it's a credit to everyone in the locker room.
They enjoyed it, and then they moved on. And we're going to enjoy this. I
guarantee you we're enjoying this. I hope the people in Chicago -- I can't
imagine St. Patty's Day in Chicago because Chicago has embraced this team so
much, and to embrace this in Chicago on St. Patty's Day, wow, my younger self
would have loved to have been there. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Admiral Schofield scored 11 points in the first five minutes and then
three the rest of the game. What was the plan to slow him down?  
PORTER MOSER: Well, I think he said I'm an Illinois guy, I'm going to give it
to them right out of the gate. Wow, he was hot. We had to regroup. I called a
time-out. And it just shows the culture of these guys. Trust is a big thing,
and I always say that.  
  
I remember working for Coach Majerus, Coach Barone. You can get on kids if
they know they love you. That's a big thing in today's society. If they know
you care and that you love them, you can get on them. I got on them as hard as
I've gotten on them in a month at that first time-out when they scored 15
points. And they just, I got it. I mean, they knew. We turned it, the way they
responded in the next 15 minutes.  
  
But Schofield is -- he is a terrific player. He's a terrific competitor. He is
a terrific competitor. He's hard to guard because he can shoot the three. He
can rise above you. And he can get you on the block. He is a very hard match-
up.  
  
Q. Porter, offensively it seemed as if the ball movement was working,
ball fakes were effective. Was that an extra point of emphasis tonight against
a more athletic team, or is that the way things always go when things are
clicking?  
PORTER MOSER: Well, they're so athletic, and I know they run people off the
line. They're trying to get you to make the extra pass, extra pass, and they
cover so much ground. We kind of talked about it. That's what we've been doing
all year is making the extra pass and not just settling when they -- because
they really cover some ground with their length and athleticism, and they run
you off the line. They run you off that line. And we talked about not
settling, shot faking, going downhill, change it, change it, and that fits
into what we have been doing all year. I thought we really were moving the
ball once we got settled in after that first five minutes.  
  
Q. You've mentioned that time-out a couple of times. Right after that,
you insert Aundre into the lineup and he gets two great baskets and an assist
fueling a 6-0 run himself.  
PORTER MOSER: Aundre is one of the most selfless young men. Here he is, he was
sixth man of the year. Last year, he was averaging over 30-some minutes a
game. And we have a different look. We've got a freshman who's terrific, Cam
Krutwig, and they've been back and forth, different games, different nights.
But it gives us a different look.  
  
You come in with Krutwig, who is this true, big center, and then you come in
and we're small, but Dre is a mismatch guy. He's quick. He's a different look.
And that's been something -- he's really efficient. Again tonight, he had 16
points on seven shots. I said it up here the other night or one of the press
conferences people asked me about Aundre, and I said, I love guys that are
efficient. That translates from junior college to here, 16 points on seven
shots.  
  
I hugged him so hard on the floor. I said, man, hometown, going to the Sweet
16, family and friends here. God is good. And he just said, absolutely, and
just hugged me. I was really happy for him because we've trying to get him
back in Texas scheduling games, and for him to get a game back in Texas, two
like this and to do this, special for him.  
  
Q. What kind of shape was the program in when you took over, and how did
you manage to get it here?  
PORTER MOSER: It was tough. It was tough. I mean, you know, it's been a grass-
roots rebuild. Everything from a couple hundred people at games to during
games you could walk through -- I remember my family members said they would
walk through the student union, and there were more people in the student
union than in the arena.  
  
It was at the bottom of the Horizon League, which is a good league, and then
we moved to the Missouri Valley, and it just -- it's been a grass-roots
rebuild. And I'm blessed, so blessed that Loyola University, the
administrators, the fan bases, they were steadfast on how I was saying I was
going to do it with good kids, good people. We weren't going to bend on the
academic reputation.  
  
All our kids graduate. We've got high-character kids, and it was a credit to
them. And in this day and age -- because I know fan bases all over want it so
fast, they want it so fast. And it's hard. It's hard to have a rebuild because
you've got to get your kids in there that you recruit. And you're not going to
hit on the first recruiting class. Everyone was like, well, the second year
they'd better win. Well, the first recruiting class is freshman.  
  
So it takes time to get those kids where your recruiting class comes in, and
the older kids are like, this is how our culture is. And I'm blessed that the
University was -- had the same vision, and this is the vision. I said it so
many different places I spoke. I go, can you imagine getting to the NCAA
Tournament, advancing, can you imagine our University, Chicago, and I'm from
the Chicago area, and I just kept on pounding that vision.  
  
And I've had a great coaching staff. My coaching staff is an extension of
everything we're doing, and it isn't just one person. It isn't just me. It is
an absolute wide stretch of people at Loyola that has had that vision to do it
the right way with a good foundation of great kids, great student-athletes.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 69, Florida - 66  
  
CHRIS BEARD: I want to congratulate Florida on another great season. A lot of
respect for their team. Their coach at Louisiana Tech when I was at Little
Rock, I kind of looked up to guys like that who have won wherever they've been
and always got an opportunity. So he's been somebody I've always respected.
And then to compete against him tonight, it was as good as advertised.  
  
Definitely one of the toughest offensive teams we played against all year.
They had us so spread out. We were forced to kind of go small ball. Two of our
better players, Norense and Tommy, just kind of made a coaching decision. And
when you make those decisions, you hope and pray it works out because regret
is pretty tough to handle.  
  
It went our way tonight, a little bit of destiny out there. And Florida got
three great looks. We were just really, really fortunate.  
  
I think you've got to give our guys a lot of credit. We held them under 70
points. We had three guys in double figures. We had a lot of balance. Our two
young guys, Culver and Z, were big-time tonight, especially rebounding the
ball when we were forced to go small ball. So just really pleased to coach
these guys and to advance.  
  
We look at this kind of like a four-team tournament. We knew we had to win two
games to get to the regional, so now we've got a chance at another four-team
tournament to ultimately get to the biggest stage. But again, a lot of respect
to Florida, congratulations to them on a great season. And I'm really proud of
our guys for advancing.  
  
Q. I want to ask I guess Keenan, the fact that y'all have made this
journey together, y'all came in at the same time, new coaching staff, just
your feeling to be going to the Sweet 16 now.  
KEENAN EVANS: It's amazing. I feel like words can't really describe this
journey with these guys. And Coach Beard came in and said he was going to win.
And after last season, it was a disappointment, he told us we were going to
get to this tournament next year. We were going to make a run, and he kept his
word, and here we are.  
  
Q. Keenan, you've talked before about how every night is senior night.
How does that motivate you late in games?  
KEENAN EVANS: It's everything. As that clock runs down, kind of look at it
like, man, I don't want my season to be over. And these guys are the same way,
so we're just taking it into account that it's senior night.  
  
Q. Zach, late in the game you got matched up with one of your guards who
kind of had you on the perimeter, but you were able to get that block. Can you
take us through that play?  
ZACH SMITH: We were switching the whole game trying to stay in front, and I
knew I couldn't give up a three. And when he drove, just tried to make a play
on the ball, and I was able to make the play.  
  
Q. Keenan, I wonder if you can explain what happened on the alley-oop in
the last minute, how it got set up.  
KEENAN EVANS: Coach drew up a pick-and-roll play for me. Zach came out. The
guy kind of came out too hard, and I saw an opening, so I kind of split it.
And Zhaire, Coach told him to be waiting right there. I was hoping he would
make a 360 dunk again, but that didn't work out. I saw him right there, and I
threw it up, and he went up and finished it.  
  
Q. Keenan, besides yourself, Zhaire really seemed to take over the game
at times. What in the heck is this guy's upside as just a freshman?  
KEENAN EVANS: Man, it's -- he has no ceiling. Even after the season when he
works and he works even this week, he's going to be putting in more work, and
he's one of the most hardworking guys, and it's just shown all season.  
  
Q. Justin, Florida comes out and scores 23 in the first ten minutes, and
then in the second ten minutes, you hold them to only ten points. What changed
there?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Just being the more aggressive and disciplined team. That's what
Coach Beard preaches to us. Just making plays on defense and making them make
tough shots. If they make tough shots, then we'll live with it. But trying to
take away those easy shots, open threes, transition threes. I feel like we did
a great job with that.  
  
Q. Keenan and Justin, on a scale of 1 to 10, where was Coach Beard's
intensity tonight?  
KEENAN EVANS: Like any other game, he's one of the most energized people in
life. He told us y'all do y'all thing, and I'll get the crowd ready. And
that's exactly what he did. Every time we scored, you saw him on the sideline
going like this and getting the crowd into the game. So definitely thank you
to all of our fans for being there and supporting us because they were a big
help.  
  
JUSTIN GRAY: Yeah, just like Keenan said, his intensity is always great at
every game. He gets us going, and I think the most impressive thing he's doing
all that on still a torn ACL. I don't know how he does that, but it's
impressive to me.  
  
Q. Norense, y'all come out and go on an 8 and 2 run, and I think that
was the most excited I've ever seen Coach Beard. How was that feeling to get
the lead coming into the second half?  
NORENSE ODIASE: You always want to start off fast. When we took the lead like
that, it was special. They got it back, but we know it's a game of runs, so we
just stayed the course, and it ended up working out for us.  
  
Q. Keenan, your knack for hitting big shots in big moments, how has that
developed over time?  
KEENAN EVANS: Just my teammates and coaching instilling confidence in me to
take and make those big shots. Just putting in the work and staying confident
in it and knowing my team needs me to do that.  
  
Q. Justin, there were so many fouls in the second half. It was a very
clean first half. Then it seemed like there was a foul every possession. Did
that upset anybody's rhythm or getting in and out of your offense? It just
seemed like there were so many whistles?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Not really. You're talking about on the offensive end for us? We
were trying to be aggressive. We knew we were in double bonus early, so we
tried to make that statement in the time-outs to tell everybody get
aggressive, drive. We made a lot of great drives. And once they collapsed, we
pitched it to an open cutter or an open person on the perimeter. There was a
lot of things that went into it, but it didn't really disrupt us at all.  
  
Q. Keenan, Coach described getting to coach y'all seniors in the day
like getting the best enchiladas is the best feeling in the world. How does it
feel like getting another few practices with Coach?  
KEENAN EVANS: These four years flown by. Once you get to this point, it's just
like, man, I'm not ready for it to end. And here we are getting another week
to prepare and play the game we love.  
  
Q. Keenan, I know Texas Tech as a three seed is hardly a Cinderella, but
first Sweet 16 in 13 years. So what do you think the impact is on this program
moving forward?  
KEENAN EVANS: I think it's a great impact. It sets the path for many, many
more years. And with Coach Beard being here and his staff, just that sets up
success in the near future.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how important it is to get a game so
close to campus, being in Dallas?  
NORENSE ODIASE: It's special. We all have family from out here. Most of us are
from this area. It was special. It was like a home game for us, so that
definitely helped us tonight, and we used it to our advantage.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: My middle daughter Ella is the one that did it, too. She knows I
only have like two suits. It's one thing if it's like in the celebration, no
problem, but literally she just came over to me and dumped it. I'll talk to
her later about that.  
  
Q. Is this like a double patty, double cheese night?  
CHRIS BEARD: Man, are we going to keep going with this, guys?  
  
Q. How does this -- is this a program-altering win and what you're doing
at Tech in your second year?  
CHRIS BEARD: I don't think so. I understand, I respect the question, but we've
got a great University. And we've got big-time facilities. And we've got the
best fans in college basketball in my opinion.  
  
We're playing in one of the best conferences. This is what we should be doing.
A good season should be a good seed and making a run. Every year should be
NCAA Tournament.  
  
A lot of work went into this, but we're just getting started. I told the guys
before this ever started last Sunday, I guess it was, after the selection
show, I was like, look, there's 68 teams in the tournament. A lot of the teams
will just show up to be a part of it, and it'll overwhelm them. A select few,
the Kansases, the Michigan States, the Dukes, the Carolinas, these type people
will go to win the tournament.  
  
I was like, let's be one of those. Whether we're going to win it or not, a lot
of things have to happen, but let's be a team that embraces trying to win it.
We're not here just to have a good time. We're here to advance. So this was a
four-team tournament for us, two games, played against two really good teams,
so now we've got to get better and try to do the same thing next weekend.  
  
Q. When you guys played Koulechov when he was with Rice last year, he
dropped 25 on you, he had just 12 tonight. Can you talk about how well you
guys played with your perimeter defense tonight?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, number one, we were really fortunate. Basketball in a lot
of ways is a game of making shots. And all this stuff goes into it, the hours,
the work, but at the end of the day, also sometimes you just get fortunate.  
  
I thought he played great, and he got some good looks on us. The ball just
didn't go in for him. But I think you've got to give our guys credit because
we challenged shots. I think we spun them up a little bit and got aggressive.
That would be up to their coach to talk about, but we knew if this game got in
the 80s, no chance, start the bus. I guess at this level, start the jet.  
  
So we wanted to control the game with our offense, tempo-wise. So with the
game in the 60s and even at halftime, even though we were down one point, we
felt comfortable with the pace. We weren't going to beat Florida in the 80s or
90s, but we could play with them at this tempo game.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about the commitment you made to your
players that you were going to get the crowd ready. And two, I just look at
the tape of you tearing your ACL. What were you thinking and how has it
impacted you since then?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I'm not good at these double questions, man. I've got like
ADD. The last one was about the ACL. That's just embarrassing, set a flair
screen in practice the night before Iowa State. Then I had it all wrapped up
during the game and told myself I was just going to fake it, and then we had a
play, me and Niem Stevenson disagreed on something that was going on on the
court and I lost my mind. So it was really embarrassing. But I always want to
thank the people from Iowa because they didn't make that deal about it, great
basketball people in Iowa.  
  
What was the first part of the question?  
  
Q. Your players said you made a commitment to getting the crowd ready.
What did you do to make that happen?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I mean, way out of my comfort zone, really I'd much prefer
to sit there like a Coach Self or Coach Smith or Coach K, but ultimately I
think the job of any coach, if it was just a one-sentence answer in the
dictionary, you do everything you can to help your players win, win in life,
win on the court and off.  
  
So tonight I felt like we worked so hard to get this seed and play in Dallas,
so I got a little out of my comfort zone and kind of turned cheerleader a
little bit. But I want to thank everybody for responding. I know I must have
looked like an idiot a lot doing that, but anything to help our guys. I would
do anything to help our team, so maybe tonight in some small way, I helped get
the crowd going. I'll take it.  
  
Q. Midway through the second half when Chiozza picked up his fourth
foul, putting you in the double bonus, how did you take advantage of that
throughout the rest of the game?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, that was a part of our game plan. We always try to attack
the other team's best players. To me, he's the driver of their machine. He's a
special point guard. His speed is unmatched. We've seen a couple guys in the
Big 12 that parallel that, but nobody quicker. And he's a great passer, and
he's unselfish, and he can hit big shots, too.  
  
We made an emphasis to try to attack him on offense. Shot selection is one of
our core values and principles, but I told the guys tonight, you've got a
chance to be aggressive on their best players and maybe kind of will a shot up
there. I won't get on you like normal.  
  
But then I said, well, if I do, just remind me I said that. But no, we were
fortunate tonight that we got him in foul trouble and was able to play five or
six minutes without him on the floor. It just helped us because, simply
stated, he's one of their best players.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said that you were approaching this game as you had to
play your best game in order to get the win. Do you feel like mission
accomplished in that regard?  
CHRIS BEARD: In some ways, yes. I think they were superior to this game. I
just thought my naked eye 40-minute, we probably played 22-23 minutes as well
as we can play. Offensively, especially in the second half, we got the motion
going pretty good. We were getting back cuts and lay-ups. We were getting
fouls.  
  
I was really proud of our guys executing our motion offense in the second
half. And then defensively, we were just trying to hold on. It wasn't pretty,
but to hold Florida to 66 points, we had to do something right. So yeah, I
thought it was one of our better games.  
  
I just want to coach these guys another day. That's the bottom line, just
having so much fun with this group. Just want to have one more practice and
one more film session and one more travel, and then I'm sure when we get to
the next destination, we'll get greedy and want to do it again. But this is
all about just surviving and advance. It really is. And I'm proud to be these
guys' coach. I'm just glad we get to live another day.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Admiral Schofield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32856)

### [Grant Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34924)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola Chicago - 63, Tennessee - 62  
  
RICK BARNES: You know, it's always a tough way to lose a basketball game, the
buzzer beaters, but you know, we had the ball with a chance to tie it or go
up. We did. They had the ball with a chance to win it, and they did it.  
  
But I can -- again, congratulations to Loyola. Got a really nice basketball
team. But I am proud of our guys. They kept fighting today, found a way to
stay in it, and put themselves in a position to have a chance to win it, and
obviously a tough way to lose it, but again, congratulations to Loyola, and
we've got a lot to build on going forward.  
  
Q. Obviously a 15-6 start, they called a time-out, and the game really
seemed to flip from there. What did they do to adjust and change things at
that point?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: They started making shots.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We just didn't continue to play on the defensive end. We were
playing hard, but we weren't really playing smart. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Admiral, after you picked up the second foul and went to the bench,
how hard was it to get back in the groove? 11 points in the first four
minutes. Did you feel like you kind of cooled off?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: No, I wouldn't say I cooled off. It was just hard to play
physical like I do on the floor. That's just sometimes how the game goes. The
refs got to control the game a certain way, but credit to them. They got in
position, and the refs called what they saw.  
  
Q. Grant, what did you notice about not having Kyle out there? How was
the game different, and was it mostly on defense where you feel like that
showed up?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Yeah. He's a talented defender. He's our rim protector. We
missed him, but we had a lot of guys that could step up and fill that role,
but it's hard to win a game when you allow a team to shoot 50 percent from the
field. It's hard. Hard to win.  
  
Q. It's tough right now, but can you look at this season and still put
in perspective what you guys have done for this program?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, we've worked really hard, and the biggest thing is
we've brought some excitement around the basketball program again. Tough loss,
big shot. And for us, it doesn't define who we are. It doesn't define our
season. We did a lot of great things this year, but it's motivation. It's
something that we needed to happen, especially for our group.  
  
We've still got guys that are going to be returning. And for us, all we can do
is build on it. We got here. We got a little bit of taste of what it's like to
be here. And if we want to go further, we've got to work a little harder.  
  
Not to say that we didn't work hard, but we worked very hard, and just the
little things what goes into winning, we've got to correct and we've got to be
more consistent in that. And I think with this experience, it'll really help.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Yeah, what Admiral said. We did a good job this year when it
comes to putting kind of Tennessee back on the map, but it's really about just
coming back next year and being stronger because this team, we have almost
everyone returning. That's all.  
  
Q. When did you know Kyle wouldn't be able to go? I know it's impossible
to say exactly how it impacted the game, but how much did you miss him?  
RICK BARNES: Well, we weren't sure. We were going to wait right before the
game to see if he could do anything. It's not that we did a lot to get ready.
We did walk-throughs and what we normally do, just a shorter version of
everything. He couldn't do any of that, but he still tried to stretch. He
warmed up and couldn't do it. He's a difference maker. We can't replace him,
what he does at the rim for us. We can't.  
  
And I'm not -- again, I'm not taking anything away from Loyola Chicago because
they won the game. But you've watched us play all year. He's been a big part
of what we've done. We had these clips before the game showing the guys our
defense.  
  
And to be honest with you, when we walked out of the room, I said, maybe we
shouldn't have shown that because Kyle was involved in all of them. And he
does, and he's crushed because he wanted to be able to go, but he just
couldn't do it.  
  
Q. How tough was it down the stretch without any time-outs? How did that
affect your strategy?  
RICK BARNES: It was, but -- it was tough, but we had to use some a couple
times to try to -- again, Grant had to play a lot of minutes today and Admiral
getting in foul trouble early. The start of the game, we came out emotional,
playing hard, but our offense -- a question was asked earlier about what did
they do different. We took bad shots. We were making them play long
possessions on defense, and we would go down and jack up a quick three after
three or four seconds and come back and play defense again. So we didn't
really give ourselves a chance. Again, we were too emotionally charged up
there.  
  
But you know, I like saving time-outs, especially with teams. I do. I like to
do that. But I did tell them if they score, what I like to see us do, and to
be quite frank, we didn't do it, and I wanted to let the ball roll and set up
a play that we have. But again, they're young and emotional and those things
happen.  
  
As much as you talk about it and hope that you prep for it -- because Bone can
get the ball. He can cover some distance pretty quickly, but we didn't really
get a chance to do it the way we'd have liked to have done it, but he still
got it down there. But again, it's the emotional part of it because we guarded
it, and then they made a tough shot. But that's part of the game, guys.
There's players capable of making those kind of shots.  
  
Q. In the second half it seemed like they were really emphasizing not
letting Grant get the ball. I assume you wanted him to have it more than he
got it in the second half?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, but we felt -- at sometime or other, we didn't want
to just stand around and force feed it to him. He gets a lot of attention, but
we needed some other guys to step up and make some plays, as well.  
  
He played a lot of minutes, and we want to get it to him, but Grant did a
great job passing the ball. We knew they were going to double-team him. A
couple times they didn't, and he made a terrific play there to put us up there
at the end. But he was working to get it because then they weren't making it
easy for him. But I just felt like our guards early in the game, they were
holding the ball too long. They weren't moving the ball. They weren't moving
themselves. We wanted to drive for. You look at it. We kept talking about
drive the ball, drive the ball, drive the ball, and we didn't get enough of
that out of our guards.  
  
Like I said early, we took six or seven straight threes where that's just not
what we do, and it's emotion. I think it's emotion more than anything and
being, like I said, too, being a little too charged up.  
  
Q. What was your message to the team after the game?  
RICK BARNES: You know, they're crushed. We all are. But -- and I told them, I
said, hey -- one, I'm glad it hurts a little bit because sometimes I've had
some teams you wonder if it hurt deep enough. I told them once we step back
and decompress from all of it, we've done a lot, a lot more than certainly
what other people thought.  
  
But as a group, these guys felt they could win, and they're going to look back
on it in a couple weeks and realize that it was a special year, but it also
puts us in a different position. We won't be picked to finish 13th next year
in the league or 14th. I think we've been picked there three years in a row,
either 13th or 14th. So now that presents another challenge that we'll get
into later on, but right now -- and I told them, they've got to be proud for
-- and you know as much as anybody that the University of Tennessee needed
something good to happen to it, especially in the athletic department.  
  
I think those guys have created that going forward, and we've got some
wonderful student-athletes at Tennessee, some great programs going on, but I
think it was a great year for the University with its basketball team because
-- it was good, and I told those guys that. The way our fans got behind us was
special, and the fact that they shared an SEC title and came within a couple
seconds of getting to the Sweet 16. But like I told them, they've got to want
more. I told them -- we talked about what -- they know what our goals are, and
one of them will be to try to be in this tournament every year, something you
don't take for granted.  
  
I told them coming in here, trying to explain to them because they had never
been part of the NCAA Tournament. None of them had ever participated in it. I
said to them when the pairings come out, we didn't put up the board or any of
that stuff. We just talked about who was right in front of us. And I said,
I've seen, I think, everything you can see in terms of this tournament except
one thing, and that's a 16 beating a one. And I said, I don't know it'll
happen in my lifetime, but it's going to happen in yours. First thing they
said to me this morning, they said, well, Coach, I guess you've seen it all,
which I don't think I have, but I've seen a lot of these kind of games, buzzer
beaters, and it hurts.  
  
But one team hurts. The other team feels good and gets to go on. This team,
like Admiral said, we've got a lot of guys coming back, all but one, and they
can use it as a catalyst to want to get back here and try to go deeper and
further. It can be a good thing.  
  
Q. Just the free throws, you mentioned the guards weren't driving the
basketball like you wanted them to. Is that the main problem?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, we wanted to -- going inside is not just throwing
the ball to Grant Williams. I felt like the only time we really drove it hard
was the last play of the first half. Again, I told the guys when we were up, I
was telling the coaches, hey, everybody going into the game like they had to
get a shot off, and so we -- and we wanted to drive the ball. We knew they
were going to switch. They didn't really do anything that we didn't expect
them to do.  
  
But we just didn't -- we settled, and they would have let us do that all night
long if we'd have wanted to do that. But at the end -- but our guys, I'm proud
of them. They hung in there. We had to fight through it. We had to fight
through Admiral not playing well, Kyle obviously not being in it.  
  
But again, we came back, and that's what we told them, if we can just get the
ball back and make some plays on the other end, get the lead, put a little
pressure back on them, and Grant made a terrific move there, almost came up
with a great turnover, would have been a great turnover. But then they made a
pretty tough shot. They really did. And the ball hit and bounced and goes in.
But that's basketball.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Chris and Kevarrius, your memories of Brandone Francis, do you have a
-- just going up against him, what did you think of him as a teammate, and how
ironic is it for him to be on the other bench when you guys are going to play
to go to the Sweet 16?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I didn't really know him that long. When I first got here, he
seemed like very energetic. He was always excited. Whether he was on the court
or not, he seemed like a very good team player. I'm excited to see how well we
do matching up against him.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, like he said, he always had a lot of energy. He's one of
those guys that always had something different to him. He was always amped up.
You could tell, he loved the game, and it meant a lot to him, and he was
always excited to be out there on the court, and he wanted to do whatever he
could as a teammate to help us and better himself, as well.  
  
Q. Chris, not sure how much you've gotten to see of Texas Tech or how
much you saw of the game last night, but how are you excited for the
opportunity to go against Keenan Evans?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I mean, he's another great point guard and a great player, so
any time you get to go up against a great player, it helps you elevate your
game. But you know, I'm not going to make too much out of that, play like any
other game, just go out there, run the team, do what coaches ask me to do, and
just make sure that everybody is focused and doing what they've got to do.  
  
Q. Chris, you being a senior, the point guard, and it sort of being,
quote-unquote, your team, how much like responsibility and maybe angst have
you had when it's been so much of a roller coaster, when the team has had
periods of struggling? How much did you feel like it was kind of up to you to
maybe get things back on course?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: With this team, we don't have just one person that's the guy,
you would say. We try to collectively come together as a team and lead each
other.  
  
But being the older guy, when we do have those times, I do feel like I have a
little bit more responsibility, you know, to try to figure out what's going on
and keep guys focused and get our focus back when we lose it. But like I said,
it's on everybody. We try to hold each other accountable. It's not just one
person.  
  
Q. Kevarrius or Chris, obviously you're in Texas, there are going to be
a lot of Red Raider fans here. They kind of filled up the arena last night.
Just the challenge of going through a road environment, and how much can you
draw from maybe some of your experiences in the SEC beating Kentucky at Rupp
Arena in terms of dealing with that?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I feel like we've played better in our away games. We come
together knowing it's all of us on the court, the coaches, and everybody else
on the staff. So it's going to feel like pretty comfortable playing against a
crowd that has their fans backing them. It's going to be a good game for us. I
feel like it's going to be.  
  
Q. Jalen, kind of a similar question to what I asked Chris, which he
didn't want to answer that much about, it being about him, how much have you
seen him be kind of the leader of the team? He kind of deflected that, but is
he kind of the guy that keeps everybody together and your chance to play with
him this year, what's that been like for you, and if you answer nicely, he'll
probably give you a lot of passes tomorrow?  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah, definitely. He's definitely been one of our leaders. Like
he mentioned, it's been a lot of us leading. I feel like he does a lot of
leading by example, bringing his own energy, playing defense, picking up full
court, making extra pass, things like that, know what I mean? So yeah, he's
definitely been very helpful for us, a big part of our success.  
  
Q. Back to the question about the crowd. A lot of Red Raider fans there
yesterday. Did you get to see the crowd before you guys got in there before
your game at all, and what are your thoughts on this basically being a home
game for them because they've got six guys on their team from Dallas?  
JALEN HUDSON: I didn't really get a chance to see the crowd. I could
definitely hear it. It seems like they'll have a lot of people there. The fans
really can't do anything for them on the court. We'll have to bring our own
energy. I still feel really good about it.  
  
We played some really good, tough teams at their place and were able to come
out with a W. So I feel really good about it. Like I said before, I don't
think their fans can do anything to help them on the floor, so I think we'll
be fine.  
  
Q. Chris, Texas Tech sort of all season has been slowing the other team
down, getting them fatigued and crashing at the end and finishing the game
off. How do you guys not let them set the tempo and play your transition
offense that you like to play? What's your strategy in setting the place early
four your team?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: We've played teams like that before that want to slow us down.
We're just going to start on the defensive end and get our offense going and
get some stops and get out in transition. That's the main thing, just we're
not really worried about the offense too much, just we're focused on the
defensive end, and that's where it's going to get us baskets on the other end.  
  
Q. Any one of you can answer this if you want. The SEC is off to a
pretty good start in the tournament. You did very well yesterday. You've got
you and Tennessee both here. I wonder if you could give your thoughts about
the league, maybe its national reputation, how much you think it improved this
season, any other thoughts that you have? Let's start with Jalen.  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah, the SEC is really tough. I don't really think they get a
lot of credit. It's a very physical league, and the way they've been calling
the games have been very physical, and I don't think a lot of teams in their
conference have even been used to it. That's one thing I noticed coming from
the ACC. It was like a completely different game, and I think the SEC teams
were more adjusted to it.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, like he said, the SEC is a very tough league. It's shown
that the last couple years. Every year has gotten better, and they put more
and more teams in the tournament and more and more teams are going deeper and
made longer runs than they've done in the past. It just goes to show you how
good that conference is from top to bottom.  
  
A lot of it has to do with the physicality and the athleticism and a lot of
that goes with the coaches that are in the league. They don't get a lot of
credit, as much credit as they should, as good a job as they do with the teams
that they have.  
  
Q. Do you take a little pride in that, with what's happening right
now?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, I mean, a little bit. Just a little bit.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Anxious to get after it a little bit, and first and foremost, get
a good long stretch, have our guys feeling a little bit better about their
bodies. Competitive game last night, of course. Anxious to move on. It's an
honor to be here. It's an unbelievable tournament. It's a great experience for
our guys. Really pleased with the way that we played last night for about 36
minutes, and not necessarily the way that we finished, but beat a good team,
and we've got a huge test in front of us against a Texas Tech team that's had
a great, great year.  
  
Q. Mike, in addition to dealing with all their talent and their guards,
they're going to have a sea of red in here, probably 14,000, 15,000. You've
dealt with road environments before in the SEC, but kind of the challenge of
that and having to deal with the crowd, and how do you think you can respond
to that and draw from what you went through in the SEC?  
MIKE WHITE: Well, definitely there's no advantage to it for us, obviously. But
we've just got to deal with it, and we've done it before. I don't think any
team in the country is more battle-tested than we are over the last two years,
considering what we had to go through last year with the renovations to
Exactech Arena. We've played a ton of games away from home. We've played a ton
of neutral site games, of course, and in this one I thought Chris Chiozza made
a good point last night, this will be comparable to the Gonzaga game, which we
didn't get any computer favorability for, unfortunately, but that was a road
game, and tomorrow will be a road game, as well.  
  
It will be a great environment. It will be a great environment. But I'm more
concerned with defending them and finding a way to score against the third-
ranked defense in the country.  
  
Q. It's not like a Florida and Texas Tech have any recent history. The
last time they played, Bill Koss was actually a freshman --  
MIKE WHITE: Wow, a couple years ago.  
  
Q. What was your immediate impression of Texas Tech's backcourt from the
film you saw?  
MIKE WHITE: It's funny, I hadn't had a chance to see them play. You follow
scores, and of course you know Coach Beard has a role in it. Of course, they
have had a great year. I just hadn't seen them live a bunch during the season.  
  
If I'm not watching an SEC game, I'm probably tuned in to the Blue Devils and
a couple other teams. More than anything, Keenan Evans is terrific. Their
freshmen, where do they come from? My goodness, the years that they've had,
their freshman class is big-time. They've got a good mix of those guys, along
with Keenan and some older guys, some good seniors. Athletically, they've got
good pieces of some big, physical guys, some good guards, some length,
athleticism.  
  
I think their team speed is as good as we've played all year, which helps them
in transition offense and defense. The way they changed ends of the floor is
top-notch. And then overall, as I mentioned, figuring out a way to score
against these guys could be our biggest test, third ranked in Kenpom.com. They
don't have any deficiencies defensively. They're good offensively. They're
going to be hard to guard. But man, do they lock you up. Chris has got these
guys really defending and playing really, really hard.  
  
Q. How have you seen Chris evolve since obviously he was there when you
got there? This year with the team sort of being up and down, do you think
he's felt more responsibility when things were struggling? He mentioned that
he thinks there's a lot of leaders on this team, but is he really kind of the
key guy, and do you think he's felt the burden maybe of trying to get things
right when things were not going right?  
MIKE WHITE: I think to a certain extent. Chris is a quiet leader. He's a
leader by example, and we have a few of those guys. Our most demonstrative
guy, our biggest communicator, is Kevarrius Hayes. We just have a bunch of
really introverted, quiet guys. Kev and Jay have heard it all year, and they
know it. It's a unique group in that regard.  
  
We've got really, really good guys just -- we've lacked that overall edge. And
Chris has been challenged by myself and our staff all year, and he's been
challenged by his teammates, as well. He's become a little bit more vocal.
He's trying to get out of his comfort zone a little bit. He's just not a big
extroverted guy.  
  
That said, though, when he says something, our guys lock in, and they continue
to challenge him to step up and be more and more vocal because they want it
and they've expressed that to him in team meetings. What he says goes a long
way, especially with our younger guys.  
  
Q. As far as this team, this was kind of a team in transition with the
lineup, I guess, some new guys kind of getting mixed in. How much was Chris
kind of involved with trying to make everything fit together?  
MIKE WHITE: He's been great in that regard. I mean, it's such a luxury to have
a point guard, like last night, he gets 11 assists and zero turnovers. He's
our best defender. He's on the all-SEC defensive team. He's held it all
together. And I would say if he is 1, 1A would be Egor Koulechov. Those guys
have been constants for us, and Chris has helped it all come together to a
certain extent. And we were -- we added a couple pieces, of course, in Egor
and Jalen and some freshmen, and then we were without a few pieces that we
thought we'd have.  
  
And to be able to count on Chris night in and night out has been given us a
chance on most occasions, of course. I know the narrative with us is that
we've been up and down, and I've been open and honest about that all year.
We're not hiding from that.  
  
We've been -- we've looked like a top ten team at times, and we've looked like
an NIT team at times. But Chris also has -- the year he's had has allowed this
team to -- despite the inconsistencies, to do a lot of really good things,
too. I beat these guys up all year, but at the end of the day, Chris and his
teammates led the country in top 25 wins with six. I think we finished sixth
in the quad one runs. And here we are in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament again.  
  
I'm really proud of Chris. I'm so happy he's my point guard. He's had a great
career, and I'm most excited that his legacy will forever be that he had a
good career, and he had a really good senior year in addition to the shot. It
wasn't just about the one shot.  
  
Q. The SEC started 5-0 in the NCAA Tournament this year. There's been a
lot of talk about how the conference has improved, but what does it mean to
prove it in the tournament, too?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I just think it -- I just think it proves it a little bit
more. Hopefully it sinks in nationally what this league is capable of, how
this league has grown from top to bottom. And there's teams that aren't in
this tournament that are really good.  
  
It's a talented league. It's a deep league. A bunch of really good players, a
bunch of really proud fan bases, and I think it'll only continue to grow. I'm
anxious to see how we finish with this tournament. I think that the league
night in and night out in this tournament is going to continue to show people
how good we are.  
  
Q. You discussed their defense; what in particular stands out about
Texas Tech's defense that makes them hard to score on?  
MIKE WHITE: Team speed, length, athleticism, and we've played a lot of teams
this year that you watch on film, and you say, guys, in talking to your team,
this guy is really athletic. They've got like five of those guys, and they've
got veteran guards. They play really hard. Again, their team speed -- and
their interchangeability, they've got versatile defenders that they move
really well, and so they do more switching in their man-to-man probably than
any team we've seen this year, and they're able to not only get away with it,
but they're able to flourish in it, making teams stagnant at times, taking
teams out of their actions at times, because they've got front court guys that
can lock up guards, and they've got guards that can defend in the post.  
  
And they wreak some havoc, too, with getting in passing lanes and having
active hands and turning it over, and that's where they're incredibly
dangerous is those pick sixes, getting out in transition offense off of
turnovers.  
  
Q. Texas Tech try and slow you down, wear you out and kill you at the
end. How do you keep it from getting into one of those half-court games?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, and transition offense. We'd like to get quick, open shots
or late open shots. We want open shots, but we want them to -- we don't want
them to be out on transition offense, either. That transition game, we'd like
to win. I don't know that we can plan on definitely winning it because of the
team speed factor. That's where they're really, really good.  
  
But our floor balance has got to be great. We've got to set our half-court
defense to have a chance, and they grind you out offensively, too, à la
Arkansas and Tennessee and South Carolina, where they're in constant movement,
and some of their defensive numbers probably are helped by the fact that they
wear you out a little bit with the ball in their hands. They've got five guys
cutting, and they can all pass, dribble, shoot, and they're all screening, so
they're going to test our discipline defensively, as well.  
  
And if we can get stops, hopefully we can get out in transition. And if we've
got something early, we'd like to take it, but again, we've been there before.
Loyola Chicago did it to us to start, and it seemed like a bunch of people
figured that out. We don't want to play defense for 80 percent of the game.
We'd like early quick ones, but we've got to be choosey. We've got to make
good decisions in transition offense, as well.  
  
Q. Keith yesterday nine, eight rebounds, three blocks. He was obviously
the premier scorer last year, but how has he developed into being a tougher
player that you kind of need inside?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I agree with you. I think he's gotten a little tougher. He's
still really young with understanding how big and strong he is. I'm hopeful
that a couple more off-seasons you'll see a finished product where he can be
more of a balance inside out guy, or outside in or however you want to term
it.  
  
But 90 percent of his game right now is facing up. But he's got such a gifted
body in strength, and I liked him attacking the rim a little bit last night,
of course. It was a little bit different matchup, a little bit less length in
there, and he was able to have a little bit of success. So he's still growing
in that regard.  
  
Q. We talked about how this is kind of a quiet group of guys, but you
have Kevarrius Hayes who's very outgoing. How valuable is that to the locker
room culture? What's he bring to the team in that element?  
MIKE WHITE: You know, when I talk about us being so quiet, I'm more so talking
about in-between the lines. Kevarrius might be our most extroverted guy in the
locker room and at the apartment or what have you, social settings, team
dinners. We have four or five guys other than him that'll cut it up a little
bit, too. Our guys got strong personalities, and they're fun to be around.  
  
He, though, more so than anybody else has become the guy that challenges
others. When his team loses a drill in practice, we try to make everything
competitive, of course, every day in practice. And he's the one guy that has
learned to hate losing, and he makes it known, and he'll call a guy out, hey,
that's not acceptable.  
  
Even when he maybe has messed a play up or he hasn't played to his ability,
he's our most competitive guy on a daily basis, and that I think overall has
made us a little bit more competitive. Again, we're not the most competitive
team. We're not the toughest team. But this team has really grown in those
regards. I've talked a lot about that, how much better we are defensively
today than we were four months ago and on the glass and how much grittier we
are, and without Kevarrius bringing that presence, I don't think we grow
nearly as much in that area.  
  
Q. Staying with Kevarrius, in the half-court defensive set, they like to
penetrate, 36 points in the paint last night, what kind of challenge does that
present for Kevarrius?  
MIKE WHITE: A lot, a lot, Kevarrius, Dontay Bassett and Gorjok Gak, Keith
Stone and Egor Koulechov, there's going to be a lot of pressure on those guys
to defend without fouling. Texas Tech lives at the foul line, lives at the
rim, not only with penetration and with post touches, but they're one of the
best cutting teams that we've played this year. Good passing team, to be able
to facilitate to those cuts, I think the speed and quickness allow them to be
a good cutting team, as well.  
  
So our anchors on the interior have got to be good. Positionally we've got to
be really sound, and then we've got to play physical, but legal at the same
time. I know our guards got to help them by trying to do the best they can, by
not getting face cut, back cut, and then of course containing penetration.  
  
Q. I know you were telling Deaundrae not to dunk at the end of the game
last night, but what's the value of the experience of the freshmen getting in
the games at this stage?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I talked to Drae today, and he had no idea. He hadn't been
told that before. He hadn't been in that situation. He told me that he had
seen a clip that somebody maybe had Tweeted where I was going crazy when he
was about to dunk it, but I say, hey, I'm not mad at you, you're a freshman,
you'll figure that out, but in terms of sportsmanship, we don't need that one.
But he said the dunk felt good. Happy that he got his name on the scoreboard.  
  
But it's a great experience. It's great experience. I thought he provided some
decent minutes. I thought Mike Okauru was really good, really good. He made
some timely baskets for us, and I thought he was really good defensively, as
well. We're not playing as many freshmen as Texas Tech, but I think any of
these type experiences, especially NCAA Tournament experiences, for your
younger guys can only help continue to grow your culture as a program.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Clayton, you mentioned last night the three-pointer. I think a little
bit tongue in cheek, said this is just because Ben always knows where I am or
something like that. But I'm just curious, you guys have obviously gone back
through your childhood, but what is the chemistry you have, and are there some
moments where you do feel like there's some connection out there that you
can't explain?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, I mean, we've talked about it a lot. We joke about it in
the room. A lot of times when I come off pick-and-rolls and stuff, I won't
really be able to see him because there are people between us and stuff, but I
know he is back there somewhere. So I will throw it over my head over the
defenders to him and stuff, and it's just situations like that. I think we do
such a good job of feeding off each other.  
  
I think it's kind of -- people feed off our energy when we're playing well
together, sharing the ball. It's kind of -- everybody kind of starts doing the
same thing, and we're able to get the ball moving, spacing it, one-mores, and
people feed off that energy. Me and Ben have been doing that for our whole
lives.  
  
Q. Clayton, does Coach have like a 24-hour rule or whatever as far as
after a game to say, okay, if you win, celebrate for 24 and then forget about
it? And I assume maybe now it's more like 12. And what's it been like since
the end of the game? Did you look at the shot a lot? Is it something that it's
been kind of hard to not spend a lot of time looking at it or getting away
from it?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, Coach does a really good job of keeping us focused. So
last night he wanted us to enjoy it. He wanted us to enjoy the moment because
he knows that that's something that we all have looked forward to our whole
lives for a moment like that.  
  
But last night, we sat down, we got in the film room and we were watching some
film, just so that we could kind of stop thinking about the past and kind of
move forward towards Tennessee. And then now that we woke up today, I mean, I
think we're kind of done celebrating yesterday. We've moved on, and now we're
ready to go to try to beat Tennessee tomorrow.  
  
Q. Clayton and Aundre, I think you guys might be able to help me with
this: Have you studied the history of Loyola enough to consider whether the
1963 championship team was maybe the first Cinderella that the NCAA ever
had?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, the 1963 team did a lot more than -- they transcended
the game. They were the first team to start four African-American players, and
Glory Road gets a lot of the movie, the Texas Western team, gets a lot of the
popularity or whatever that everybody knows about that, but a lot of people
don't know about the 1963 team.  
  
So I mean, I guess in a way it was a Cinderella, but that team was really
talented. They had a lot of really good players. But aside from that, I think
it was amazing that Coach Ireland recruited all those guys and brought them
all to Rogers Park, and that team is an inspiration to us.  
  
And we definitely know about the history of Loyola basketball. We've spent
time with the 1963 team. They come to our games. They were at our last home
game this year, and they've told us all the stories from back when they
played.  
  
So I mean, they're a really good team, and they're an inspiration to us for
sure.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: He covered it all.  
  
Q. Aundre and Clayton, as older guys who were recruited after your first
stop coming out of high school, how would you describe Porter as far as a
recruiter and his pitch to you, and what stood out about him in the way that
he kind of presented it to you?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: I'd say his vision. He kept on preaching culture, kept on
preaching family, just the direction that the program was going. He's an
honest person, so he never told me that I would have a cookie cutter. He
always told me I had to work for what I'm going to get and work for my spots.
So just that honesty and the culture aspect and just the family preaching has
just helped me get here.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, like what Dre said, I don't know, just his passion and
his energy is the first thing that you notice with Coach Moser. He always
brings it every single day, and even when he first -- the first time I ever
actually talked to him in person, he actually came out to Ames after I decided
to transfer from Iowa State, and I got to eat lunch with him.  
  
You could just see it in his eyes how much he really cares about this program
and how much he really wants to be great. And that was the first thing that
stuck out to me. He's definitely a really -- like you can see it, I think
that's why he's been able to get a lot of good players into this program. He's
a really good recruiter because you can just see how much he really cares
about it.  
  
And then also -- I don't know, the culture part is a big part. You want to be
around good guys. You know he's going to recruit character guys. You know it's
going to be a program where you're going to fit in and feel comfortable.  
  
Q. Clayton and whoever else wants to answer, whether you win by 26 like
Tennessee did or you hit a buzzer beater, does any of that matter come
tomorrow night, or does it?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, I don't think it matters now. I mean, we both got a W.
And now we're moving on to the next one. I think we can play better than we
played yesterday, so I think that's a good thing. We kind of got that first
game under our belt now, and now we feel a little bit more comfortable. Just
playing on the court, the feel of the ball, all that stuff. I think we'll feel
more comfortable out there shooting and everything.  
  
I don't think it matters how much we won by. I think we're going to get on the
scouting report and do whatever we can to try to get a win tomorrow.  
  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Yeah, I don't think it really matters obviously. They won by
a large margin of victory. And we won on a last-second shot. But we're just
going into tomorrow playing like we played against Miami, obviously. We know
we're not going to lay down for them. We're not going to be shocked because
they play in a better conference or they're a high major or anything like
that.  
  
We respect them, and hopefully they respect us, too. And we're just going to
go out there and play like we normally play. And once that ball gets tipped
up, we're just going to play hard and set the tone with them.  
  
Q. After Tennessee's game, I talked to one of the Wright State players
about Tennessee's defense, and he said they've got a lot of long, quick, big
guys, which a lot of teams have, but they really get after it defensively.
That's what he said, that that's what kind of sets them apart. They're one of
the best defensive teams in the country according to Ken Pom.  
Is that something you can really see from film, or until you guys get on the
floor tomorrow, is that going to be something that you may have to kind of
adjust to during the game depending on how they come after y'all?  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: We're used to playing against size, but we was watching film
earlier, and they try to block shots, so just a lot of pump fakes, a lot of
eyes to the rim, and we will get them out of stance and out of position, and
then it'll be easier for us to score.  
  
Q. Clay and Aundre, you guys have been here a couple years and you've
played in front of Gentile crowds that there weren't that many people, but I'm
sure you saw the video of Damen yesterday, so what's it like seeing the buzz
around your team grow on campus?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, that's when the cool -- one of the really cool parts
about being a part of this team this year is that we've kind of created that
buzz around the University and around campus and around all the whole
community.  
  
They've started to come out and support us, especially towards the end of the
year where we started to get big crowds at Gentile, and to see those videos of
'63 and Damen and Schreiber downtown and the Bulldog, everybody was in there
and they were going crazy when we won.  
  
I think everybody -- a part of every college experience, everybody wants to be
a part of that. It's something cool. It's something that we've seen growing
up. They pan to the University and everybody is going crazy on campus. We got
to experience that yesterday, and it was really cool.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It's a great feeling. After we beat Florida, we got a little
bit of buzz, but as we kept on winning and winning our conference, winning the
conference tournament, the fan base increased, and then winning the game
yesterday was amazing. It was a lot of videos on Twitter about people that
wasn't even in Chicago, like Las Vegas people that was watching the game and
everybody just screaming and yelling after the great shot. So yeah, it's just
nice to have a good fan base.  
  
Q. Clayton, could you just kind of reflect on your path from growing up,
Kansas household, outside Kansas City in Overland Park, to that year at Iowa
State, and then finding your way to Loyola, how did all that unfold?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah. So I grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, and I played with
Ben. We went to Blue Valley Northwest. And I started to get recruited in high
school, and it was mainly like by a few Big 12 schools.  
  
I ended up deciding to go to Iowa State at the beginning of my junior year.
And then when I ended up getting there, I enjoyed the experience a lot. It was
fun being there, and I'm glad I spent that year there. It was a good
experience for me.  
  
But I mean, it just didn't work out. And that's kind of how sometimes this
works in this business and stuff like that. I have no hard feelings towards
them at all. It just wasn't the right situation for me, so I decided to make
the move.  
  
When I decided to transfer, it's obviously kind of a scary situation because
you don't know what your options are going to be and who's going to give you
another opportunity. Coach Moser and Coach Gordon were two of the first
coaches to call me right when I got my release, and that meant a lot to me,
that they were really serious about giving me another opportunity.  
  
Like I said, Coach Moser came out to Ames actually to eat lunch with me, which
was awesome. And he actually went to see my family, too, in Overland Park.
That was right off the bat, like I kind of knew that me and Coach Moser were
going to have a good relationship. And then also, add in having my best friend
from high school on the team, as well, and having the opportunity to play with
him again in college, not a lot of best friends get to play Division I
basketball together. I thought it was too good of an opportunity to pass up.  
  
Q. Cameron and Lucas, as younger guys, what was your first impression of
Coach Moser's style, hands-on style and how aggressively he does coach all the
time?  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: Well, when I first got here, the first thing that I really
noticed was his energy and his passion. The way that he coaches is something
that I'm kind of used to coming from Chicago and the way -- the style that we
play in Chicago.  
  
So it wasn't really hard to get accustomed. It was just the speed and how
everything -- he wanted everything to be so detailed. I think that's really
helped me throughout the year.  
  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Well, one of the main things that lured me to Loyola was just
when I came down for visits and things like that, just kind of the family that
he preached and all these guys just being great friends. You know, that
culture that we always talk about, he just kind of introduced me to it. And in
high school, I came from a program like that where we had a lot of culture and
we did things the right way, and at Loyola obviously we do things the right
way.  
  
And Coach was always telling me that he had a vision for me and that if I came
to Loyola, we could do some big things. With these guys, we've got a lot of
pieces, and I just like the guys a lot, and Coach's vision, and obviously it
all worked out.  
  
Q. Lucas, how has your state championship experience helped in these big
moments as a freshman?  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: I think just that path, that whole state championship like
run has really helped because of I kind of got used to, okay, win a game, put
it in the bank, focus on the next opponent, and that like next opponent, next
game mentality is something that we've really bought into all year, and
especially postseason, and Arch Madness and March Madness.  
  
PORTER MOSER: You know, our thoughts have been Tennessee and how big and
physical they are, how much -- how balanced they are. They've got side.
They've got speed. They've got shooters, and they're well-coached. The guys
really enjoyed the moment last night. It was great here. Leaving the arena, we
got back, we kind of just decompressed with a team meal with each other, and
then our coaches went to work. We let them get some rest, and we went to work
and got our minds focused on Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, in that situation, are you one of those coaches with kind of
a 24-hour rule after victory where you say, hey, give them 24 until the next
game, and obviously this is a different situation with a different game. Was
there any kind of a different approach to try to make sure that they kind of,
like you said, enjoyed the moment, but then kind of start resetting to play
Tennessee?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, like if it was a regular season game where you know you're
not playing the next day, we have a 24-hour -- you let them. But last week at
Arch Madness and the thing, you have to get moving. You play the next day.  
  
For this, it's kind of the same thing. You can't prepare yourself, especially
at Loyola, for the national scope of what happened last night. These guys are
back in their hotel room watching themselves all night. The social media was
berserk.  
  
I'm one of those guys where I wanted them to enjoy the moment. I mean, this is
how hard they've worked for it, and I can do that, because I said this
yesterday or two days ago, it's a mature group.  
  
Then we went back talking about Tennessee's personnel. This morning we had
some meetings, some film, and every time that it's time to do business and do
that, this group is completely locked in.  
  
You know, we decompressed at the hotel a little bit with a team meal last
night. And our coaches, we went right at it. We went right back and moved
forward, put it in the bank, and now our thoughts are to Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, so this moment and everything that comes with winning a NCAA
game the way that you did and just winning it, period, when you were a
31-year-old head coach, Division I program in Arkansas, Little Rock, did you
think it would be easier or come sooner, and do you look back at that guy at
that time and think, boy, you've come a long way, or how do you reflect on
that?  
PORTER MOSER: You know, I haven't really thought about that, that long of a
journey. I've just thought about the -- I've taken over rebuilds, complete
rebuilds. This rebuild at Loyola has been a grass-roots rebuild.  
  
I really haven't reflected on that. I've just reflected on how far and how
great it is for the University, what kind of group I have, and I'm listening
to the press conference with Donte Ingram, and I know this because I know how
good a guys these are. But he makes a comment about any one of those guys in
the locker room could have hit that shot. I was just fortunate enough to be
the one Marques passed to. What a humble, great thing to say for a 21, 22-year
old in that moment right there.  
  
That's who they are. They share the ball. They're humble. They're high quality
kids. We've got an unbelievable parental support system. Our parents of these
young men are first-class. And I was reflecting on -- I'm blessed to go
through this journey with the guys in our locker room. And I said that early
-- like first week of the season, and now we're here, and that's what I was
reflecting on.  
  
Q. Are you still the official darlings of the NCAA Tournament, or did
Buffalo steal your Thunder?  
PORTER MOSER: No. Damn Nate Oats and Buffalo. I said that this morning, gosh
darn it. I was happy for them. But it is truly -- you don't try to think about
that. You don't. I mean, it's fun to joke with it. But I heard Lucas say the
term -- I love when players regurgitate what you tell them. We've been talking
about put it in the bank, put it in the bank, because we've been doing that
for a while now because we've had to, especially when we were on that
proverbial bubble, which we weren't really in the bubble. Put it in the bank,
and that's what our guys said last night. We got that one, now we've got to
move on. They're looking at it like we're still chasing. We're really chasing
for another one.  
  
Q. But do you believe in destiny?  
PORTER MOSER: Sure. Why not? Why not believe in it? We've all watched the
tournament. Crazy stuff happens, March Madness. But it just doesn't happen by
daydreaming about it. You're not going to compete against Tennessee just
daydreaming about it.  
  
I mean, you're going to have to play physical. You're going to have to box out
every possession. You're going to have to guard the post because they have
some of the best duck-in players in the country. We've got our hands full on
things we've got to prepare for yourself.  
  
I think people that just think and daydream about destiny and all this, it
becomes fantasizing. There's a lot of things we've got to get ready into this
game plan and then produce and do in this game to compete with Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, Clayton talked about when he had decided to transfer from
Iowa State, you visiting him, having lunch, that sort of thing. He hadn't
played a whole lot that freshman year, but what did you see in him, and did
you envision the kind of upside that he's displayed at Loyola?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, 100 percent. I'd seen him in high school when I recruited
Ben Richardson, and just -- I loved their program, where they come from. They
won two state championships together. I saw how character -- so I saw him play
and the program he came from and win, as we had signed Ben.  
  
And then when he became available, I remember right away, we got his release,
and it was game on. There was -- I don't know if I've ever -- it was the foot
on the gas pedal. We envisioned him having this kind of impact on us. That's
the kind of player that I saw in high school and I saw with Ben, and it's been
really cool to watch those two. Like he said, you don't get to really have
your best friend play this level with him, and it's really cool.  
  
Q. Porter, I talked with Grant Benzinger, the leading score for Wright
State after they lost to Tennessee. He talked about the fact that they're so
long, they're quick, they've got all the physical attributes, and a lot of
teams have that. But defensively they just get after it, and a lot of teams
don't do that.  
From watching them on film, what do you think of them defensively, and will
it be something that you can really tell from film or until the guys get out
there and realize how strong and physical and quick these guys are, is that
going to be maybe a bit of an adjustment?  
  
PORTER MOSER: Well, we've -- they do get after it. Tennessee does. They
contest every shot. They really do. They do not want you to get easy shots.
They really -- they're long. Their guards are put together. I mean, they're
really a physical team.  
  
You know, we've played big teams in Florida and Miami, so the size -- these
guys have -- Donte and Ben have had three years of Wichita State, which is a
ton of size. So they've seen it, but you make a great observation. They've
been really at a high level on both ends. They're efficient. They don't beat
themselves. They're efficient on both ends. There's a reason why they're that
good.  
  
But you really -- I think the thing that really impresses me is how
fundamental Williams is posting up. I mean, he is the best duck-in guy in the
country. You show me a better guy that ducks in, and in the words of Rick
Majerus makes and maintains contact. He makes and maintains contact when he
ducks in. I've just been really impressed with his fundamental in ducking in
and posting up.  
  
Q. With Clayton and Ben, what is it like coaching guys that have played
together since third grade? Do you have to say anything to them sometimes? Can
they communicate without speaking?  
PORTER MOSER: They've been -- you can get on them. You know when -- they just
get it. But I'll share with you when you asked me what it's like to coach
them. I'm going to tell you a story that happened last week at the Missouri
Valley Tournament. We won the game, the final game, so we're going to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
We had an hour-long celebration on the court. Then we had to go to the locker
room. We had five minutes to adjust our team. We said a prayer, talked, and
then we had to go to the press conference. So we're walking to the press
conference, and I'm walking behind them, and it was the coolest moment. They
both had their hats on, Valley Championships, they had nets coming out of the
side, and they're just walking next to each other and he goes, man, can you
believe this, we've won since we were in third grade. They're just hitting
each other back and forth like, can you believe this, we won a state
championship, now we're going to the tournament. It was the most genuine
little-kid moment of two grown guys just sharing it like, man, we've been
winning our whole lives. I'm just walking behind them like, man, I'm blessed
to coach these two. They're winners on and off the floor, and it's been cool
to coach them.  
  
Q. What are you going to need out of Krutwig and Aundre tomorrow to go
up against Tennessee's big men?  
PORTER MOSER: 15 rebounds apiece. That's what I'm asking. They're rebounding
-- we don't see it from four out of the five -- like they crash four guys. We
were pushing the pause button. They box out on the offensive side. They box
out to get the offensive rebound.  
  
So we're going to need a tremendous effort on the glass. We're going to have
to have a tremendous effort post defensive wise. They pound it inside. They
duck you in. You've got to do your work early in the post. You just can't sit
there and let them just post you up. So we're going to have to have the best
rebounding and post defensive effort of the year tomorrow.  
  
Q. Before Rick Majerus, who were your greatest coaching influences, and
have you ever had to temper your hands-on style either during a game or
practice to regather your poise?  
PORTER MOSER: Another one of my biggest mentors in my life is my college coach
and who brought me into this profession is Tony Barone, Chicago guy. He was my
college coach at Creighton. I coached with him six years at Texas A&M. He was
high energy, as you can get, passionate. And I spent ten years with him.  
  
He left me a message. He was at our game when we clinched -- when we won the
Missouri Valley championship at home, when we got presented the trophy. He
lives right near Loyola campus, still a huge influence in my life. But no
question Tony Barone was a huge mentor of mine.  
  
Q. Have you studied history enough to have an opinion on whether Loyola
was the first Cinderella in the 1963 championship season?  
PORTER MOSER: The first Cinderella? I've studied history to know about all --
the game of change and the four African-American starters, but the first -- I
would have to guess no, if you're asking me, because there must be another
Cinderella out there. Was there?  
  
Q. I would argue they might have been. If you look at the list, you
might be able to make the argument. I don't know. It's an interesting
question.  
PORTER MOSER: It is, because I -- you look at all the programs that won
National Championships. There's not -- I don't think there's more than 40, if
someone knows the exact number. But Loyola Chicago sticks out. Like Loyola
Chicago won one? So that year, that year was such a monumental breakthrough
for so many things. I guess I've always looked at that as so much more of a
breaking segregation, the game of change, that I really haven't thought about
them being a Cinderella because it was Loyola Chicago, so it was interesting
to think like that. But that team is -- obviously means a lot to us and to
what it was all about back then and the game of change.  
  
Q. Very quickly, another thing I wonder about is if the term Cinderella
based on the social implications just kind of cheapens the whole thing because
of what we think of Cinderella today?  
PORTER MOSER: Yep. Yep, I agree.  
  
Q. Can you kind of trace your recruiting of Aundre Jackson? Is he just a
guy that slipped through the cracks for other Power Five schools?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, you know what, I love guys that are efficient and get it
done. He's a get-it-done guy. It doesn't bother -- he's an undersized guy.
I've had a lot of -- I've had like three all-league players that are
undersized. I had Montel James. Christian Thomas was 6'5". Now Aundre Jackson
is 6'5".  
  
I think sometimes coaches get into that mode where they hear the voices from
outside, whether it's fan bases and recruiting services, and God, we need a
big, we need a big. He's a two-star. He's a three-star. None of that matters.
There's a lot of guys that'll take -- well, we need this 6'9" guy and the 6'9"
guy can't do anything.  
  
Aundre was second in the nation in field goal percentage. That's a stat that
translates, your field goal percentage. He shot like 64 percent at junior
college on a team that went to Hutchinson, Kansas. I watched him play there a
couple games against a team that had like four or five high-major guys, and he
had 26 points. He had a knack to scoring the ball against bigger guys. And
when we signed him last year, he was top three in the country in Division I in
field goal percentage. It translated right to Division I, that field goal
percentage.  
  
So I love get-it-done guys, and we watched him. So 6'5" post player scared a
lot of people off. It doesn't bother me. I like get-it-done guys, and he's one
of them.  
  
Q. Who did you have to beat for him?  
PORTER MOSER: A lot of schools that were at our level. There wasn't a high
major school on him. It was a lot of schools at our level recruiting him.  
  
Q. Years ago when I was at Marquette, I had the good fortune to
interview Rick Majerus. He was nice enough to give me time to help me with a
journalism project I had, and I'll never forget him telling me one of the
biggest challenges when it came to recruiting was keeping kids, whether it was
kids from Milwaukee or wherever, keeping kids from the city in the city or
getting them to come to Marquette, a city campus. How tough is it getting kids
from Chicago to stay in Chicago?  
PORTER MOSER: When I got the job seven years ago, we're Loyola of Chicago, we
had one Illinois player on the roster. And we had not one Chicago public
league player in a 10 or 12-year window. That's amazing to me. Think about
that.  
  
Probably David Bailey was the last. It was like 11 or 12 years, and we
convinced Milton Doyle, who was a highly ranked player from Chicago to come,
and everybody knew Milton in the city, outstanding first-team all-state
player. And I think people are like -- and if you asked Donte, he'd say the
same thing, Milton went there, I'll check it out.  
  
And we had to grass-roots recruit coaches, parents to come to our campus. Our
campus is absolutely gorgeous on the lake, and they've put so much money in
redoing it, and we had so many people from Chicago, myself included, that when
we got in and walked our campus, they said, I had no idea this was here,
tucked up on the north side. So we started it just grass-roots bringing
people. Then we got Donte, then we got Lucas Williamson, and it started with
Milt.  
  
Young people, it wasn't cool to go to Loyola. They hadn't been winning. They
hadn't been on campus to see it. The people that advised them hadn't been on
campus to see it, so we had to really grass-roots the whole thing. And I think
people are saying now, hey, you know what, Milton Doyle graduated and got a
great degree, and his friends and family saw him play a ton.  
  
You look at Donte Ingram, he's going to graduate in a couple months with a
great degree from Loyola of Chicago. Donte has an entourage at all the games,
all the games. And I think it's becoming something where -- I think staying
home now and playing in front of family and friends, because at times people
will say, man, I want to get away. I want to get away.  
  
We're in a great part of -- we're right on the lake tucked in. We've got 6,000
students live on our campus. It's a great setup. It's a setup I think we can
really snowball into bigger and better things, and I think more and more kids
in Chicago are looking at Milton Doyle, Donte Ingram, Lucas Williamson and
looking at, you know what, I can stay home, get a great degree, have friends
and family see us. And now they can add the piece we're in a great conference
and we have the ability to win that conference.  
  
Q. Porter, for years you've been going to freshman orientations and
begging students to come to games. What's it like seeing the celebrations in
Damen and the student centers and the bars around Chicago and seeing all that
work pay off?  
PORTER MOSER: Absolutely awesome. To watch -- what he's referring to is the
freshmen have an orientation, and they break it off into six groups throughout
the summer, and I'd run between basketball to speak to all the friends and
family and beg them to come to games. I've been doing that for years.  
  
To see that aerial view of Damen student center last night gave me chills. It
was just nuts. They had a celebration at the business school, at the student
center, at Ireland's, all around. They had student-athletes. I saw the
softball team. I saw the track team all having watch parties. That's what you
want. That's what up want in a student body. I told them it can help their
experience getting behind it.  
  
It meant so much because of the efforts I've put in to connect with the
students and to get them to buy in, to see their excitement over our run meant
a lot.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Keenan, I was hoping you could talk about your journey over these
four years, how important it is to be here and how special it would be to
advance.  
KEENAN EVANS: This journey has meant everything to me. Like I say in every
interview, just being at the bottom of Tech basketball and now it being at one
of the highest points and being part of a team that can pretty much make
history is unbelievable.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, how do you feel like just getting through the
first game, just kind of feeling through your emotions and getting that first
one, how important is that so when you get the first one you say, all right,
now we can just kind of roll through it?  
TOMMY HAMILTON: That first one felt good, man. That was my first tournament
game, and it was my first taste of it to see what it's like. It was ugly, but
we got it done. I think that we're aware that most of the games like this
tournament is going to be like that, so we're preparing to come out and play
our best game tomorrow, and I think we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Jarrett and Norense, when you see Keenan, obviously he has nights
like last night, 0 for four in the first half and then he comes back in the
second half. Talk about how you know he's going to come through, and what was
it like those few games you were without him this year?  
JARRETT CULVER: We just trust Keenan a lot. So we put the ball in his hand at
the end and he came through this season, so just trusting him at the end to do
what he does. He's proven to us that he can be trusted. Two games without him,
we knew we were going to have to play hard, and we just did our best to try to
win those games.  
  
NORENSE ODIASE: Just like he says, we trust him, put the ball in his hands, he
makes plays all year long. Those games without him, obviously we struggled,
but just glad to have him 100 percent now.  
  
Q. How much more intense was that game last night than the stuff that
you normally play in the Big 12, if any, or was it about the same? What was it
like?  
JARRETT CULVER: I feel like it was very intense because if you lose, then your
season is over. So we wanted to keep going, and the first game is really
tough, so we just played our hardest. And we knew if we lost, our season was
going to be over, and we didn't want that.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: Just being in a conference like the Big 12 kind of prepares you
for those types of nights. Tournament is kind of a different atmosphere, but
being in the Big 12 prepared us, so we've been working at that and we've been
talking about finishing, and that's one of the big parts of that game last
night was finishing at the end.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON: Yeah, like Keenan says, playing in the Big 12 prepared us for
games like last night. And I think also it was just a part of our identity
that showed. We've been down big at half in games and came back and won and
been down with a minute to go, came back and won, so it was something that
we've been doing.  
  
NORENSE ODIASE: Like they all said, the  
  
Big 12 sets you up pretty well to be able to play in these games. Just like
Jarrett said, there's a little bit of added intensity because it could
potentially be our last game, so we just brought that to the table, and we
wanted to play hard.  
  
Q. Keenan, just reflect on coming out of Richardson because you weren't
the typical four or five-star recruit that everybody was after, but about the
path that led you to Texas Tech, and when did you first realize that I've got
a pretty high ceiling and I can make a lot of things happen out here?  
KEENAN EVANS: Just in high school, just putting in all the work, not being
really touted as a four- or five star motivates you every day, and I feel like
that's how this team is just with our name. We're not Kentucky or Kansas
across our chest, and we have to go take everything we want, so that's just
been my motto all my life, got to go take it instead of -- can't let it be
handed to me, I've just got to go get it.  
  
Q. Guys, just each one of you, kind of talk about how important it is to
get off to a quick start against a Florida team that has a lot of depth to it,
very tenacious on the defensive side, and to not kind of find yourselves down
three points going into the half.  
JARRETT CULVER: Starting off the game is very important, just starting off
strong and attacking and trying not to get down is very important for us, so
it really sets the tone.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: Yeah, last night we didn't get off to a good start, so this game
will be big for us to get off to a great start. We're kind of flinging the
ball everywhere and not doing what we practiced, so getting off to a great
start is very important in this game.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON: It's not about how you start. It's about how you finish.
That's all I've got.  
  
NORENSE ODIASE: It's huge. Whenever you can get through the first game, I
guess some jitters are gone. We know what we're used to. We're back in the
tournament. We can kind of not relax, but kind of settle down into it, see
what we did last game, what went wrong to start that game, and just watch the
film and see how we can get better for this game.  
  
Q. Keenan, take us through when you hurt your toe. Talk about what that
felt like and just how difficult was it for you to try to push through it, and
then where are you at right now with that? Are you 100 percent, or is it
adrenaline or what?  
KEENAN EVANS: It was tough to overcome just because I felt like I was letting
my team down in a way, but I felt like it wasn't my fault, and also it's just
not 100 percent, and I still battle with it every night. Just the support and
confidence given from my teammates helped me make it through every night, and
the trainers staying up late and working throughout the day to just help me
feel better is greatly appreciated. I'm definitely still working on getting to
100 percent.  
  
Q. Have you ever had anything like that before?  
KEENAN EVANS: Not really, not this bad.  
  
Q. Jarrett and Keenan specifically, with the way that Florida just --
they kind of volume shoot threes, several of those guys do, I know you guys
have played good three-point defense all year long, but how about maybe in
this game specifically is it so much more important to keep your rotations up
and be on everybody that's on the line outside?  
JARRETT CULVER: They're a great team. They're a great shooting team, as well,
so we just try to focus on trying to take that part away in a way, so just
focusing on that and our defense turns into offense, so just making sure we
take that away.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: In the tournament, they always talk about threes is what beats
you, so we've just got to be more urgent getting out to that three-point line
and not fouling them on three-point shots and just try to take away what they
do best.  
  
Q. Keenan, can you describe the mindset of maybe taking over a game like
you really have in the second half, and part of that, I don't know if you
watch the NCAA Tournament, if you looked at other players that took over their
team and had great runs in the tournament?  
KEENAN EVANS: It's just, in my mind every night is a senior night for me, so I
don't want to lose, I don't want to go home yet. And as time ticks down, it
just putting more pressure on yourself. If we lose, I feel like it's all on
me, so I just try to do what I can.  
  
I saw some highlights, I think with the Houston game, the guy took over and
just kind of amazing to see other players do it, too, and you're like, I want
to be that guy for my team, whether it's just on the defensive end or the
offensive end.  
  
Q. Jarrett, just kind of talk about how surreal this experience has been
for you because this time last year you were finishing up with the Coronado
Mustangs and now you're sitting up there on the stage. How exciting has this
been for you?  
JARRETT CULVER: It's a blessing to be here most definitely. I am glad to be
here with my team. We set a goal from day one since we started. So just glad
to be here, made March Madness, and we're just trying to do something in it.  
  
Q. For Keenan or any of the guys, the feeling of the crowd last night,
because it was packed with just two Texas teams and just the crowd was
cheering for both, and what are you expecting tomorrow as you guys get back at
it again here?  
KEENAN EVANS: I'm expecting even more fans tomorrow, just because it's a
Saturday, and it's at a pretty good time. Just Raider Nation, I'm hoping they
show up and show out and help us come out with a win.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON: Same as Keenan said. It was a great atmosphere. It was fun to
be a part of, and we kind of knew there was going to be a lot of people here
since we were not that far from school, and the alumni base is huge in Dallas.
We hope to see you guys even more tomorrow.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Just pleased to advance. You know, really proud of our players.
You work so hard, and these games are so hard to win. They really don't define
a season. A lot of really good basketball teams, championship basketball
teams, will leave this tournament at some point, but for us, it's just a deal
where we want to try to live another day as a team that enjoys being around
each other in practice and games, so we just feel fortunate to advance to the
second round.  
  
Our respect for Florida and their program and their coach couldn't be any
higher. This is one of the best offensive teams in college basketball, the
three-point shooting. They're a really good defensive team that gets a lot of
steals and turns you over. And a coach that's one of the best coaches in
college basketball. His teams play hard. They don't beat themselves.  
  
I think they've been to the Elite 8 like the last four or five times they've
been in this tournament. They have our full respect and full attention.  
  
From our standpoint, we think we're going to have to play the best game of the
season tomorrow. That's our approach, and that's our objective.  
  
Q. Could you just speak more to Florida and the way they volume shoot it
with several of those guys from behind three? I know you guys have been good
with three-point defense all year, but how this game might be one of the most
important as far as three-point defense?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, every team in this tournament has a different offensive
identity. And I think it would be safe to say that one of the big parts of
Florida's offense is the three-point shot, both in transition and in the half
court.  
  
So that's going to be a lot of work for us. You've got to kind of pick your
poison. If you try to take away the three-point line, you open yourself up for
drives or inside play. But if you sag back, they're certainly a team that can
beat you with that one weapon. That's something we've got to figure out. I
don't have the answer right now, but I've just got to have to by tomorrow
evening.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Davide's game last night, and
considering the pressure of the situation and the size of the stage, did it
look to you like maybe he's beginning to come of age?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, we really like Moro in our program. We think he's going to
be a great player, highly recruited guy, took some visits to other BCS
schools. I think when our team, Jarrett Culver and Zhaire Smith have gotten a
lot of attention this year for having outstanding freshmen years, which they
should. Culver is a great young talent as well as Z. But I'd put Moro in that
same class. He is just a guy that is kind of waiting his opportunity. Coming
from Italy and being an international player, he played for his national team
this summer, which did not allow him to come to Lubbock for off-season
workouts in the summer and conditioning. The first day that he played was
basically the first day of school. He took a huge adjustment to get used to
the athleticism and physicality of college basketball versus international, so
he's just been trying to keep up.  
  
We have always had a lot of confidence in his talent, his game and his
basketball IQ. He has made some big plays for us this year. He's won four or
five Big 12 games himself with key plays he made down the stretch. It was nice
to see yesterday all his hard work and all the confidence that we have in him
within our program help us win a tournament game yesterday. But I think Moro
is going to be a special player.  
  
Q. When you got to Texas Tech, you had a point guard in Keenan who was
going into your junior year. Can you kind of explain how he's developed his
game and developed as a player to become the guy that you guys kind of look
for to close out games?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, absolutely. I think the first thing you've got to recognize
is Coach Tubby Smith and his staff recruiting Keenan, investing time in him as
a freshman when they didn't have the best of records, but Tubby had a plan,
and Justin and Zach and Norense and Keenan were getting playing time. As a
sophomore, Keenan is the starting point guard on an NCAA Tournament team, the
first tournament team at Texas Tech in over a decade since Coach Knight was
the coach and I was there with him.  
  
And then I think you've got to give our staff some credit for putting him in
some situations offensively where it built up confidence in him, allowed him
to do things, expanded his game a little bit. Thirdly and above all, not even
close, you've got to give Keenan all the credit. The Keenan Evans story is not
me or Tubby. It is Keenan Evans. This guy self-made himself into one of the
best players in college basketball, and I can tell you how he's done it. He's
done it with a lot of work. He's in the gym every day. He's in the film room a
lot. He's a guy that's changed his body in the weight room.  
  
To me, he's everything good about basketball college when you think about
four-year players staying and grinding. I think Keenan will play in the NBA.
The courage he's shown here in the last month with his toe issue to still play
at this level in the kind of pain he's in, I've never coached in the NBA, but
I know those guys look for the intangibles, and that guy's middle name is
intangible. I've never coached a tougher guy than Keenan Evans.  
  
Q. From a baseball analogy, is he kind of like Mariano Rivera for you
guys as far as at the end of a close game, you put the ball in his hands, he
finds a way to either get fouled or finish at the basket? Those finishes he
makes look easy, but those aren't easy plays he's making, right?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, he's a special player. You know, we kind of take what the
game brings to us in terms of finishing. There's different ways we can go, but
certainly Keenan is our point guard, our leader. He has courage to make those
plays in those moments. He wants the ball late. He's earned the right to be in
those moments throughout his career, the ups and downs. So certainly, yeah,
he's one of our better players, and we absolutely want him involved late in
games.  
  
Q. Two quick questions about Keenan. The first one, just how different
was this team during that stretch, though, when he was really hurt? When he
hurt the toe at Baylor and the next two games he really wasn't himself and
then the third game he didn't play?  
CHRIS BEARD: In my personal opinion, a little bit too much has been made of
that. We're playing in the Big 12 Conference, and we're on the road at West
Virginia and at Baylor, and then we've got Kansas. Y'all might have heard of
them. We got them at home.  
  
So I think the relationship between Keenan being out for a little bit and
resting a little bit and us dropping a couple games, obviously that's a
factor, but you also got to consider the other factors.  
  
That stretch also allowed us to learn some things about our team. Other
players were given more minutes and opportunity, and I think that will only
pay dividends -- it paid dividends yesterday, seeing Moro and Niem and
Brandone Francis make big plays down the stretch. So there's no question
that's affected our team.  
  
But everybody in this tournament is affected by something. There's not one
healthy team in this tournament completely. There's not one team in this
tournament that's not overcoming some type of adversity. We've chosen not to
make this an excuse and just keep writing our book and see what happens.  
  
Q. Quite often he has a big second half, and you've seen it time and
time again this year. Is there anything you say to him at halftime, you just
kind of know he's capable of doing that, and I don't have to say much?  
CHRIS BEARD: No. I mean, at this point I listen to Keenan a lot more than I
talk to him. Certainly he's a more aggressive player, the bigger the moment,
but he also does a great job at the point guard role trying to get people
involved early.  
  
I grew up, to me the greatest player ever was Michael Jordan. I grew up in
that generation, no cable TV, but you could watch his game on WGN. He would
always get aggressive as the game goes on, too. Keenan is a floor general.
He's a guy that can play the point guard no doubt, but he can score, which we
need him to do.  
  
Q. Chris, Rick Barnes was in here talking about recruiting and
developing players and stuff. He said, I want to get old and stay old,
speaking about his players. How hard is it trying to balance that, trying to
recruit four, five a lot of repick guys but four-year and three-year guys and
try to have a great team?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, it's definitely a challenge, but I think each program has a
philosophy. Each program has a way they go about it. We are looking forward to
being in the neighborhood of one-and-dones and consistently being able to
recruit top 25, top 30 players. That's where our program is heading. We want
to coach the best players. We have a University and a program that I think
will attract those kinds of guys.  
  
But we also want to balance with developing players. Back in my day, it was
Ronald Ross and Jay Jackson. Now you're seeing it firsthand with Keenan Evans
and Zach and Justin. Coach Smith and those guys started it. We've tried to do
the best we can finishing it. I think there's definitely a balance between
developing players within your program, but also trying to recruit the best
talent you can.  
  
Q. Your high school coach, Mike Kunstadt, was in the stands last night
supporting you. What's your relationship like with him?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I've been very fortunate in my ride as a player and coach,
and something I'm really proud of is I played for two Hall of Fame high school
coaches, Mike Kunstadt at Irving High School right here in the Metroplex, and
Terry Priest, who was also in the stands last night, from McCullough High
School in North Houston Woodlands. My relationship with those two guys is as
important to me as any.  
  
I'm always associated with Coach Knight and Pat and those guys, and I'm very
proud of that, but I'm also very proud of my relationship with my two high
school coaches. Coach Kunstadt taught me about discipline at a young age. He
taught me the pyramid of success with John Wooden, taught me how to put my
socks on without getting blisters, taught me how to play basketball without
dribbling the ball. And then certainly Coach Priest was a guy that believed in
defense and discipline and team basketball. So some of the things that you see
in our teams today are a direct reflection of those guys, Mike Kunstadt and
Terry Priest.  
  
Q. Mike talked a lot about your defense and how proud he is of that
because he feels like he maybe instilled a little bit of that in you. Would
you agree with that?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, that was the only way I had a chance getting on the floor.
Growing up in Irving, I wasn't the most athletic guy. So I learned early on,
you take a charge that makes Coach K happy and you stay in the game. I would
take a lot of charges. But no, that's something I learned from those guys. I
think a lot of programs around the country, they talk about defense, but they
don't live it.  
  
I've said before you go to a high school or junior college practices and you
see the backup people shorts, defense, and then you watch a two-hour practice
and they don't work on defense at all. With us, we talk about it and believe
it. In our 90-minute practice today, we just went over for 70 of the 90
minutes. That was something that started long ago with Coach Kunstadt and
Coach Priest.  
  
Certainly on our staff, Mark Adams, one of our coaches does a great job.
Simply stated, Coach Adams is the best defensive coach I've ever seen. And
that is no disrespect to Coach Knight or Coach Kaspar or all the coaches I've
been around. Mark Adams has a way about defense, and it's been a big part of
our team, our identity, is the work that Coach Adams has done on our staff.  
  
Q. Seems like Zach Smith has really worked his way back from injury and
had a really good game last night. What has he brought to the team?  
CHRIS BEARD: Just like with Keenan, Zach is probably the story nobody is
talking about, and I will because I'm proud to represent Zach and his family,
and be his coach. Zach has been voted to be a preseason all Big 12 player, one
of the top five players in the Big 12, and that's why the coaches in this
league -- and I couldn't vote on my own player. So the other nine coaches in
this league thought Zach was one of the best top five players in this league,
so that says it all.  
  
Zach gets hurt early in our Big 12 season and basically is not a part of our
season really until senior night. So for him to play the way he has in the Big
12 tournament and the way he has in the NCAA Tournament yesterday, I don't
know if I've ever seen a more courageous effort. He obviously doesn't have his
legs and he's trying to get used to the basketball side with the shooting and
the skill, but he's just playing on pure heart right now. But his rebounding
and defensive rim protection last night, he made a big three in our opening
win, I think it was against Texas, in our first-round game. So Zach is just
playing on pure, like, heart and courage right now.  
  
But he, too, is a guy that's got a great future in pro basketball because of
his talent and skill and work ethic, and for us to overcome his injury this
year and be sitting here right now as one of the last 32 teams speaks a lot
for our other guys. For Zach to come back and be able to contribute at this
high of a level just speaks for him and his heart.  
  
Q. Quick question on Brandone Francis. I know he was only at Florida for
a year, but did he give you any insight into anything Florida does offensively
and defensively behind the scenes?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, of course, this happens in coaching from time to time. We
were going over personnel this morning, and we just asked B, do you think
we're right here. And so, yeah, of course, that's kind of a thing that happens
sometimes. Another thing in this game is we played against their power forward
who played at Rice last year. Rice gave us all we could handle. We know how
good he is. He's actually one of my favorite players watching play and stuff.
Yeah, we still talk about his shot fake today. We call it the Rice shot fake.
Now we'll call it the Florida shot fake. But they've got some great players on
this team.  
  
Some of the things that we've seen them do are some of the things that we
believe in in basketball, so we look for a great game tomorrow against a team
that we have nothing but respect for.  
  
Q. Coach, how many teams do you think commit to defense the same way you
do, and why don't more?  
CHRIS BEARD: I don't know. I can't speak for other people. I just know my
coaching journey starting with Coach Kunstadt and Coach Priest all the way up
to my first college job with Danny Kaspar when I was in college with Tom
Penders played defense, pressed, caused turnovers. There's different ways to
play this game. But I learned a lot about competitiveness from Coach Penders
and guarding. Those Texas teams guarded. And if you thought otherwise, then
you just weren't on the inside.  
  
And certainly with Coach Knight, the basis of everything we did was man-to-man
defense. Our Little Rock team was a great defensive team ranked nationally in
the top ten all season long. And that's certainly been what we've tried to get
done this year at Texas Tech.  
  
Playing in our conference with this talent and coaching, it's hard to stay up
in those rankings, but we do stay focused on defense, but I can't speak for
what other people do. I can only speak for what we do. And in our opinion, we
think defense is the key to championship runs.  
  
Q. I know you probably took a lot from Bobby Knight when you were
working for him. Was there one quality more than any other you took from him,
and you don't do the facial expression thing he did, do you?  
CHRIS BEARD: No, I don't have that whip he had. Yeah. I never get tired about
answering these questions. One thing was preparation. Everyone in college
basketball, especially in this tournament, wants to win. Every player, every
coach, we want to win. But it's the people that will do anything to prepare to
win. With coaching, it's just a different level of preparation.  
  
I mean, in this tournament, I saw coach watch practice tape from the day
before. This was his commitment to preparation and watching study, studying
film. I think a lot of people want to win, but coach wanted to prepare to win.  
  
I also think just the commitment to graduating players, Coach was always
talking about so proud of the former players and his graduation rate, what his
guys were doing. I'm really proud of that, too. We had five seniors last year.
All of them graduated. And these guys we're watching right now, Justin, Zach,
Niem, Tommy, Keenan, they're all going to graduate in May. Really proud of
that.  
  
Some of them are already working towards their graduate degree. I learned so
much from Coach Knight, but probably the commitment to academics, and it
wasn't just an APR deal there on paper or something you put in an article. It
was real. Coach wanted everybody who played for us to graduate. He cared about
that, and that's something that's really important to me that I hope in some
way we're emulating.  
  
Q. I've heard you mention your love of Whataburger several times. When
you go, what do you get, and if you don't go to Whataburger, where else do you
go for a burger?  
CHRIS BEARD: That's the only thing, on this Whataburger ride we're on, there's
a lot of other places, too. But Whataburger is a great place. I think
breakfast, we go taquito. If my girlfriend is not with me or my daughters,
I'll go extra cheese. During the day, I'm pretty easy, it's just a one,
mustard, pickle cheese only. I'll go with the milk shake. Another thing I
learned from Coach Knight, a root beer milk shake. I almost got this at Sonic
one time with Coach. The lady is like so you want a milk shake with root beer
in it? No. I want a root beer milk shake. You want the root beer to substitute
the milk? No, I want a root beer milk shake. That is when Coach Knight and I
were on I-20 going to I think to Rockwall High School on that one.  
  
But no, back to Whataburger, I do enjoy a milk shake, but I never substitute
that as my drink. Even in the days where I didn't have much money, and I'm
very fortunate now, I'm blessed, I would never be the guy that substituted it.
I would go ahead, man, I've got to get the unsweet tea, and then I get the
milk shake, too.  
  
Another great thing about Whataburger, too, have you ever been to Whataburger
at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning? Don't go through the drive through. Go in next
time, and just get a corner booth and just watch America. Just watch it.
You'll see so many cool things at Whataburger. You will see a guy pick up a
tab for somebody else. You'll see somebody clean up a plate that wasn't his.
You'll see some of the bad things in America, too, at a Whataburger late, but
I love people watching, and that's one of the many things I do.  
  
Q. I want to ask a Whataburger follow-up about Keenan Evans. What would
Keenan Evans be on the Whataburger menu, if you can figure out what that is?  
CHRIS BEARD: That's a tough one.  
  
Q. I know it's a tough one.  
CHRIS BEARD: Back in the day, you could say stuff like this and your players
would never see it. But today, they see it before I see it. You've got to be
careful. Yeah, I don't know. We've got Moro on our team this year. Moro coming
from Italy, he loves pasta and cheesecake. We try to incorporate that into
every pregame meal.  
  
Classic Moro style, he had been in Lubbock for about 4 or 5 days and he came
to my office, he is a quiet guy, Coach, can I talk to you. He said, Coach, you
don't like those. Normally something is going on. You don't like those. I
said, Moro, come in. He's like, Coach, everything is good, apartment, coaching
staff, language, no problem, academics, I got it, but the fuel the body part,
Coach, because that's what we call the nutrition, fuel our body in the
process, too much chicken strips. Do we eat chicken strips every meal? Is this
America? So we've tried to get away from the chicken strips a little bit this
year and go with pasta and cheesecake for Moro.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Admiral and Grant, I don't know if you guys spent much time looking
at stuff last night, but obviously Loyola had a last-second victory. Did you
guys see any online video of the shot and what did you think about it?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, I was actually at Shake Shack watching the shot. It
was a big shot, and Ingram, who hit it, actually played against him in high
school. He went to Simeon downtown. It was a big shot for him, but really for
their program.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'd say the same thing. It was a terrific shot. Got a
good look, and they're a talented team. They move the ball well, and it was a
competitive game, so I was actually watching it with a couple of teammates in
the hotel room. It was kind of exciting because March Madness, and you kind of
get hyped up for it. It was a good shot.  
  
Q. So he didn't invite you to Shake Shack?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Shake Shack isn't my thing.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, he don't need that. We're going to keep Grant away
from Shake Shack.  
  
Q. If you weren't playing Loyola, would this be a team you might be
rooting for in this tournament?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I'd say so. You like teams like these, the ones that fight all
odds and compete, and that's something that you love. Like we're a type of
team like that. Not many people chose us. We're fighting for the same thing
they are. If we weren't playing them, you'd kind of get excited and you kind
of enjoy March and the madness side of it. But really, we've just got to focus
on the game and play our game.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah. Like he said, most of the times in March Madness, a
lot of people pick the underdogs. They want the underdogs to pick the bigger
schools, just like Buffalo and Arizona last night, teams like that. The
biggest thing about March Madness is anybody can go on a run, and it's about
chemistry and executing and really what goes into winning, people playing
unselfishly and sacrificing for the team and for the greater good. The biggest
thing for us is continue to play hard. We don't have as much talent as other
schools, but we have people that work hard and are willing to go out and do
their jobs consistently. For us, we've just got to continue to do that.  
  
Q. Kyle, Grant sort of brought it up a little bit, but you guys have
been the underdogs all year long. We've asked you about being picked 13th for
months now, and tomorrow you're going to be the bully against a team that is
the underdog. How does that mindset work for you?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I mean, yeah. So you know, like when you've been the underdog
the whole year, you kind of carry a little bit of a chip on your shoulder, and
it's kind of a little bit of a motivation for your team to kind of just do
what you've been working on all off-season and all season.  
  
But just like yesterday's game and just like any other game in the season,
it's just a regular game that we have to go out and we have to work on keeping
our identity and being who we are and playing our Tennessee defense and just
going and playing our basketball. We can't look at it any other way, you know.  
  
Q. Admiral, you touched on this just a little bit just now, but do you
think parity is changing, the definition of a Cinderella, and what is your
definition of a Cinderella?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, the biggest thing is in a Cinderella story, it's
teams that people don't expect to come out and compete against the big dogs. I
mean, I don't believe in a Cinderella story. I believe anybody can be beat. It
just makes a buy-in from a collective unit, and like for us, I would say we
were picked 13th, and the biggest thing for us was we didn't think we were
13th.  
  
When you have that collective group believing in something bigger than
themselves, you can do anything, especially when you put the work in. And when
you put the work in, eventually you'll reap the blessing of it.  
  
So for us, I would say that -- I mean, me personally, I don't believe in
Cinderella story, it's just who wants it more in that aspect.  
  
Q. For the two Jordans, do you guys expect it to be like a road game,
kind of the arena against you guys tomorrow with Texas Tech and Florida fans
cheering for the underdog and trying to get Loyola?  
JORDAN BONE: Yes, I would imagine that the atmosphere would be leaning towards
Loyola. Like Kyle mentioned, simply because they would be considered the
underdog in this, and during this time of the season, that's who people often
root for. I mean, I would imagine that the atmosphere would be like that. It's
kind of been like that the entire season for us, though. I mean, our backs
have been against the wall. We're just ready. We're ready to play tomorrow.  
  
JORDAN BOWDEN: Yeah, like Bone said, Loyola has a lot of fans out there and a
lot of people going against us, but we've just got to go out focused and be
ready for them for tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Admiral, growing up in Zion near Chicago, I was just curious what
were your perceptions of Loyola? Were they ever on your radar screen as a
possible destination?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, they were. They recruited me out of high school, and
in the summers, we would play a lot of Summer Leagues up there, so I would be
in the gym a lot. It's a really nice school downtown, but the biggest thing
for me was I wanted to get out of the cold and snow. I got tired of shoveling
every winter and all that, so I wanted to get out. But I love going home, love
the deep dish pizza, love being downtown and going to Millennium and all that.  
  
It's pretty cool to be able to play against a school like that growing up,
them being right 20 minutes away from the house. But at the same time, I'm
really focusing on playing hard for Tennessee, going out and giving my all for
Tennessee.  
  
Q. Admiral and Grant, I don't know if you saw this, but Loyola has a
98-year-old nun praying for them. How can you guys compete against that?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I don't know. I feel like she's aggressive. You know, she
pushes the ball up the court. (Laughter). But she's super nice. I saw her on
TV. We respect that, and we just -- to have that around is something special,
and you just love it at this time of the year.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, for us, that's hard to compete with, a 98-year-old --
but we have our traditions, as well, but we're just going to go out and
compete.  
  
Q. Kyle, you mentioned a phrase we have to be Tennessee, not let outside
stuff affect us, play our game. How much better have you guys gotten at doing
that this year, just focusing on yourselves and not worrying about the
opponent?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I think a lot better because we were relatively young, you
know, last year, and we got some experience. This year, we've never been a
team that when we went places, we sold out stadiums and stuff like that. We've
been through a lot. We've experienced a lot this year, and I think this team
has matured a lot in the sense of learning how to shut out all the outside
noise and all that stuff and really focus on our game plan, our scouting
report and what we do. I think that we've gotten a lot better at that this
year, and I think that we can continue to get better at that.  
  
Q. Kyle and Grant, after looking at Loyola, what kind of challenges will
they present to you guys defensively, and I guess what did you think about the
way they executed, as well, late game yesterday?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: As I said, they're talented offensive team. They move the ball
really well. They have a lot of motion, and they're just aggressive. And on
defense, depending on the lineup, they might switch everything. You've got to
prepare and execute your game plan. Coaches do a good job preparing us, so
we've just got to go out there, find the shooters, and consistently get those
rebounds, as well.  
  
KYLE ALEXANDER: He got it. He covered it.  
  
Q. They remind you of anyone you guys played this year?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: They run similar offense to Vandy, but the biggest thing is
we've seen pretty much everything you can possibly see offensively. It's just
about going and competing like I said earlier, and being on edge and knowing
what they're going to run and trying to pressure them out of it, just
understanding they're going to do the same thing on the other end.  
  
They're going to switch like Grant said and try to put pressure on us, as
well, but we've got to be aggressive on the boards and be really physical and
be really strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Admiral and Kyle, you guys obviously won a lot of SEC awards after
the regular season, but you guys didn't have anybody on the all-SEC defensive
team. What goes into being such a good defensive team without having any
stand-out individuals?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I was actually surprised that Kyle didn't make it. Actually
that was one of my goals, to be on the defensive team. I didn't really care
about all-SEC to be honest. No disrespect to our league, but I really wanted
to be on the defensive team more than anything. I really thought Kyle would
have made it. But I think it's ironic, us being one of the top five teams in
the country as far as defensive percentages and ratings and all that stuff,
and no one is on the list.  
  
But at the end of the day, most of the time, it's a pain to focus on
statistics. For us, we're going to keep competing and we are going to keep
going out and doing what we do. We're not worried about getting awards or
accolades. We're really just trying to win championships and really make our
University proud, our families proud, and our coaching staff proud.  
  
Q. Admiral, you mentioned playing against Donte; what was the game, and
what were your impressions of him?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, I played against him on the AAU circuit more than
anything. But he's very athletic, very shifty with the ball. I mean, he's a
city kid. He plays city ball, and very tough, tough-nosed guy. But the biggest
thing is a lot of us coming up in that area, that's how we play ball. We're
very tough.  
  
We pride ourselves in being able to get to the rim, being able to shoot the
outside shot and having somewhat of a mid-range guy, guys that can do
everything, and he can do that. He can pose problems for a lot of teams. And
for us, we've just got to be ready to guard that.  
  
Q. Kyle, Loyola really likes to space the floor offensively and do a lot
of driving and kicking and that sort of stuff, and Miami was able to help at
the rim on a lot of their penetration. The way they play, what's the challenge
defensively for you guys? Obviously you guys are a really good defensive team,
but when a team is trying to space you out, what are the challenges for the
team in general?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I'd say the main thing is kind of like our white-line
presence, and that's kind of just loading up in the middle of the paint.
You're not -- when your man is not guarding the ball and somebody on the other
side of the court has the ball, we're loading up on the white line and just
making sure that you're providing help for your teammates because like he
mentioned, defense is really a team thing. You can't just rely on one person
for it. I think that's why our team does so well is because we really play a
lot of help defense. We really help our teammates out.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you update your health? I saw you had an ice pack on your
hip yesterday.  
KYLE ALEXANDER: It was good. I had a little bit of a bone bruise on my hip,
and I've been with the trainers all day, and I will continue to be with them,
see how it goes.  
  
RICK BARNES: Again, you get into this tournament, you realize that everybody
that's playing, they're here for a reason, and you look at Loyola, you realize
they haven't -- they've lost one game since January. You win 29 games. You
shoot 50 percent as a group. Five guys in double figures, it's just a team
that, one, looking at them and watching them play, you enjoy watching them,
the way they share the ball, the way they move the ball, and the way I think
they really understand how to play together.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys looked like they had been here before yesterday.
Were you surprised at the poise that they showed, or what did you expect?  
RICK BARNES: You know, I'm not sure about what to expect, actually. We thought
they would come out a little bit jittery, which they did. We missed some shots
there, but I did feel like looking back on it, they were locked in
defensively. And we had actually told them that coming out of the tournament
in St. Louis that we had really had one really good game where we played for
40 minutes the way we needed to. What team is going to show up here? So they
came out yesterday, and I thought they were really locked in on the defensive
end. Then we did get things going offensively. But to be honest, I wasn't sure
what to really expect.  
  
Q. Rick, these days, is a team in the seed range of Loyola still a
Cinderella, quote-unquote, and if not, what's your definition of a Cinderella
these days?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I think with college basketball now, the parity, and once
years ago when we went back to 13 scholarships and the fact that players
transfer now, we know that there's been an epidemic in college basketball.
Every team has good players. I think you realize that when you start playing
early in the year and you even get into your non-league schedule.  
  
You realize that maybe your players don't see it at first, but I think over
time they really do have a great respect at how many guys in the country can
play.  
  
And so when you talk about a team that -- if you want to say Cinderella,
whatever, it's probably a team that's doing the unexpected. But that could
probably -- that label could be probably said about a lot of people in some
ways. But all I can tell you today in college basketball, there's a lot of
guys that can play, and with the rules where guys can transfer and sit out and
another year of sitting out makes a big difference, and teams that get older,
and most of those guys end up getting older, and teams I think that stay
together.  
  
One thing we wanted to do with our program is get our team old, and we knew we
were going to start young, but we want to get old, and we want to stay old if
we possibly can.  
  
Q. A lot of your players were asked about the 98-year-old nun as the
sixth man for Loyola. I wonder if you worry about that karma, and are you
going to bring in a priest or Chaplin to counter that tomorrow?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I can tell you one of the best things that we've done all
year is we've had a power talk that we have Scott Jackson, who's actually my
pastor and local minister in Knoxville, and Chris Walker, who's with
Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Of all the things that we've done on the
court, my biggest thrill has been to see what's happening with our team within
our program. That's been the biggest thing.  
  
I do believe that God is sovereign. I believe he's in charge and controls
everything. I'm not sure I believe in karma, but I do believe in God and that
he's in control.  
  
But I can tell you, like I just said, what's gone on with our players off the
court has been as big a win for us as winning the games.  
  
Q. You mentioned you want to grow old and stay old. Seniors can kind of
be a lost commodity in college basketball. Will we ever see that change and
maybe the NBA change their one-and-done rule? Could we maybe see more juniors
and seniors in college?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, I do think it will happen. I think the rule is close to
being here. I don't think it'll be a year or so away, maybe even could come in
quicker than that, that high school prospects will have a chance to enter that
league if they want to. I think that's going to happen.  
  
But you look around, there's some teams that have been that way for quite some
time. I mean, Virginia is a team that's shown that. I think of other teams, I
think of Gonzaga has been a team that's done a lot of that, too, Wichita
State, I think of that -- I'm not sure on those, but when I think of that, I
think of guys that have guys that stayed in their program for periods of time
and have had success with it. And I'm sure there's other ones.  
  
I'm not up on all of it, but again, I do think that it'll all trend. I just
think it's just around the corner before the NBA drops that rule and gets guys
come right out of high school.  
  
Q. Rick, you've coached teams that had one-and-done guys and five-star
guys. Now you've got guys who are maybe a little under the recruiting radar.
Is there a difference in groups when you have guys who maybe weren't given all
the notoriety or aren't looking at going to the NBA after one year?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I think there's -- I don't know if there's any one specific
thing. I can tell you, every one-and-done guy that I coached, I really enjoyed
coaching, and the best players that we had at Texas were our hardest working
guys. And I will tell you, whether people believe it or not, they did not come
in with that idea they were one-and-done. If they were, so be it, but they
came in and they put both feet in.  
  
I think where the problem occurs is when they're not putting both feet in, and
they come in like, hey, I'm only going to be here for 8 or 9 months. I've
always thought it was really tough if you sign a terrific player, and the
first thing he says is that he's leaving before he even gets on campus. I
think that's a -- we talked to Gavin about it. We talked to LaMarcus and TJ
and all of those guys to make sure they realized that they were going to have
to come in and be part of a team. And they didn't want to separate themselves
right off the bat.  
  
So I do think it's the way it's handled, but I think we all know that you want
talent and you want to recruit the most talented players you can recruit. But
sometimes in recruiting, those five-star guys are over-recruited, and
sometimes those three-star guys are overrated, and the three-star guys are
underrated.  
  
We ourselves don't put a lot into what other people rate them. We've always
said we're going to go out and rate ourselves and get the guys that we want
and that will fit with what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Rick, in your history in the NCAA Tournament, have you encountered a
double-digit seed like this with the story that people are running around, the
building is getting behind them, they hit a shot like they did yesterday, and
if so, does that stuff matter once the ball is tipped off?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah. I mean, like I said earlier, I remember when we were at
Clemson, I don't remember what the seed was, but I remember playing I think it
was Western Michigan that had five fifth-year players on their team and had
one of those great years. We were banged up a little bit, but still, they beat
us. But you expect that in the tournament. You expect -- there's three sets of
crowds normally at the game. They have their fans. We have our fans. And then
the neutral crowds have always -- most of the time when you think about it,
they go for the underdog or the team wearing the darker jersey. They're not
necessarily the underdog, but they're normally the team that's wearing the
darker jersey.  
  
You expect that, and it can be like a road game if that's what you want to
call it. But you've got to play the game. You've got to get in there, and
you've just got to execute what you've talked about, understand the ups and
downs of a game, and just fight the game and understand it's 40 minutes or
longer sometimes that you've just got to stay focused and locked in and
understand how hard you've got to compete to get the job done.  
  
Q. I want to ask you about Chris Chiozza, the guard for Florida. His
numbers aren't really eye-popping, and this is really his first year being the
full-time point guard, but how have you seen him kind of evolve kind of from
your side of the court as far as him becoming a player who's kind of, I guess,
the key to Florida maybe?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you love him. When you coach against him, he's the kind of
player that he's got tremendous speed and quickness. And when he gets going
downhill and he's a guy that really wants to pass the ball, I think Mike has
done a terrific job with him. He's improved a lot from a year ago, where I
think he's much more under control, a guy that really looks to play the
position the way coaches want it played.  
  
But when he really -- and they're obviously a heavy ball screen team, and when
he gets going downhill, he can really create havoc for your defense. So he's a
guy that going into the game that you have to give a lot of attention to
because if you don't get him contained and under control, he will set up a lot
of guys, and he can get to the basket and finish, as well. He can shoot the
ball. But again, his biggest improvement I think has been the way he has
really learned to get his teammates involved.  
  
Q. Back to the 98-year-old nun and God for a second, what kind of
control do you think God will have on the outcome of the game, and can you
tell us a little bit more about the power talks?  
RICK BARNES: Again, I think -- all I can tell you is I think God is sovereign,
and that means I think he's in charge of everything. He's the only guy that
knows the future because he's made the future.  
  
Our power talks, what we wanted to do was Chris Walker came in, and since we
have been there, we've had fellowship of Christian Athletes, Athletes in
Action, both were on campus. But when Chris Walker played for  
  
Coach Fulmer, and when he came back, I met him, and I knew a year ago he was
going to move back to Knoxville and be -- leave that chapter on campus. And I
just -- and he's one of the finest people I've ever been around. I just said,
I'd like to be someone that's going to really be invested in our program and
be around.  
  
I look back on my time as a head coach, there's a lot of things I wished I
could go back and do different. And one of them would be I wish I would have
done what we've done this year a long time ago. And it's something that during
those power talks, he's going to share the gospel. He's a former player that
understands athletics, but he is a very transparent person. He along with
Scott Jackson. It's real, and we talk about it because we know just in the
last really two and a half, three weeks, people that I know have passed, and
you realize the brevity of life and how quickly it goes.  
  
One of our former players, the first player that we signed at Texas, Chris
Owens, came by this morning to the hotel and had breakfast with us, and one of
the neat things has been to watch -- I've coached so many guys that have grown
up to become wonderful fathers and very successful in what they do.  
  
But what we've done with this team, like I said, with our power talks and what
those guys have done has been just really something I'm most -- probably as
proud of as anything we've done this year.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Loyola's big Cameron Krutwig, and how do you
plan on stopping him from getting down and scoring a lot from the post
tomorrow?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, you love their balance as a team. Five guys in
double figures, you're obviously going to look at each player and see what you
can do with as many tendencies as they have.  
  
But he's a terrific player. We've always said, we don't think we can stop
anybody one-on-one. Our whole defense is set up on being a sound defensive
team as a team. And we expect our players to be on edge and understand
whatever coverage we're in with ball screens, whatever we're doing when the
ball goes into the post, understanding the scouting reports, and if we feel
like we want to help off of and who we don't want to help off of. So it goes
back to our game plan in terms of each individual guy, how we're going to try
to play him to -- really try to get as much done as we can on the defensive
end.  
  
Q. I know you're a big fan of Bob McKillop at Davidson. I was curious in
the evolution of your offense, maybe how much the Davidson offense influenced
that in any way?  
RICK BARNES: Oh, yeah, Bob and I were together at Davidson. And truly a man
that I -- a great friend, and as a man I admire as much as anybody I've been
in the business with. Just, again, a great basketball coach. And yeah, I've
learned from Bob. There's no doubt I've learned from him. But we've taken some
of the things that he does along with some things I've learned from Gary
Williams and Wimp Sanderson that we're using this year -- back, again, some
things from Alabama, some things that -- so we put it all together, and we
will continue to do that, along with some of the things that my current
coaching staff, that we think fits our team.  
  
We've always believed that we're going to change the system for the players to
help them as opposed to trying to always force feed them into something they
can't do, and we're not a heavy ball screen team. We have it as part of our
package, but that's not what we do. But we can. We like the movement. We want
to be different. We want to play inside-out, and everybody knows that, so
there's no secrets with that.  
  
I've been very blessed and been around a lot of terrific coaches and
assistants and guys I've worked for that we've used a little bit of all of it
that I've learned through the years.  
  
Q. What's gone into Derrick Walker kind of cycling out of the rotation a
little bit?  
RICK BARNES: It's nothing -- Derrick hasn't done anything. It's just Fulke has
been a guy that's continued to improve, and Derrick is the same way. We look
at both of those guys based on match-ups. That's what we base it on. But
Derrick hasn't done anything. He's ready to play. Fulke is a guy that's given
us good minutes the last couple games, and we're going to need them all
tomorrow. And we know that, but Derrick is getting better, but he hasn't done
anything, it's just a matter of the match-ups that we've seen.  
  
Q. I don't know how much you're aware of this, but the SEC has gotten
off to a pretty quick start in the tournament, I think winning their first
five games. What does that say about the league, not only getting a lot of
teams in, but making the most of that opportunity?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you know, as a league, we talked about how good we think
our league has been, and it was a good league. I've said every year, I think
every league is good, you know, but who's the better league, that can be
debated all the time.  
  
But I can only tell you from experience, this year, it was as tough a league
as I've ever been a part of from top to bottom. It was amazing. And then I'm
excited because I like to be -- every year I tell people all the time, when
this season is over with in another two weeks, people are going to start
projecting next year how many teams the ACC is going to get in. Somebody is
going to throw out eight or nine or ten. Somebody is going to throw out the
Big 12 getting in seven or eight.  
  
I want the SEC to be a team that people know from the beginning. They're going
to get seven, eight teams in. And on a bad year, it's going to be seven. And
on a great year, it can be eight or nine as opposed to people might say --
most people have said four or five since I've been here in the three years.
And hopefully to do that -- and probably in the past, that's probably what
they were doing. I'm not saying they won't do it anymore, but change in
perception is a hard thing to do, but it started a year ago.  
  
So the start of this tournament, I was with our commissioner who has done a
terrific job. And he said, you know, I was so excited when it came out with
the number of teams we got in, but now I'm as nervous as I've ever been
because we need to do well, and we know that.  
  
Hopefully we can continue to do well. We've got some terrific coaches in our
league and guys that know what they're doing, and recruiting has been great in
our league. We've got good teams. We really do. And there's some other teams
that were right there that probably had a chance, but you end up beating up on
each other.  
  
Q. Your kids talk a lot about the team defense concept that you just
mentioned and seem to take a lot of pride in that. Can you talk about tweaking
your defense, your basic defensive philosophy from year to year, and how you
adjust things to the personnel you have?  
RICK BARNES: Well, for three years at Tennessee, we haven't been very good on
defense. One of the hardest things to do as a coach is when you know you're
going to struggle on offense if certain guys go out of the game. When we first
got there, we knew we had two seniors that had to play 35, 36 minutes a game
in Armani Moore and Kevin Punter, we had to basically tell those guys, you
guys can't get in foul trouble.  
  
So you basically -- not that they would -- both of those guys were really big
competitors, but we couldn't extend our defense. We couldn't pressure the way
we wanted to. And at the end, we were only playing six or seven guys. Last
year, we had a lot of these guys back -- these guys come in and they were
young and had no idea how hard you have to play at this level to be a good
defensive team. They had no idea.  
  
But we knew that after last year, the biggest way we could improve would be on
the defensive end. If you go back and look at numbers, you'd be surprised if
you rebound the ball three more times a game how you can go from being in a
team that's in over 200 to the top 25. If you turn the ball over three times,
the same numbers show up.  
  
So we talked about how we've got to improve on -- we really talked about four
or five possessions, that we've got to get better at defensive rebounding. We
need to do a better job on the offensive boards, got to get consecutive stops
more. So our personnel and the one thing with this year's team by having the
depth, we told our guys if they're not going to play hard on defense, they're
not going to play, and I think they know that.  
  
Hopefully we can -- and we think we can be better, and going forward, we hope
that we can be a better defensive team because we think we can be.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Chris Chiozza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33167)

### [Egor Koulechov](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35004)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Florida - 77, St. Bonaventure - 62  
  
MIKE WHITE: Just very pleased with the overall performance, of course. Beat a
really good St. Bonaventure team who's obviously been playing really, really
well. Like to congratulate St. Bonaventure and Mark Schmidt and his players.
They had a great run, an amazing year. They play as hard in my opinion as any
team in college basketball, have a terrific backcourt, share it, really defend
at a really high level.  
  
We've had some quality wins this year. We've had some big wins, and this was
certainly one of them.  
  
Q. How much do you think the defense, particularly early in the second
half, kind of set the tone for you guys?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: That's what got us going. We got stops early in the second
half, and we got out running and got some easy baskets in transition, and we
just kind of built the momentum from there, and we was able to maintain it for
most of the second half.  
  
Q. It seemed like the game plan was to shoot over their zone and
eventually guys started hitting shots. You guys went through some droughts,
but how much did sticking with it kind of help, or did you feel like you could
have attacked it better at times?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Maybe at times we could have attacked it better, but I felt
like even in the first half when we went through that drought, we felt like we
were getting really good shots, and we felt like if we keep getting those, we
were going to be okay. We had a good game plan coming in. They changed the
pace of the game with that zone, but eventually we figured it out. Shots
started falling, and we defended at a high level. Like you said, the first
four minutes especially, that was our main emphasis coming out of halftime.  
  
Q. Chris, you guys held Mobley and Adams to only 21 points. Did you feel
like coming into the game if you were able to limit them effectively you'd be
on the right step to victory?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Those are two great guards, and we had to focus in on them
along with Stockard. Those are their three main guys that score. We just
wanted to make it tough for them to score, not give them any open looks early,
get it going.  
  
They hit a couple tough ones, but when you're playing good players, and we did
a good job of not getting that let to our confidence, and we played hard the
whole game and was able to keep them from doing what they normally do.  
  
Q. Chris, 11 more assists tonight, the ability to kind of find your
teammates, particularly when you went through some stretches against the zone,
how key was that, and how key was the ball movement at times?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I mean, guys were knocking down shots. We did a good job of
moving the ball. We didn't really rush anything. We found open guys. Guys did
a good job of moving around the zone. When I penetrated, they would relocate,
and I was able to just find them, and they had confidence.  
  
I'd just tell them every time they're open, shoot it. If it's an open look,
we're never going to get mad if they miss them.  
  
Q. Egor, I see a scratch on your shoulder. Was that kind of just the
kind of game it was in terms of the physicality and the desperation --  
EGOR KOULECHOV: No. That's actually courtesy of Kevarrius Hayes a couple days
ago. He actually scratched my other shoulder, as well. I don't know how that
happens, but yeah, it just kind of happened. It's not a big deal, honestly.  
  
Q. The play Jalen Hudson made with the put-back dunk, what went through
your mind when that happened?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I don't know. I was just like -- I was kind of shocked. I
couldn't believe he made it. He got up over his own teammates, the other team.
I think his head was over the rim.  
  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah. I had a good look at it from the corner, so I kind of
saw the whole play develop, and the first thing I just kind of said, like wow,
he looked like he literally like climbed a ladder to get that. And then I
heard the foul, too. It was a great play. Jalen is a top athlete, scorer,
whatever. He can make those plays.  
  
Q. Thoughts on going into next round and potentially playing against
what's going to be a pretty hostile environment here?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah. Yeah. We've kind of got to settle, move on from this
victory. Tomorrow obviously we're going to watch some film. We've got to be
prepared for a hostile environment, obviously. We're in Texas. We saw they
have a lot of crowd here. But we're going to do our best, treat it as every
other game this year, lock in on our end, try to defend at a high level, get a
good scouting report in. Yeah.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, we know it's going to be hostile, a lot like we've played
in neutral site games, a lot of those have been like road games to us,
especially early in the season when we played Gonzaga in Portland.  
  
We're just going to come out and focus on our game plan, focus on us, and
whatever the coaches tell us, they're going to have us prepared as well as we
can be. They take pride in that, and that's why they're such good coaches.
We're going to come out and do whatever they say, play hard, and just be ready
for a fight.  
  
Q. Egor, how much does this kind of much better NCAA memory for you than
your freshman year?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: A lot better, a lot better. I was hoping not to have another
bad one. This is like four years later. I mean, that's what I wanted when I
came here. We're obviously not done, still hopefully a lot of basketball to be
played, but this team, the coaching staff, they've been awesome. It's just the
whole experience, just even not from the NCAA Tournament, just the whole year,
it's been amazing.  
  
Q. Chris, this has been such a roller coaster season, and you have a
national analyst that's picking against you again after leaving the SEC
tournament early. What does it say about this group that it kind of took that
to heart and bounced back tonight and showed the kind of effort that it
showed?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It's always, you know, a chip on your shoulder when you're
picked to lose in the first round as a higher seed for the second year in a
row. You know, it just gives you a little bit more fuel just to go out there
and prove people wrong, but again, you try not to make too much out of it, go
out there and try to treat it like any other game. You don't want to get too
excited for it because people are talking about you, but of course it gives
you a little bit more -- a little more spunk to your game.  
  
Q. Last year you faced the Bonnies in Florida. Mobley and Adams dropped
a combined 48 against you guys. How much did seeing them just a year ago and
rewatching film from that game help you prepare for tonight's matchup?  
MIKE WHITE: I think it was definitely to our advantage to understand how good
they are individually and obviously as a team, to have experienced it
firsthand. I think that if this was the first time we had played them, we
definitely wouldn't have been as prepared. I have the utmost respect for the
job, again, that Coach Schmidt and St. Bonaventure have done and the program
that they've rebuilt here as of late.  
  
Obviously for their backcourt, those guys, they went nuts on us last year in
Lakeland late in the game. I want to say we were up 15-17 and it was tied with
about a minute, minute and a half if I'm not mistaken. They're a handful to
guard, and our guys know -- they were very familiar, especially our veteran
guys lead by Chris Chiozza and KeVaughn Allen, I thought both did a terrific
job tonight. They know that when Adams and Mobley cross half court, they're in
range, and they can score off the bounce. They can score off the bounce. They
score off down screens, off staggers, off hand-offs. We went under one early
on Mobley where he made us pay, of course, from really deep.  
  
But they're just really good guards, and they run good stuff. So obviously I'm
really pleased with our defensive effort.  
  
Q. What do you sort of tell your team at halftime, and what was the
attitude even though you guys were only up by five and the offense wasn't
great, the defense was still there?  
MIKE WHITE: Stay the course offensively. I liked our ball movement in the
first half. We missed a couple more right at the rim. We'll continue to
address. I thought we had decent looks from three against a really good zone
because we're a really good passing team, especially certain lineups that we
play, of course, and Keith Stone and Egor playing in the middle of zones and
playing in the corners and short corners, they have an ability to find guys.
And then we've got multiple guys that can make shots. So we try to spread
zones out as much as possible. Try to do the same thing against man.  
  
And I thought we had some decent looks, so I was actually pleased. We just
talked about staying the course, focusing on getting a great shot, not the
result. Whether it goes in or not, next possession, let's get a great shot.
And more than anything, first four minutes of the second half, getting back to
that same edge defensively, making sure that we came out, because we've had
struggled. A lot of teams have struggles first four minutes of the second
half, regaining that defensive edge and energy that we played with in the
first 20.  
  
Q. Mike Okauru went down with what looked like a head injury, looked
like he took a shot to the head there at the end. How is he doing, and will he
be able to go on Saturday?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I anticipate he'll be fine. I asked him how he was feeling
and he said great. He just bumped his head. I think we had a few guys bump
their heads tonight by the Bonnies and by each other.  
  
Q. How big was it for Jalen and Egor to both kind of give you
production, especially coming off the game against Arkansas?  
MIKE WHITE: It was great. I mean, it's crucial for us to get balanced scoring.
It's who we are. It's allows us to spread the floor. It promotes that movement
of the basketball. Jalen, it took him a little while and he finally got going.
He had a huge play, of course. Egor was great offensively for the better part
of the game, of course.  
  
We were led by Chris Chiozza, 11 assists, zero turnovers. My goodness, it's a
luxury to have as a head coach. When the ball is in his hands, good things
happen. He drew fouls, as well, got guys shots, and he probably could have had
15 assists if we shot it at a really high clip.  
  
In addition, he chased Mobley around for 40 minutes whenever he was in the
game. However many minutes he played, he was chasing him around. Looks like
31. And I thought KeVaughn Allen in addition, he didn't get it going
offensively for us. I thought he was terrific on Jaylen Adams.  
  
It was a good overall team defensive effort, again, led by Chris Chiozza and
KeVaughn Allen. Those guys really dug in and stepped up knowing how important
it was to slow those terrific guards down.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Scott Nagy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23525)

### [Loudon Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34983)

### [Everett Winchester](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35057)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Tennessee - 73, Wright State - 47.  
  
SCOTT NAGY: Well, I think it's kind of the obvious. You just can't play as
poorly as we did offensively and win an NCAA game, not against a game like
Tennessee. We talked about this, that we were going to have to play great on
both ends. And we struggled offensively this year.  
  
We haven't been a great offensive team. We've had some ups and downs. We've
been in some games like this where we've played this poor offensively and won,
but when you're playing Tennessee, that just isn't going to happen.  
  
Pleased with the kids, how hard they played. We got good shots. We did
everything we needed to do. And then it just puts so much pressure on your
defense. I thought defensively we were really good. Now, we didn't rebound the
ball as well as we should have. And when you miss as many shots as we did,
you're going to get beat on the glass.  
  
I've got nothing to complain about with how hard our players played.  
  
Q. Loudon, you're only ten minutes in the first half, how frustrating
was that sitting there, you waited all this time to play in a game like this,
and to have to watch it from the bench?  
LOUDON LOVE: It's tough from a personal standpoint, not just because I'm
sitting there, because I can't contribute for the team for at least those ten
minutes. And it really stopped me from going in the first half with those
fouls. You've got to be smarter. We knew that. We knew they were physical, and
you just can't make stupid fouls, but definitely difficult.  
  
Q. Did you feel they were coming at you, or was that just kind of in the
flow of the offense?  
LOUDON LOVE: I think it was in the flow. The first one was not ideal for me
when I wait for it, just catch and post at 15 feet. There's no reason to push
him down. And I think it was just in the flow of the offense, not getting
through screens and such.  
  
Q. Everett, you were really the only offense that they had there in the
first half. It looked like the stage wasn't too big for you. What did that
feel like getting out there and attack being early on?  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: For me, it felt good, of course, because if it wasn't for
my teammates and my coaches believing in me, none of that would have happened.
I don't know. It's just hard because I know we have some great offensive
pieces, and shots didn't fall for us. I made some shots that I just wish we
all as a team would have made shots together.  
  
Q. Tennessee defensively, did they do anything that gave you particular
trouble today?  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: Tennessee, they're really physical on defense. They're in
the lanes. They attack the ball. And they just pressure a lot. I think we have
some pretty good looks out there. We just couldn't knock down the shots.
That's just how I feel.  
  
LOUDON LOVE: Yeah, like Everett said, they're definitely a physical group, but
I found myself out of control and stuff due to own pace, and it was tough
getting gauged at the beginning of the game to what it was like, and them
being physical like they are and athletic, it just made it more difficult.  
  
Q. How unsettling was it for you guys to see Grant struggle like that? I
know he kind of gives you guys a spark, and he couldn't buy a basket.  
LOUDON LOVE: I mean, whether it was emotionally shooting the ball or whatever,
he carried this team almost all year. Both the seniors, him and Trey, even
Trey on practice squad. It's hard to see him play his last college career game
like that. You wish both of them would drop, but we know he was trying to make
each one, so we can't blame him for anything.  
  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: Although he wasn't hitting shots, he was the first one,
the main one out there with a smile on his face still. I know he missed one,
and he said, the next one has to fall, with a smile on his face. He's a very
important piece to this time. Without him, we're not here. It was hard seeing
him miss shots, but it kept us motivated.  
  
Q. Just how would you kind of sum up your NCAA Tournament experience?  
LOUDON LOVE: It was neat. Shorter than I would have liked.  
  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: I agree with Loudon. It was really a great experience, but
of course, we wish we could have advanced.  
  
Q. How tough was that to have Loudon on the bench with foul trouble
almost the whole first half?  
RICK BARNES: You know, it was more frustrating than anything. His third foul
was his fault, just because he was standing straight up and got screened. And
he's obviously an important part of our offense.  
  
But you know, I don't think it impacted us that much. You know, I think when
we go back and look at this, two things: Tennessee has been good defensively
all year, and so it's to be expected a little bit. And we got some great
shots. We flat-out got great shots, particularly in the second half, we got
great shots and just didn't make them.  
  
You know, you're not going to be able to play with Tennessee if you don't play
well offensively, and we didn't. And too, honestly, the first two fouls Loudon
got were not good fouls for him. He just wasn't -- early in the game, he just
wasn't in a good spot.  
  
Q. Just a little bit on Benzinger's struggles today and also I think he
banged himself up diving on the floor?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, I mean, you're going to have games like that. You are.
Grant has had people sticking to him all year, and so I don't think that was
any different for him. I mean, he's had the kind of defensive players that
Tennessee has guarding him all year, and so I don't think -- I'm not knocking
Tennessee. I'm just saying I don't think that necessarily was the impact, and
Grant has had some tough offensive games.  
  
Sometimes he takes some tough shots, but we've asked him to do that because he
can make tough shots, and he's put the time in, so we live with it. It's just
-- I don't know what to tell you. He just had a tough game offensively. You
know, then when he dove on the floor there, he's had basically a hole in his
hip. When I went down and looked at it, it was probably two inches wide, and
I'm sure they're going to have to stitch him up before we go home, but I mean,
he's had a hole in his hip because he dives on the floor like that all the
time, and he reopened it when he dove on the floor.  
  
Q. 2 of 15, 5 minutes left in a blowout and he's diving on the floor,
does that kind of sum up his career?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, it wouldn't matter what the score is, that's the way he
plays. That's the way he plays in practice. I've said that several times, I've
had to ask him to stop doing stuff like that in practice because we have to
keep him healthy. But it isn't going to matter to him what the score is. He's
been -- he has been the heartbeat of our team all year.  
  
Q. What was the message in the locker room afterwards, to kind of look
at the broad picture as opposed to today?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, and it's hard. I've had to give that speech 23 times now
because I've ended every one of my seasons with a loss. It's hard for the kids
to hear it right there. Doesn't matter what you say to try to make them feel
better. They don't feel better at that point. I think as time goes on, they'll
be able to look back and see what a special season this was. But one thing I
told them, I haven't enjoyed every team that I've coached. I wish I could say
that I have, but I have really enjoyed these guys. This team has been a joy to
coach, and for as thin as we were and as young as we are, having accomplished
so much. And the key now is to make it a habit. And it's hard. It's hard for
teams at our level to get back here. But if you can get in here and have
players that have been to it two or three times, then these kind of things
change.  
  
Q. I know everything starts at 0-0 next year, but what kind of carryover
can there be for like a freshman like Everett, the way he came out and
attacked early?  
RICK BARNES: I mean, for everybody, the expectations for our whole team should
change in terms of how we prepare for next year and what they think. We
primarily lose one guy that has played for us, and we're adding six, six good
players. So our depth is going to change a lot. It's going to be very
competitive. But the guys that are coming back understand what it takes, they
understand the culture that's needed, and they'll be able to teach the new
guys, and so we're obviously very excited about the future. Just it's hard to
think about those things today.

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Porter Moser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26501)

### [Marques Townes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30631)

### [Clayton Custer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32693)

### [Donte Ingram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30355)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola - 64, Miami - 62  
  
PORTER MOSER: You know, first of all, God is good. He blessed this group. We
give the glory to him. He blessed our University, this group. He blessed me
being able to coach resilient kids.  
  
The second thing with these young guys, we're in the huddle. Even when we were
down seven, it was just about keep fighting, keep fighting. There's no quit in
these guys. They believe. They share the ball. We had 19 assists. And a great
example is that last pass to Donte with Marques to find it.  
  
They made big shots. Clay made a big shot on an action we run in the corner.  
  
Very, very blessed that we have kids that do not quit, that are resilient.  
  
Q. Donte, just describe the shot and just the feeling when that goes
in?  
DONTE INGRAM: I mean, it was a great feeling. I thank Marques for making that
pass. Any one of us could have hit that shot, but I was just fortunate enough
to be in the position. And when I seen the shot and I had space, I was
confident, and it went in, luckily.  
  
Q. Before that happened, before the time-out, what was the discussion
like in terms of what the plan was if you missed, and how close did what
happened was it to what you wanted, what was planned?  
DONTE INGRAM: Well, if our five man would have got the rebound, we would have
called a time-out. Since a guard got it, you know, Coach just had faith in us
and said let's go. We're under attack. At that point, it is just up to us to
make a play, and luckily we came through with a play.  
  
Q. Clay, you had that game-tying shot. Can you just talk about that pass
from Ben and what went on with that play?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, that's another example of Ben knowing where I'm going
to be before anybody else knows where I'm going to be. No, it's a credit to
Coach. I mean, we work on situations like that in the last four minutes every
day in practice.  
  
We try to be the best team at executing down the stretch. And I mean, we've
worked on that action a hundred times. We felt comfortable running it, and we
executed it perfectly. And it was lucky enough to make the shot.  
  
Q. For all of you, you guys were picked as an upset pick, and there's
some pressure on you, highlight game. Just how did you kind of keep -- in such
a tight situation in the game, your coach mentions the time-out, keeping cool.
How did you manage to keep your cool through all of this?  
MARQUES TOWNES: I mean, we go through those situations all the time. Nothing
has changed. We talk about in the huddle the last four minutes, just give it
everything you've got and don't break, don't break on defense, just stay and
execute our plays.  
  
Yeah. We just talk about just never give up. And he just talked about in the
huddle, Coach always emphasizes, don't break, don't break. These last four
minutes, don't break.  
  
DONTE INGRAM: I mean, we just all have confidence in each other. Like Marques
said, we go through those situations in practice all the time. So we know it's
a full 40 minutes to play, and we all want to stay together, stay connected.
And if we do that and leave it all out there, we have a chance to win.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, I don't know. Coach does a great job of making sure we
keep our blinders on. In a situation like the NCAA Tournament, there's so many
distractions around us and cameras following us around everywhere.  
  
He closed the doors on everybody and just told us like it's time to play, it's
time to focus. And I don't feel like we had pressure on us to win. I mean,
we're in the situation where we can go out there and play free and play the
way we've been playing all year. And I think we're a scary team if we're
playing free and like we have nothing to lose. I think that's a big part of
what we've been doing.  
  
Q. For each of the three players, as you guys left the court, you all
stopped and greeted Sister Jean. Can you talk about what she means to the team
and if you have any stories that illustrate what type of person she is?  
DONTE INGRAM: Sister Jean, she has meant so much to me personally and
obviously the team. She is there before every game. She's saying a prayer
before every game. After the game, she sends a general email to the team. And
then at the end of the email, it'll be individualized, hey, Donte, you did
this, you rebounded well tonight. Even though they were out there to get you,
you still came through for the team. She's just so special, her spirit. She's
just so bright, and she means so much to the city of Chicago and Loyola
obviously and the team.  
  
MARQUES TOWNES: Yeah, she gives us great, great scouting reports. But no,
Sister Jean, she's just a wonderful person. Just to have her around and her
presence and her aura, when you see her, it's just like the world is just
great because just her spirit and her faith in us and Loyola basketball and
just her being around, she's the biggest Loyola fan I've ever met in my entire
life. And just having her and her giving us our pregame prayers, just having
her here is just a real blessing.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, I mean, Sister Jean is like when you talk to her when
she's in the same room as you, it warms your heart. She just has such a
positive energy around her. I mean, she's obviously just amazing. For her to
be doing what she's doing at her age, it's amazing, and it's inspiring, and I
think -- I mean, I think her prayers definitely mean a little bit extra when
she prays for us. She's huge for us, and she's huge for our success.  
  
Q. It's an overused statement, but defense wins ballgames, and it took a
defensive play to set up the winning basket. I know you practice offensive
plays, but how much of a high emphasis do you put on defense in your game
plan?  
MARQUES TOWNES: I would say defense is at the top, the top, top, top with us
because defense wins championships. I mean, offense can win us a couple games
here and there, but we really take pride in our defense. You know, we set game
goals for our defense. We want to keep them at a certain percentage, limit
them to a certain amount of offensive rebounds on the glass. And you know, I
don't think we got our field goal percentage today, but that just shows that
we don't ever quit. I've never seen these guys quit all year, and we're just
looking forward to this next game.  
  
Q. Donte, back to the shot, this is the kind of thing that this month is
all about. You've seen it before, growing up and everything, hitting the game-
winning shot against the higher-ranked team. Does it really set in for you
yet?  
DONTE INGRAM: I mean, man, I've been saying all the last week when people have
been asking me how does it feel to get to the tournament, and I've been
saying, this is -- as a kid, this is what you grow up seeing, hoping that you
can be in that moment. For me to be in this position with these guys, with
this coaching staff, I wouldn't want it any other way, and I'm just obviously
blessed to hit that shot, and I'm happy that we can get on and advance to
Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, how discouraging was it at times, and you talked about that
resilience, did you sense that your team maintained its confidence, or did you
see any kind of -- any signs that they wouldn't be able to come back?  
PORTER MOSER: The only negative sign I saw was the first couple minutes
defensively in the second half, and then we had a media, and we kind of got
after them a little bit, and then we were guarding the way we were guarding.  
  
But like we were down seven at a time-out. I think I called a time-out, and it
was all about us regrouping, moving forward. We'd been in that position many
times where we've gotten down, and we don't quit. These guys understand that
there's a lot of possessions left. They understand that we can have great
possessions on both ends. And that's what it was about. It was about great
possessions, getting the defense, getting our -- and we always talk about
this, and I think you've heard me say this, our defense has got to dictate our
offense.  
  
I think we came out of that time-out, and then Ben Richardson got a great
steal and then kicked it up, and we got a lay-up. That's one of those
intangible plays we talk about. Our defense created it. We needed a play like
that bad.  
  
It shows you the intangibles with Ben. You look at Ben, Ben didn't score
tonight, he was unbelievable. He had some really good plays defensively, and
he had eight assists, one turnover, one block. I mean, that's got to be a
career. One steal, five rebounds. I mean, the kid does anything he needs to do
to win, and he is just a winner.  
  
Those are things that guys like Ben, Marques, we're in the huddle, and it
wasn't any panic. It was about getting back, grinding defense, sharing the
ball.  
  
Q. This hot streak that you guys have been on, how much confidence is
that giving to your team as you enter this tournament, and also, have you
mentioned to them it's been 55 years since Loyola Chicago won the National
Championship?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, they're well aware of the National Championship, the guys
on the team. In terms of where we're at, a lot of people talk about the
conference tournament is a new season, NCAA Tournament is a new season. We've
never viewed it that way. We wanted to continue on what we were doing.  
  
The thing about this hot streak, we didn't talk -- I don't even know if the
guys -- we've even talked about how many we've won out of -- in a row. It's
all about this mentality of get better. We said before the -- we said before
the conference tournament, those four or five practices we had, we said, we've
got to get better this week. So then we had some time off, and there was a lot
of questions about how's your team going to handle 11 days off. And it's the
same mentality we've had all year. We can't control that. What can we control?
We did situations all week. We worked on that play that Clay hit all week, all
right, and that's what you do. You control things you can control.  
  
These guys believe, and we got better this week. We got better, and that's why
we're not dwelling on the past. These guys really got a good mentality because
of their culture and because of their togetherness.  
  
Q. Clayton was talking about how you keep blinders on them and that
allows them to play free. Can you just talk about your philosophy and what you
do to handle all the extra stuff?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, what we've talked about is this: I was asked a question
yesterday: Are you guys letting the guys enjoy the moment? 100 percent I've
been letting them enjoy the moment. It's been great for them. They come down,
and heck, we got a police escort to the arena. These guys, we went around
Chicago, Chicago is buzzing like crazy. I want them to enjoy that. They've
worked so hard to get here.  
  
What our blinders is, as we talk about, is when it's time to be in a film
session, when it's time to be in a practice, it is blinders with a focus. And
it's a credit to them. They've bought into that.  
  
So we got off the bus, and there was TV cameras everywhere, and then we went
in, I wouldn't allow anybody in from that point on. That's what he meant. We
closed the door, and we all just had blinders now. We got our blinders on, and
it's all about the next two hours.  
  
And these guys have -- you've got to be mature to do that, but I want them to
enjoy the moment. These guys are unbelievable. I'm so blessed. We're having
this journey with unbelievable guys. I want them to enjoy this, and I'm able
to do that -- if I thought we had an immature group that wouldn't focus, I
probably would have been a little bit more this, but we've really just been
talking about the blinders when we get in the film, when we get into practice,
and they've been practicing their butt off. Our walk-through this morning was
just absolutely laser, right on, what we were trying to do.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Lonnie Walker IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34997)

### [Ja'Quan Newton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33217)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola - 64, Miami - 62  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, it's pretty simple to know why we call it March Madness.
Unbelievable great game, both teams played very hard. We did some very good
things and shot the ball over 50 percent, 44 percent from three, out-rebounded
them. But was one big play after another, and it was a close contest
throughout, and they made the last big play. They hit that three that
basically won the game for them.  
  
Hats off to them, and congratulations to the Loyola basketball program.  
  
Q. JaQuon, can you kind of run us through that last play?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Lonnie was at the line. He had missed the shot, and he had an
opportunity when they got the rebound to run, and I couldn't really see what
happened because I wanted to go find my man. I just seen the ball go in the
net.  
  
Q. You guys obviously see these kind of things happen and you never
think it'll happen to you. You dream about you being the one that makes the
big shot. Lonnie, how about you from that perspective, what's the feeling out
there?  
LONNIE WALKER IV: After they made the shot, I mean, it's definitely a dagger
to the heart. It for surely hurts because your teammates, such as JaQuon who's
a senior, you come to the realization it's your last game with them. It
definitely hurts seeing a shot like that go in, but I'm proud of my team and
how we fought and how we played. Hats off to them, and hope they do well in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, we asked you a little bit the other day about the 6-11 seed.
Now you're on the other side of that. Can you kind of describe that for us?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, as I said the other day, I don't think the seeds mean
that much. Teams that make this tournament are really good, and whether you're
a high seed or a low seed, it really depends on how you play. I thought we
played well enough to win this game. We had our chances. We put ourselves in
position to win, but so did Loyola. They did a good job. We pulled ahead of
them in the second half, and they fought back, but I thought we made some very
good plays.  
  
I thought the defensive stop that we got with the two-point lead with under
ten seconds to go, I believe, I thought that was going to seal the victory for
us. But something that happens quite often in this tournament, someone steps
up and makes a huge shot, and I think it was Donte Ingram was trailing the
play -- when Lonnie missed the free throw, Sam Waardenburg had the chance to
get the offensive rebound. There was a battle, it went loose, and they came up
with it. So it made it like a scramble getting back defensively. And I thought
we guarded the first couple of guys correctly, and they were not able to
shoot, but Ingram trailed the play, and they kicked it back to him.  
  
I thought the biggest statistic that separated us is they had 19 assists. We
only had 11. They found the open man a little bit more than we did, despite
the fact that we shot 51 percent from the field, better than their 47, and 44
percent from three better than their 38. And neither one of us shot well from
the foul line. We shot 61 percent. They shot 44 percent.  
  
When I look at those numbers, I think to myself, we probably would have won
the game, but we didn't. They made the last big play.  
  
Q. You talked about the 19 assists; was it a matter of their persistence
offensively that allowed them to get free there once in a while?  
JIM LARRANAGA: No. What I thought they did very well was they set a lot of
screens in the middle of the court and rolled the man to the basket, and
sometimes our help defense was there and very good, but other times we were
worried so much about them making threes that the help defender left early so
he could cover a three-point shooter. They didn't throw it to the three-point
shooter. They threw it to the roll man, and he ended up making the lay-up. We
tried making adjustments in the first half, did a little bit better job in the
second half, but not quite well enough to come out on top.  
  
Q. This is obviously the second straight early exit. This one obviously
more competitive than the last one against Michigan State, but how do you view
just the state of the program going forward and some of the pieces that you're
going to have back and some of the pieces that might be going?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, the first thing is I thought these guys did a great job
this year. When we started the season, we had five freshmen and four
sophomores, only one senior. It was a very young group. Just to make it to the
big dance I thought was a tremendous accomplishment.  
  
Secondly, we lost perhaps our best player in Bruce Brown midway through the
ACC race, which made it even more challenging to finish as high as we did in
the ACC and make the big dance.  
  
In today's college game, there's no way to predict at this early stage how
you're going to look next year with the number of kids that transfer, guys
that go pro, injuries, recruiting. What you see now would be great if we had
everybody back next year. If we did, I'd feel very, very strongly that we'd
have a great team.  
  
One of the things my staff and I have wanted to do and haven't been able to do
is stay older, have a more experienced team. I think that plays very well into
postseason. I think the older guys who have been through it normally play
well. I think younger guys have it a little more challenging.  
  
Right now, we only have one scholarship senior. We have two guys sitting out.
So if everybody would return, that would be like 11 guys. We still have two
scholarships to give. But in today's game, I have no idea.  
  
I look around our league, and I can't tell you what's going to happen at those
places, either, because guys are going pro, guys are transferring who don't
play much, guys get injured and they're out, could be out for the season. We
saw a lot of that this year with Bruce Brown and Donte Grantham and now
De'Andre Hunter is hurt and missing the tournament. So it's very, very hard to
predict this far in advance.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Kyle Keller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35007)

### [Ivan Canete](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35010)

### [Shannon Bogues](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35088)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 70, Stephen F. Austin - 60  
  
KYLE KELLER: I wish we could have ended the game at halftime, obviously, but
the game is 40 minutes. I give Texas Tech a tremendous amount of credit. Their
Coach Chris Beard, his team embodies his spirit and toughness. And they
imposed their will obviously the last 10 minutes or so of the game, and my
guys tried. They always try, but we just didn't have enough tonight. We just
-- it wasn't our night.  
  
Q. Shannon, obviously we saw you go out with an injury briefly in the
second half. Can you just talk a little bit about that and how that affected
you offensively for the rest of the game?  
SHANNON BOGUES: I just started cramping a little bit, and then after that, I
couldn't really get back in the groove, but it was just a cramp really.  
  
Q. Ivan, in the first half, you really got them going offensively,
making some big shots. Can you just kind of explain, you being a senior and
being out there, taking that leadership role and leading them offensively, how
you were able to get the momentum going in the first half?  
IVAN CANETE: I was trying to find open spots for my guys. Being a senior, I
just wanted to go out there and give it all I got and play as hard as I could.
If I see someone open, I am going to pass them the ball. A guy like Shannon
over here can just score however he wants, so yeah.  
  
Q. Ivan, second half you guys came out and scored three quick threes.
What was the feeling at that point as far as the momentum, and then talk a
little bit about the last five minutes, kind of what was going on during those
five minutes.  
IVAN CANETE: Yeah, when we were hitting those threes, I mean, we seen them
before this year, I felt like we were about to start pulling away. They looked
kind of defeated, but every time we made a run, they just responded and made a
run back. That's credit to them. They're a tough team, and then in the last
five minutes, we just were having a tough time scoring, and some things just
didn't go our way.  
  
Q. The foul trouble the team seemed to be in, not trouble until late in
the game, but just a lot of fouls seemed to be accumulating for you guys. Did
that affect what you were trying to do offensively through the better part of
the second half?  
SHANNON BOGUES: You said the foul? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Just the foul trouble, the foul situation the team was in. Did that
affect what you guys wanted to do?  
IVAN CANETE: Yeah, I mean, it definitely affected what we do on offense. When
you're used to certain guys playing a lot of minutes and being in certain
spots and then you don't have them on the court out there when it matters,
it's kind of hard. You've got to figure it out on the fly. So it was
different. But we just tried to get through it, and that was obviously tough
not having those guys out there with us.  
  
Q. Coach Keller, I noticed the disparity in points in the paint, Tech
versus SFA was not in your favor. Could you address that?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, that's been our strength all season, and obviously we
wanted to score points in the paint. They make it really hard the way they
play defense to get it in there. I thought we did a good job at times of
getting it in there. We weren't very successful at scoring in it. They clog it
up on the weak side. And to their credit, they make you throw it out and shoot
perimeter shots, and they put bodies in front of you.  
  
You know, they blocked a bunch of -- I don't know how many shots they blocked
tonight, but it seemed like every time we went and got to the rim, at least in
the second half, they were really challenged. But that's how we've won games
this year is scoring points in the paint. And our inability to score points in
the paint to me, that and not scoring points off our steals and turnovers
tonight is the reason why we didn't win the game.  
  
Q. You had said earlier you wish the game could have ended at halftime.
You guys were pretty much dominant through the majority of the game until the
last couple of minutes there. Can you talk about the difference in those last
few minutes, what you guys did the first 30 some minutes of the game?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, Evans, obviously, senior point guard dominated the second
half. He made it four points at half and gets 19 the second half. I've got Ty
Charles as an assistant coach in his last game over there with me. We guarded
him a lot of the night. We had to switch him off because of what you guys just
said, some foul trouble. So I needed him on the court because he is our senior
leader and dominates a lot of different things for us offensively, makes
things run. Even though he didn't score many points tonight, he makes things
smooth for us. He started the game guarding. And Evans is a reason why he's
all Big 12. There's a reason why he's on a lot of draft picks. He's a heck of
a player.  
  
I think it's a six-point game maybe, and he goes right through Aaron Augustin.
And TJ Hoyfield just splits a ball screen and imposed his will and got through
it when the game was on the line. That's what pros do. That's what seniors do.
We didn't have that happen for us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach Beard said you guys were one of the best teams in the country,
said you definitely weren't a 14 seed --  
KYLE KELLER: He's being nice.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like you really were able -- Texas Tech is a 3 seed.
You were really able to play with them and maybe were under seeded?  
KYLE KELLER: I don't know. There's 68 teams in the tournament seeding that to
me doesn't have anything to do with it. I coached the No. 1 seed in the
tournament. We didn't make the Final Four. So to me seeds don't matter.  
  
When the game starts, the game starts. And that's what we try to convince our
kids. Our kids didn't -- they got to play against some dudes they knew. Ty
knew some guys on their team. And the millenials today, they don't even watch
college basketball. A lot of our guys didn't even know who those cats were
because they don't watch the game. They're on their phone and doing that kind
of stuff. I hate to say it, but as much as you or I or anybody in here watches
the games, they don't. Or the NBA. They might watch the slam-dunk contest in
February on TNT or whatever, but that's about the extent of it.  
  
Q. Obviously it wasn't the outcome that you wanted, but just looking
back on the season, what do you take away from this particular team, and as
you do walk away and reflect on it, what stands out to you about this squad?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, you know, it's a hard time to really collect my thoughts. I
thought we had three great seniors who came together. A lot of tears in the
locker room after the game because of how much invested they had in our
University. The thing I think that they did was we've been living off
everybody else that had been before us, the players and coaches that had come
before us.  
  
I think my staff and the current players on our team kind of created our own
-- a little bit of our own legacy, and so I'm proud that we're -- I look at a
lot of championship trophies and nets in my office that other people have won,
and it's great for recruiting, and I love that. But to be honest with you, I'm
glad we get to have one of our own in there finally, and I'm glad our guys get
to -- were able to see this. This is about probably -- I never have counted,
between 30 and 40 NCAA Tournament games I've been a part of, and I'm glad they
got to experience that for a lot of these kids.  
  
Q. How do you know about millenial behavior, and how might that behavior
impact college basketball?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, I think it does a lot. If you are going to be around kids
today, you better read it. You better study it. I've got an eight year old and
11 year old, and I've got the greatest wife and kids I could ever imagine. I'm
the most blessed dude you've ever met, trust me. I shouldn't be here today.
But if I don't read it and study it and learn and try to figure these kids
out, I have no chance to coach it because the way I was taught as a child was,
hey, you are going to eat what is on your plate, if not, you're going to sit
here. I had to sit at the kitchen table one Saturday afternoon because I
didn't want to eat green beans or salmon patties. So we have a lot of green
beans on our team meals, and I tell that story to our guys. But you have to
adjust. You'd better learn to give and some take with these kids, I think. But
you have to be stubborn enough to impose your will on them to get them to come
together as a team and give them a lot of love, I think. Sometimes it's not
very much fun. They don't like me very much sometimes.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 70, Stephen F. Austin - 60  
  
CHRIS BEARD: First of all, I just want to congratulate Stephen F. Austin for a
great season. They were everything we thought they would be and more. Kyle
Keller is a great coach. They've got good players. They've got a program is
what they have. You go back to Danny Kaspar and certainly Brad Underwood, and
now Kyle has taken it to another level. They just forced us into so many
things and took away things, but I just wanted to congratulate them on a good
season, and I know Kyle is just getting started building the program there.  
  
For our guys, we knew we were going to have to play great to win this game
because we knew how good Stephen F. Austin was. I'm really pleased for our
players that we advanced to the second round, beating a team that we had
nothing but respect for.  
  
Q. Keenan, on the alley oop that you threw to Zhaire in the first half,
the 360, it looked like you almost changed your mind before you threw it to
him. Can you take us through what you saw from him?  
KEENAN EVANS: I actually was about to throw it to Zach at first, and then the
defender went to Zach, and then Zhaire had back cut, so I just threw it to
him, and he did his thing.  
  
Q. Keenan, I know you had a lot of emotion after that game. What was it
like just to finally get that first NCAA Tournament win and just kind of
really -- cement a legacy here as a senior?  
KEENAN EVANS: It felt great. Last time we were here, we didn't get the job
done. And for us to get the first one out of the way is a really good feeling,
and I feel like all we can do is improve the rest of the way.  
  
Q. Zhaire, on that dunk, on that 360 alley oop, what was going through
your mind?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: I was about to catch it, and I just 360'd. And I surprised
myself.  
  
Q. Keenan, just talk a little bit about first half versus second half.
It seems to have been a trend all season long. It seems like either you catch
your second wind or just kind of the difference between those two halves for
you?  
KEENAN EVANS: I honestly don't know. I guess I just get aggressive later in
the game, and it's something that I have to do for my team. I've got to get to
the line, make plays, and just try to bring us to a win. Yeah, as the time
winds down, I've got to get more aggressive and more aggressive.  
  
Q. You guys took 10 threes in the first half, but only six in the second
half. How did you feel like you adjusted as started driving on them?  
KEENAN EVANS: We had to go to man to five, and we had to be aggressive. That's
one of the things. We got probably not even 10 free throws in the first half.
And one of our big deals is get to the free-throw line, and not only were we
jacking up threes in the first half, we were missing threes when we were
shooting them. So it was an adjustment to drive the ball more.  
  
Q. Keenan, was it about as intense and frenetic a game as you've played
in, and how physically and mentally exhausting was that?  
KEENAN EVANS: Definitely. I wasn't ready for it to end. And like Coach said,
they were everything we saw in film and watching them play. It was very
intense, very emotional, and I'm just glad we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Zhaire, what was it like playing in front of essentially a home crowd
while playing in the NCAA Tournament?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: It was a blessing to play here. I got the fans behind us, and
that motivated me and gave me energy to play harder.  
  
Q. Talk about they came out in the second half, really started -- I
think they hit their first six shots in the second half. What defensive
adjustments did y'all make at that point to cut them down the rest of the
way?  
NIEM STEVENSON: Just being aggressive. That's our motto right there, just
being aggressive on both ends of the floor. We had to play better one-on-one
defense, and that's how we got it done.  
  
Q. Niem, just obviously it was a game of runs, especially at the end of
that one. Keenan had a nice little run there, but you had a nice, little steal
that allowed him to get that fourth point and really kind of propelled you.
Just the defense that you played, what did you feel you did differently or the
whole team did differently to kind of get you guys on that run and sustain
possessions?  
NIEM STEVENSON: Just being aggressive, and I'm not going to lie, I was trying
to get it back. I just missed the lay-up. I was like, yeah, let me get that
back. So you know, just heart. So that's what we all had.  
  
Q. Chris, how much do you think it changed the complexion of the game
when Bogues got his leg cramps and Hoyfield got four fouls? Do you think that
changed them at all?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I'm sure from Kyle's perspective when you lose one of your
better players and he was playing so aggressive, absolutely. I think foul
trouble in the first half kind of put us in the same situation, but yeah, I
would think that Kyle would tell you that affected them because he's a really
good player that was playing so aggressive. We were game planning for him
every time-out.  
  
Q. Coach, you were running the high horn set a lot in the second half.
What were you trying to get out of that?  
CHRIS BEARD: A basket. (Laughter).  
  
No, Stephen F. Austin plays pressure defense. We put it in the same category
as West Virginia in our conference or South Carolina in our non-conference
schedule, so it's important to get the ball into play. You can do that
individually, a guy V-cutting or in and out or back cutting, but then
sometimes you've got to get some X's and O's involved to just make the first
pass, and the horn set was good to us in the second half.  
  
Q. You've already talked about the respect that you had for SFA, but
when you look at these seedings, they're definitely not a 14 seed, are they?  
CHRIS BEARD: No, they're a really good team. Look, they passed the eye test.
Make sure I get this right, I've watched so much film, but they beat LSU. They
lose to Missouri by one point. They've won true road games at places like
Louisiana Tech. They had a great run in their conference, which to me being a
Texas guy, I understand how good the Southland Conference is and how good the
coaching is. It's probably the most underrated conference, good basketball,
good coaches. They do what's to me the toughest thing to do in all of sports,
and that's to win your conference tournament after you've had a great season.  
  
I think it's more pressure filled in Game 7 of the NBA Finals or the Super
Bowl. I've never participated in those, but when I was at Little Rock, we had
a special season, and it gets down to that championship game of your
conference tournament, and you have to win it to advance. And it's a different
level of pressure and stress.  
  
So just the fact that Stephen F. Austin did that, that's all I needed to know
personally about how tough this team was. So I think they're a really good
basketball team, and we're just pleased to win the game. I've got a lot of
respect for their players and their coach.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned this to be a game of runs. You guys had that run
at the end with the defensive stop and then Zhaire had that nice little V cut
in there to get the dunk. What did you see from your team knowing that they
had to kind of grit your way to a grind-it-out victory?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah. I was really proud of that ending. That's something we've
been working on for two years. Finish was our motto. Last year when our season
ended sooner than any of us would have wanted, we regrouped, and we just
decided that the thing has got to be finished because we were so close last
year. So finishing doesn't just mean close games. It means finishing the
semester academically or finishing in the weight room your last couple reps or
finishing individual workouts, basically just a mindset to finish.  
  
Like in football, the whole fourth quarter deal, we wanted to finish. And
tonight on the biggest stage, the biggest game of the season, I thought we did
a great job finishing the game late. We had different players do it. Keenan
Evans is a great player. And everything he gets, he deserves, but we're a
team. And tonight when it's the Justin Gray pass or the Brandone Francis
corner three or the Zach Smith block, it's just great to see our plan, a team
win, where everybody embraces the idea of finishing. I thought we were a
confident team late, and I thought our coaching staff did a great job keeping
it positive, as well.  
  
Q. You guys didn't take your first lead of the second half until around
three minutes left, and obviously you busted it open the last few minutes. Can
you just explain what SFA was doing that was so efficient defensively
throughout the whole second half, and what was just so, I guess, an annoyance
just hanging around and being able to be productive?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yes, sir. I think I can answer that. They're one of the best
defensive teams in college basketball. They really are. Their turnover margin
I think is No. 1. I know we were telling our guys all week long, they cause
more turnovers or the differentials more than West Virginia. That got our
guys' attention. I can step up there and talk all night, and I don't know if
they'd listen or not, but when I say, hey, these guys make you turn it over
like West Virginia, they listen.  
  
So yeah, I just think it was them playing their game. They've been doing that
all year, whether it be their non-conference win, their successful run through
the Southland Conference, winning a championship in a conference tournament.
They are just a good defensive team. They do it in different ways. They'll
trap. They'll deny. They press. And above all, it's just discipline. It's a
Kyle Keller team. They're not going to make mistakes. They're hard. They're
tough. We're pleased to get this win. I would agree with the first question,
that's not a 14 seed. That's one of the best teams I think in college
basketball this year.  
  
Q. Brandone hadn't hit a couple threes in the last game, hitting some
open shots. That three he hit tonight, how big was that not just for him but
for the momentum?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, first I think we've got to talk about the pass. They
trapped the ball out of Keenan's hands. I think we made the extra. Then we
made the extra. The spacing was good. I was really pleased tonight. I think we
had 25 baskets, and we had 14 assists, so 14 assists on 25 baskets on 14
passes. That's the way we want to play. That's balanced. That's a little bit
of motion, but more importantly just spacing.  
  
And then Brandone has worked hard to earn the right to make that shot.
Brandone is a guy in our 300 club. He makes 300 every day, seven days a week.
I think you've got to give our student managers and the assistants, the guys
that put in the long hours following rebound on the ball. But that's a team
thing when a guy makes a shot like that, but I was proud of Brandone Francis.  
  
Q. As long as Keenan has been around here in college and suffering
through turf toe and ankle sprains, how much do you feel like he kind of
epitomizes college basketball?  
CHRIS BEARD: I think he's definitely a part of it, and I would put Carter from
West Virginia and Graham from Kansas. That's no disrespect to Graham. He's a
great player. But I think Keenan would have been the Big 12 Player of the
Year. I believe that. If I didn't believe that, then I shouldn't be coaching
at Texas Tech. But this guy is a special player, and I think his story is he's
not a McDonald's All-American. He's not even a top 100 guy, and he just gets
to school, and he gets to working.  
  
I think you've got to give Tubby Smith and his staff and Joe and Vince and
Pooh and those guys credit too. They laid the foundation. I have to give our
staff some credit. And then above all, you've got to give Keenan Evans credit.
This guy has willed himself into one of the best players in college
basketball.  
  
I think the one and done and the great players, that is a part of college
basketball. Those guys deserve it because they are so talented, but I think
the Keenan Evans story, the Jevon Carter story, the Devonte' Graham story,
these guys are just special. These are guys that just continue to get better.
I just love coaching him. I just don't want it to end. I want to coach that
guy another day. It is like when you go to a good movie and you know it's
getting towards the end, but you are loving the movie so much, you want it to
go a little bit farther. Or you've got a good plate of enchiladas and you're
looking at it, and you only have two bites left, but it's so good, you turn it
into three bites.  
  
I want it to keep lasting. I'm so glad we get to go back to the hotel, and I
get to coach these guys another day. I can't wait until tomorrow to prepare
and certain Saturday a chance to play again. But guys like Keenan make this
job great, and this is all about the players. And we've got good players.  
  
Q. What did you think about the beginning of the game and your team's
mindset and mentality in the early portion of the game?  
CHRIS BEARD: I thought our young guys looked a little bit star struck on this
stage. That's understandable. I thought our veterans did a good job kind of
calming them down. We had good productive time-outs. Patience is not one of my
strengths, pretty emotional guy. But I thought that the coaching staff did a
great job with me to kind of prepare me, long game, long game, let's hang in
there.  
  
So it wasn't our best of starts, but you've got to give Stephen F. Austin
credit. I hate the guy that sits up here and talks about we didn't play well
and never talks about the opponent. We didn't start the game well because
Stephen F. Austin is a really good team, and they took some things away from
us. But we did calm down. To be in the game at halftime, that is all you ask
for in this tournament. It's a long game.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

### [Grant Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34924)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Tennessee - 73, Wright State - 47  
  
RICK BARNES: Obviously we're happy with the win and the fact that we felt
coming in that Wright State would be as difficult a team that we've played all
year in terms of the way they move without the ball. They're really a team
that, you watching them on tape, you could tell they were just a terrific
team. They understood each other. They've had one of those special years, a
lot like we have.  
  
So from that point, defensively we were really pretty good today against a
team that's not a very easy team to guard.  
  
Offensively once we settled in, we settled in, and we missed some easy ones
early, but we settled in and got our offense going.  
  
Q. Admiral or Grant, how important was it do you think to get one under
your belt and kind of settle in to being in the tournament?  
ADAM SILVER: It's always important because if you lose, you don't get to play
again. But the biggest thing is we came out and did what we said we were going
to do, try to run them out of their offense, and against a great team, like
Coach Barnes said, a very special team that can shoot the ball. They're great
with movement away from the ball, and we guarded pretty well. But towards the
end of the game, we didn't do our job. We kind of let up on defense. So we've
got to tighten down in that aspect, but we're going to get a day off and
really recoup our bodies and our minds and get ready for whoever our next
opponent is.  
  
Q. How difficult of a prep was this the way they move on offense and why
were you guys so successful on that end of the floor today?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Well, we've prepared for an entire year for something like
this. We've played teams that are similar, that played similar basketball as
they do. With basketball, it's a lot of constant motion, and you just have to
understand these concepts. Really just going on the film and executing the
scouting report that the coaches lay out for us because they do an amazing job
with it. We trust them, and we go out on the court well prepared, and we just
do our jobs.  
  
ADAM SILVER: Like Grant said, our coaches do a great job of scheduling teams
that play different styles like this early in the year, and our strength of
schedule is important, and we get great teams like Lipscomb and different
other schools that run different schemes.  
  
We usually prepare early in the year, but at this time of year, you've got to
be ready because any team can get hot, especially in a tournament like this.
Everybody has a special year. Everyone is in good position at this time of
year. The biggest thing for us is, like Grant said, executing the scouting
report to a tee, just being able to go out and compete at a high level and
also give a good effort on defense, which is our identity, and offensively
just let things flow.  
  
Q. Grant, I think 20 rebounds in the last two games on a pretty big
stage. I know your coach -- it's a favorite topic for him. What's kind of been
the key to you improving in that area?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Really I've just been pursuing the ball more. Normally I try
and box guys out and make sure to keep them off the glass and allow other guys
to get it because that's just how I used to do it. But recently I've been
being more aggressive and being more pursuant of the ball. And just on the
other end, it all flows and comes kind of easily, so just got to put an
emphasis on one thing and harp on it.  
  
Q. He's not in here, but can you guys talk about Kyle and what he's
turning into on defense, how much is that a result of having a big guy in the
middle that's playing like Kyle is?  
ADAM SILVER: Well, Kyle is a game changer. He's very athletic, and when he's
locked in and ready to go, he can really affect the game defensively and
offensively, you know, getting us extra possessions on the glass and also
protecting the rim. And when he does that, he makes us a lot better on both
ends. He's really our anchor, really our X factor. But when he's really locked
in, he changes the game for us in a big way.  
  
Q. Grant, it looked like y'all were intentional about getting the ball
to you early to start the second half. And then maybe some outside shots
flowed out of that. Was that something y'all talked about in the locker room
or maybe how did that work?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Not really. We just run our offense, and we get good looks out
of it. We didn't harp on getting me the ball or nothing like that because I
don't really have to score the ball with this team. It's a team where we have
a lot of guys that can put the ball in the basket. Really just coming out and
executing what Coach calls, and we did a good job of that. We were moving the
ball well, and it led to open looks. It was important to just be aggressive
and do what we do.  
  
Q. Rick, it looked like you still had quite a bit of fire there on the
bench, even with under eight minutes left. You guys had a comfortable lead.
Were there some things that you wished y'all could have cleaned up a little
more in the second half there?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, I think this time of year, you're looking for perfection. I
thought when we got the lead, even in the first half, I didn't think we
defended well in the last five minutes of the first half. I thought they
looked up, and I think the score was 23-8, 21-8, something like that, and I
just felt like we let down a little bit defensively.  
  
You know, it's a game of momentum, but when they started pressing, they went
with five guards -- you know, a big key, too, was Love getting in foul
trouble, and they were playing five guards a lot and just really going
downhill hard with the ball. We adjusted to that okay, but I thought, again,
with five guards at the end, you know they're going to trap and press. And we
were a little bit sloppy, just weren't on edge the way I want us to be. I just
think it's a game of habits. I want them to play every possession like it
matters.  
  
Q. Coach, the first five minutes of the second half are usually
typically pretty important, and up 11 anything can happen. How happy were you
with the way you guys opened the second half?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you know, we've tried to talk to these guys about a lot of
different things with this tournament, and actually one thing I forgot to tell
them is the longer halftime, and we were back there longer than normal. But
you watched us all year. We've been really good out at halftime. We've had ten
points lead where we've come out and let teams score four, five straight
possessions, and we just keep talking about -- I told them, we're not waiting
one possession. You'd better be locked in, because we had the ball, so you'd
better be locked in on the defensive end the first time we go down, and we
were. So that gets us started.  
  
I mean, we're better when we're locked in on the defensive end, and then
obviously Love was in the game. All we talked about was maybe at the end of
shot clocks putting him in ball screens if we needed to do that, but otherwise
we were just going to execute our offense.  
  
Q. Rick, how would you describe your Tennessee basketball team, and is
it not a team that can just out-talent other clubs?  
RICK BARNES: You're saying can we out-talent clubs? No, we've never looked at
that because one thing we've told our players, and we say it all the time,
everybody can play. I mean, I was really impressed with our team tonight
because we looked at this team, and they play hard. They do a lot of good
things. And we probably have better players that people want to give us credit
for, but I do know we've got -- I do think hard work is a talent. I don't
think that's a given. There's not everyone that works hard.  
  
Overall we've got a group of guys that have embraced that talent of working
hard, and they've -- we've tried to create our own standard, our own identity
in terms of how hard we think we can play on defense and on offense when we
stay together and execute -- I mean, we missed some shots at the beginning of
the game that we need to knock down, but that's part of the game, and you
expect some of that, especially in the opening game of this tournament. But we
settled in, and again, I think our players are probably a little bit better
certainly than people thought at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. What specifically did you like defensively in the first half as you
built that lead?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you know, we knew that they knew that we were a pressure
team, and we knew they would counter with back cuts, and they did a couple,
but we had pretty good ball pressure that they weren't able to really get that
pass. And they cut really hard. They do a good job of that.  
  
Our post defense was important. You know, with Love, he does such a great job
of creating angles. And if you let him catch it with a foot in the lane, it's
hard to guard. Our ball pressure was good early, but overall in our help line
was there, and we rebounded. We thought we had to rebound, and we thought we
could get to the offensive boards.  
  
Someone had told me they made a comment they wanted to play a little bit
faster to keep us off the offensive boards, but we felt we could get there,
and that probably got us going as much as anything, what we were able to do on
those second shots during the start of the game. And our ball screen defense
-- because they're very good at coming down in transition with drag screens.  
  
If you're not up there to touch, they can shoot the ball, and we just did not
want them coming off ball screens looking to raise up and shoot threes.  
  
Q. This is a little off topic, but former Texas baseball Coach Augie
Garrido passed away yesterday. I was wondering if you have a comment on his
passing.  
RICK BARNES: Sad day. Just many fond memories of Augie. I can remember seasons
would be going, and when things weren't going well, he was one of those guys
like Yoda. He always had a little something he could tell you. I remember we
were playing and struggling a little bit, and he came over and told a story
about -- they had won the National Championship at Fullerton. And next year,
he put so much pressure on his team, and he said he was with his mom one day,
and she had a picture, and she said, you notice when your guys won the
championship, you're holding the trophy. Why don't you let the kids hold it.
He said, I realized that day that it really is not about me. And he told me,
he said, the key to this, what you're doing, is can you get your guys to play
like little boys that love the game.  
  
But we had many, many -- I loved being around him. Sad day. I just hate it
when I heard the news the other day. But my time at Texas with he and Mack and
Deloss, there were so many memories, and we lost truly a beautiful
personality, and his baseball record and all that. But I loved him more as a
man than I did as a baseball coach.  
  
Tennessee - 73, Wright State - 47.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jaylen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32871)

### [Matt Mobley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32870)

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Florida - 77, St. Bonaventure - 62  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, all the credit goes to Florida. I thought they had a great
game plan coming in. They did a really good job on us defensively. You know,
especially on Jay and Matt. They just seemed like they were quicker than us.
They were longer than us. At times they dominated us on the ball.  
  
I thought our defense in the first half, we didn't play very well offensively
in the first half, but I thought being down by five going into the locker room
was a moral victory. I thought we were right there. We had the ball coming out
in the second half, and we always talk about -- talk to the team about the
first five minutes of the second half, the first ten possessions were going to
be critical, and they jumped on us. The first four minutes of the second half,
it went from five to 14 or whatever, and then we were fighting an uphill
battle from there.  
  
I'm proud of what we've accomplished. I'm proud of these two guys, along with
Idris, the three seniors, the things that we've done, that they've done, not
only this year, but through their career. It was disappointing the way it
ended, but I was proud the kids kept on fighting. We just lost to a better
team today.  
  
Q. The three-point shot was something that you really could rest on all
season, and lately it kind of went away, especially today, missing, I think,
it was just 3 of 18 or 19. Can you just talk about what happened to the shot
and how bad that was for it not to be falling versus a team this good?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: Credit Florida's defense. They were long and they were active
early, forced us into some tough shots. I think we played a lot of one-on-one
early and really moved the ball, took some bad shots, and it kind of affected
the rhythm. From there, we couldn't really stick any after that, so it's going
to be rough to win the game without the three.  
  
Q. Guys, four games in the last six days, travel to Dayton, travel from
D.C. and then fly all the way to Dallas. How much was fatigue a factor in this
loss?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I mean, I'm not one to make excuses, but it's one of those
things. We were a little gassed, you could tell. We weren't used to that many
games in that many days. But I think you have to credit more Florida's defense
than anything. Give all the credit to Florida.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, definitely Florida's defense was the credit for us losing
energy. That's about it. Not really any excuse to be tired. We've played a lot
of minutes before, we've played a lot of games before, but yeah, just credit
to Florida. They did a great job today.  
  
Q. Matt, you really led the charge during that comeback late in the
first half. Momentum seemed to be swinging in you guys' favor, you had a big
three, started at the free-throw line, then that dunk in transition. What
happened to start the second half? Obviously Florida's defense came out great,
but where did that momentum go?  
MATT MOBLEY: They came out, punched us in the mouth, and we couldn't really
get over the hump after that. So that's about it.  
  
Q. Best season this program has had since 1970. It's hard to think about
it right now, but can you guys talk about what this year and this run meant?
You guys are forever going to be remembered by that fan base that has showed
up for you guys all year.  
JAYLEN ADAMS: It's kind of hard to look at it right now. Historic season. I
couldn't be prouder of my teammates for the way we fought all year, from
losing that first game to that 2-4 start in conference, the way we battled
back and we fought to get here. I couldn't be prouder, like I said, of my
teammates and the seniors just for battling all year. It's not something that
we could think about, obviously, right now. It's a tough way to go out. But
like I said, I'm proud of my guys.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, yeah, can't really reflect on it right now. Maybe in a
couple days it'll really sink in how great we played this year. But just sad
that it had to end like this. But it is what it is. I mean, we had a great
year. Proud of my guys, like he said, and there's no one else I'd rather be
able to do it with than these guys, so I'm just thankful that we were able to
have a great year.  
  
Q. Mark, do you think that ultimately it just kind of caught up to you
guys in the end? Like Jay, four years, he's had such a leadership position, he
had done so much this year, Matt, also, that it just looked like they were
emotionally wiped out?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I don't know if emotionally. I think it's hard sometimes when
you get down, and we got down to Florida, especially in the second half. But I
thought today was the first day that our guys looked fatigued, both Jay and
Matt looked fatigued, and I don't know if that was because we had just played
48 hours ago or -- and some of it from a mental standpoint, when you play --
when Florida plays the defense that they played and it made it difficult for
them, it's hard sometimes to show emotion. You're just trying to fight to stay
alive.  
  
But Florida was ready. They did a really good job, and kudos go out to them.
They did a really good job of -- their game plan was good, and they executed
it and have great athletes. They played well.  
  
Q. Speaking to Jay just a few minutes ago, he said that he felt like it
started to catch up to him late in the season. If you watch your team close
enough, I think that's probably accurate.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, you know, I don't know. They've played a lot of minutes.
Jay played a lot of minutes, him and Matt played a lot of minutes over their
whole career.  
  
I think it might be -- we knew when we were 2-4 that every game -- when we
talked about the seventh game mentality, that every game we had to win if we
were going to get to this point. So there was a lot of pressure. And those
guys worked.  
  
People don't realize, it's just not practice. It's getting into the weight
room. It's individuals. It's a grind. You know, and when we were 2-4, to win
13 games, and we won some close games, and those guys worked. Jay --
particularly Jay, he has the ball in his hands all the time, so it is
draining. But I don't know if it was -- I don't know when it started to affect
him. You could tell today that he was a little bit fatigued.  
  
Even, I think, in the conference quarterfinals against Richmond, he asked to
come out early in the first half, and usually -- even if I want to take him
out, he doesn't want to come out. So there was some fatigue. But that's not an
excuse, like I said. Florida, they deserved the win. They were the better team
tonight.  
  
Q. What about the emotions, the range of emotions over the past week
where there's the uncertainty coming out of D.C., then you get in, and it's
like a short trip to Dayton, then you beat UCLA, you were emotional yourself,
and then you have to come down here. To get back up again, it's like a --  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, but this is a dream of a lifetime, for our players, for
the coaching staff. This doesn't happen every day. You know, so if this was
something that went on for two or three weeks, then it would be -- that
wouldn't be good. But we were on a high, and I think you can fight through for
a couple days, just through adrenaline. But I think when you get down by 15,
that adrenaline rush that you have is out the window, you know. And like I
said, give Florida credit; they got us down, and it was hard to fight through
it.  
  
Q. He wasn't out here with Jay and Matt, but can you talk about what
Idris has meant to this team over the last four years?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, I've been doing this a long time, and he's one of the top
five most unselfish players that I've ever coached. We don't run anything for
him. He never complains. He plays the hardest guy offensively. You look at him
tonight, and he had 13 rebounds. That sucker wasn't going to quit. He doesn't
have great skill, but he epitomizes the toughness that we try to play with and
the grit and the blue-collar approach. He's just a great teammate, someone
that -- winning is the most important thing. He could care less if he got one
point or 21 points. He wants to win, and it's been a pleasure coaching him.
He's come a really long way. But he's the glue of our team.  
  
Mat and Jay get a lot of the credit, and deservedly so, but without Idris in
that -- he brings us together. He's the glue. He makes all the big plays.  
  
People that don't know basketball don't appreciate it, but people that really
know the game really appreciate a guy like that, and for me, being a head
coach, he's -- I'm lucky to have the opportunity to coach him because there's
not a lot of guys, especially in today's world, where they would sacrifice
that much for their teammates and not shoot, and they'd be complaining about,
Coach, run a play, I'm not getting enough shots. He's all about winning, and
that's going to -- he's going to have a lot of success in his career because
of that.  
  
Q. You talked about the defense, their defense, a little bit in your
opening statement, but it seemed like every time you guys would get it back to
nine, ten, 11, they came up with a turnover, got an easy transition bucket.
Can you speak more specifically about what the Gators did that it seemed like
they were able to clamp down a little bit every time you got almost there?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, when a team is more athletic, longer and stronger -- I was
telling my SID, that's a bad trifecta, and Florida was longer, more athletic
and longer. So in a game like this, every -- it was hard to get open looks.
But when you do get open looks, you've got to knock them down, and we didn't
do that. When we got open looks for the most part, we missed, and they sped us
up. They were long. They did a good job getting to our shooters, knocking them
off the long. Then when we drove, their length really affected us in the
passing lanes. They did a really good job getting to our shooters, getting
into the gaps. They averaged 16 points off of turnovers, and one of the keys
going into the game was try to not allow them to get more than 16, and they
got 25, so we lost that battle. I'm a big guy on the columns in the right-hand
corner. That tells a lot about the game. And we lost every one of them. That's
a credit to Florida.  
  
Q. Mark, if you can, put the season in perspective. 26 wins, obviously
the 48 seasons, and what a year really.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, it's hard as a coach or as a player to -- losing stings,
and if it doesn't stings, you're not a competitor. But just thinking about
what we've done. Bonaventure has great tradition, way back to the Stith
brothers, and for us, for this team to break the record of the most wins
speaks volumes about our season, because the seasons before and the tradition
that we have, we've had great teams that have never done that.  
  
For us to win an NCAA game for the first time in 48 years is just -- it's
unbelievable, and I've said this -- and I told the seniors in the locker room,
you know, we're proud of what they've accomplished. When they got here, we
were building this program, and they are going to be known for it, not just
sustaining it, but making it more of a national program. And that's what I'm
proud of.  
  
You know, the wins are great, but we got the respect of the country now, and
it's taken a while to get that, but I'm just proud of what we accomplished.
You know, it's hard to put into words sometimes, especially now when we're
just coming off a loss. But we did some incredible things that -- the guys are
going to look back on years -- days, years from now and look like, wow. This
team is going to be remembered forever for what they've done. We can't allow
this one game here to jeopardize or to affect what we've done throughout this
year.  
  
So it's disappointing, but only one team ends -- or two teams, I guess, the
NIT, ends in a win. I'm happy that we were able to get this far, and I'm happy
for the seniors to be able to experience something that they've dreamed of.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Chris, what do you take from the matchup that you had with them last
year in Lakeland, particularly in defending their guards who are both back
this year, Mobley and Jaylen Adams?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: We know those are their two main scorers, and they're great
players. So we're going to try to contain them as much as we can and just play
how we do, try not to let them get any open shots early and get going.  
  
Q. Chris, you just mentioned it's kind of a tough preparation thing
since they played last night and you had to get ready for UCLA or St.
Bonaventure. Do you think that gives you a little bit of an edge or is it
easier getting ready for them rather than some team you hadn't played last
year?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I don't think it'll be any easier, but we played them last
year. We know kind of a little bit better what those guys want to do or what
they're good at. So you know, we're just going to try to make them do things
they're not as comfortable doing.  
  
As with UCLA, we haven't watched them play at all or haven't seen them play at
all until last night, so it would have been probably a little bit tougher
scout.  
  
Q. Chris, everybody called you Cheese before last year with the big shot
against Wisconsin. How much did that take off your nickname last year?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I'm not sure. I felt like probably a lot of people called me
that last year, but this year I feel like everybody calls me that. I'm sure
that has something to do with it or just me being here so long that everybody
started calling me that. I'm not really sure, but I'm sure that probably had a
little bit to do with it.  
  
Q. Egor, I know that your first NCAA Tournament appearance was obviously
a heartbreaker against Texas. Could you sort of talk about what you learned
from that experience and how excited you are after starting at ASU, going to
Rice and ending up at Florida in your last season?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah, sure. I think where I learned from it the most is
probably -- not that the seeds don't matter, but every team in this field is
very good, and you've got to respect every single opponent. And I mean, the
margin of error is so small. That was a heartbreaker my freshman year against
Texas. The guy just picked the ball up, just laid it up.  
  
I kind of learned from that, and it's been a journey since then. Obviously
went to Rice, now finishing my year here at Florida, and it's been great. This
is the time and this is why I came to Florida, this team, those guys. We
worked really hard all year to be where we are right now, and now we've just
got to take advantage of that.  
  
Q. You were both playing at a pretty high level towards the end of the
regular season, then hit a little bit of a lull in the Arkansas game. What's
the sense of urgency been like in practice to kind of bounce back for
Thursday?  
JALEN HUDSON: We're just trying to hang our hat on defense. That's what our
main emphasis is. We want to play really hard, make the shots really hard, and
shock them in transition. Our main focus has been on St. Bonaventure. We kind
of moved on to next thing. We made our mistake against Arkansas, but now we
have a whole new focus, and it's all been on St. Bonaventure.  
  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah, you know, same kind of thing, just, again, trying to
take it one day at a time and trying to move on from the Arkansas game. We
have a new opponent, really try to hang our hat on defense, like Jalen said.
We know if we defend high level, it's going to give us a chance at every
single game. That's what we're going to try and do tomorrow, just defend at a
high level.  
  
Q. Jalen, you guys obviously got to spend more time in St. Louis not
playing than you would have liked. What was that like for you guys, kind of
being just stuck there and probably wanting to get home and having to find out
on the plane who you're going to be playing, all that stuff? What was that
whole experience like?  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah. I feel like it made it a little bit worse for us. We had
to sit there. We had to watch all the games there in St. Louis. I feel like it
made the sting like a little bit longer. I like remember exactly how that
feeling feels. I don't want to feel like that again, so I want to use that,
know what I mean, to help push us forward.  
  
Q. Chris, I know you have some NCAA Tournament experience from last year
and playing in that, but have you reached out to any of your older friends who
have been in this experience before more times than you or maybe back out to
Kasey Hill for some extra tips and pointers in terms of getting ready for the
tournament?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I haven't been in contact with any people regarding my fellow
teammates that's already been there. I'm going to try to use my experience to
help these guys out. I'm sure Coach or somebody will have something set up for
us when we get to the hotel or something with former players or just somebody
to give us a little extra advice that I might not be able to provide.  
  
Q. Jalen, I know coming into the season and during your redshirt year,
there's a lot of questions surrounding your defense and sort of how that was
going to affect your playing time. How have you seen your game change from
when you first came into Florida for your redshirt season up until now in the
season?  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah, my game has changed a lot, both ends of the floor. Still
trying to continue to get better every day. Not exactly where I wanted to be.
I feel like my ceiling is still pretty high, but it's about us right now, know
what I mean. March Madness is always about everybody. It's not about
individual things. It's going to take everybody tomorrow. So that's what I've
been focusing on, giving as much as I can, being a servant.  
  
Q. Chris, could having some guys that have had experience that went
through it last year be an advantage on your team?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, I think it could be an advantage, just the atmosphere we
have here every game when you get into this tournament, people that haven't
been here before, it might rattle them a little bit. But like you said, we
have pieces that have been here, and I think that the guys that were here last
year, I think we're trying to do as best a job as we can, getting everybody
ready to prepare themselves mentally for this -- what we're about to face on
this court out here.  
  
Q. I just want to follow up, you were talking about the sting. Were you
talking about the loss to Arkansas and sitting around watching other teams
play? Was that what you were referencing?  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah, that was exactly what I was talking about. First and
foremost, I don't think we feel like we played our best game. We didn't give
ourselves a chance really against Arkansas. And then on top of that, we had to
sit there in St. Louis and watch all the rest of the SEC games when we knew we
should have been playing, know what I mean? It really stung. And for us to sit
there and not have anything to do besides watch the rest of the games, it
really stung. So that's what I was talking about.  
  
Q. Chris and Egor, not really a basketball question, but I've seen you
guys are both big into Fortnite. Do you think even though it's a non-
basketball thing it's brought you together, just creating that chemistry?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah, I mean, you could say that in a way. We just got a lot
of similar interests. Having those always helps to kind of bring you together,
maybe even on the court, who knows. But it's been great, just getting to know
him. All my teammates really, Jalen and me, we all live together, and we feel
like we're pretty close. A lot of times it shows on the court, too.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Like he said, any time you can find something that you can
share interests with somebody else or a lot of people on the team, we all like
to -- we all enjoy playing that game, so we try to play together as much as we
can. I mean, it just -- I don't know, it's just a bond that we've got just
from that, let alone everything else we do together, but just that. It
definitely like brings us a little bit closer together.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Great to be here. Great to be back in the NCAA Tournament. I
thought my guys did a really good job, three really good guys. Decent practice
today. Coming off, obviously, a performance at the SEC tournament that we
weren't overly pleased with, but at the same time understanding that we played
a very good team. The SEC has had a great run, a great year. Hopefully our
league can do some damage in this tournament. And obviously now it's about St.
Bonaventure. I thought they were really good last night against the UCLA team
that has terrific year. St. Bonaventure I thought played extremely hard,
defended at a really, really high clip, and beat a good Pac-12 team without
their best two players in my opinion, playing at their fullest potential. That
shows you how dangerous they are.  
  
Q. You're aware of Mobley and Adams from last year and what they did to
you in Lakeland, but what else about their team particularly kind of stood out
on Tuesday night that's going to be really difficult for you guys to deal with
going into Thursday?  
MIKE WHITE: Well, I think with those two guys, they're complemented by
Stockard, who is a really underrated guy in my opinion and a mismatch
nightmare. How do you guard him? Who do you guard him with? He was terrific
last night and was the difference in the game in my opinion.  
  
Again, to complement, arguably, one of the best back courts in the country
both offensively and defensively, and then they've got complementary pieces,
too, that I think provide defense and rebounding, play within themselves, hard
to block out, really good in zone, provide some physicality.  
  
Going back to last year's game, since you brought it up, one of the things
that stuck out after the game was their talent level, how good they were
offensively. They could really score. The way they executed, Coach Schmidt has
done an amazing job there, of course, but just how tough they were and how
hard they played, and I thought that that was shown again last night.  
  
Q. I was just curious about your preparation and scouting for this
situation based on the fact that you're playing the play-in winner, so you had
to kind of get ready for two teams, and I know you're usually at least laying
groundwork for a possible second round. Can you kind of explain how you had to
handle that whole situation?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, sure. For us moving forward, we won't discuss it, look at
it, peak at it, nothing. We've never done that. It's just our philosophy.  
  
But your first question, it was a first-time deal for us leading into this one
in that you don't know who you're going to play, and that's a position we put
ourselves in, and we were close to not having this type of situation. We try
to combine as much tendency as possible offensively and defensively.  
  
Obviously what UCLA and St. Bonaventure, led by guards offensively, transition
defensively, altering defense being huge. Isolation being defense. And then
there's some differences there with speed and quickness versus athleticism and
size and length.  
  
And then we went -- in terms of scout team, offense versus a dummy defense
scout team, we went against their tandem 2-3 zone a bunch, St. Bonaventure I'm
talking about, and unfortunately wasted a lot of time going against UCLA's 2-3
zone.  
  
Q. At this time of year, is it different than regular season preparation
because of the time factor, so do you dial anything back even though the games
are obviously very important? Does that factor into it at all?  
MIKE WHITE: No, I think there are a lot of similarities really, outside of the
fact that we didn't know who to prep for, but once you find out last night
late, it becomes pretty similar, a little bit quicker than most of our SEC
games, but both Bonaventure and us have played Thursday-Saturdays this year
and Tuesday-Thursdays or Saturday whatever, Sunday-Tuesday.  
  
We're all -- it's an even playing field from here on out, really everybody in
the tournament, and whoever is fortunate to advance, again, it's the same
prep. It's a two-day prep. Mostly mental compared to a three, four-day prep,
but there's got to be some physicality involved, as well.  
  
Q. Does the experience of going through it last year play a factor at
all? I know you don't have all the pieces, but obviously you have Chris
Chiozza, Hayes, and --  
MIKE WHITE: I don't know. We'll see. I just think we're such a different team.
We're playing such a different team. I just think it's more about this year's
Gators versus this year's Bonnies. This experience if you really look into it,
there's probably some positives we can draw from, but there might be some
negatives, as well. We think that we have a lot of positive, and we think that
because of our experience, if we allow this to creep in, that we can just play
well, and we're just going to move on because that's what happened last year,
but that can be the negative side of it.  
  
We've got to play really, really well to win tomorrow, and our focus can't be
on how far can we make it in the tournament, or it's going to be short-lived.
Our experience here in the NCAA Tournament, it's got to be focused on the St.
Bonaventure scouting report.  
  
Q. I know in the press conference before your team left for Dallas you
talked about that there still wasn't that guy who was really stepping up being
the absolute leader of the team and that sense of urgency because you have a
shyer, quieter team. Have you noticed since you've been out here that attitude
change just in the spirit of being out here for March Madness and being in the
spirit of the team and seeing it in person?  
MIKE WHITE: No. And I want to be clear, too. We have some leadership, we do.
Chris Chiozza has been a terrific leader in a lot of regards. Hayes has really
stepped up. Egor Koulechov has provided some leadership for this team. This
team, though, we've had an inconsistent level of edge and competitiveness and
desire. And I was talking to somebody about it the other day, the fact that
it's just really hard to tick these guys off.  
  
I'm going to give you an example. There's a bunch of stuff hits the media,
whether it be social media or television media, that everyone is picking
whoever wins this game, they're going to beat Florida, right? We all know it.
Why would I not use it? Whether it works or not, who knows, with this group,
we showed it, and we showed it this afternoon before practice because I
thought it might lead to us having a bunch of edge in practice, and we got off
to a horrible start in practice, quiet, had to tell my managers to stop
cheering our guys on because it sounds like a library in there if they're not
getting after it. It's just the personality of this team.  
  
I probably need to stop fighting it this time of year. It is what it is. But
that said, I think that the positive occasionally that we can draw from that
type of mentality is this team doesn't really get rattled, either. This team
has got an ability to make plays late down the stretch with poise. Maybe our
lack of emotion at times can be a positive.  
  
Q. You've discussed the wing defense against Arkansas. How imperative is
that going to have to be to improve facing a team like this that has multiple
wings that can score?  
MIKE WHITE: Huge. It's transition defense, ball screen defense, isolation
defense, our guards defending their guards at a high level. Those things have
to happen for us, or we might as well not show up. If we defend the way we did
against Arkansas, we'll be a one-and-done in this tournament, and that's been
explained to our guys several times leading into practice today and several
times during practice today.  
  
These guys are really good, really good. Heck, at the 1, 2, 3, 4, catch and
shoot threes, finishing in transition, drawing fouls, using ball screens,
creating their own shot. In addition, they execute well.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Talk about the experience from -- let's start from Sunday night and
what's gone on the last couple of days. Not a whole lot of sleep, I would
imagine.  
JAYLEN ADAMS: It's been a fun experience. It's new to all of us, so we're just
kind of taking it in as we go. You know, from Selection Sunday all the way up
until the first game, it's all new to us, so I'm just enjoying it and trying
to not take it for granted.  
  
Q. Has Coach Smith given you a little -- he's had a lot of experience in
going to NCAA Tournaments through his coaching career and his playing career.
Did he impart any words of wisdom to you?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: Yeah, he kind of just told us to take it in. More the same, just
enjoy it. It's an experience that not everybody gets to have, and it's kind of
extraordinary to be here, so he just lets us know to enjoy it, but at the same
time that we're here to win games. We've got to take it in, but at the same
time, we've got to focus and prepare for Florida.  
  
Q. Jaylen or Matt, what do you take from the experience of playing
Florida last year in Lakeland, and can you use it as any kind of advantage in
terms of tomorrow night?  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, we know a couple of their players already. We know a
couple of their sets. We know what they like to do, but at the same time, they
know what we like to do, so I think it's an equal advantage for both of us.
We're going to go back and watch game film, watch what we did right, watch
what we did wrong from last year, and take that into consideration for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Matt, you've said before during the season before you guys got here
that either you or Jay have to be going at some point. Yesterday in the first
half really neither one of you were, but that guy was. How important is it to
have Courtney kind of emerge and really like mostly the second half of the
year where he's really started to produce more?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, like you said, if it wasn't for this guy, we probably
wouldn't be sitting here right now. I think that's just a testament to our
team. That's what makes it so dangerous. It's not just one or two -- it's not
just our backcourt. We've got a whole team that anybody any given day can go
off. We're just thankful for him and hopefully he's going to continue to do it
for the rest of the tournament.  
  
Q. Syracuse, Maryland, now UCLA. You're going to be David once again
when we go out there tomorrow. Talk about playing that role of David versus
Goliath and how much you play that up as a Bonnie when most people don't even
say Olean properly?  
COURTNEY STOCKARD: Well, I don't think we really look at it like a David and
Goliath type thing. At the same time, it's a five-on-five game. They've got to
come out there and lace their shoes just like we do. We just want to go out
there and play our game and execute the way we execute.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: You know, we don't fear anybody really. We don't really take on
that David or Goliath role. We're just coming out to play basketball. We're
going to go hard every day, and whatever happens happens.  
  
JAYLEN ADAMS: Just piggybacking off what those guys said, we're not really
intimidated going to the court like Coach said. They've got to lace them up
just like us, so we've just got to go out there and defend and do what we've
been doing all year.  
  
Q. Courtney, similar to the question that I asked Matt before, do you
think in the first half of the season, as you were starting to get comfortable
after being off for so long, that perhaps you deferred to those two a little
too much, and then as you became more comfortable, you yourself became more
assertive, more aggressive offensively?  
COURTNEY STOCKARD: I think my confidence just kind of rose as the season went
on. Like you said, me being off for two years, I was kind of rusty coming out.
I wanted to kind of get used to the game, kind of play off these two. And as
we went further in the year, like I said, my confidence rose, and I was able
to play my game a little more. And when these two can't get going, I try to be
more aggressive. And when I'm more aggressive, their looks open up, so I think
that's what helped this team a lot.  
  
Q. The defense kind of carried the weight last night. You guys led the
A-10 in scoring, but it was your defense holding UCLA in check for most of the
game. Is that something we need to keep relying on, knowing the offense has
scuffled a bit?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I believe so. It's something that we've hung our hat on all year
is our defense. We know we can score the ball, but the offense isn't going to
be there every night. Teams are going to adjust. And the one consistent thing
that we're going to have to do is defend, and I think we've been doing that
lately, and it's definitely something we've got to keep doing going forward.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, defense is what got us here to this point. Just like Jay
said, offense isn't going to be there every day, but as long as we defend
every game, we are going to give ourselves a chance at the end of every game
to win, so we've just got to keep defending, keep blocking out, and everything
else will take care of itself.  
  
COURTNEY STOCKARD: Just more of what these two guys just said. We can't really
-- we have to make sure we are consistent in our defense, and if we do that, I
think we can be pretty successful.  
  
Q. Matt, y'all have been here in Dallas for 12 hours. It was flying
through the night after the game, and I'm sure you would have rather done that
than go back home. Did you sleep on the plane?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, I probably got like an hour and a half on the plane. We got
back to the hotel, got some food, went straight to sleep. So I think everybody
is well-rested now. It's not really going to be an issue. We're all excited to
be here, and we're just ready to go.  
  
Q. From a game strategy point of view, getting ready so quickly to play
Florida, did you guys do any prep work beforehand as far as who you might
play, or is it, hey, we're just going to go into it, and is it more maybe what
you guys are wanting to do than worrying about Florida?  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, this quick turnaround is really nothing new to us. We've
played three games in three days before. We've had quick turnarounds all year
long. We're ready to go, and we can't use anything as an excuse. We've
actually scheduled -- our schedule is put in place just for this specific
moment, tournament games you only have one game to prepare, so we're ready for
it. Coach put us in great spot, and I think we're all ready to go.  
  
Q. You guys have been a lot of comparisons to the 1970 Final Four team.
You broke their record for most wins in a season, tied the record for longest
winning streak, and have you thought about the historical part of making this
trip?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: It's something that we haven't really taken in yet. We
understand that this is definitely a historical season. We talk about it
amongst each other. But it's one of those things that we're not satisfied, and
we're not going to be satisfied until it's all said and done, so we've just
got to keep pushing forward. And at the end, we'll look back and see what we
really accomplished.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, I think the same thing. I think right now, we're still
playing, so we're not really taking in everything that we've accomplished, but
I feel like whenever our last game is, a couple days after that, then it'll
really sink in, and we'll all realize all the special things we were able to
accomplish this season.  
  
COURTNEY STOCKARD: Yeah, to piggyback off what they said, we just want to kind
of focus on the task at hand that we've got right now, just worry about
getting Florida out of the way, trying to survive and advance. When it's all
said and done, then we can look back and see what all we accomplished.  
  
Q. Kind of building off of what you were just answering, this whole
season, all we've talked about is get here, get to the dance, get to the
dance. Just the other day, the elation of getting to the dance, how do you not
settle for getting to the dance and knowing you have so much more that could
be out there tomorrow?  
COURTNEY STOCKARD: I think we've just got to continue to keep that chip on our
shoulder, continue to focus on what we've got ahead of us and not get
complacent.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, like you said, this has been a goal for us all year, and
now that we're here, it's not like we just want to stop now. We always say we
didn't come this far just to come this far, and now that we're here, we want
to make the most of it.  
  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I would say it's something we expect going into the season. It's
something we spoke into existence that we'd be here. Getting here for us was
definitely a goal, but it wasn't the final goal. I'm just looking forward to
going out there and competing and finishing the season on a high note.  
  
MARK SMITH: It's an exciting time, and we're glad to be here. We had a great
flight, 2:00 a.m.,  
  
best flight I've ever had at 2:00 a.m. But it's been great, and really looking
forward to the challenge of competing against Florida tomorrow night.  
  
Q. There's been a pattern of some teams in recent years riding a first
four win sometimes all the way to the Sweet 16 or more. How do you think that
can give you momentum going forward?  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, I think the first game is always difficult. You have the
first-game jitters, and we had them last night. But I doubt that we're going
to have them again. I would think that Florida would have more jitters than we
have. Plus as you said, we're coming off a victory. We have momentum. Our guys
are feeling good about themselves. And like I said, they've already played a
game, and I think that's to our advantage.  
  
The disadvantage is not having time to prepare, the short turnaround, the
travel and all that. But as I told our team, when you're 18 to 22 years old,
you'd better not be tired. When you're dead, that's when you can rest. Our
guys aren't dead yet. We're just going to play and see what happens.  
  
Q. Going off the preparation and the fact that obviously very short
turnaround, how do you guys handle that? Did you do any early prep work on
perhaps playing Florida, and Matt said that you guys are prepared to play
three games in three days, but I doubt seriously with a two and a half hour
flight in between --  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, one of my assistants had Florida. We share those scouts.
Once the game was over, he gave me what he had on Florida, and then I watched
some tape on the plane. When I got to my hotel room, I watched more tape, and
I'll watch more tape when we get out of here. But I think preparation is
important. But I think sometimes at this time of year, you're going to do what
you do. You're going to do what you do best. Florida is going to do what they
do best. There's not going to be a lot of changes.  
  
You watch tape and you find tendencies and stuff that they run and how you
want to guard it. But for the most part, you're more worried about yourself.
And for us, it's more important for us to get rest than it is to be out on the
court preparing. We had a walk-through already for an hour and a half. We
watched tape on Florida. We'll go back after this, after our shoot-around and
do a little bit more. But it's more for us, it's more about getting our guys'
legs back and then just doing more mental stuff, walking through rather than
doing some physical stuff.  
  
Q. Talk about the travel that Bonnie fans have done for you, Washington
last weekend, going to Dayton, playing Tuesday night, and it looks like the
crowd is shifting to Dallas as we speak here?  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, we have a great fan base in my opinion. We may not have the
biggest fan base, but we've got the most passionate fan base in America. We
have 29,000 alums, and it feels like wherever we go, there's 29,000 alums with
us. Basketball is a huge thing at Bonaventure. We have great tradition, and
there's great passion. If you went to -- if you saw the game last night, the
rally center where we play at home, Dayton Arena became the rally center last
night. Our fans are tremendous, and we wouldn't be here without their support.
It's amazing to me, I've been the head coach for 11 years, and wherever we go,
no matter where it is, we have Bonaventure people there supporting us, and it
makes us proud.  
  
Q. Your offense, the best in the A-10 this season, but it's been your
defense that took you from D.C. to Dayton to Dallas for the alliteration. Can
you talk about the guys stepping up and really locking in on that side of the
ball, and again, how important that will be tomorrow?  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, we had a 10-2 non-conference record. We had some really good
wins against Syracuse and Maryland, Buffalo. And then when we started our
conference, I think we got a little bit soft and forgot that defense was a
part of the game. We started the conference at 2-4, and we were picked to have
a really good year and picked second, I think, in the  
  
Atlantic 10. After we were 2-4, we came back to campus and talked about as a
team how offense is fickle. It's going to be there one day, not the next.  
  
It's the defense that has to be the staple, and our guys have done a really
good job of focusing in on the defensive end. Early in the conference if we
had scored 65 points, we would have lost. But last night, the way we played
defense was the reason why we won, and that's carried us -- we've won -- I
think we were 14-1 the last 15 or something like that, and that's -- and we
had won 13 straight, and over that period, it was our defense that carried us.  
  
Our veteran guys understood, our young guys followed suit, and that's why
we're here. We have a really good offensive team. We average 80 points a game.
But it's our defense that has gotten us here.  
  
Q. The value of having a senior backcourt and particularly guys that are
talented, what makes them both special and unique?  
MARK SMITH: You know, we're really lucky. I'm really lucky. Any coach, you
talk to any coach in America, and what they want is the backcourt. You win
with guards, and it's the reason why we're here. Jay and Matt have been
tremendous for us. Jay is the quarterback. I'm a big Patriots fan, and he's
our Tom Brady. He runs the show. And Matt plays off of him. They both can
score at all three levels. They have a really good feel. They don't get sped
up. They hit big shots -- even last night, both Matt and Jay struggled, but
Matt hit big shots at the end, Jay was one for 15, I think, and hit that big
shot, that pull-up. They're not afraid to take that big shot. They're not
afraid to have the ball in their hands. They're not afraid to make a play, and
any coach would tell you, that's what you want in your guards, and that's what
we have.  
  
Q. Just following up on that, how do you view their matchup with Florida
guards, guys that have been there before?  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, we played Florida last year down at Florida. We lost by, I
think, two or three. So our guys know who they're playing, and the Florida
guys are really talented. We understand Florida is a really good team, very
well-coached, talented, long. Different than UCLA. UCLA's big guys were
skilled, Florida's guys are really athletic and long, and their guards, they
shoot the ball well from threes. They can take you off the bounce. They space
you out. So we've got a big challenge ahead of us being able to guard them on
the perimeter, but also dealing with their size and length inside.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jaylen and Matt struggling last night. The fact that
you guys won despite that, does that make you feel kind of good, assuming that
they're not going to have another bad games, two back-to-back games and being
seniors and knowing that they're not going to worry about having a bad game?  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, I've always said, basketball is played with five guys, and
our guards get a lot of attention, and rightfully so. But it takes five guys,
guys -- role guys playing their roles, and Courtney Stockard, you saw him last
night, he scores 26. When Jay and Matt aren't playing up to their
capabilities, you need somebody else to step up. And on a good team, somebody
else does step up, and we've had that -- Jay and Matt didn't play great every
game this year. And when they didn't, we had somebody else, Idris Taggee or
Courtney or Nelson or LaDarien step up, and that's a sign of a good team, and
that's why we're here.  
  
It's just not a two-man team. It's five guys working together and picking each
other up, and Jay and Matt didn't have the game that we were accustomed to
seeing from them, but we had other guys step up and make plays, and that's why
I'm sitting here tonight.  
  
Q. The community around you, the whole season, has talked about getting
to the big dance. You're at the big dance, you've got a win under your belt.
How do you make sure that guys aren't satisfied and don't settle for lack of a
better term with what you've already done, knowing there could be so much
more?  
MARK SMITH: Yeah, you know, we're not satisfied, and if you listen to those
guys, when they were up here, we have goals just like everybody else. Our goal
wasn't just to get to the NCAA Tournament. Our goal was to advance, just like
every team that's in this tournament.  
  
We have veteran guys, and I've always said that you're only as good as your
seniors, and we have three seniors that don't want this thing to end, and
they're going to do everything in their power to play as well as they can so
they can advance until Saturday. So there's no concern on my end that we're
satisfied. Our guys are driven. They're competitors. They competed last night.
I expect them to compete against Florida and play well. There's no, we're
comfortable, we've had a good season. We want to continue to win. We didn't
come down here to give Florida a good game, we came down here to compete and
win.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [Scott Nagy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23525)

### [Mark Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34982)

### [Loudon Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34983)

### [Grant Benzinger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34984)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. This is for Grant and Loudon. Could you guys talk and explain what
Ryan Custer's presence and his injury has kind of meant to the team this year,
and I know he was present there when you guys won the automatic bid, but
what's it been like having him around the team this year?  
LOUDON LOVE: It's something special for sure, and now we've been able to get
him on the road with us. It's a different aspect being able to have him at our
side all the time, and we have shirts with it on them. Some of the guys got
tattoos for him. He is the heart of this team.  
  
He's got the hard job of us all waking us up every day, pushing through some
obstacles that some of us have never faced. It's good to know that he's there
with us and that we can play for him.  
  
GRANT BENZINGER: Yeah. We're super thankful that him and his family were able
to come out here with us. We were so happy he was there with us at Motor City
Madness. And for him to be on the court with us to celebrate was a special
moment.  
  
Q. Loudon, can you explain why you changed your name and what was
involved? I just wonder if your family was excited about your changing it.  
LOUDON LOVE: Yeah. It's my mom's maiden name. My parents were divorced, and I
didn't see my dad for a very long time, and my grandpa helped my mom and I for
a long time after her divorce, so I'm kind of paying tribute to him and my mom
for all the hard work they put in.  
  
Q. Loudon, your journey has been pretty interesting to get to this
point. You were a football player. What was the decision? I know you had an
injury. How much did that play a part in going the basketball route for you?  
LOUDON LOVE: Not a huge part. Basketball has always where my heart was at, and
Coach Nagy being able to keep his recruitment after the injury made a big part
in staying with him, as well, after he transferred to Wright State. The
coaching staff there is just something special.  
  
Q. When did Coach Nagy plant the seed that, hey, you could be a
championship team or you could get to -- did that start right when you came or
this year or when?  
GRANT BENZINGER: He planted the seed in the summer. He saw the pieces we had.
He knew what was coming back, and he planted us then. But we started out with
three. Some of us didn't really believe, and then I would say around the
Georgia Tech game when we beat them, we really bought in. And ever since then,
it's been a completely different team, different mindset, different attitude,
and that was the turning point for us.  
  
MARK HUGHES: Definitely I would say he's always believed in us. And we really
at the beginning of the season like Grant said, we didn't believe it, but
around Georgia Tech when we got that huge win, we thought, we could do this,
why not us. Ever since then, we've just been playing with unbelievable
confidence and taking with one game at a time, and really we just picked up
some big wins. And now we know this shouldn't be just a once in 11 years
thing, why not every year, like Coach Nagy has been saying.  
  
LOUDON LOVE: Yeah. Like the guys said, starting 0-3, be close game, Loyola
here in this tournament and overtime loss to Miami of Ohio. So there were
close games. Nothing to hang your head about too much, but we still believed
then, and like they all said, the Georgia Tech game was probably a good
turnaround for us after one of our worst losses all year at Missouri State.  
  
Q. Mark, Tennessee apparently kind of turned its season around this year
by really stressing physical defense and being really tough guarding people,
that sort of stuff. What have you seen from looking at them? How do you guys
counter that, and have you gone up against teams that have had that similar
kind of philosophy this year?  
MARK HUGHES: I feel like we haven't seen a team this physical. Coach Nagy been
stressing that, just the pure physicality of the game is going to be so much
different, not to be reactive because they're a much bigger team, and we don't
want them to throw the first punch. We've got to come out and attack them, so
just being more physical is a big key for us winning the game.  
  
Q. A little bit of a curve ball for all three of you, but I'd like to
hear your thoughts if possible on gun control in light of all the gun violence
we've seen here recently.  
LOUDON LOVE: You know, I haven't been too in touch with it other than the
major happenings and issues, and I think it plays a part with us because we're
on a university campus, as well. Just the safety of everyone is a big issue. I
don't know.  
  
MARK HUGHES: Like personally, I feel like something needs to be done just
because it's been happening so frequently. Again, I'm not too familiar with
everything that's going on, but I feel like with recurrences like this,
something needs to be done because obviously like people aren't safe, and it's
not working how it is now.  
  
GRANT BENZINGER: No comment on that one.  
  
Q. Grant and Loudon, if you guys could talk about Admiral Schofield and
Grant Williams, what you've seen on film and just your thoughts, if you've
played against similar players to this, maybe the Georgia Tech game?  
GRANT BENZINGER: For Admiral, we've got a guy here that was first-team all-
defense. He'll probably be matched up with him. And then Grant, it'll be
Louden Love and Parker Ernsthausen and just splitting time with him. We have a
plan. They're two really good players. Grant Williams, SEC Player of the Year,
a lot of respect for them, the way they play. They play the game the right
way, and we're going to have a lot of fun competing against them and hope to
be the better team that day.  
  
LOUDON LOVE: Like Grant said, they're tough offensively and defensively.
Definitely respect their games inside and out. Just physical guys all over,
and we've got to be able to outwork them from the jump and be able to go throw
the first punch, like Mark said, from the jump.  
  
Q. Mark, having looked at film of Admiral, have you seen a player quite
like him, and how would you assess him as a player?  
MARK HUGHES: I wouldn't say I've seen a player like him just because of
physically how he's built, 6'5", 240, so he's got me by about 50 pounds. But
yeah, he's a good player. He's very physical, a good shooter, really just all-
around good game. I haven't really guarded anybody in the post, like he's
probably going to post-up, so something I've got to work on, and no, he's a
good player, though, for sure.  
  
Q. Grant, as someone who was on that team that went 3-13 in conference,
what does it mean for you now to be here with a shot to pull a huge upset in
the tournament?  
GRANT BENZINGER: It's huge. My freshman year was a disaster, just so many
injuries, not great attitudes on the team, and to have a complete turnaround
from freshman to senior year, it really sends me off on a great note, on a
high note. And you know, I wouldn't take back that freshman year for anybody
anything. It taught me a lot about leadership and work ethic and what it takes
to be on a good team and lead a good team. I'm glad it happened. It wasn't an
easy year, wasn't a fun year. That off-season was absolute chaos and no fun,
but to get to where we are now, definitely a blessing it happened.  
  
SCOTT NAGY: Well, I think we've obviously not had any players that have
experienced this, and so things like this, the attention, the travel, just so
many of the things that go along with the NCAA Tournament, they're so much
fun. Can be overwhelming. And so people have asked me, you've been there
before, how do you help these kids get through that. And my answer is, I
really don't know because I've been there before three times and we've not won
the game. It's not like I had the answer to help them get through that.  
  
Obviously there are some things I can talk to them about that I've
experienced, and so we've done that. But obviously super proud of our kids and
what they've done this year, and probably a little bit ahead of schedule of
what we thought could happen, but they've been one of the most enjoyable
groups I've ever worked with.  
  
Q. Scott, can you kind of go back and review when Ryan Custer got hurt,
what your reaction was, and what he's meant to the team this season, and
particularly now that he's been able to travel with you guys?  
SCOTT NAGY: You know, when it happened last April, it set our team back
probably about a month. It really hit us hard. Obviously it hit Ryan and his
family the hardest. But he was such a good teammate and is such a good
teammate, but to not have him around every day and to have to watch him go
through and his family go through what they've gone through was incredibly
difficult for all of us.  
  
You know, we're just so proud of him. It's a great story, and everybody wants
to talk about it. I wish it was a story we didn't have to talk about, but Ryan
has handled it so incredibly well. His family has handled it well.  
  
Yesterday when we got on the ground, we sat on the plane for a while because
we couldn't get Ryan off, and so -- and I think his family started to get a
little uptight because they were affecting the schedule. And then we got to
the bus, and the bus couldn't get him on, and we sat there for half an hour,
and so things were pushed back, and they were starting to get upset. And I
just went back, and I said, look, if everything was screwed up because Ryan
was with us, we would rather have Ryan with us. If we have to miss practice,
it doesn't matter. We would rather have everything go wrong because we have
Ryan with us than everything go perfectly and not have you here. And so we're
thrilled to have you here. I want you guys to relax and just know that we're
happy to have you here.  
  
He's meant so much to our team. Obviously we talk to our team a lot about
courage. And a lot of times, it takes one person to show great courage, and it
kind of bolsters everybody else's courage, and Ryan has been that for us for
sure.  
  
Q. What kind of bolstered you going back to South Dakota State when you
had several rough years as you became a D-I program? You had 5, 6 years, and
what, it's just -- you could foresee this coming or you had had success
before? What was it like going through that and now?  
SCOTT NAGY: When we made a transition, it was -- we had won 80 percent of our
games at the division two level. In terms of percentages, I was one of the top
coaches in the country. It was almost easy. And when we made the transition,
that obviously became very difficult. We had no league. We had five years,
obviously, to wait until we were eligible for anything, but even if you don't
have a league, it's pretty difficult to have anything good happen to you.  
  
So we were traveling all over the country trying to play people. We couldn't
keep players. We'd have one them or two years and they'd transfer. And in
terms of coaching, it was obviously the hardest time of my life and really
made me -- it made me a much better coach because when winning was so easy, I
didn't have to do as much. We just had better players. I all of a sudden had
to start coaching because we were playing people that had better players than
us, and I had to figure out how to be better at strategy, the X's and O's part
of the game, and so it helped me there. It probably helped me personally
because I had started to just identify myself with just winning all the time,
and all of a sudden I wasn't, and I felt like a loser.  
  
And one of the things I always told our players is whether you win or lose
doesn't say anything about who you are, and it was easy for me to say that,
but I didn't feel that way. And so I had to readjust some things in my own
life, so it was good for me that way.  
  
And I was thankful we got a new AD during that time. It would have been very
easy for him to get rid of me. Most coaches don't make it through a division
two to division one transition, but he knew enough basketball that he knew I
could coach, and we just needed the time, and he gave us the resources that we
needed. And we slowly did it. We won 6 games, 8 games, 10 games, 14, 19. We
just slowly built it and got the kind of players that we needed.  
  
Q. Just wondering if Admiral Schofield, how unique of a player he is and
what you've seen from him recently on film and how you plan to deal with
him.  
SCOTT NAGY: You know, we have a player in our league, in the Horizon League in
Khalil Small that's built like him, but he's 6'2", not 6'5". Now, Khalil don't
post like Admiral does. If you put a smaller person on him, he's going to beat
him up, and he's a tremendous offensive rebounder. If you put a bigger person
on him, he can step out and shoot it and drive him. He does become a problem.
You need an excellent defender on him. You need a tough person that can block
him out and guard him when he puts the ball on the floor. And clearly even in
the SEC with the bodies they have, people have struggled to deal with him. He
does present all kinds of problems without question.  
  
Q. Following up on that, the combination of him as he's been playing
lately obviously what Grant Williams does for them, you don't see too many
teams that have a guy like that around center anymore. How unique is that sort
of approach?  
SCOTT NAGY: It's very unique, and generally when you talk about teams being
physical, you think of the defensive aspect, that they just beat you up
physically on the defensive end. But they beat you up physically on the
offensive end. And if you don't move before they move, then it's over. If they
get their body on you and they're the first to move, they're the first to
create contact, then it's a problem, and they have -- you know, it's not only
Williams and Schofield, they've taught all of their threes, fours and fives
how to do that.  
  
Coach Barnes is -- and I've never played one of his teams, but having a chance
to watch film on his team, he's done an incredible job, and they -- not only
in putting a team together and just all of the motivational aspects that go
with it, but their X's and O's and their technique and how he coaches those
guys, I know is not very easy to get most people to do, and he's done it. He's
done a great job.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Aundre, selection day, you see Dallas pop up, what's it like being
here now?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It was an amazing feeling. As soon as I saw we were in Dallas,
I jumped up and screamed. And ten seconds later, I was on the phone telling my
mom telling her I was coming back home to play. I've had a lot of people that
wanted to see me play college ball, and now they get that chance to, so it's a
great feeling.  
  
Q. You guys had the big win over Florida earlier this season; what kind
of confidence does that kind of game give you moving forward in a season?  
DONTE INGRAM: It was a great confidence booster for us. We already had
confidence coming in, but obviously to get a great win over an SEC school like
that, that's something that you don't forget. So obviously moving forward, we
want to carry that momentum. We weren't content with just getting that win. We
knew we would go against other athletic, great teams. Obviously it was great
to get a win, but moving forward, we knew we had to do more.  
  
Q. If you guys won with people watching you for the first time or being
introduced to Loyola basketball for the first time and wanted to know one
thing about your program, what would it be?  
MARQUES TOWNES: Just a high team of culture. We really pride on our culture. I
think that's what made us successful this year. You know, Coach always drives
our cultures during our games and practice, and if we get that culture into
the game, we knew we would have a really good season, and I think it showed,
and this is why we're here.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: Going along with the culture, I'll say it's the little things.
We focus on a lot of little things that help us for the bigger picture, like
high hands or like short close outs, no middle and everything. We focus on the
very small details that help us become great.  
  
DONTE INGRAM: I'd say unselfish team. Each of us like we got like six guys on
the team that can score 20 each night, but we do a great job of spacing the
floor and moving the ball. We don't really care who scores. I think that's a
great thing and why we're such a big threat.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, I think they pretty much covered it, but just like our
togetherness I would say. We're so close on and off the court, and I think
that in clutch situations in the last four minutes of games, I think that
really comes in handy because we trust each other so much that we're going to
get the stops that we need to get at the end of the game, and we're going to
continue to move the ball and space it. I think that's been a huge part of our
success this year for sure.  
  
Q. Clayton and Marques. My limited understanding of you guys' offense,
there's a spacing. Do you think your offense is very difficult for a team to
prepare for because it seems like you guys just sort of read the defense as it
goes along? Is that a fair understanding, and do you feel like that's given
you guys a little bit of an advantage this year that it's hard to prepare
for?  
MARQUES TOWNES: Yeah, I mean, I think you hit it on the head. We really space
the floor. That's what we try to emphasize. Like they said, we're really
unselfish, so I think that plays a big factor. We don't really care who scores
the ball as long as we just keep moving the ball and sharing the ball and just
seeing everybody score, that's just -- it's just good for us. So yeah, I think
if we just space the floor and share the ball, I think that's why we're a
really good team.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, I think Coach Moser has done a really good job of
getting us to buy in on spacing, and we push at opportune times. When we have
the opportunity to push it and run, we're trying to do that. And if we don't
have something, we're going to run something, and we have really good actions
that have worked all year.  
  
Our ideas on spacing and stuff makes it really hard to guard, and especially
with the unselfish part of our team, if we space the floor and we're
unselfish, I think it's hard to match up with us because we have so many
weapons for sure.  
  
Q. Apparently you guys are the trendy upset pick right now, and I don't
know if when people are filling out their brackets they're talking about that,
you're hearing it, and what your thoughts are?  
MARQUES TOWNES: Yeah, I've seen there's a lot of media attention going for us
right now, but we just try not to handle those distractions right now. We're
just focused on our team and what we have to do to win this game. We have this
thing that we say, just have our blinders on, just block everything out and
just focus on us, focus on our togetherness, just look forward to this next
game and what we have to do to win this game and set our goals for this next
game. We try not to really look at it, but yeah, they really have us as an
upset pick, I guess, but we're chasing still.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: I've said this before, if we play how we play, we can beat
anybody. I think our team has something to prove just focusing on us and
handling our business, and then we'll be able to get the win.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, we've definitely seen all this stuff. It's hard not to
see it with today's social media and stuff like that. But I mean, we have the
ultimate respect for Miami, and we know they're going to be a really, really
good team. They're one of the top teams in the ACC, so we know they're going
to be good.  
  
We've done a good job all year of respecting our opponents for sure, but at
the same time, we have the confidence that we can go in and play against
anybody and win games in this tournament for sure.  
  
Q. Aundre, what's the story with how you wound up at Loyola out of
community college? How did they find you, or how did they get on your radar?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: In JUCO, we went to the Dream College National Tournament up
in Hutchinson, and I had two really good games. And then after the second
game, Coach Porter came to the hotel and talked to me, and we just clicked.
And when I went on my visit, I liked everything I saw, respected the culture,
just what the program was doing, and it was a perfect fit for me.  
  
Q. Donte, it's been a long time since Loyola was back in the tournament,
and there was a lot of pressure on you guys to win the automatic bid because
otherwise you might not have gotten in. I get the impression that's far from
your guys' radar. Can you kind of explain the mindset that you guys are kind
of starting a new season here?  
DONTE INGRAM: Well, first, we didn't look at it as like pressure. Obviously we
didn't want to leave it into the committee's hands, so we wanted to do what we
had to do to get a win, so not even cut it close or think about it.  
  
And second, we're far from content, as you said. We're not happy to just be
here. Just like any other team, we want to compete and we want to win games. I
think that this team is very capable of that. And just going forward, that's
all we're focusing on. We're not looking at it like, oh, we are here now and
that's the end of the road for us. We want to do what we can do to go in here
and get wins.  
  
Q. Do you have a specific NCAA Tournament memory that comes to mind as
far back as your first one that you remember watching the tournament as a kid
and imagining yourself in the position you are now?  
MARQUES TOWNES: I think it was my -- I guess my first kind of memory of the
NCAA Tournament was when -- I think where Mario Chalmers hit that shot when he
was on Kansas, and I think that was a really exciting moment, and that was my
first fond memory of the NCAA Tournament growing up as a kid. So yeah.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: I don't know, I can't really think of anything in particular.
I was a big Duke fan, so just hearing about Duke every year. I've always
picked them in my bracket, but now it's changed. (Laughter).  
  
DONTE INGRAM: For me, just coming up, always seeing -- obviously you've got
the Dukes and North Carolinas and everything, they're always having that
success. But I like seeing Cinderella stories as well and seeing teams have
that success that people didn't expect to have. Obviously seeing that one
shining moment songs and obviously being a kid growing up, you want to be a
part of it, and now I'm happy to be a part of it.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I grew up in Kansas, so I grew up -- my dad went to KU, so I
grew up watching KU. I remember KU actually -- well, the Mario Chalmers shot
in the National Championship against Memphis was one of the things that will
always stick out in my mind just because I was watching that game. And when
Mario Chalmers hit that three to send it into overtime, that was definitely
one of the moments that I'll never forget.  
  
And then also Butler making the run when they were still in the Horizon League
is definitely one that sticks out to me just because, I mean, obviously it's
hard to do. It's hard to make it to the National Championship game from the
Horizon League. And they had such good teams and they played so hard, and that
was definitely one of the teams I remember, too.  
  
Q. Talk about how it feels to be the team to break the NCAA Tournament
drought for Loyola.  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, it feels really good. I mean, obviously it's been a
long time. There's a ton of history around Loyola basketball with the 1963
team. And the 1985 team was really good, too. It takes a lot.  
  
I mean, it's been a really long time, but the thing that makes it even more
special for us to be the team that has made it to the NCAA Tournament is we've
brought like the buzz back around the campus. Basketball is important again
around the campus and the community. So it's more than just us on campus. Like
it's more than just us. It's about more than just us. It's about bringing
basketball around Rogers Park in Chicago and just seeing the smile on people's
faces when they talk about Loyola basketball is the part that's special.  
  
Q. Donte, we've already kind of touched on this, but people kind of see
you as the Cinderella team. Do you guys see yourselves as that?  
DONTE INGRAM: Like I said, we've said -- obviously people have picked us as
the team to be the Cinderella story, but we just have had blinders. As Marques
said, we don't want to get too fed into the outside distractions and
everything. We just want to control what we can control.  
  
Obviously it would be great to be looked at as the Cinderella story as we try
to move forward and win games, but like I said, our main focus is just buying
into all the small things and just getting ready for Miami, to begin that
process.  
  
Q. Aundre and Donte, apparently students across Chicago today are
participating in a national walk-out in protest to gun violence. Chicago has
been particularly hard hit. Just wondering how you feel about what's happened
the last few years with gun violence and if you have any thoughts about gun
control or things that might be able to solve the problem or improve the
problem.  
DONTE INGRAM: Obviously me living in Chicago and being from Chicago, I've lost
friends to gun violence, and I've seen it happen so much around the city of
Chicago. That hurts. I mean, you don't want things like that to happen. But I
mean, I don't know, I just think that there needs to eventually be rules for
who can get -- the owners of guns, who can own guns, I think they need to
tighten down on that because I feel like there's a lot of people, especially
in the city of Chicago, who own guns that shouldn't. I think if we can somehow
try to cut that down, that would help.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: I guess -- I don't know, it's the guns and the people. You
have two sides of the story. You have people like who's responsible with guns,
so I wouldn't say guns are all bad, but when you have people that like misuse
guns, I guess there's just two sides of the story.  
  
PORTER MOSER: You know, excited for our program, our University, our guys,
obviously, to be here. Dallas is a great city. I was fortunate enough to coach
at Texas A&M for six years, and recruited the area a lot. My wife is from
Texas, and ironically, in 1989 when I played for the Creighton Blue Jays, our
regional was Dallas regional, played at Dallas Reunion Arena. It's a really
great city and excited to be back.  
  
Q. How did that go? What do you remember about that as a player being
here in the regional?  
PORTER MOSER: I remember it was the same kind of feeling in terms of the
group. We had a really close family atmosphere, very close-knit group and
coaching staff at Creighton. And we went into the game, and we were playing a
Missouri team, and it's a game that just sticks in my craw, still does. We
were in control of the game, and they were loaded. they had Anthony Peeler,
Doug Smith, Lee Coward, Church, Byron Earvin. They were loaded, and Doug Smith
had a half-court shot to -- we were up like six or eight, six or nine, and
they hit the shot. And it went into halftime, and it just kind of turned the
momentum, and we ended up getting beat to a very, very good Missouri back
then.  
  
An experience in the NCAA tournament, I have been asked this a lot, what is
better as a player or coach? And unequivocally it's a player. You have a short
window as a player. The excitement, it's what you're working on as a boy,
watching it, dreaming it. And just watching these guys up here, to share this
with them, as you listen to them talk, you can understand top to bottom, we've
got high-character guys, guys that you want to go into battle with.  
  
So the experience of having a close-knit group is very similar to what I had
at Creighton.  
  
Q. How have you seen Cameron Krutwig develop as his freshman season has
gone on?  
PORTER MOSER: You know, he's the most vocal player that I've ever coached. I
mean, he is locked in. He's talking ball screens. He's talking. He's yelling.
I remember one of the quotes we had on our wall culture, great defenses are
noisy. And he's constantly talking. His confidence level has just risen as it
went on.  
  
I'll tell you, I probably made a mistake early on. Early in the year, he's an
elite passer. He's really good, old-school passer, so we were running a lot of
things through him, and I think he was passing -- his first and second thought
was pass. And it was about right around Christmas, and right after Christmas,
the conference started. I was getting mad at him because he was passing it out
of the post with two feet in the paint, just got on him pretty good. And he is
now looking to score when he gets a deep catch, and now you saw his scoring
average just go up. He still can really pass. Everyone knows that. But he's
getting more of a mad mentality when he gets it down low, and I love that.
He's spent a lot of time getting his body right. He lost 30 pounds in the off-
season, and I think he's just scratching the surface. I think this off-season
he'll be focused in on agility, not only losing weight, but getting that next
maturation process with weights and conditioning. But he's a fun kid to coach
because he's locked in every single day. He's locked in on scouting, what
we're supposed to do. He's a very, very fun kid to coach.  
  
Q. I talked to Steve Watson, I think, a few years ago. He's a basketball
guy, obviously, and he said it takes time for a program to rebuild the way
that you guys wanted to do it, the right way. Did you think you would be here
this quickly?  
PORTER MOSER: You know, I did. I did. You always think that. You know, you
build your program to that, and I know when we got here, we were last in the
Horizon, and then jumping to the Valley was a huge jump. And then that first
year we took a hit, and then the second year on, which was the last four
years, we won the CBI championship. We won 85 games the last four years. So
that's your vision. Your vision is to get here.  
  
We've showed the team one shining moment. We've had our own private selection
show with our own team with nobody there, going this has got to be us. It's
more than visualization. The effort these guys have put in, it has been a
grass-roots rebuild going to the dorms trying to get students involved to
speaking at freshman orientation to just absolutely the recruiting process of
the amount of time and effort we put in to get the right kind of student-
athletes to balance the education and the type of people we wanted at Loyola.
So it's been grass-roots from the very, very beginning.  
  
Q. I think Marques talked about having blinders on and trying to ignore
the noise. How difficult has that been this week?  
PORTER MOSER: You always love it when players regurgitate what you say in the
locker room. We talk about this laser-like focus with our guys, because how --
the experience they went through is the last eight or nine games of our
season, it was -- you start talking about the first four in, the first four
out. That starts happening so early. And everything they heard was we weren't
in. We had to win the tournament.  
  
So we kept on talking about having these blinders on and just focusing in on
us, our locker room, what we could control. And then we went into the
tournament. We won the league, and then we went into the tournament. It was
the same thing. We didn't talk about the at-large bid. We didn't talk about
that.  
  
That's what we've been talking -- that's kind of what we mean by that. The
same thing with distraction. We've had more distractions around Chicago. I
love it. I mean, you've been there. There's been more people talking about
Loyola basketball in 30-some years. And the guys are handling it because
they're high-character guys. They know every practice, every film session has
been locked in. And obviously the NCAA Tournament is another level of
attention, spotlight, which is great for them. It's what they wanted.  
  
You know, their focus hasn't changed. This week of practice for these film
sessions has been good, and the blinders have got to be strictly on Miami,
what we have to do for ourselves and what we have to do with Miami. Nothing
further. It is those two hours when we play them Thursday.  
  
Q. You found Aundre at a junior college around here. Do you remember
that, and how difficult was it to find him?  
PORTER MOSER: You always see reports, and we were following him, and one of
the things we liked when we read the first report on him is he gets a lot
done. He is very efficient, but he is undersized. And sometimes high majors
read that word undersized, and it scares them off. It's never scared me off. I
would rather have a 6'5" guy that is unbelievably efficient.  
  
So then we started digging in, and Aundre was the second or third leading
field goal percentage player in the nation in junior college. Well, that
translates. I remember Rick Majerus used to always say that translates. Last
year as a junior, he was the top five in the nation in division one in field
goal percentage. So we flew out to the national tournament to watch him on
this stage, and he played I think it was Northwest Florida, a team that was
loaded. I think they ended up winning it all. He played really well against
6'9", 6'10" guys. He had a knack to get it done. He was perfect for what we
tried to do. Back then, he was 6'5" and not 6'7", 6'8", but those things don't
bother me. I like guys that can get it done rather than just looks good to
announce to your boosters that you signed a 6'8" guy.  
  
Q. A lot of people are looking at Loyola as the Cinderella team. Do you
guys see yourself as that?  
PORTER MOSER: No. We haven't talked about it a lot, and here's why, we've
always said predictions are always from within your own locker room. We
weren't picked to win the Missouri Valley Conference. We were not picked to
finish second. Here is the thing, it's unfathomable to think you've got a team
like Miami. We finished third in one of the best conferences in the country,
in the ACC. They are extremely well-coached, space it. Lonnie Walker is a pro.
He really is a good player. They've got a ton of good players.  
  
I love what one of our guys said about respect. We've talked about in our
locker room all year long. We said it when we went to Florida. We said it to
Northern Iowa. Every team we said, this day and age, respect is not a
weakness. Sometimes people think you can't respect -- respect is not a
weakness. And I mean, these guys have an unbelievable amount of respect for
Miami. And all our focus is on what we have to do to try to contain their
athleticism because they're extremely athletic. But we haven't bought into
this -- I can imagine what they're saying. They finished third in the ACC. I
mean, they're really, really good.  
  
Q. Porter, from Jerry Harkness to Gene Sullivan to Alfredrick Hughes,
you do something like this, a lot of the history of your program becomes a
part of the present. How have you tried to incorporate that so these players
live that tradition and don't forget that now?  
PORTER MOSER: You know, I've said it from the beginning, I've had the guys
talk to them. From the very beginning, I've said the past is part of our
future. And when you start talking about the '63 national team, National
Championship team and what they went through with segregation and the game of
change, I think that has been one of the best things -- Shannon Ryan wrote a
great story about the '63 national team. And the conversation to talk about
that for young people, look it up. There's a great video on it, a great movie
on it.  
  
It's unbelievable what these guys went through. And then when you get to know
them, you get to know the Jerry Harknesses, the Jack Egans of this team,
you're like, these guys did it, unbelievable character, unbelievable guys. I
love Alfrederick's era. Alfrederick called me like -- it was like he was right
there himself going to the tournament. He was so excited congratulating our
guys. And pride is an awesome human trait. And to see the pride coming out of
Loyola alumni, Chicago, is a fun thing for the Loyola University.  
  
But 100 percent what they did in the past, the '63 team, and what they went
through and persevered has been something that's been talked about with our
guys and our program. And I've loved that this NCAA run here, getting in the
tournament, has brought that '63 team and what they meant to the country at
that time to light.  
  
Q. The fact that you're kind of being able to bridge Coach Majerus to
this team, I was talking to Ben Richardson about how you explained about how
successful people and you can kind of emulate that sort of stuff. Can you
maybe articulate a little bit more about Coach Majerus maybe having an
influence on this team?  
PORTER MOSER: 100 percent. I mean, Coach Majerus had a huge impact on my life,
my coaching career. You know, just being around a guy like that who thinks
differently and just thinks game preparations. But there's so many things I
took from him. One, it was amazing how he taught the game. You can go to
practices, clinics, and people will talk about practices, and you'll see a
coach yell at a kid. All right. I want you to hard hedge the ball screen. Then
you see Coach Majerus say, all right, your toes have to be perpendicular
facing the sideline. Your shoulders got to be ahead here. Your hips can't be
-- I mean, it's a lot of teaching points on how specifically to teach to hedge
it.  
  
That's kind of how the wall of culture that we've had in our program and our
locker room start. There's a lot of little phrases that he used that our guys
have bought into. And he was an amazing teacher. It resonated with the guys.
Here's a great example. This was fun. I've had former players will call, and
they said -- they watch a game differently. So Donte Ingram in the hotel
yesterday, we have one of our things is never come off a corner shooter. That
was a big Rick Majerus thing, never come off of the corner shooter. The corner
is three and the highest percentage shot. Literally yesterday we were in the
hotel, and we were watching a game, and Donte was screaming because he is like
that guy is coming all the way off the corner off the shooter and they hit a
three.  
  
It's fun to see them look at the game differently. Any player that played for  
  
Coach Majerus will say that. He said, you look at the game differently after
playing for Rick Majerus. I coached the game differently after working for
Coach Majerus.  
  
Q. Could you expound a little bit on Miami, and do you think that
they'll be -- well, they said yesterday that they are motivated by the fact
that you guys are being called the Cinderella, the sleeper team, the upset
team. How do you think that will affect the Miami players, and also, what
about the Miami team scares you -- not scares you, but concerns you the
most?  
PORTER MOSER: You can use the word scare. That's okay. They're unbelievably
athletic and long. Coach Larranaga, they do an unbelievable job spacing the
floor. They really space you, and they're going to drive you. They've got guys
that can shoot it, their length. We just don't see length and athleticism to
the level that Miami has. And they just space you.  
  
You know, that's one thing is their combination of being able to strike you
off the dribble. Sometimes you'll have teams that can strike you off the
dribble and you can pack off and they're not great shooters. They've got some
big-time shooters on the perimeter to go with that athleticism.  
  
The Cinderella thing, it's just -- both teams have to look at it. Predictions,
all that stuff, only matter within your own locker room, but what you believe
and what you think, I know they're not buying into it. I can tell you right
now watching how hard they play and how much they space the floor, so I know
they're not buying into it. It has nothing to do with Thursday.  
  
From our end, from their end, it's hard to fathom. Like I said earlier,
they're the third -- they finished third in the ACC, which is like an
unbelievable conference when you just start looking at it. It's unbelievable
that they finished third.  
  
You know, they check a lot of boxes. They're well-coached. They space the
floor. They've got shooters, athleticism. There's going to be no lack of
respect or no -- we're not looking like they're the underdog 100 percent.
There's a ton of respect from our end going into this Miami game.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. You guys come in as a six seed going up against an 11 seed. They've
won 28 games. A lot of people are picking Loyola as an upset special. Does
that get your attention even more? How do you view this team coming in that's
won ten games in a row?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: They're a very talented team. Everybody in this tournament is
very talented. So you've got to be good to get here, but we just watched film
on them, and we just go out there and play hard, and everything will take care
of itself. We've got full respect for the team. They've got good and talented
guards. They've got a great big man. So we're going to take advantage of the
pick-and-roll and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Lonnie and Chris, the two freshmen, can you talk about actually being
here in your first NCAA Tournament and what's it been like compared to what
you probably anticipated coming up in high school?  
CHRIS LYKES: I mean, it's everything I've anticipated. I'm definitely excited
to be here, definitely excited to have this type of opportunity. Not many
people get to play in a March Madness as a freshman. I'm going to definitely
take advantage of it, give 100 percent when I'm on the court. I know the rest
of my teammates are going to do the same.  
  
LONNIE WALKER IV: With me, it was kind of just how we would honestly look.
Once I set foot and committed to the University of Miami, this is definitely
one of the goals that I expected this team to accomplish, and that was to make
March Madness. Now that I'm here and I've been consistently thinking about how
it looks, how is it going to be and everything, it's been going past that. I'm
really shocked with how everything is going and how structured, how things
are. So I'm very excited, and I can't wait to step on the court.  
  
Q. For each of the players, today there's a national student walk-out in
protest to gun violence, and I think it was largely spurred by what happened
in Parkland. Considering you guys are just an hour away, how did that impact
you, and do you have any thoughts on gun control and addressing this
problem?  
CHRIS LYKES: It kind of -- like for me, it's a national like problem that we
have. I mean, it kind of makes me understand that your life can be taken at
any moment. Kind of like respect like the situation that I have with the
security that we have on campus and stuff, so I think we do definitely need to
make this an important, like, situation for the worldwide. Like we've got to
do something about this. We need to kind of like continue our focus towards
that.  
  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: It was an hour away from us, so it impacted us a lot. I think
the next game we had wore t-shirts for them in the pregame warmup. It's just
something that I think should be handled in a very, very calm way by the
government and things like that around the world.  
  
LONNIE WALKER IV: It was definitely a difficult time for myself because I have
a couple friends who had family and friends that also went to that school.
Seeing the negativity and the people upsetting crime, it definitely impacts
you in a personal way. Just knowing -- you know what Chris said, it can happen
at any moment at any time. You just be at the wrong place at the wrong time,
and that's the end of your life. Most of those kids went to that school not
expecting that to be their last day living. Most people went to that school to
get educated, be knowledgeable and learn and look forward to their future
lives, so the fact that they got taken for granted, got taken away too quickly
is one of the sadder things. It definitely has to be struck, especially
because of this national walk, and we have to take this seriously because Lord
knows what could happen next. But it's all about how we want to make a change.  
  
Q. Chris, Lonnie has really seemed to kind of take on a leadership role,
particularly once Bruce went down. What have you seen out of him during the
year since you're kind of fellow freshmen? And what kind of a leader and
player is he to you?  
CHRIS LYKES: Like you said, when Bruce went down, it was kind of like a
collective team, like we got -- each of us got to step up into bigger roles,
and for Lonnie, I think for him, it was more so of a scorer, like we need to
put more points on the board. And Lonnie is one of those guys who leads by
actions. In practice, he works hard. In the game, he's trying to get everybody
up on their energy level so we can continue to play well even if we make a bad
play. I mean, but it's been multiple guys. We've got a lot of different guys
who lead in different ways in this team. Like Ja'Quan Newton, the senior, he
tries to get us all on the same page, definitely prepares us well for the game
to get out there and give it the best effort. There's been multiple guys on
this team to help take up for Bruce's role.  
  
Q. I want to ask you again about the Cinderella thing. The Loyola guys
and their coach said they're not buying into that, that they fully respect you
guys are No. 3 in the ACC. Yesterday getting on the bus there was a little bit
of a chip on the shoulder like we need to go prove that we really are better.
Does it add extra fuel to see that so many people are picking you guys to lose
the first game?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: I mean, I think it don't matter who you play coming to this
tournament. You always have a chip on your shoulder. But like I said, it
doesn't matter if we play Loyola or any other team, we're always going to have
that chip on our shoulder like we've had all year. Like I told another
reporter, we've got a lot of respect for the team, watched film, and they're
really talented.  
  
Q. Chris, for a guy your size, you seem to have an ability to get your
shot off. How much of that is innate, and how much of that's been developed
over time?  
CHRIS LYKES: For me, I've always been small, so I mean, I think, like you
said, developing over time, just developing different ways to create space so
I can get my shot off. I mean, I've been playing basketball for like 13 years
now, so it's just been a development, just work hours in the gym and stuff.
That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Bruce Brown, everyone is wondering is he going to play. I know he's
going to be dressed tomorrow. What do you anticipate from him? Do you think
he'll play tomorrow or possibly Saturday if you made it there, and what would
he bring if he comes back to the team?  
LONNIE WALKER IV: As of right now, Bruce I'm pretty sure won't be playing, but
even besides playing on the court, the way he leads, the way he brings the
energy on the bench is something that truly can't be explained. He uplifts us
in a huge way without even dribbling a ball or shooting it or telling people
what to do. He's kind of just there bringing that energy off the court and
helping us to see it.  
  
Regardless if he's playing or not, he definitely brings that energy, you know,
consistently day by day.  
  
Q. Lonnie, you're hair is like artwork, looks like sculpture. How long
did it take to get that way, and what kind of response do you get on the court
and walking around campus for that matter?  
LONNIE WALKER IV: I kind of get that question at least twice a day. You know,
people are truly surprised with how different it is. I kind of let it grow up
by itself. It's its own person at this point because ever since my freshman
year, it was a regular flat top, then going into my junior year, it was still
a flat top, then senior year, it just became its own -- people have been
calling it a pineapple. And the student section definitely has a fun way of
pleasing and telling me what type of names it is.  
  
It's my thing. It defines who I am, just being a different person and a
different kid. All I can say is it's pleasing that other people are truly
delighted to look at my hair consistently.  
  
Q. This can be for any of you guys. How much pride are you taking in
getting this program to where the level it is right now, especially a school
that's considered a football school really?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Yeah, when I first came in my freshman year, like the games
were different. They weren't like sold out how they are now, and I think me
and my teammates, we did a great job of leading on the court, just trying to
get fans there by winning games. And my sophomore year we went to the Sweet
16, and then my junior year, we went back to the tournament. I think we turned
this program around a lot, and I think the best is yet to come.  
  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Just in case you're interested and wondering if I'm going to
try to change my hair style to do the pineapple look like Lonnie has, the
answer is no. My wife told me I wouldn't look good that way. (Laughter).  
  
Secondly, we are very excited to be here in Dallas. My brother used to live
here. My brother and his wife lived here in Dallas for I think about 20 years,
and we used to come and visit. And I've done a lot of speaking engagements for
the corporate world here in Dallas, and just love when we've come to Texas.  
  
My team is very young. We have five freshmen, four sophomores, two juniors and
only one senior, but it's a great group of guys, lots of youthful enthusiasm.
As I think you can see, they have a lot of personality. Our freshmen guards,
Chris Lykes and Lonnie Walker are really dynamic athletes and fun to coach and
fun to watch play, quite frankly. And then we've got a group of front court
guys that have really improved during the course of the season, and it's one
of the main reasons we're here in Dallas.  
  
Q. What kind of player was Loyola AD Steve Watson when he played for
you?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Steve Watson, the athletic director at Loyola of Chicago is one
of my former players, and we stayed in touch over the years, just a great
young man, great family man. He and his wife Ann have a beautiful family.
Steve is almost 6'10", can really shoot the three, was an outstanding passer,
had a very, very nice low-post game with a little right-handed jump hook.  
  
He could use some work defensively, but I believe he's still playing today. He
plays in all those three-on-three events and kind of in the old man's league
now. But he was a very smart basketball player. And when I look at Porter's
team, they kind of are similar to the way Steve played, really share the ball
well, really shoot the ball well, and they shoot a very, very high percentage
both from two-point and three-point range.  
  
Q. As a follow-up on the scouting report about this Loyola team, you
could say it's David and Goliath looking at your size, not just the seeding,
but what do you see from this team particularly defensively that could pose a
problem for your ballclub?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, I think the whole key is in Loyola's case they've got a
lot of experienced guys. They're older guys. They have two guys who have
transferred in from other schools, sat out, now playing at a very, very high
level. They've got the Player of the Year in Clayton Custer, they've got the
defensive Player of the Year in Ben Richardson. They've got the freshman
Player of the Year in Cameron Krutwig. They've just got a really, really good
skilled basketball team at both ends of the court. They play very good team
defense. They play very good sharing of the ball team offense.  
  
Q. I'm sure you're aware that Loyola came into Gainesville and beat the
Gators earlier this year. I don't know if you reached out to Mike White or
anybody on their staff to pick their brain on them? What does that say about
them?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: No. The University has got a great basketball program, great
team this year. They're in the NCAA -- I think they're also seeded sixth like
we are. And my staff and I have watched that game repeatedly to see how Loyola
approached the game, how they played the game. Maybe the most impressive thing
about it was Clayton Custer got hurt in the first half and didn't even play in
the second half, and they still were able to pull out the victory, showing you
like what kind of player Townes is. He moved from the three to the one and did
a great job of ball handling.  
  
So they're just a well-rounded team, well-coached team. Porter Moser worked
with  
  
Rick Majerus, who to me is one of the legendary coaches, a tremendous
defensive coach, and I see a lot of Rick's influence on this Loyola team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Bruce Brown and what he -- do you expect -- I know
you've been sort of saying that he's going to dress, but he's not going to
play. Is there any chance at all that he would play at all in Dallas, and
whether he does or he doesn't, what does he bring to the team?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: No. Bruce Brown is a unique personality. And when we recruited
him, I kind of anticipated that, that just getting to know Bruce is a real
joy. Bruce has tremendous personality and energy, and I heard Lonnie Walker
describe that. He's got great natural leadership qualities. And even though
he's been injured and hasn't played in the last six weeks, he still has had an
impact on our team.  
  
And if you'll notice him during the game at time-outs, he's the one getting up
and talking to his teammates about what's going on. Yeah, he'll tell someone,
hey, you've got to block that guy out, that guy is a heck of an offensive
rebounder, or hey, don't dribble so much, there's open men, you've got to hit
the open man. So he's not a coach, but he is definitely a leader.  
  
You know, he sat out for six weeks. The foot has healed beautifully. The
doctors have cleared him, but he's not in basketball shape. He's going to have
to rehab and get himself in great shape before he ever steps out on the court.
Unless we're able to advance into April and May, you know, chances are he's
not going to play.  
  
Q. Miami, Florida, Florida State all in the NCAA Tournament for the
second straight year. What does that speak to the level of basketball in the
state college-wise?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Yeah, I think one of the interesting things that has happened
over the decades, once the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat started up back in
the '80s, basketball at all levels has improved dramatically in the state of
Florida. And it starts at the grass-roots. It's the elementary schools,
playing a lot of basketball. We've always been a great football and baseball
state. But now you'll see some of the best athletes choosing to play
basketball.  
  
And now you have a lot of in-state kids being recruited all around the place.
I don't know how many high school seniors out of the state of Florida are
playing in this tournament, but I'm sure it's quite a few.  
  
We only have two. We'd love to have a lot more, but we have Anthony Lawrence
and Dewan Huell, two of our starters are terrific college players coming out
of the state of Florida.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the progression of the program, especially since
you've gotten there, and the level of what it is right now, I think three
years straight NCAA?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Yeah. When my staff and I arrived in 2011, there were three
things that everybody said we wouldn't be able to do: Number one, we'd never
be able to beat Carolina or Duke; number two, we'd never win an ACC regular
season or tournament championship; and number three, we'd never be able to
draw consistently good crowds to our home arena because people didn't have
that much interest in basketball.  
  
Well, we've been able to compete pretty well with Duke and Carolina. We've won
our share. Second, we've already won a regular season and a tournament
championship. And for the third year in a row, we've been sold out for every
home game. And as you mentioned, this is now our third straight NCAA
Tournament appearance. So we feel like we've laid the foundation for a
successful basketball program, and we're trying to build on that tradition.  
  
Our football and baseball programs have won National Championships. Football
has won five. Baseball has won four. We feel like we're building a foundation
that maybe one day we'll be fortunate enough to win our first.  
  
Q. You know firsthand an 11 seed can pull off an upset --  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: I've heard that.  
  
Q. You've been through that. What do you think is going through the
minds of the Loyola players in terms of motivation, and how are you alerting
your own players that, hey, don't look past this team because they're an 11
seed and we're a 6 seed?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, as far as I'm concerned, my experience is the seeding
doesn't mean that much. It's how well you play. And my George Mason team back
in 2006 happened to be a No. 11 seed, and we beat the 6 seed, which was
Michigan State at the time.  
  
I think very, very clearly the success that you've enjoyed during the regular
season and that Loyola has enjoyed, both during the regular season and in
their conference tournament, is going to give them a lot of confidence. They
haven't lost in a very, very long time. They've won 10 in a row, 18 of their
last 19 games, so you know they're going to believe that they can win this
game.  
  
The challenge for our Miami team is we need to play at a very, very high level
to compete with them. They're actually the favorite in terms of if you read
all the prognosticators, they're calling them the Cinderella already. And
we've got to be sure that we understand the caliber of our opponent has earned
an awful lot of respect. And there's only one way for us really to earn that
same kind of respect, and that's to play great tomorrow.  
  
Q. Just following up on that, why do you think, even though they have
had all the success this year and everything you just said, why do you think
so many people are picking them to win this game?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: You know, years ago, the discussion was always surrounding the
RPI, and there was a lot of complaint the RPI was not really good or what have
you. Since that time, there have been a lot of other statistical websites that
you can go to to analyze teams. The one I'm most familiar with is Ken
Pomeroy's, Kenpom.com, and the thing that's most impressive about Loyola is
their Ken Pom numbers, how efficient they are offensively, how efficient they
are defensively, and I think that's one of the reasons why the prognosticators
are looking at them as a team that's already proven that they can play great
basketball at both ends of the court. And I also am a great believer in  
  
Ken Pom, as well.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. I know you're excited to be here, but Ty, being in your hometown,
what's it finally like being here?  
TY CHARLES: You know, this is nothing but love and just glad to play in front
of my family and my friends with my brothers.  
  
Q. You're finally here on this stage. I know it's been a goal all year
to get there, and it was kind of iffy during the middle of conference play
with those four losses. Now that you're here, what are you expecting to show
the nation?  
TJ HOLYFIELD: I feel like we play our best basketball on the bigger stages, so
we had our ups and downs during our conference, but I feel like we can show
everyone how SFA basketball should be played.  
  
KEVON HARRIS: I feel the same way. I feel like we've been looking forward to
this all season. That's what we've been working hard for, so we're just
excited to be out there.  
  
LEON GILMORE III: The same as my two teammates. I feel like when the stage is
bigger, we play up to competition rather than kind of playing down to our
competition when there's not really no one in the crowd watching us play. I
feel like we're prepared for it, and it's a big stage, and we can't wait to
get out there and show the world.  
  
TY CHARLES: We've prepared, just ready to get out there and show what we can
do.  
  
IVAN CANETE: Same thing, just ready to play.  
  
Q. TJ, you said SFA basketball. Explain what you think that means or
what does that mean to people that haven't seen you guys play? Explain
basketball the way you guys play it.  
TJ HOLYFIELD: Disruption, pressuring the ball, where we consider ourselves a
defensive team, forcing turnovers, pressuring on-ball defense, help ball
defense. That's SFA basketball.  
  
Q. For any of the players, pop quiz: What does the F. stand for in
Stephen F. Austin?  
IVAN CANETE: I got it. I got it. It stands for fun.  
  
TJ HOLYFIELD: Dang, that's bad. We'll know after this.  
  
Q. Guys, when y'all can play y'all's style of basketball, we've seen you
put up close to 80 points in some games, and it seems like when you get slowed
down like you did in the conference championship, it slows your production
down. What do you do have to do out there against Texas Tech to get those
turnovers going and keep that fast pace?  
IVAN CANETE: We've just got to play our style of basketball, get out and run
and play together offensively. And once we do that, the points will just start
piling up.  
  
Q. Leon, what TJ said about defense, how tough are you guys' practices?
Do you guys love defense, because you have to or because you do?  
LEON GILMORE III: Man, practice is tough. You have to come with a different
mindset to get through one of our practices. It starts in the summer. I mean,
just getting conditioned, learning where to be on the court. We have to be at
a certain spot every time. Everybody moves in a certain pattern, and you just
have to be tough mentally and physically to get through it and learn it. But
once you get it, it's fun. That's what makes it fun. We go through all those
hard times in practice just for the games, and then we get to finally express
it once we get to the games and show everyone what we can do.  
  
Q. Ivan and TJ, I was just curious ever since that game against West
Virginia, almost making the Sweet 16, a lot of teams seeded where you are are
a little bit under the radar. You guys probably aren't going to be sneaking up
on anybody. What's it been like for you guys since that game and kind of
putting yourselves on the map?  
IVAN CANETE: I didn't play in the West Virginia game, but I watched it, and it
was pretty cool.  
  
TJ HOLYFIELD: Yeah, the game definitely put SFA on the map. It was already on
the map, but I guess people started respecting the school a little bit more.
They heard about the school. It helped bring in recruits, and -- I don't know.  
  
TY CHARLES: I mean, he said it. That was that team, this is a new team, so
we're here to create our own legacy.  
  
Q. Ty, about the defense, I talked to a coach that played you guys this
year, and he said that if you make teams go east to west, like side to side,
they're dead, they've got to go right at the basket, attack real quick. If you
were coaching against Stephen F. Austin, would that be your game plan, to just
attack quickly, and if you go to the side, to a wing pass, that's when things
get hairy for other teams?  
TY CHARLES: Most definitely, yes, sir.  
  
Q. Why?  
TY CHARLES: I mean, playing against our defense is tough, so you've just got
to make shots. If you don't make shots, it's going to be pretty hard to beat
Stephen F. Austin.  
  
KYLE KELLER: Well, we're excited to be here. I think our players have earned
the right, obviously. We had a tremendous non-conference schedule, and the
kids played tough. We had little bumps in the road in the league, but we
talked all year long about playing well as we went through March, and I think
our kids are peaking at the right time, and I'm excited for them as we prepare
for this two-game tournament here in Dallas, which to me is the perfect venue
for not only our players, but our fans. We know we have an unbelievable
mountain to climb in Texas Tech and what a great coaching staff they had, but
hopefully I think our kids will try pretty hard tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach Beard discussed your relationship and your time throughout the
years. Can you look back at some of your memories with him, maybe at a
McDonald's stealing Sprite instead of water?  
KYLE KELLER: You know, I have amnesia pretty good, so I'm not really
referencing what he's talking about, but I think he would really hate if I
aired some of my dirty laundry on him through the last 25 years that I could
throw back at him. But I think my hand just slipped on what lever to push. I
didn't hit water, it just slipped off the water tab. I think that's what
happened and Sprite accidentally came out into the cup versus water.  
  
I don't know if he remembers it exactly like that because I think I threw it
in the trash versus drinking the Sprite. Everybody that knows me knows I hate
Sprite. I'm a root beer and iced tea guy. I'm not sure how he remembers it,
but you know, Chris and I have spent a lot of time together, and we're great
friends, and I have the utmost respect for him. You guys are really lucky to
have a great coach like him. I'm glad he brought that up. What a great guy he
is. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Chris was also mentioning earlier today about how you guys come from
a rank of coaches that not a lot of people talk about from places that people
haven't heard of, and he said he took kind of pride in representing those
guys. I wonder if you feel the same way, and do you think there's any kind of
connection there because of your shared background?  
KYLE KELLER: You know, Chris and I, I think both were at one time, and Jeremy
Cox on my staff, who's my associate head coach. We were all living in San
Antonio when we were trying to figure it out, and he was at Incarnate Word as
a GA and Jeremy and I were at UTSA, and we were all trying to figure out where
we were going, hoping to make it in this career and if we could be somebody,
just hang on. Then all three of us go junior college coaching, and then you
never know, you take a chance. And Chris obviously has won everywhere he's
been, just like Jeremy has, and I've been blessed. And I just think the Lord
has blessed all three of us.  
  
There's no perfect -- I tell the young coaches all the time, there's no
perfect way to become a head coach in this level. You have to be blessed. I've
been blessed by my athletic director who's leaving me right now. I'm not happy
with him at all one bit because he's leaving. But you know, Chris is -- I
think he's only had 62 jobs in the 28 years, 25 years he's coached, and won
everywhere.  
  
He left Tech and came, and we had dinner at PJ's Brewery. He wanted to learn
Bill Self's ball-screen continuity. I think it took all of 20 minutes to learn
what Coach Self has perfected. Then he went undefeated in his professional
basketball career because he never runs that ball screen offense. That's how
smart a dude he is.  
  
And so you know, he's a special guy and a special coach. He can do anything.
You know, he's a magician as a basketball coach. You know, you can imagine how
excited I am that we get to play them.  
  
Q. Getting your guys to play the relentless defense that they play, I
guess if they don't do that, it's a non-starter literally. But it sounds
simple; go out there and play defense. How do you get guys to do that?  
KYLE KELLER: We're on our second treadmill at our place. You know, we don't
have a chance to be successful. We don't have a chance -- if you follow this
program, and I know from here you love basketball, Brad Underwood couldn't
have won two games in the NCAA Tournament. If we're going to line up and be
traditional, we have no chance to win a game.  
  
But if we do something different, we have a chance, and Tech averages 12
turnovers a game. If we force 12 turnovers tomorrow, it's going to be -- we're
going to ride the bus back home again. We have to do something different for
us to have a chance to win. And for us to try to not let them catch, to make
them uncomfortable and those kind of things.  
  
You know, it's a credit really to our kids' parents, allowing us to make them
uncomfortable every day in practice. We have got great parents. Our staff has
recruited great kids, and to allow us to coach them, and to not be entitled in
this society and in the generation today and allow us to make them
uncomfortable every day to take them to another level. I think we have nine
starters. So they know if they don't do it the way we think we can be good at,
then they'll -- I told them today, I said, hey, please put the shooting shirt
on and cheerlead or go play the trumpet in the band tomorrow, whatever you
want to do, but if you can't play this way tomorrow, just be ready to go home
with the band or the cheerleaders because you ain't playing tomorrow if you
can't play the way we play.  
  
Q. I subjected your players to a pop quiz, so I can't spare you.  
KYLE KELLER: Uh-oh. I was a terrible student.  
  
Q. What does the F. in Stephen F. Austin stand for?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, golly. You know, I did my research before I got this job,
and I think it's Fuller. Is that right? I was pretty blessed. I wanted to know
everything about the school before I went into it the most I could, but I'm
sure our guys -- I can imagine the dumb looks on their face. They could have
thrown some stuff out there. I'd hate to -- I don't even want to know what
they said.  
  
Q. Following up about the defense, do you have to recruit a certain kind
of player that you know will, like you said, not be entitled and be willing to
be pushed maybe beyond limits?  
KYLE KELLER: As a coach, as you know, we all think that we can change every
kid. We all believe that. And I'm no different than most of them. And I've
tried. Some play, some don't, some leave. We've had a couple leave since I've
been there. I said this a week ago, the greatest talent you have in my
opinion, and I learned this from Coach Sutton, spending so much time with him
and Sean, is your heart, your Valentine.  
  
The last kid I signed won our game for us last Saturday, is a kid named John
Comeaux, who his mother when she asked me if I offered him a scholarship, she
got down on her knees and cried last spring in her house, and I really -- it
was kind of a soft scholarship offer if you can believe it, but I knew right
then and there I had to have him because it meant so much for them and their
family to come to Stephen F. Austin.  
  
We had gotten tight and nervous and we had the game under control, but he
would give the energy to our team. He wasn't afraid. He cared so much about
Stephen F. Austin, and he changed the game for us. But it's character and
willingness and those kind of things.  
  
And it's deeper than, hey, how pretty is this shot, those type of things, I
think that allow us to remotely have a chance to beat somebody else versus,
hey, he's 6'8", 220, or fits all those things maybe like those kids that I've
coached in the past at our place. Don't get me wrong, I'll take a five-star
kid, and we'd like to have them. If they'd like to come tomorrow for the
spring, they can come on, we'll coach them, too, but they have got to be the
right kind of kid. We consider ourselves gritty and grimy and that kind of
stuff.  
  
Q. Let me ask you first, how big was it on Sunday when you find out you
were playing in Dallas, and secondly, have you got enough tickets now?  
KYLE KELLER: You know this story. Back in December, the Lord told me we were
going to play in Dallas. And the second thing is there is not enough tickets
for all the people that want to come to this game that are involved in my
life. I need to get to this game, that's for sure, at least I'm responsible
for getting them tickets.  
  
But I'm sure Coach Beard and their families and the players that are involved
with Texas Tech have the same problem that I do, which I think is great. I
think it's wonderful, and I'm blessed that so many people want to come to this
game tomorrow, especially for me, for my first time. I'm so lucky that people
want to come to watch us play and that has been a part of my life, and I get
to play in Dallas? Oh, it's a story book. But I've been led everywhere, and
it's no shock. You know, trust me, it's no shock that we're here.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Zhaire, and just all the Dallas guys, what's it like to come back
home and be able to see some friends and family, and if all three of you could
kind of speak on that real quick.  
ZHAIRE SMITH: It's very exciting. I'm just glad to be home, but I just came
here to play basketball.  
  
ZACH SMITH: Yeah, I agree with what he said, just excited and good to be home.
Don't really get to see too much friends and family. Going to be pretty busy,
but excited to be here.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: That's what it's all about, playing in front of friends and
family, so it's a big deal.  
  
Q. Zhaire, how do you feel your game has developed your freshman
season?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: I feel like it developed a little bit because I've been working
hard on it, and when you work hard, it translates.  
  
Q. Zach, talk about just being back and what the time away from the game
was like for you this season, and how different are you and how rested maybe
are you now going into this final stretch?  
ZACH SMITH: Being away, it was pretty tough, spent a lot of time just working
hard trying to get back on the court. I'm just blessed to be back.  
  
Q. Keenan, what is it about this SFA team and the way they try to
disrupt you in the half court, the way they try to trap ball screens and all
that?  
KEENAN EVANS: They're similar to South Carolina and West Virginia type teams,
and we know that they force a lot of turnovers in the half court, and whether
it's full court pressure or half court, and they just try to make it really
tough for teams.  
  
Q. Justin, just in terms of what y'all have to do defensively against
Stephen F. Austin, what kind of stands out to you about them and what you all
have to do to kind of slow them down a little bit?  
JUSTIN GRAY: They do their sets really well. Mainly for us just ball pressure,
being a help defense, siding, a lot of stuff just being what we are, a
defensive team, and just doing our tactics that we've been doing all year. But
SFA is a really talented team. They execute their offense really well, a well-
coached team, so it should be fun on Thursday.  
  
Q. Keenan, what was your reaction to seeing that you guys got to play in
Dallas for the opening round, and what did your friends and family say when
they found out the news?  
KEENAN EVANS: It was like a celebration. We were all happy, excited to be able
to play in front of friends and family and have such a -- it's going to be a
good crowd for us, and hopefully that gives us an advantage.  
  
Q. The ability to come back here to some extent, is it like a home game
of sorts for you, the comforts of home being able to come back to the DFW
area?  
ZACH SMITH: I mean, Stephen F. Austin being a Texas team, also, we expect them
to have some fans here, as well, and I feel like it's homecoming, but I
wouldn't consider it a home game.  
  
ZHAIRE SMITH: Same. Yeah, I feel like it should have just half and half. It
should be a pretty good vibe for both teams.  
  
JUSTIN GRAY: I'm not from Texas, but I love the fans. But yeah, it should be a
good turnout for both teams, and I know we have a great fan base, so I'm
excited to see just the number of people Tech brings to American Airlines.  
  
Q. Keenan, obviously when Zach missed his time, you missed your time
where you were not 100 percent. Talk about where the team is right now. You
got through the Big 12. It's got to prepare you for the NCAA and you've got
pretty much a full roster right now. Talk about that.  
KEENAN EVANS: I would say that helped us in a ways of coming together, people
having to step up and take bigger roles, and that brings out the best in
people and shows them what they can really do. And especially now that we're
back and healthier, certain people can play like that still, and once we got
all our pieces together, it's just we're a better team. We just look forward
to people playing their best and getting back to what we do.  
  
Q. Zhaire, just obviously being a freshman, just having your first
experience here, what's it like, and I guess is it not necessarily that big
just because you've been on a big stage before like Madison Square Garden in
previous games?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: I'm just learning from Madison Square Garden. I'm just living in
the moment right now, enjoying it.  
  
Q. Zhaire, what would you say was the biggest challenge you faced as a
freshman, and how did you overcome that?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: Most challenging, the speed of the game. I feel like the speed
of the game is very fast, and I just have to overcome that.  
  
Q. Keenan and Zach, how important was the rest for y'all just to kind of
get your minds right and just kind of get the bodies right?  
KEENAN EVANS: Yeah, I'd say it was big. I'd say it helped a lot, me sitting
out of the game and resting, and also these breaks in between the last few
games has been good, and also being on the sideline and kind of watching the
game from afar, it really helps you break down stuff so when you get back, it
feels like it makes the game a lot easier.  
  
ZACH SMITH: I feel like the rest was extremely important, just being in the
training room, getting your body right before you go back out there.  
  
Q. Keenan, Zach, neither one of you guys came from real touted
basketball powerhouses in high school, but every year your game has gotten
better, every year you've gotten better. Talk about what it's been like to
progress from not being all-world in high school, but it's gotten better and
better every year.  
KEENAN EVANS: It's just, like Coach Beard says all the time, just a process,
during the summers, during the year, just staying committed and stay working.
It's been a process from being at the lowest point of Texas Tech basketball to
now one of the highest points. It's just always going to be a process, and you
can't let up.  
  
ZACH SMITH: Keenan couldn't have said it better, just sticking to the process,
trying to expand the game, and do the best you can.  
  
Q. Zhaire, obviously the season began with quite a few freshmen, quite a
few seniors on this team, and you guys have developed and built a continuity
and chemistry. Talk about where it's kind of set the foundation for moving
past. I know you guys are focused on this tournament, but talk about how it
set a good foundation for this program moving forward after this year.  
ZHAIRE SMITH: We're just learning from the seniors, follow in their footsteps.
We just always ask them questions, so we just follow in their footsteps.  
  
Q. Keenan, just one more time, I know you kind of mentioned it about the
process. How long do you feel like this moment for you and Zach and all the
seniors, what's it been like either at the off-season or just when you first
started at Texas Tech, and what's it been like to get all these No. 3 seeds
kind of play in front of your friends and family? What's that process been
like?  
KEENAN EVANS: I would say that the ride has felt long in the moment, but then
you realize like how fast it's gone by. But this last go-around has been
amazing. I'm just not ready for it to end, so we've just really got to battle
and keep it going.  
  
ZACH SMITH: Yeah, like he said, it's just been a long process, just feels like
-- we're here now, just got to live in the moment and take advantage of the
opportunity.  
  
JUSTIN GRAY: I mean, yeah, pretty much what these guys said, but feels like
yesterday we were just moving into the dorms with each other and just getting
our first shots up in the gym, but now we're seniors and it's the NCAA
Tournament, so it's a fast turnaround, and people try to tell you that college
goes by fast, but you really don't realize that until you're finally at the
end of your road. Like Keenan said, we're going to try to make this last as
long as possible and just play our hearts out.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, just really proud to be here in the second year of building
our program. I think about those guys that y'all just talked to, Zach and
Keenan and Justin, and when the coaching change happened between Tubby and our
group, I just promised those guys we would do everything in our power possible
to get them back in the NCAA Tournament, and came up a little bit short last
year, but really appreciative of those guys staying the course with us.  
  
We look forward to hopefully being a part of the fight. But the story in my
mind is just how thankful and appreciative I am of our players and all the
work that they've put into our program to get us back to the national
tournament.  
  
Q. When you were recruiting Zhaire Smith in high school, what did you
see in him, and how has he developed in his freshman season?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I think with Z, the obvious is the athleticism and the
talent, but what we saw early on in the process was the thing to me that makes
the difference and will eventually make him an NBA player one day is his
character, his toughness, his unselfishness, and maybe above all, his love of
the game. I think in today's world with rankings and the internet and all this
stuff and kids' talent can be pretty well-documented pretty quickly. But what
separates, I think, the good from the great and the great from the elite is
just the old-school love of the game, and Z is a guy that loves basketball.
He's always in the gym.  
  
I'd put our other freshman Jarrett Culver in the same classification and Moro,
Malik, and that's one of the great things about our team is we've literally
got a bunch of guys that love basketball.  
  
Q. I know you kind of mentioned it already, but just the process for
these guys to get back here, especially like you said with the coaching
change, just how much work has been put into this, and how gratifying is it
for you to kind of watch these players kind of do that and just kind of reward
themselves with this?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, you know, I've always had a kind of problem with the
coaches that talk about how hard they work. They all do. Or this player has
this extreme work ethic. He makes 500 shots -- everybody does that at this
level. But I would say is this: I don't think we work harder than anyone else.  
  
I'm not saying we're better, but there's no one in all of athletics that works
any harder than us. We take a lot of pride in our day-to-day process, whether
it be nutrition, fueling the body, weight room, getting your body to play in
the Big 12, training room, making sure you're sharp. The academic piece of
being a student-athlete is everything to us, individual work, but we just have
a day-to-day process that we believe in, and we've got guys that want to buy
in and be coached like that.  
  
Great players want to be coached. They want to be pushed. And that's what we
inherited first year with Tubby Smith's class. I can't thank Coach Smith
enough for the foundation that he laid that we're benefiting from, and for the
players that he added to the team. But I think at the core is a bunch of guys
that want to get better, and I believe in our day-to-day process.  
  
We don't have a lot of McDonald's All-Americans. We don't have a lot of
players that national scene has heard of. I think our season speaks for
itself. And at the core of all that is just guys that love basketball, coaches
that love basketball, and a process that we believe in and that we try to
execute every day.  
  
Q. SFA, those guys force 20 turnovers a game, the most out of anybody in
the country. What is it about their disruptive style of half-court defense
that makes them so effective at that?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, Stephen F. Austin is one of the best teams in college
basketball. Ask LSU, ask Missouri. They passed the eye test with their non-
conference schedule, and they just got really good players. They've got guys
that have played on NCAA Tournament teams. This is a team that's beat West
Virginia in the tournament just a couple years ago as well as another first-
round game. They've got all-conference players. They've got guys that are
going to play after college. And then they've got a really good coach.  
  
Kyle Keller is a guy that all of us in basketball know Kyle. We know of his
success in the Big 12, an assistant for Coach Sutton and Sean. We know he was
at Texas A&M and built the program quickly. I know he was a great junior
college coach back at Tyler. Kyle and I after recruiting events, we'd go to
McDonald's. Neither one of us could afford the regular meals, so we'd order
two things off the dollar meal and then we'd get the water cups, and I'm not
proud of this, but when they weren't looking, we'd put Sprite in the water
cup. Nobody respects Coach Keller more than I do. I make sure that our players
understand you're playing against a really good team. You're playing against a
team that's good enough to beat anybody in this tournament in a 40-minute
game, and you're playing against a team with a coach that knows what he's
doing.  
  
Q. Along those lines, when you're in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in
the ABA and McMurry, do you think that you're on your way to something like
this, or is that even on your mind?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, I have a lot of confidence in myself. It's not arrogance. I
would hope the people that know me, including my three daughters that are
here, they keep me humble pretty quick. But I have a lot of confidence in
myself, and my confidence comes from the people I surround myself with.  
  
I think we have the best coaching staff in college basketball with Coach Adams
and  
  
Coach Ogden and Al Pinkins and our support staff with Coach Sutton and Brian
Burg and Max, and I just surround myself with winners, people that have been
there and done it. Our coaching staff, everybody on our staff has won a an
NCAA Tournament game. Two have played in the Final Fours. Then I have a lot of
confidence in our players. I recruit guys that I know I can coach, guys that
love basketball and want to get better, and then ultimately that's where great
opportunities come from is when you have good players.  
  
So I am a confident person, so back in those Myrtle Beach days, I was just
trying to win the next game on the schedule. As I sit here today, I'm having a
lot of fun. We're eating in nice restaurants, staying in nice hotels, walking
through carpet here. Four years ago, I used to stay at the Days Inn. The
continental breakfast is what we ate for pregame meals.  
  
I never forget where I come from. I wouldn't change my journey for anything,
but today's story is these Texas Tech players and this team and everything
they've done to get us here, and I'm just enjoying the ride. I don't want it
to end. I want to coach these guys all the way to Monday night me where it is
me and one other guy coaching and everybody else is just watching the game in
a sports bar.  
  
Q. You mentioned it there, your three daughters are here. Emotions
running high as you enter the big game. What's it like to have them here, and
you also mentioned they humble you. How do you do that?  
CHRIS BEARD: Anyone who has three daughters understands where I'm coming from.
Margo woke up this morning and asked what we were going to do today. There's
an American Girl Store in the Galleria. I said, well, we've got a basketball
tournament. And then Avery is smarter than anybody in our program combined, so
when she says something, we all just kind of pay attention. And then I wish
Ella can play some minute sports. My middle daughter is very competitive and a
good player. No. It's special.  
  
And again, I just want to thank our players. I've thanked those guys four or
five times this week. They're the guys that have worked so hard and played
good basketball and overcome adversity to get us into this tournament, where
all of us, including myself and my daughters can benefit.  
  
Q. When you beat Kansas up in Lawrence this year, someone asked you what
you had, and Kansas didn't have. You famously said, we've got Whataburger in
Lubbock. Have you given directions to any Whataburgers here or passed any
dining advice to these non-Texans?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I grew up in Irving, Texas, right down the road, so I know
where they all are. We are staying at the Hilton, and over there is a
Whataburger right on feeder road. I might have or might not have walked over
there about 3:00 in the morning. I'll leave that up to you.  
  
But no, I just kind of speak from the hip. I'm not a guy that really prepares.
I just speak from the heart. I think that's where coaching is. Guys know, you
tell them the truth, and that's everything in recruiting and coaching.  
  
With that comment, I just -- it's actually worked out pretty good for me,
though, the people that own the Whataburgers in Texas, they sent me like a
Yeti cooler, I got a couple coupons. It's worked out really good for me. It
was one of my better decisions.  
  
Q. Tommy Hamilton, how would you describe his role and the way he's
developed for you?  
CHRIS BEARD: Tommy has been great for us. Tommy jumped on board with Texas
Tech when we were kind of unproven. As a transfer coming from DePaul, he could
have gone a lot of different places. But he believed in us before we had a
body of work to show him, what we are going to do and going to try to do, and
he believed it. I'll never forget Tommy visited his mother. Him and me were
sitting there talking about the process, the nutrition, to working out and
stuff like that. And we also are two guys that say let's not talk about the
past. Let's just talk about the future.  
  
I have a lot of respect for Tommy. He transformed his body during his sit-out
year last year. He lost 50 pounds. That is hard to do. I have been trying to
lose 4 pounds for the last 2 years. Tommy dropped 50 in 6 months. He's one of
the better players. I think he'll be even a better pro than he was a college
player for different reasons, but Tommy is skilled. When Tommy plays well, we
play at our best. But I have a lot of respect and appreciation for Tommy
Hamilton, and it's been a great ride coaching him, and again, I hope I can
coach him well into this month.  
  
Q. Chris, what did you guys learn about yourself in the time that you
either didn't have Keenan or had him really limited there late in the year?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, I think we all learned about the character of our team and
the things that we hold our hat on that came through. I tell the guys all the
time that in life, and just like in college basketball, it's not a matter of
if adversity is coming, it's a matter of when. That's just the life that we
all live. Basketball is no different.  
  
So we talk a lot about things like mental toughness in our program, and to
have to overcome some of these injuries, whether it be Keenan, whether it be
Justin, the first play of the Kansas game or Zach all season long. Just the
fact that these guys have had the kind of season that we've had overcoming
some adversity is a direct reflection of their character. All teams have
adversity. All teams have injuries. But I think we've had our share this year,
and our guys have just overcome it.  
  
We've had a steadiness to our team, a professionalism, a maturity. I tell the
guys all the time, it's like, prince today, frog tomorrow. You win a game,
your cell phone is blowing up. Everybody is your best friend. Text messages
are random and you drop a couple, and it gets pretty quiet pretty quick. And I
think our guys understand that. We don't get too high, and we don't get too
low. And I think that steadiness is a necessity to play in the Big 12. And I
think it could actually help us in this tournament, too.  
  
We expect a great game against Stephen F. Austin. We know they're going to
have runs. They're a really good team. And I think we've got to be steady. The
NCAA Tournament games are long games. They're a game of runs, and I've always
thought the team that can kind of stay the course gives themselves a chance
late in the game.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Kyle and Admiral, when Coach Barnes took over the program, what was
his message to the team about really his vision for what you guys could
become?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: You know, Coach Barnes is a really respected coach who comes
from a great history at University of Texas, so he kind of talked to us about
the stuff he expects, our standards, the stuff he brought from that program
over to us, and all his visions for everything and everything he wanted us to
be.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, just to follow what Kyle said, the biggest thing was
changing the culture and instilling a program that could compete with the
Kentuckys and the different winning programs in the SEC. So the biggest thing
was just instilling character within the program off the floor and on the
floor, and also just guys who were willing to work hard and going out and
competing as hard as they can, no matter the outcome.  
  
From that point on, we have been building that. And that's what our standard
is, especially some of our characterization traits that we have is
responsibility, respect and humility, things that we live by, but also playing
on the floor with just guarding and competing as hard as we can, playing
together, being unselfish, and remember what we're playing for. Just go out,
like I said, and compete as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Admiral, do you think it's fair to say you've got the coolest name in
the NCAA Tournament, and how did you end up getting the name?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, I think it's pretty cool. To be honest with you, at
first when I was younger, I didn't like it. So my parents never called me by
Admiral. Believe it or not, they call me by my middle name, Donovhan. And when
I was in, I think, the second grade, they ended up calling home and saying,
Admiral hasn't been showing up to school for the last month. So they called
home and was like, Admiral hasn't been showing up to school for the last
month, and it's only because they would call Admiral in the classroom, and I
wouldn't answer because at home my family and friends would call me Donovhan.
So my parents had to teach me my name because I really didn't know my name was
Admiral.  
  
I got my name because my dad was in the military for 24 years. I was born in
London, England. Over there, they have the Admiral Insurance like we have the
General Insurance here. It was aired on infomercials over the radio. And he
was like, Admiral, so my name was Admiral, so that's how that came about.
Yeah, it's a pretty cool name. I didn't really like it, though, when I was
younger, but I've gotten used to it now.  
  
Q. Jordan, I think you guys led the SEC this year in defensive
efficiency, how much of that is in your DNA, and how much are you going to
need to rely on that to be successful in the tournament?  
JORDAN BONE: Yeah, defense is big when it comes to winning games. At the
beginning of the season, that was a part of our standard, just to be a hard-
nosed team that played defense really efficiently, and that's going to win us
a lot of games and already has this season. So we're just going to stay true
to our standard, perfect it, and continue to perfect it, and continue to
perfect our defense.  
  
Q. Grant, you guys have been talking about getting here since November.
Now that you're here, how does it feel? What's the mood of the team?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We're excited. We've never been a part of this. We're
thankful. We're humbled to be here, and it's a blessing for the first time we
can say we're in March Madness and we're participating, and we're ready to get
on that court and show what we've got.  
  
Q. Admiral, why have you surged of late? What's been different or better
for you lately offensively?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, honestly, I mean, this is my first time really
playing on the wing since high school. Coming into Tennessee, I was playing
down low. I started at the five my freshman year, at 6'5", freshman playing at
the five against a lot of talent in the SEC. But I've improved in a lot of
ways, just getting comfortable at different positions.  
  
This year I just changed my body and the way I approach the game. And the game
just really has slowed down for me, and it's really a testament to my
teammates really because at first it was a struggle not rebounding the ball
and not defending and the little things that it takes to be a good wing player
in this league.  
  
Every day I just continued to work at it, and these guys continued to go at
me, and throughout these games that we've had, especially league games, the
games have started to slow down, and I just got better at doing things that
I'm good at. I'm a good mid-range player, good on the block, good on the
extended block and catch and shoot. So just playing towards my strengths and
my teammates find me when I'm open, and they're confident in me taking certain
shots and so is Coach Barnes, just continue to do what I work on, and it's
been working for me.  
  
Q. In what ways have you guys surprised yourselves this season? I'm sure
you expected to be here, but what has been surprising about yourself or your
team or just any of it?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: The biggest surprise is we didn't come out to compete
against Kentucky. That's the biggest surprise for me. And it wasn't something
that we could put on any person. It was a team effort. That first half really
surprised us. All of that work that we put in and we didn't come out as the
team we know we are. It's kind of alarming because that's a big stage, the SEC
championship game. It's probably going to be like what the NCAA Tournament is
going to be, and we didn't come out and perform in the first half.  
  
That kind of bothered all of us, so we've been really focused on coming out
and showing who we are, and just coming out and having fun like we've been
doing all season.  
  
Q. Jordan Bowden, you kind of talked about it in the past, but do you
think you guys would be the same team you are now if not for what you went
through last spring with conditioning and all the extra things that Coach
Barnes put you guys through?  
JORDAN BOWDEN: Talking about the last spring, it was really a mental toughness
for us, just things we had to go through, like the running and things. We
really came together as a team, and then we went to Europe and things like
that, really got close to one another and playing against those pro teams, and
that's really helped us along the way now. And being in the NCAA Tournament,
you can't take a game for granted. You've got to go in and play as hard as you
can for as long as you can.  
  
Q. Jordan Bowden, one of the clichés of March is guard play is really
important. How do you take what you did against Arkansas on Saturday and
replicate that now on this stage?  
JORDAN BONE: Yeah, I mean, real easy just playing within the offense, getting
to my spots, just putting consistent pressure on the defense. I mean,
Arkansas, I just came out kind of hot, but I was still playing within the
offense.  
  
But to be able to take that into this tournament takes a certain level of
toughness and a certain level of concentration, and I think that's something I
need to improve on, so I'm going to continue to get better at that. And I
mean, my teammates have faith in me, and I'm going to continue to get to my
spots, continue to put pressure on defense, and hopefully the outcome is going
to come out in a good way.  
  
Q. Grant and Admiral, across the country today there's students
participating in a national walk-out to protest gun violence. I wonder how
you've been impacted by gun violence and if you have any strong feelings about
gun control and what can be done to solve or improve the problem.  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I'll take that one. Really we believe that you should be safe
no matter where you go in the country. We try to stick -- let politics be
politics. We aren't politicians, so we're not going to comment that much
further, but we believe you should be safe no matter where you go. And we feel
for those families that have been through, going through it, and we pray for
them when we can, and we think about them, and that's all we can do from here.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Just to add to what he said, we're not politicians, but we
are Americans, and we are citizens of this country, and the biggest thing for
us is, like Grant said, you should be safe anywhere you go, and there should
be certain regulations on guns, especially in our country, as far as we have
the right to carry and bear arms. Should be a lot more regulations on it, but
at the same time, you have the right to do what you please when you're bearing
arms. That's one of the rights that you have, and I think in this country,
we're a lot more violent because of the way we have our media, even in movies
and things like that, how we portray ourselves.  
  
We have to do a better job in that aspect as well. We have to portray safer
environments in our country, not just in movies, but in commercials and
different ways we advertise. We've got to be more cautious of those things and
more lenient in that way, but the biggest thing is everyone wants to feel
safe. We're all Americans. We're all working together to create a safe
environment, and I think that's the main thing that needs to happen in mind
when they're creating these regulations or rules for things.  
  
Q. You seem like a pretty big X factor for for this team when you're
playing inside. How do you get that more consistently playing to reach your
potential and change things?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I think the easy answer would be it's kind of like a mindset.
You've got to go into every game expecting to play well and help the team, but
it's something that I've been trying to do, too, is be more consistent with
it.  
  
You know, I'm just trying to help the team as much as I can. We've got a bunch
of different pieces that help contribute, and I'm just trying to contribute as
much as I can towards helping the team win. But yeah, I'd probably say mindset
going into every game, telling myself that I'm going to do what I'm going to
do and stuff like that, so...  
  
Q. For whoever wants to take this one, you guys were picked to finish
13th in the SEC this year. How much of a motivating factor was that for you
this season?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I like the 13th question. I like that. Well, the biggest
thing is for us, we don't -- we've never really looked in the media or
rankings or anything because we're a bunch of two and three stars sitting up
here. And what we've done this year is a testament to our hard work. At the
end of the day, whatever you put in, you're going to reap the blessings. We're
going out to compete. We don't care what starters you have. We don't care
about being on the mock draft. We don't care about any of that. Basketball is
basketball. The court is 94 feet. The rim is 10 feet off the ground. And
you've got to come out and you've got to compete against me. You bleed like I
bleed. You get tired like I get tired.  
  
At the end of the day, it's who wants it more. And at the end of the day, we
put the work in, and why not go out and compete as hard as we can, why not
want it more than the next guy. So we stick together. And at the end of the
day, we'll live with the results that we come out with.  
  
RICK BARNES: Well, it's good to be back. My thoughts are we're getting ready
to play a really tough basketball team, like us, that's had a very special
year. They're very, very sound in the fact that they defend well. They share
the ball well, a lot of movement, certainly know how they want to play the
game.  
  
It's an early game, so we're going to have to be up and ready to go. But our
guys have worked hard, and the goal from a year ago was to be part of this
tournament, playing at this time in March, and we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. Rick, I was talking to some of your players in the locker room, and
one of them told a story after you were picked 13th in the league where you
had a team meeting, asked the players, how many you guys think you're future
pros. A bunch of guys raised their hands, and the players said your response
was, "nobody else thinks that." Do you remember that, and how have you used
being picked 13th as a motivational factor?  
RICK BARNES: That was probably the only time I brought it up all year,
honestly, because of when the polls come out. I'm sure I did that, and I said,
if we're ranked good, why are we picked 13th. So I guess we're going to go out
and show people you're that good.  
  
But it wasn't something -- I don't know after that day if I ever brought it up
again because what we talked about was our own standard and what we wanted to
be. We go back a year ago, we were on the bubble a year ago, and Robert Hubbs
got hurt, and I told this group they weren't tough enough to take up the slack
when he went down. He went a guy averaging 16 points a game. After his last
five, six games, he was a non-factor, scored five, six points a game, but he
could hardly do anything. He was trying, but that was an experience not being
able to win games in February.  
  
And what we talked about was, again, once we got beat in the conference
tournament a year ago, we went back and we had one thing in mind, and that was
to find out who really wanted to be a part of this, who was going to really
put both feet in and go to work.  
  
Had a really tough spring and a good summer, then we had our foreign trip and
got off to a great start in the Bahamas tournament. It's been a long time
coming, it seems like, but this group of guys, they've worked hard, and
they've done, obviously, much more than everybody else thought. I'm not sure
if it was more than we thought because we had a standard that every night we
go out, if we prepare ourselves, we think that we can win.  
  
Q. How challenging has this quick turnaround been for the coaches and
players?  
RICK BARNES: It is what it is. I mean, yeah, we didn't get home until, what,
9:00 Sunday night, and obviously we played three games in three days, couldn't
do anything on Monday other than get together and meet a little bit, then get
back on a plane yet, practice, get back on a plane and get here. It is a quick
turnaround.  
  
But it is what it is, and you have to deal with it.  
  
Q. Admiral said up here a few minutes ago that coming out slow against
Kentucky on Sunday was maybe the most surprising thing of the season for him.
What went into that slow start, and do you worry about that now that you're
here this week on a similar stage?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, you can say it might be the stage. I mean, they were
in a position they hadn't been in ever, playing for a tournament conference
championship, and we weren't very good defensively. We weren't very good at
all to start the game. But we fought back, and I told them, we're going to get
back in the game. I actually told them we'd win the game. We were there to do
it, and we made three poor plays on the offensive end that cost us there at
the end that we just made three really poor decisions with the basketball --
or no, actually two offensive possessions, and then we gave up two big
rebounds. That was four possessions. Regardless of what went on throughout the
game was really the difference in the game.  
  
While I can't -- it's the third game in three days. Kentucky had to do the
same thing. But I was -- when I broke the film down to them yesterday, I
showed them those things. I said, we can't be breaking down defensive
assignments at the end of the game not realizing what we had done because we
had done a pretty good job of that all year.  
  
Q. The time you've been in the SEC, how have you seen the league
improve, and how much did that help you guys this year finishing regular
season co-champions and the increased competition, that sort of stuff? Did
that sort of help you guys raise y'all's game?  
RICK BARNES: Well, a year ago, we started out with this group, a lot of -- we
were one of the youngest teams in the country a year ago, and we started out
in Maui playing Wisconsin, Oregon to a one-possession game basically, and then
losing to North Carolina in another game like that, and Gonzaga in Nashville.
And I was telling people how good this league was a year ago because we had
played that kind of schedule.  
  
Obviously the teams in the tournament last year went out and did a great job.
But I would go back to my first year in the league, and when Commissioner
Sankey started talking about men's basketball, and when you look into the
Southeastern Conference, it's an unbelievable conference when you talk about
football. You talk about women's softball. You talk about gymnastics. You talk
about baseball. You go to track and field. And the one sport, women's
basketball. You talk about the one sport that wasn't holding its end was men's
basketball. And he pretty much challenged the coaches in the league, recruit
well, schedule better, and go out in the non-league and play people, hired  
  
Dan Leibovitz come in and help, hired Mike Tranghese as a consultant, hired
Mark Whitehead to get our officiating going. So a lot of credit goes there. It
starts at the top, but he said you guys have to do your job. That's basically
what he said. You go back and look this year, it was as competitive a league
as I have ever been a part of. It was amazing the competition in our league
this year. We don't play a round-robin, but every game was a tough one.  
  
We've got, I think, the most teams in a while in the tournament. But from the
time I've gotten here, I said, I think every year we should be a league that
gets eight, nine teams in the league, and hopefully we can continue to build
on that and be consistent with it.  
  
Q. Two of your starters, Jordan Bone and Kyle Alexander, are guys that
can seemingly give you anything from one night to the next. How do you handle
that going into a tournament like this?  
RICK BARNES: Well, it's the unknown, and you're right. I mean, we don't know.
Those guys have been spectacular, and they've just gone away. They both have
played enough basketball now that we should have an idea pretty much, and it
shouldn't be as -- they're not going to play perfect every night, but the key
word is consistency, where even on nights when they don't shoot well, they're
impacting winning other ways, and Kyle normally does that. He really does.  
  
Jordan Bone, you know, he's talented, but he's got to be able to affect the
game when he's not shooting the ball well, whether it's with his defense,
moving the ball, passing the ball. And Kyle, again, I would say that when we
are really playing our best basketball is when he's really playing his best
basketball.  
  
Q. Wondering how Admiral compares to other players you've had in terms
of obsessively working on his game. You hear about that a lot with him. And
have you ever had a combo quite like those two, the way you use them, with a
center, as well, often, kind of rare today?  
RICK BARNES: It would go back -- the combination would be really LaMarcus is
taller than any of those guys. PJ Tucker and LaMarcus Aldridge were those type
players that we could interchange them in a lot of different ways around the
rim. Neither one of those guys obviously would step out and shoot threes the
way Admiral does.  
  
But you know what, Admiral does work really hard. He's up there with his --
any players that -- as many players as we've coached as being one of the
hardest working guys in terms of putting time in. It means a lot to him, but
he is a guy that loves being in the gym and wants to get better. And as he
continues to grow and can learn to keep his emotions and everything under
control, he can continue to get better as a player.  
  
Q. Rick, you went to 16 NCAA tournaments, I think, in 17 years at Texas.
What's the difference going from a situation where you clearly had things
going to a building sort of situation? And also real quickly, I think you're
4-0 in this building in NCAA Tournament, just the familiarity factor coming
back here, does that have any special meaning to you?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I mean, I love my time at the University of Texas, and I've
got so many wonderful, dear friends that I'm still in touch with that I love,
and I love the state of Texas. It really became home to me.  
  
But when I got to Knoxville, Dave Hart, when he and Jon Gilbert talked about
was we really want to build a program. We'd like our players to be consistent.
I really appreciate when I go back to that first group of guys, we were picked
I think last that year, and achieved a little bit more than everybody thought,
and last year we came and we were right there, Robert Hubbs getting hurt. But
we knew that this group of guys that we brought in, that was a group of guys
that we almost the same blueprint we tried to use at Texas with Royal Ivey,
Brian Boddicker, Brandon Muton, that group of guys, and then we added a TJ
Ford. And then from there, we were able to get the program where we felt it
could be. We feel like we're in that same situation at Tennessee now, where
this group of guys, we lose one player off this team, and over the next two
years, we only lose three off this team, and we've got some redshirts and some
guys that had to have some -- well, we've got three freshmen, two of them that
had to have redshirt years because of injuries. And so we've got a good
nucleus, but we know we've got to continue to build it and get stronger, and
you're always looking to recruit the best players in the country.  
  
University of Tennessee, our fan base has been terrific. This year I think we
finished in the top eight in the country in attendance. The last game against
Georgia, the building was sold out. We were able to clinch this year. The SEC
had one of those magical nights that you'll always remember. The state of
Tennessee, the University of Tennessee have really gotten behind this
basketball program. We appreciate that.  
  
Q. Being back here and being in a familiar place, Big 12 country in
Dallas, does it stir up nostalgia, any good memories for you, any bad
memories?  
RICK BARNES: Oh, I don't have to come back here to have good memories about
Texas. I've got friends I talk to a lot, and my daughter still lives in Austin
with my grandkids. So I don't have to come back. The way I feel about the
University of Texas, I don't think that will ever leave because, again,
working at the University with DeLoss Dodds, Mack Brown, Augie Garrido. And
you go down the line, it was a great time. It really was. I just feel that God
had another plan for me to be in Knoxville, Tennessee, and I'm thankful for
the blessing that he's given me.  
  
Maybe when everybody thought it was a bleak situation, I mean, again, I have
met and made some just absolutely wonderful friends in Knoxville, Tennessee,
and I'm three hours -- really two and a half the way I drive, from my hometown
in North Carolina, and gotten to see my mom a little bit more than -- she's 87
now, and so that's been a good thing, too.  
  
Like I said, I think that God had a plan for the whole thing, and I'm just
thankful and blessed, to be quite honest.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Purdue - 76, Butler - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue head coach Matt Painter and student-
athletes Vincent Edwards and Dakota Mathias. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously it was a tough, grind-it-out type of game. I thought
Butler really posed some problems for us, especially in some isos. And I
thought our guys did a really good job. I thought our rebounding in the first
half was really good. Just trying to make it as difficult as we can on Baldwin
and Martin.  
  
I really thought if both of those guys played well, when they played good
competition they've won. And we had to make it tough for them and try to get
more shots than points for at least one of them. We were able to do that with
Baldwin and bottle him up and keep making it difficult for him.  
  
I thought we really did some good things on the offensive end until the last
three minutes. We lost our poise there, but we still were able to make enough
plays. We made a couple of transition stops where we deflected behind. Vince
made a big time block in transition. We got a couple of key reader boards
there.  
  
But obviously the play of the game was our execution in Dakota knocking down
that 3 to send it to five points. So I want to give credit to Butler.
Obviously they have a great program. They've done an unbelievable job. And
Kelan Martin is a fabulous player, fabulous player. For a guy to score 2,000
points -- Kamar Baldwin is very difficult to deal with. So congratulations to
those guys.  
  
But just proud of our guys. We found a way. We lost the big fella and he's a
big part of our team. But I think we also showed we've got a lot of pieces and
we've got a lot of guys and we're able to hang in there and get this one.  
  
Q. What was that last minute like, all the different plays that
happened? And then on that final shot, what was going through your minds when
that ball was in the air?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: We had a good play designed coming out there. Once it left my
hand it felt pretty good. We ran that play a lot throughout the year. And it's
a good designed set.  
  
But those last couple of minutes we kind of got out of our element, forcing
some things offensively, not making the right read to let them back in. And
like Coach said, give Butler a lot of credit. They played hard. They're a good
team. We're excited to come out with a win.  
  
Q. Is that the biggest shot you ever had?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Absolutely.  
  
Q. What's second?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: I don't know right now. This is one, two, and three.  
  
Q. Also, can you speak to the seniors really stepped up. You lose Isaac.
What did it mean to you guys to play like you did on a night when you lost
Isaac and obviously wanted to help him get to the Sweet 16?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Definitely. That's what we talked about before the game. This
was for Isaac. Our senior class, we've been through a lot together. I think
this is the first game he's missed. So to go out there and play for him,
everything he means to this program. It just feels good to find a win and for
him right there.  
  
Q. Vincent, how does it feel to be the leading scorer on your team,
contributing a lot to this victory?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I mean, honestly, I don't even care that I was the leading
scorer. I was just happy that we're surviving and advancing to the Sweet 16.
The coaching staff did a good job of putting me in great positions to be
successful. My teammates found me, and we did a great job executing. And
Dakota had itself a huge shot at the end for us.  
  
Q. The NCAA Tournament is like a book and each team has their own unique
chapter. You guys showed a lot of perseverance losing your team leader. What
are you guys doing to adjust and fill in the chapter?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: You look sharp, man, by the way. (Laughter) I like that suit.
But like you were just saying, I think our thing is, for us would be to just
stick together. Losing Isaac is definitely is a big piece of something we do.
And like Dakota said, he's a huge part of our program.  
  
So we told each other we had to go out there and play for him. That's the way
we had to keep it going for the rest of the ride. We don't want to stop
anytime soon. We just gotta stay together and believe in each other, and I
think we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Vincent, how concerned were you when you picked up the third foul at
the end of the first half knowing you would have to play the whole second half
that way?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: It was a little frustrating to be out there here and there,
but just trying when I was out there, trying to be as effective as I could.
Gotta be a little more smarter in those type of situations about picking up
that foul and just try to stay out there on the floor. Can't afford to be in
foul trouble, especially when we're missing a guy like Isaac.  
  
Q. Dakota, how important is your confidence from the perimeter going
3-for-6 for this game as the tournament progresses? Do you feel confident
shooting from 3?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Definitely. I think we all do as a collective unit. Especially
losing a piece like Isaac down there, we're going to be a lot more perimeter-
oriented. With Carsen, Vince -- P.J. was huge again tonight. I think
collectively we have to be more aggressive and confident on the perimeter.  
  
VINCENT EDWARDS: One more thing. Shoutout to Lil B, 2YBG (phonetic).
Appreciate you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Butler didn't seem like they wanted to go away even though you
had stretches where you were able to hold him down on defense and score. What
did you tell your guys to keep them going and keep telling them that this game
is winnable and that you can take it all the way?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, the game is just a game of runs. It goes back and forth,
any game you watch, unless it gets lopsided. You knew when you got up 10 in
that one stretch they would make plays and come back.  
  
We were just trying to do a better job of keeping the ball in front of us and
bottling them up, trying to make it as hard as we could and take up their
space. And it's hard with Kelan Martin, because we put a guard on him, but
he's got the size of a power forward. But yet he can move and shoot. So you're
going to give in to something.  
  
So when he gets deep, he had the one post move, a couple of spins, it's hard
because he's rolling off your body and he's bigger than. And that's what made
him a great scorer is just his ability to do things. We knew they would make
runs, but we had to do a good job executing trying to keep the ball in front
of us on the defensive end.  
  
Like we talked about earlier, we lost our poise right there. That could have
cost us. We had three to four possessions in the last three minutes where we
came away from nothing and a couple of them put them into transition. So we're
very fortunate to be able to pull this out after those possessions.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy for replacing Isaac? I
saw that you guys went small for a little bit there without a big. You played
Taylor a little bit more than he usually plays.  
COACH PAINTER: Right.  
  
Q. Was that the game plan going in, and is that something you'll have to
try to do going forward?  
COACH PAINTER: I think you play teams that have earned their way here. But
somebody like Butler and their prestigiousness of a program, I think it starts
with playing hard. So you're worried about your personnel. Everybody puts it
in like a schematic form. When in reality you've got to compete harder than
Butler or compete as hard as Butler.  
  
And I thought we were able to do that and match them. They played hard. We
played hard. Sometimes you can get caught up in the loss of something instead
of getting consumed in what you have.  
  
I thought Taylor did some good things. Eifert did good things. Matt Haarms did
some good things. But what's ironic in this game is Matt Haarms, he played 29
minutes, and the game we played the first time he played 27. It's not like we
put in somebody that hadn't been playing.  
  
Jacquil Taylor hadn't been playing. So for him to give us those kind of
minutes was huge. And then Grady Eifert has a lot of energy good. He's got
good physical tools. He can compete and plays hard. That being said our bench
played good.  
  
Nojel Eastern played well. Ryan Cline made a huge 3 there at the end. They
kind of left him open. Proud of those other guys that had to kind of increase
their role. But we didn't do anything really different.  
  
We're not going to play through the low post is the only difference. We throw
the ball to him a lot. But we're pretty balanced. Carsen leads us in scoring.
Vince Edwards averages 15, Dakota averages around 13 or 14.  
  
Q. The senior mentality that it's your last chance and you don't want it
to end and you have several seniors out there, how important of a factor is it
in a game like this?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it's important that -- we lost our poise there, but
then we also regained it. And Dakota Mathias made a huge shot but we executed
that play and set good screens and moved the basketball and did what you're
supposed to do. That's what you have to have.  
  
We can still win the win the game with that one possession and we were able to
do that. It's so importantly because they know what they're doing. I know
that's hard. You guys say, well, you guys practice. But when you have people
that have been in the same system, they started as freshmen and they grew into
seniors and they've been together and they have so many experiences, it
definitely helps going down the stretch.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to the next game, what's your strategy?  
COACH PAINTER: The next game, we've got to play harder than Texas Tech. It's a
heck of a strategy, isn't it? But no, Chris Beard has done an unbelievable job
at Texas Tech. We played them and they beat us when he was at Arkansas-Little
Rock. They play extremely hard, very physical, very tough.  
  
And we have to match that. We'll have to rebound the basketball, have quality
possessions. I think more than anything, when you get into tournament play, so
many people are so excited to play, go at it, but you still have to have
quality possessions. When we execute and get those quality possessions, it
really helps us offensively but it also helps us set our defense and make them
go against a set D.  
  
Q. This is your second straight year making the Sweet 16 of course. For
your players, is there a little bit more of a focused mentality rather than
they're just happy to be in the Sweet 16; is there more of like we're ready
for revenge for last year?  
COACH PAINTER: I think anytime you've been there before, I think it helps you.
I think that experience of being there, and -- I wouldn't say a focus because
I thought last year we were focused we just ran into a buzz saw. Kansas was
really good in that game in the second half.  
  
We know we're playing a quality opponent again. We know they're tough and
physical. But anytime you can have an experience like that, I think it
definitely helps you the next time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Purdue - 76, Butler - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Butler. We'll open with a statement from Coach
Jordan and then open the floor to questions for the players.  
  
COACH JORDAN: It's like the rest of the games this weekend, heck of a game.
Obviously we got a ton of respect for Purdue and Coach Painter and their
program. And that's what you would expect when Butler's playing Purdue to go
to the Sweet 16.  
  
I think March is defined as much by those moments as just -- you can see --
and I know I see it in our locker room -- it's palpable, just the feelings
that teams have for one another, the bonds that grow, and nobody wants to stop
playing together.  
  
Nobody wants those moments to end. Nobody wants their journey to be over. So
you fight. And I thought we fought. And they fought. Somebody has to advance
and somebody goes home. And they had the last shot to go up.  
  
We had a shot that could have kept us playing. And it didn't go in. But I'm
extremely proud of this group, extremely thankful for how they embraced the
change in staff and how they represented Butler University this entire run.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Kelan, talk about the transition this year and playing for Coach
Jordan who played in the program and how this was for you being a senior.  
KELAN MARTIN: I think it was a fun transition going from Coach Holtmann to
him. Obviously had another coaching change. So just had to get to know all the
coaches and things like that. And then I think it just turned out well this
year. And I want to thank him for having me on this team this year.  
  
Q. Kamar, when you had that running shot from almost mid-court at the
end, what did you think when you released? Did you think you had a try, or
could you tell right away that it was a little bit off?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: I thought it had a shot of going in.  
  
Q. Tyler, can you put in words for us what -- you're a senior, what are
you going through right now; what's in your head?  
TYLER WIDEMAN: That it was a fun season with a great group of guys. Looking
forward to see how our team progresses next year, and all the progress they'll
be able to make, and I'm looking forward to watching them play next year.  
  
Q. Kelan, what was the key to your offensive performance scoring 29
points tonight?  
KELAN MARTIN: Just really attacking the paint. Getting easy scores. Coach kept
telling us to attack, don't look to get fouled, but they'll foul you when you
get in the paint. Obviously we did a good job of that, just attacking the
paint. We just came up short. But we fought hard tonight, and you can't ask
more from us.  
  
Q. Kelan, when you reflect back on your four-year Butler career, what
will you think about?  
KELAN MARTIN: Just everything, how I've grown from freshman to senior year,
went through three coaching changes. Just a lot. I've grown, matured more,
came from a little boy to a man.  
  
And the coaches always pushed me and my teammates pushed me to get better each
and every day. And, I mean, I just can't put it in words. I'm going to miss
this team. And I love every single person on this team, even the coaching
staff. It's just -- I'm just going to miss it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coming back to coach at your alma mater and having a pretty decently
successful season, can you tell us some of your thoughts this first season
with Butler.  
COACH JORDAN: My thought right now is I wish I could still be coaching this
team. I think you couldn't ask for this group of guys to put more, to put
themselves out there more than they did. Again, for some of them.  
  
And so obviously thankful for the opportunity to come back. It was very
special. Unique. But as you get into this, what we're in this for, as mentors
and teachers, the relationships, you love being around these guys. Every day
at practice, this group, they came and they embraced and they were willing to
learn. So I just wish we could have done better so we could still coach them
for a few more practices and at least one more game.  
  
Q. Did you think that Vincent Edward's block on Kamar's layup there with
about a minute left almost may have been the play of the game? And also both
halves tactically, strategically, did you guys pretty much do what you
intended to do offensively and defensively?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I think there's so many plays. And when you're in this
moment, obviously that was a heck of a play to chase it down and block it off
the glass. But in that, like I said, neither team wants for the journey to be
over.  
  
They've got seniors that stepped up in a big way, with Vince and Dakota, and a
senior go out. So they're fighting for him. We've got a couple of seniors that
are fighting.  
  
Plays are being made the entire game. It's intense. So you expect it, guys to
step up and do those things.  
  
I think, tactically, I thought we dealt with our pressure well. We had eight
turnovers. We had 17 the first time when we saw them in December. I thought we
got decent shots on the rim. And we kept them off the foul line in the second
half.  
  
The first half we didn't do as good of a job. It came down to the 3-point
line, which you knew, obviously with Haas out, that the 3-point line would be
a huge factor. And at the end of the day Mathias steps up and drills one.  
  
And talk about a senior stepping up in a big moment, and we could have done a
better job there. But everything else, I thought we attacked the paint well. I
thought we finished. You look up, we shoot almost 50 percent. We just couldn't
make them miss enough in the second half.  
  
Q. What kind of legacy do you think this senior class will leave for
Butler University basketball?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I told them in the locker room, we're going to miss those
two guys. I think they leave a legacy of the same as the classes that have
been through Butler before them; that they showed toughness, they showed
resiliency, grit. They went down fighting to the very last possession.  
  
And that is what, I think, defined us all year, if you go back to some games
where we were down and fought back and won them to this one here. And those
guys were -- we talk about growth from now on, I think they'll be a big part
of the conversation, just to know where they were when I walked in the door,
what they went through and how they had to make big jumps as leaders to get us
to where we were today to have a shot to do this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Miles Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32885)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Syracuse - 55, Michigan State - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: I'd first like to thank our fans. It was an incredible showing on
their support. Little Caesar's is a great place to be. And I want to thank my
team for -- we said we didn't want to make effort-related things and mistakes.
And when you outrebound a team by 21 that's average height is 6'9", and you
got just about every loose ball we could get.  
  
And we got beat because we couldn't make a shot. And I thought we had some
good shots. It was really disappointing. We didn't shoot very well from the
free-throw line and some of those early were one-and-ones, which means it's
worse than the stat shows.  
  
But you gotta give Syracuse a lot of credit: They played hard also, and I
thought it was just a war of a game and they made a few more shots than we
did, although neither team shot well from either the 2 or the 3. But they made
shots at the free-throw line and we didn't. And that's the difference in the
game.  
  
So sad, when you're in the locker room with some of those guys that don't get
another chance. But there's nothing that I can say that they didn't do. They
played every bit as hard.  
  
Jim did a hell of a job coaching his team. And I know he was upset with some
things, and so was I. But both teams played their hearts out, and they just
made one more basket than we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Miles, can you share your emotions, what's kind of going through your
mind right now?  
MILES BRIDGES: Probably the saddest I've ever been in my life. I wanted to
send my best friend, Tum Tum, out the right way, and our seniors, Ben Carter
and Gavin Schilling. And unfortunately I couldn't do that. That was my only
goal for this year, and I'm sad I couldn't do it, but life goes on. And -- I
don't know, just life goes on.  
  
Q. Cassius, what are you going to take away from this season?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Almost anything could be solved or fixed through hard work.
If you dedicate your time, put the hours in, results will show. This team, you
know, we got better throughout the year. We just got better and better. It was
no secret formula. Players got better.  
  
Xavier Tillman got better throughout the year and there was no secret to it.
He worked hard. So this summer, it's another step for me to take. It's a whole
nuther level I can reach. And the recipe is just going to be me putting that
time in and working on it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the unique challenge their zone presents despite
your preparation?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It kind of forces you to take some two-pointers. You can't
really punch it inside, like we couldn't really get Nick Ward involved just
because how they played the zone. That would be the only challenge.  
  
Other than that, I think we got some great looks, some shots that we usually
knock down. And the ball definitely wasn't falling tonight.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: I feel like we missed shots. We got the shots that we wanted.
We just couldn't get inside as much as we wanted to because the zone is so
long, but we just missed shots.  
  
Q. Miles, it might be a little bit more difficult to say about it now,
but when you do look back on what you have accomplished at Michigan State with
this team this year as conference champions, what are going to be the bullet-
point takeaways, the things that you'll remember most about this season?  
MILES BRIDGES: Just how much fun we had. Everything that was thrown at us, we
still had fun. And I love every guy that's on my team. That's why I'm so hurt
right now. I couldn't ask for a better team. And I'll have memories that will
last a lifetime.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You went big with your big lineup when Jared got in foul trouble and
you outrebounded them. Was it as effective as you wanted it to be or were
there issues?  
COACH IZZO: (Indiscernible) was better than I wanted it to be. I thought our
guards rebounds well, our forwards rebounded well. Xavier Tillman was a man in
there. But Josh Langford got a bunch, Jaren got a bunch in his time in there.
And Miles got a few.  
  
The problem is we had a lot of rebounds to get. But so did they. You don't
want to have regrets in games like this and the effort we gave, I have no
regrets. I wish we would have shot it a little better.  
  
Q. For Jaren, was there any particular reason he didn't play more?  
COACH IZZO: He was in foul trouble the first half. And it's different in the
tournament. And the second half we just, Ben seemed to have a feel in there,
which we knew he did. But it really was in the defensive end.  
  
Cassius did a hell of a job. I mean, there's nobody badgered him harder for
two years than me. But defensively he grew so much this year. And he did an
unbelievable job on Howard, I thought. Howard is a hell of a player, so is
Battle.  
  
But we did it because we got some help from our bigs. And Xavier was really
good at it. And then we were moving Nick and, in all honesty, we put Ben in
there because he had such a feel. I mean, he got some kickouts, we had some
wide-open looks. I mean, really good looks. And it just didn't happen.  
  
Q. Following up on that point, Coach, Ben's such a good high-post passer
and it seemed like that point of attack against the zone was the most
important thing, getting it to the high post. Looking back on what you had to
face against the Syracuse zone, is there something that stands out that you
didn't see coming in?  
COACH IZZO: No, really didn't. I thought we'd have an easier time getting it
in the middle, but at the same time we showed patience. We turned it over a
little bit at the end, but 14 turnovers against them is not ridiculous. I
didn't think that they did anything different than we thought. I just felt
like maybe we didn't appreciate -- we took some shots inside.  
  
We got rebounds and that length of 6'7", too, and 6'11" and 6'10", those
should have been kick-outs. But it's probably hard for Nick. Nick played
pretty well, too, but he's not the kind of guy that kicks it out. And he's
trying to put it up. And their lengths when you're underneath the basket
bothered us. So maybe that would be one thing.  
  
Q. Tum Tum's meant so much to this program. Can you talk about what
you're going to miss most about him and the other seniors as well?  
COACH IZZO: I felt sad that I didn't get the -- I didn't get Schilling in. And
Ben been played a little more. Hasn't been playing much. But I didn't get Tum
any minutes. It was just the game. I talked to him about it before. It was
just the situation.  
  
I think Miles said it best in the locker room. So did Dane Fife. That kid has
meant the world to our program, our community, our team, and me. And I don't
know if -- I don't know if there's another Tum out there. I just hope I can
keep him around for a while. I'll figure that out in the future. He's meant
the world to our entire community.  
  
He's been rock solid through a lot of things this year. And I love him for
that. As I do -- it's hard not to feel bad. I know why Miles came back. But he
has no regrets why he came back, because in his mind he got to do the things
he wanted to do and he came back, except maybe get to a Final Four.  
  
And you don't get all your dreams sometimes. But Cassius has gotten a lot
better because of Tum. Miles is better because of Tum. Josh is better because
of Tum. Nick Ward has really made some strides in the last three weeks, four
weeks, a lot because of Tum. Tum's not God, but he's right there.  
  
Q. Clearly disappointed with the loss, but this is one of the best group
of young men you've ever coached in your entire career. Can you put in
perspective what this team will always be in your memory?  
COACH IZZO: As everybody knows, it's been a different year. I don't think me,
personally, I could have gone through the year without a group like I had. In
fact, I know there would be no way.  
  
And I've had a couple disappointments with some pretty good teams. And that's
the way basketball goes. And I think Tum said it best to our team, you know,
that: Hold your head up high; don't let one game -- we're 30-5 -- define who
we are. Let the times when we went through some tough times define who we are,
the way we stuck together and hung together and battled together.  
  
And there's no reason to hang your head, as he said. Nobody's got cancer.
There's a lot worse things in the world. Just never seems like that when you
coach or when you play, especially when you're a senior.  
  
The rest of us all get different chances, but they don't. And I love the kid,
but I could look everybody in the eye and say I love every one of these kids
and that's coach-speak. I don't give coach-speak very often. I give heart-
speak. And from the bottom of my heart that's the way I feel.  
  
Q. When you see Ben Carter and Xavier Tillman out there in a million
years, did you think those two would be in a clutch NCAA Tournament game?  
COACH IZZO: Not clutch; they played pretty well. It wasn't that Jaren didn't.
It's just that sometimes the youth -- we did some different things defensively
than we've been doing that worked.  
  
We didn't jump those ball screens and stay up high on them. We kind of
feathered them and made sure that, for the most part, Battle didn't get to the
rim. I thought we did a very good job on Battle, didn't give up the 3s. We ran
them off the 3s because we were helping with our bigs, and it was a bit of an
adjustment for a couple of the bigs. And so we found some guys.  
  
And then the middle of the zone, Jaren is going to be really good in there,
and right now Josh -- Ben just had the experience to know what to do. And,
man, we got some good looks. I don't know how many assists he had, probably
not many because nobody made any shots. Two. But we had good enough shots.  
  
Listen, it never ends happy for all but one team. I've been in the finals. I
got beat and felt bad. I've been in the first round of the Final Four and got
beat and felt bad, and in the Elite Eight and got beat and felt bad. And the
Sweet 16. And a couple of years ago I was in the first round and felt bad.
That's never going to change. But that's not going to define who we are.
What's going to define who we are is what these kids went through this year
and how they handled it. And that's what's going to define us.  
  
And to me that's the only thing that matters in the end because I saw the
facts of what they gave me, and I had great appreciation for the facts of what
they went through and how they handled it.  
  
And every Michigan State person can be a little upset with me; don't be upset
with them, because they did their job in a very difficult time and did it with
class and humility.  
  
And you will never, whether you're a reporter following them or a fan cheering
for them, you will never have better kids to appreciate than this group.  
  
So I appreciate all of you. I'm sorry to our fans who did such an incredible
job here this weekend. We were all set to maybe get another shot at Duke, and
yet Jim Boeheim and his team deserves all the credit in the world. They did
their job. They did it in a hostile environment. They played very solid. They
played their style. They did not change. They just made a couple more free
throws than we did. And that was the difference in the game. So thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Syracuse - 55, Michigan State - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: Our defense has been good this whole tournament all the way.
It's obviously been the key for us. We wanted to get to their shooters, and we
did a great job of that. They made two bank shots, 3s and we were still able
to persevere -- this team perseveres through no matter what happens.  
  
End of the first half, that's an impossible shot. And they bank one. The
second half, I think they started out with three or four 3s in a row almost in
the second half.  
  
And these guys just keep going, they keep battling. Frank fouls out, it
doesn't faze them. They just keep going. And Tyus, he made the plays. With
Frank out he's going to have the ball and we're going to go with what he can
do. And he made all the big plays in the second half.  
  
Frank made some before he fouled out. But it was a great effort. I'm really,
really -- it is very tough to play three games in five days at this level
against the physicality. We knew they were going to get us on the boards. They
really got us on the boards. These guys just battled the whole game. I'm very
proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. They went with a big lineup. How did you counteract that. I know they
beat you on the boards, but you held them from scoring inside?  
FRANK HOWARD: Yeah, either way we still had a little size advantage on the
perimeter with me, Tyus and Oshae and Miles probably the same size. But I
think we just battled. We just kept battling. We knew they were going to punch
us in the side a lot. And I think in some instances that kind of helped us a
little bit, but it's just a fight, man. I think we just fought down the
stretch and we came up when we needed to.  
  
Q. Tyus, going 8-for-8 in the second half with free throws, how were you
able to keep your composure, not only just in front of a heavy Michigan State
crowd but just a big game?  
TYUS BATTLE: I usually don't worry about the crowds and stuff like that. We
play in front of big crowds all the time all throughout the year. So crowds
today didn't bother me at all.  
  
Q. All year, one of your strengths has been rebounding from the guard
spot and coming back down. How do you balance that when you know you're
getting beat down on the boards down below but they're calling those fouls
throughout the game?  
FRANK HOWARD: It's hard. Tried to stick my nose in there a few times, grab a
few. Calls didn't go my way. But the guys picked me up -- the bigs, they
fought hard, Braedon came in, stuck his nose in there, got a big rebound.  
  
Kudos to my teammates. They picked me up. A few of those I think they could
have went our way, but they didn't. So we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Yesterday you guys had a lot of confidence. Coming into this game you
kept fighting. Can you tell me about that?  
TYUS BATTLE: I mean, every time we step on the floor we don't care who is on
the floor with us, we're expecting to win the game. So we have supreme
confidence. I have supreme confidence in my teammates. Everyone steps up.  
  
Braedon came in, hadn't played much the entire year, stepped up and played
some great defense. And it's just the heart of this team. It's amazing. It's
amazing.  
  
Q. Tyus, talk about how much Coach stresses defense, because it was all
D tonight.  
TYUS BATTLE: For us it's defense every night. We know we're a defensive-minded
team, and we're only going to win games as long as our defense is moving.
We're moving. We're talking, just making it tough on the opposing team to get
up 3s and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Frank, I believe you're the only player on this team that went two
years ago to the Final Four before losing to North Carolina. Has the rest of
the team drew on your experience of being there through these three games
against Arizona State, TCU and now Michigan State?  
FRANK HOWARD: I mean, off the court I try to let them experience it
themselves. It's a special time of the year. This is what we all come to
college for. So I try to let the young guys get their own experience.  
  
But on the court I just try to lead as much as I can, try to -- I'm a little
hoarse right now, but lead with my voice, lead by example. And guys is doing a
great job following up taking the initiative themselves. We've got a lot of
fighters and a lot of talent. And with that combination, I think we can come
up with some wins.  
  
Q. After Miles Bridges hit that thunderous dunk, MSU seemed to pull away
at that point. The crowd was really into it. What changed with you guys after
that that changed the complexity of the game?  
FRANK HOWARD: To be honest, nothing. Coach always stresses.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: Calling a key timeout.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: I'm not giving him that one (laughter). But the timeout. Coach
always stresses next play. But whatever happens on one end, we try to go down
on the next end and try to get something good or hit a timeout, get ourselves
together. But Coach has stressed poise all year. So that's what we try to do
is stay poised.  
  
Q. It's obviously been a tough week for you guys winning three games in
five days. Just put it in perspective what this win means to either one of
you.  
TYUS BATTLE: It means a lot for us. I mean, we've just been fighting an entire
year. We're constantly trying to prove ourselves in this tournament. And I
think we've been doing a pretty good job with that so far.  
  
They're a very good Michigan State team, well-coached, very good players. And
come out here, it's practically a home-court advantage, and to come out with a
win is pretty impressive.  
  
Q. Frank, Jim mentioned yesterday that you couldn't take just one or two
guys from Michigan State, you had to take away everybody. Was there any
particular focus on defense that led you guys to the job you did?  
FRANK HOWARD: We just wanted to keep the ball out of the high post and keep
the big out of the paint. They did a great job of finding open spots and
having guys in and out. But I think our activity level and our length up top
is tough for people. So, you know, when we can be big and clog those passing
lanes, I think we can be successful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Overall game plan, heading into this, we know you're a great
defensive-oriented team. Were there any one, two or three players that you
specifically --  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, we didn't want Nairn -- we didn't want Langford and
McQuaid to shoot the ball. We tried to get on them. When you get on a guy from
the beginning, when they do finally get a shot later, then they're not ready.
So I thought we did a good job of getting on them.  
  
I've never won a game when a team made -- banked two 3s against us. It would
have been bad sitting up here if we lost by one and say we lost because we
were unlucky. The first bank was the hardest and luckiest bank I've ever seen
in my life. The second one was just a bank. But they made 8-for-37 and banked
two shots for 3s.  
  
We did a good job covering those guys. It's hard to keep it out of the high
post. We tried. They didn't -- we know that people go there, and we react to
that, to the shooters so they can't get it out. We try to force that guy to do
something there. And a couple of guys they had in there were trying to throw
it out when it wasn't open.  
  
I think it really helped that Jackson didn't have a good game. I was most
concerned about him in there, because he can make the play and score. And when
guys miss a couple of foul line jump shots, everybody thinks that's where you
should go and that's the shot. It's a hard shot. There aren't that many guys
that turn and make that shot.  
  
In my 42 years, teams in that high post are shooting 22 percent. I don't know,
but they don't shoot well there. But I was really concerned about him. We were
concerned about the boards. They're physical. They're strong. They've got guys
running at it.  
  
We've got to somehow find a way to sneak some out. And the game would have
been lost on the boards if it came down to that. They got second-chance points
in the paint there -- 21, that's a lot. But we kept them off their spots. And
our problem was -- at the halftime was offense. That was our problem.  
  
Should have been tied at the half and we did nothing on offense. Tyus had one
point. Frank had a couple. They struggled the last two games and we were able
to win. I told them at halftime, we can't win without you two guys; you've got
to go. Tyus, you've got to go.  
  
And FRANK made a couple of really tough shots when they were in those runs
there, and then Tyus started well and then he finished. We tried to go to him
at the end of the game with the lead. I thought he was going to make the 3
then he makes the pull-up to give us separation. We couldn't hang on to the
ball down there twice. They had to foul. We just had to hang on the ball. So
we made the end of the game more interesting.  
  
We're always going to foul in those situations. And it's always worked for us.
I've seen too many games where a guy throws in a 3 and you go to overtime. So
players are -- they deserve a lot of credit. Michigan State is a really,
really good team.  
  
I think one thing that happens, it happened one year to us, the home court is
a great thing, the advantage. But when you're in a close game at the end you
feel like, we're home, we need to win this game. You start to feel that a
little bit. And the last couple of jump shots they threw up, they weren't in
the ballpark. Bridges is a great player, but we wanted to make him shoot from
the outside.  
  
Q. You mentioned the five days, the three games in them, depth being a
concern against a team like Michigan State, how do you come into this third
and final game with rotations and minutes?  
COACH BOEHEIM: (Indiscernible) but we don't have rotations in minutes. It's
easy to coach. I don't put anybody in. It's not like I'm thinking, I've got to
get this guy in or that guy in. I just worry about our offense and our
defense. We make desperation subbing. When Paschall gets in foul trouble,
Bourama goes in. When one of the forward gets in trouble, Matt goes in. The
guards don't come out.  
  
I get mad at them. I'm upset with them but they're not coming out. But we're
pretty resilient. We're in good condition. Everybody says, pick up the pace,
run. You can't run. If you run, we're going to beat you bad because we're
going to get back and get set, and you're running and taking a quick shot.
That's going to help us.  
  
You play against a team that gets their defense set -- they made two or three
shots at the end of the shot clock. Shots we want -- the first shot of the
second half, we wanted him to take that shot. He's six feet out, the shot
clock is going and he makes it. Then they bank one.  
  
These guys just keep playing. They don't worry about that. They just don't
worry about that. They just keep playing and we want to control it. We would
like to run, but we don't ever get a rebound really to run off of. I think we
got one fastbreak, and I think we might have scored. I'm not even sure now.
But we're not getting fast breaks.  
  
And we can't exert energy running up and down the court. We need to save our
energy. And in the half court set our guards work pretty hard. Our other guys
are not doing a lot. They're setting screens and rolling; they're not doing a
lot.  
  
But Oshae has been really good in this tournament. He's just a freshman, but
he doesn't play like a freshman. He makes big plays. He's going against a
great defensive player. He made great plays. But our guards have not played
well on offense, and we need them moving forward. We've got to get them to
play better offensively. There's some teams you can't stop. And you get in
those situations in this tournament where you have to score. And today we got
away with it, but that won't happen again.  
  
Q. How did things change offensively when Frank fouled out?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We just gave the ball to Tyus and opened it up. That's it. It
doesn't really change, it really doesn't hurt our offense. For a short period
of time it might help our offense. He's our best player. He's got the ball.  
  
So it hurts us on the defensive end a little bit but Braedon is a tough kid.
He did a good job out there. He was good. I liked what he did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue student-athletes Vincent Edwards and
Dakota Mathias. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Your next opponent is obviously Butler, a team you're familiar with.
You played them earlier in the season. Their campus is not far from yours. How
well do you know the guys who play for that team and do you follow them at
all? I know they're in a different conference, but do you kind of pay
attention to how they're doing as the season goes along?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Yeah, we're familiar with them, obviously being so close. A
lot of those guys are from Indy and I think in the summertime we work out with
them, open gyms and things like that.  
  
So we're familiar with them. And due to that, I personally follow them
throughout the season, know how they're doing. I got pretty close with Kelan
Martin this summer, just working out together. So we definitely follow their
progress and how they've been doing.  
  
Q. What was your reaction to Isaac being ruled out for the rest of the
season with the elbow injury? How hard was that for you guys, being seniors as
well?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I mean, it wasn't as hard for us as it was for him. We had to
be there for him and keep our heads up. We're not going to hang our heads
down. Our focus is on Butler. We've dealt with injuries before. These guys
have picked this team up when I was out. So we plan on doing the same thing.  
  
Q. Like a lot of teams, Butler seems to have some of its best games when
they're making their 3s. How did you guys defend Butler in the 3 the last
time? What was so effective about that? And how have you dealt with good
3-point shooting teams generally throughout the season?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: I think the first time we played them, especially in the first
half, we were very active with our hands. I think we kind of disrupted the
flow of their offense. We made things pretty tough for them.  
  
Whenever you get out of rhythm like that it's tough to kind of rebound. Like
you said, they're a great 3-point-shooting team, so just making them feel
uncomfortable is going to be the biggest thing for us.  
  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I would say the same thing. We were really active in the
first half and we were able to get a lot of the loose balls and get our hands
on deflections and passing lanes and things like that. So, when you can
disrupt someone's rhythm and the flow of their offense it makes it tough.  
  
Q. Isaac came back in the game yesterday after the injury. He was joking
around. Seemed like he was in great spirits in the locker room. How big of a
shock was that to everybody? And what did you say to him to try to lift him
up?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Obviously we didn't expect that, those results. But he's a
tough kid. He's battled a lot. We just wanted to let him know that we were
there for him. Obviously being a senior like that, it's tough to handle. But
he's our brother, he's our family and we just wanted to let him know we were
there for him.  
  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Just to piggyback on the same thing, me and Isaac have had
some rough patches throughout our relationship and career, but definitely like
a guy I've grown closer with. And just like these guys, being the senior class
and not being able to actually walk out on the court with him knowing his
senior year ended the way it did, it sucks for him.  
  
And, like I said, we're not going to hang our heads on it; we're going to be
there in spirits, and he's going to be our biggest cheerleader. We're going to
go out and play for him.  
  
If Little B is watching this, shout out to Little B for blessing us with his
presence. Appreciate it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're now joined by Purdue head coach Matt Painter.
Coach an opening statement.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Excited to be able to move on. I thought our guys played well
in the second half, had some really good energy, got some stops, made some
good plays. We were a little bit too eager in the first half of our game
yesterday. I thought we took some ill-advised early, quick shots and really
didn't probe the defense.  
  
Thought we did it much better in the second half. And our guys really played
much better, played together, played hard, took what the defense gave them,
got some quality stops. We know we have a tough task against Butler. And they
have a great program through the years. LaVall has done an unbelievable job
with this team. Baldwin and Martin are very, very difficult to stop. But it's
really more than them.  
  
They outrebounded Arkansas by 20. Play hard, stingy on defense. Do a good job
getting their hands in passing lanes and on the ball, just being active, just
being around the ball, just a really good all-around basketball team.  
  
Q. There's a report out that Isaac did practice today. He's had a brace.
Is that the case, and what's it going forward?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, he ran up and down today, did a few things, worked out. I
don't see him playing, though.  
  
Q. Butler, like really most college basketball teams, is much better
when they're making their 3s. And most of -- a lot of their big wins they were
making 3s. How was Purdue so effective in neutralizing that the first time?
And just how have you defended -- have you been pretty successful defending
the 3 on a year-long basis, or do you have like a special philosophy or
strategy to guard the arc?  
COACH PAINTER: I wish I did have a special philosophy. I think it's different
with different schemes. Sometimes you feel like you're doing a good job, like
against Butler by the numbers in the first game, it looks like we did a good
job. Or is it just wasn't their day.  
  
Sometimes guys that shoot the basketball, Kamar Baldwin, you go back watch
tape, he had a handful of shots he normally makes. And he didn't make it. It
helps us. And you go watch him against Seton Hall in the Big East Tournament,
and they're just draped all over him and he just makes tough shots.  
  
Sometimes it's just your day. I think that day was ours. We try to do a good
job of guarding the arc, but also not exposing ourselves to where now we're
not containing the dribble and they're getting to the free-throw line and
getting easy 2s.  
  
Sometimes guarding the arc means they get by you. Now they still penetrate and
pitch and still get good 3s. They have some tough matchups for everybody, so
it's going to be really important for us that we do a good job and stay out of
rotations.  
  
Q. Back to Isaac for a second, after the game yesterday he was joking
around in the locker room, seemed to be in great spirits. And then the rumor
was it was mandatory surgery; now he's back. Can you talk about the emotional
roller coaster of the last 24 hours? And if he's not able to play tomorrow is
it your understanding that this condition could get better at some point
during the tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: No, he's not going to -- he's fractured his elbow. So he can go
out there and get in warmups and do things but I don't think he's going to
play. I'm obviously not a doctor. But I've been able to look at it and see --
he just went through things today and just getting loose and everything. His
legs aren't broke. So you're allowed to still run when your elbow is
fractured.  
  
Q. As far as you as a coach and handling the emotional swings of this
with your team and this senior class, can you talk about what that's been
like?  
COACH PAINTER: It's not an emotional swing for us. We just prepare for Butler.
When Vince Edwards went out, and we had to play two conference games, we won
those games. And you focus on what you have. You don't focus on what you don't
have.  
  
It's no different than foul trouble. Isaac plays half the game for us. We're
used to playing half the game without him. So now we've just got to play a
full game without him.  
  
Q. If Isaac can't go, what do you see from Matt Haarms that -- obviously
he's played a good amount, but stepping into that starter role, what do you
see from him that gives you that confidence he can step in?  
COACH PAINTER: Matt's played the whole year. He's done a good job for us. He
played 27 minutes in the game versus Butler when we played earlier in the
season. He's long, he's athletic, he can run, he can block shots. He knows
what's going on. The game matters to him.  
  
So it's a great opportunity for him to be able to step up and stay in his
role, be really good at being Matt Haarms. You don't have to be something
else. And I think that's going to be important for us that he brings that
energy and helps us get going on both ends of the court.  
  
Q. Not a lot of international players end up at Purdue over the years.
How did Matt end up on your radar? How did he end up coming to west
Lafayette?  
COACH PAINTER: He played at Sunrise Christian, so just seeing him in AAU. And
then just following up, he was a little bit of the under-the-radar guy. He
wasn't a guy at his high school that was averaging 20 and 15. But he was
really skinny. So he's gained about 25 pounds since he's been at our place.  
  
But we were very fortunate. I think you hear a lot of stories as coaches when
you recruit somebody for three years and then you lose out, you know, to
somebody and you get upset about that. We put in all this time and you put in
no time you get the player. We were on the back end of that one to where we
didn't recruit him for a long period of time and then when we went in to
recruit him, he liked us, he knew everything about us. He watched us a lot on
television. And he knew everything about our program and the development of
our big guys.  
  
And so it was one of those rare moments where the exposure that you're getting
internationally and just the exposure and the understanding that he had of the
development of our bigs really helped us land him.  
  
Q. How similar is this situation with Isaac in terms of 2010 with
Robbie? And what did you learn from then?  
COACH PAINTER: That's a good question. You know, we still had three games in
conference season when Rob tore his ACL. So we had three conference games. We
had two tournament games and then we obviously had three NCAA Tournament
games. So it gave us a little bit of time to prepare.  
  
And it's interesting you just said that. I just watched one of our games in
the NCAA Tournament because it was on the Big 10 Network against Texas A&M to
go to the Sweet 16. It just makes you run things differently. Rob made things
work for us. We don't run anything differently. We run a lot of things for
Isaac, but we also run things for other people. Whereas we ran a lot more
motion at the time.  
  
We'd isolate JaJuan Johnson and we'd isolate E'Twaun Moore a lot in some ball
screen action. So, we had to change some things. We had to change a lot. And
we didn't shoot the ball as well when Rob didn't play. And the guys that
stepped in there who were good shooters still didn't shoot the ball well.  
  
So that's a big part of it. It goes back to what David said before is, like,
how good Butler is when they make their shots. And it's kind of a profound
statement. It's as how good anybody is that relies on 3-pointers.  
  
I think it's going to be key more than anything, just us running our stuff,
sticking with it. But we had a lot of turnovers the first time against Butler
with Isaac Haas. It's going to be important that we play this game and not
turn the basketball over and just be able to rebound and just kind of focus on
those things.  
  
Q. I know you said it's unlikely, but is there a chance Isaac would even
dress tomorrow?  
COACH PAINTER: I would think he dresses and goes to warmups. I would think he
wants to do that to stay connected and stuff. But I don't think he'll play.  
  
Q. Is there a brace he would have to wear?  
COACH PAINTER: Yes. Yes. He'd have to get that approved, yeah.  
  
Q. I don't want to harp on this, but down the road is this something you
could see it would have to be surgically repaired or will it heal itself?  
COACH PAINTER: No, they said you have to have surgery.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Butler student-athletes Tyler Wideman, Kelan
Martin and Kamar Baldwin questions?  
  
Q. If you could all speak to this, how is Purdue different without Isaac
Haas?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: He's a big body. I don't know if he's going to play or not. But
we know they're a really good team with him or without them. So we're going to
prepare either way and be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
KELAN MARTIN: Pretty much what he said. They have another big guy also. So he
protects the rim. So this is just another big body out there for them.  
  
TYLER WIDEMAN: Like they said, they do a good job of using their bigs. If he's
in or out. So they're still a good team regardless of who is playing and who
is on the court.  
  
Q. Do you think it helps having the familiarity of having played them?
Sometimes in the NCAAs you hope that you have that, we haven't played you
before. Can't prepare like that. But it's different with this matchup.  
TYLER WIDEMAN: I think it helps a little. I think it helps the coaching staff
with their scouting. They already have stuff on those guys. But that was a
long time ago, so I don't remember too much from the game. But I think any
team you play at this point you just know they're a good team, and you're in
for a good game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Butler head coach LaVall Jordan.
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH JORDAN: Obviously it's an exciting thing to still have games to coach at
this point and for our team to still be playing and competing for a
championship. As we're watching games, I think one of the best parts of this
time of year is when you win and you kind of have the next day to watch other
games and knowing you're still going to play the day after.  
  
And so our guys are excited. And we've got a tough task ahead of us with
Purdue. I was proud of how we competed yesterday. And watching the film, I
thought we executed fairly well. We've seen Purdue earlier this season. And so
we've got some film to draw upon to try to correct some of those mistakes.
We'll work on and talk about that over the next 24 hours.  
  
Q. First, talk about Carsen Edwards and how his role has changed since
the first time you played him. And then just what makes him such a difficult
player to stop?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I don't know if his role has changed. I think he's just --
his confidence has grown to such a high level, as you continue to watch him
develop. He's always been a very aggressive player. And I think he's dynamic.  
  
He's one of the guys that across the country that, his athleticism, his speed
to get to the rim. And then you look up and he's got 90 3s made on the season,
which is a high number. I think Kelan Martin just got over 90 yesterday. So
that's an elite-level shooter. And they have two of them, him and Dakota
Mathias.  
  
They move him around well. He's a load in transition up the court. And
defensively, their team is really good defensively, but he's got the ability
to shoot some lanes and steal some passes, so he causes some havoc on that end
of the floor as well.  
  
Q. Butler, perhaps more than some other teams, has a huge influence when
you guys are hitting 3s -- some of your best wins have been when you're making
them. What are the components that allows you to do that? Is it from scheme?
Is it from what the opposition gives you? Is it how you're defending? What are
-- how you're moving the ball -- what are the things that you've noticed the
team through the season allowing you to do that?  
COACH JORDAN: I think -- I agree with you, when we're at our best, we're
getting a good percentage of shots made from 3. How we get them important. I
think when we're playing inside/out, that's critical to our shot percentage
going up from 3. Whether that's attacking the paint, off the dribble, throwing
into the post and ball movement. And earlier in the year it wasn't as crisp or
fluid as it's gotten over the season. And we have to have that.  
  
And I think the other formula for us, part of the formula for us is
transition. I thought we got pretty good looks in transition yesterday. We
made them early. We had a spell when they made their run where we missed a
few. And then we made a few big ones late. I know Kelan made a big one off the
steal up the court late.  
  
So we can't get 3-ball dependent. That's not who we are. But when we've got a
good balance we're pretty good.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago you put Sean McDermott back into the starting lineup.
What have you seen in his play since coming back from the ankle injury? And
how does having him in the starting lineup change the dynamics of the team?  
COACH JORDAN: Sean, he had a terrific offseason. I thought he prepared himself
well to have a big role this year. And then as we got into the start of the
non-conference, he came out really strong. He was shooting the ball really
well from 3. He was making plays offensively. He was a big part of it.  
  
And then defensively he's got length and he's got an IQ. And so after he was
injured, we went small with three guards and it was really good for us
offensively as well but we were smaller at position. And I think the
Providence game was when Sean came back into the starting lineup. And they're
6'6", 6'7", 6'8" everywhere. So it was more of a matchup-based type of thing
at that point in time. And we kind of stuck with it.  
  
I think Paul came in with great energy off the bench, and yet he wasn't doing
so great leading up to that game. And he had a couple of good games in a row.
Just gave us more scoring off the bench than bringing Sean off. And so we just
stuck with that lineup, and I think defensively it's really helped us just to
have a little more length on the court.  
  
Q. In the first matchup against Purdue, maybe one of their best
defensive halves of the year in that first half, you mentioned they're a good
team. What makes Purdue a good defensive team?  
COACH JORDAN: They've got the ability to -- some teams can't pressure without
giving up great looks. And they're really well-coached, where they can apply a
ton of pressure, ball pressure on the perimeter and still keep you from
getting wide-open, drive-kick 3s.  
  
A lot of that is due to they've got rim protecters at the basket. When Haas is
in there and the other kid is in there, he blocks shots, so you're forced to
drive into him.  
  
And then I think they're really smart. I think they've got high IQ guys with
Dakota and P.J. Thompson and Vince Edwards. And those guys, they're veterans.
They cover for each other. When some guy is over on the rotation, they kind of
pick it up on the backside, and next thing you know you're taking difficult
shot-clock shots.  
  
Q. Back to Carsen, but in terms of matchups, is that something that
Baldwin starts out on him, but it's like a team defensive thing?  
COACH JORDAN: No question it's a team thought. I thought we did a tremendous
job yesterday with the two guards from Arkansas, and they're pretty dynamic
with their ability to score. Aaron and Kamar took on the bulk of the
assignment, but there was a team thought to it. Because if you're going to sit
there and guard Carsen Edwards one-on-one, good luck. He's too good for that.  
  
But you can't over-help. I think that's the challenge with them. They're 40
percent from 3 at multiple positions, so you can't overcommit two guys onto
the ball, but you have to be there, because's if he's just looking at one
defender he can attack one guy, and he's really good at that.  
  
Q. The narrative is they'll just replace Haas with Matt Haarms or maybe
the 6-10 Taylor kid. But what if they go small with Vincent at the 5 and move
Nojel in the lineup? What defensive challenges does that present if they go
small and they have five guys that can spread the floor and shoot and drive
and handle and all that?  
COACH JORDAN: I think that's -- you gotta think that way if Haas is not
available for certain. I think probably Creighton would be the best reference
point for us. Providence has done that in our league where they play Bullock
and just go small.  
  
And the decision you have to make on our side is are you going to match it? Or
are you going to try to play advantage basketball with your post? And we have
to do some of that in the Creighton game. So we've got something to draw on
there.  
  
And that's kind of a game-time -- I think we've got to prep for all of it and
make a game-time call as you're in the moment and see what's best if they do
do that, how you're going to counter it.  
  
Q. How are you a different team than the first time you played these
guys?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I think we are. I think that's a great observation. I
think we are a lot more fluid offensively. At that point in time it was pretty
choppy. That was one of our worst games. Now a lot of that was due to Purdue's
defense.  
  
And then I think defensively we've gotten a lot stronger, a lot more solid, a
lot more aware, a lot more connected on that end of the court, where we've had
from that point on, once we got in the Big East play, we've had some really
solid defensive performances. And guys have good clarity, a lot more clarity
at this point.  
  
I think Kamar Baldwin, specifically, during that time he was transitioning
kind of learning on the fly, where he look at him last night, he's got a
really good command of the court. He knows what he's looking for. And that was
due to us simplifying some things for him, us probably over-coaching at that
point, and then him studying and growing and developing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State student-athletes Cassius
Winston, Lourawls Nairn and Miles Bridges. Questions?  
  
Q. Cassius, how do you try to discipline yourself to go for singles? You
talked about last night you like to go for home runs. How do you, as the games
get bigger, settle for singles or be okay with singles?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: You've got to keep it in your mind. You've got to focus on
that a lot of times. Sometimes you let the game get to you so you think
there's something that you can make a play. So if I keep it on the back of my
mind and focus on the simple play, then that problem will be fixed.  
  
Q. Wondering how the 16 over the 1 upset last night, how much you guys,
how much did that impact you? How much you think about that? How much that
confirms what we know about this tournament in your guys' minds?  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: I think it confirms a lot about what goes on in this
tournament, just anybody can get beat. And we've just got to focus in and make
sure we do all we can to execute our game plan.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: I would say that's why they call it March Madness. Every team
here is good. You can't take any plays off.  
  
Q. I'm dressed like I am today because I'm proud of who I am and where
I'm from. Each one of you, what are you guys proud of for who you are, where
you're from and about this team?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: That's a good question. I believe I'm from the greatest city
in the world, Detroit. I'm very proud of it and I wouldn't trade that for
anything. It's a tough place and there's a lot of love and support; everybody
there wants to see you succeed. So I'm very proud of that.  
  
And I think this team's the same way. We're all together. We all want to see
each other play their very best and see each other succeed.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: I'm very proud of where I'm from. I wouldn't be the man I am
today if I wasn't from Flint. They instilled a lot of toughness in me. Made me
mentally ready for college.  
  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: I'm also proud of where I'm from, just being a kid from
Nassau, Bahamas, moving to America when I was 13 years old, 10 years ago. Like
Miles said, it made me into who I am today, and I wouldn't be the person I am
today if I wasn't had been born in the Bahamas.  
  
And I think with this team, you have so many players from different places
growing up all across America and coming together for one common cause, to be
the best we can be every single day and help each other live out each other's
dreams.  
  
Q. Guys, with such a quick turnaround, how challenging is this Syracuse
defense for you guys?  
MILES BRIDGES: We struggled with zones in the past. But I feel like we move
the ball better now and we're more experienced with it. So if we don't let
them speed us up, I think we'll be fine.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It's a long, probably the longest zone probably we're going
to play. So we gotta do a great job of limiting the turnovers. Can't let them
get turnovers -- got to keep the ball moving, make smart plays.  
  
Q. Miles, can't let them speed you up. Does that mean you have to be
patient, not take quick shots, the first shot you see over the zone?  
MILES BRIDGES: I wouldn't say that. If we have an open shot we have to take it
because we're not guaranteed another open shot, because the zone is so long.
So we just have to make -- when I say getting sped up, I mean making bad
passes or cross-court passes, any of that type of stuff.  
  
Q. What do you know about Frank Howard's game so far, the scouting
report? What do you have to respect about him?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like I say, he's a big guard for sure. So he's going to be
able to create a couple of shots. He's hard going right and he can shoot the
ball pretty well, got pretty good range, a good athlete. So, we've got to do a
good job of bottling him up, force him against his tendencies, can't let him
get any set-up 3s or anything like that. Make every shot tough.  
  
Q. Cassius, what is the unique responsibilities for the point guard
going up against a zone like this? What is your main priority?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Just to make sure our team doesn't get impatient, make sure
we're playing with a lot of confidence. It's going to be times a zone like
that can be frustrating. So I've got to do a good job of keeping everybody
together, keeping our heads together. And we're going to do a good job moving
the ball and getting quality shots.  
  
Q. Syracuse defense is tight. Anything you're going to do to get out and
start aggressive from the beginning?  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, we're just going to try to move the ball around, find
open spots, find open shots. Just don't let them settle in the zone, because
that's what really helps them.  
  
Q. Only one team is smiling on April 2nd, but what's the lesson with
what happened for Isaac Haas yesterday and Virginia last night that you carry
forward the rest of the tournament?  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: Oh man, I think the lesson is you can't take any day for
granted, man, just even apart from basketball. You just -- if you live to see
another day you've got to attack that day with whatever you've got.  
  
And I'm praying for Isaac, because him being a senior, his last ride, his last
go-around with that team, being a very senior-oriented team. It sucks to see
him go down.  
  
If you're in this tournament, you've got to be thankful that you're in it and
try to survive and advance. So I think, like I said in the beginning, it just
helps you to have an appreciation for life in itself.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely. Like I was telling Miles the other day, one of
these games is going to be our last game of the season. Whether it's the
championship game or anything like that. So every opportunity you get to go
out there is -- one of those games could be your last, so you've got to tackle
that like it's the last chance you have.  
  
Q. The bench has been such a strong point for you guys throughout the
season. You go into this game against Syracuse where they have three guys that
play at least 38 minutes per game. And the Orange have played three games in
the last five days. Is the bench a huge X factor for you guys going into this
one?  
MILES BRIDGES: We would like to get into transition, like I said, don't let
them set up in that zone because that consumes some of the tiredness. So we
just want to move the ball around, get in transition, kind of get them tired
or in foul trouble.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Coach Izzo. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: Excited is the best statement I can give. Excited to be here. It's
good to play against our old foe Jim Boeheim. He's back at it. I mean, just
doesn't seem to change.  
  
His zone is maybe bigger and taller and better than ever. The size that they
present is, I think, difficult for everybody. I don't think many teams have
shot it very well against them or scored very well against them.  
  
And so one of the good things about our team over the years is we were able to
play fast or play slow. And hopefully we can speed up the tempo. But they're
definitely going to slow it down. And we've got to figure out a way to win
whether it's going in a slow-down game and a smashmouth game or whether it's a
race-horse game. So I'm looking forward to the challenge. I think our players
are. We'll see what happens?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. With the zone coming up, I know you've got Ben a little bit of time
last night. How much bigger can his role be with the defense you're going to
face?  
COACH IZZO: You're right. That's why we got him a little more time because
he's pretty solid in the middle of that zone. He really has a high basketball
IQ. Xavier playing a little more has really helped because he has a high
basketball IQ.  
  
So we feel we have different people that we can put in different positions.
But the zone is tough, man. I saw some pretty good teams watching all that
tape I watched last night that struggled against it. I mean, it's hard to
simulate it if you had a week to do it. It's almost impossible when you have a
day to do it. That's why he's been so good in the tournament also.  
  
Q. Looking back to your games against Boeheim and Syracuse, do you have
a favorite memory in those games or one game that stands out above the rest?  
COACH IZZO: There's been a bunch of them. I remember early on we played at the
Garden and must have had 20 turnovers against that zone. I remember the game
at the Palace when we were down big and came back and won big.  
  
But probably one of the funnier games is, I think in 2003 or 4, I scheduled
the world. I thought I was going to have -- I did have a good team, but I lost
a great big guy in Erazem Lorbek. And he said to me on the recruiting trail,
are you crazy? Because I scheduled the world.  
  
And the last game of that preseason schedule was at Syracuse. And he called me
a better choice of words than knuckle head; you can figure out what words he
used. And sure enough they beat our brains in.  
  
I just love what he's done there. It's amazing to me how year after year after
year, even years when you don't think they're going to be as good, that
defense has been so hard to deal with for a lot of teams. And like last night,
it was just a grind-them-out find a way to win. So we've had some great games
over the years. We played a couple times in the NCAA Tournament. And my
respect and admiration is very high. And so hope we can find a way to solve
it.  
  
Q. One of the first people you spoke to after your win last night was
Dave Bing. I wonder if you can recount your relationship for us?  
COACH IZZO: I think Dave Bing is a hero for any of us in this state. He
definitely was me. I was growing up, he'll probably get mad at this, but I was
a little kid, I was looking at Dave Bing.  
  
And then the year that we played in the Final Four here, he was the mayor of
Detroit, and I thought did a great job, really kind of got things back on
track. And he was very supportive when we were here.  
  
And I love the fact -- like our Magic Johnson or Steve Smith and ma Mateen
Cleaves, he's still here wearing his Syracuse Orange, and came to the Pistons
and had incredible years here and remained here in Michigan.  
  
So I have tremendous respect. I saw him, I saw D.C. there, but I did get a
chance to talk to Dave for a couple of minutes.  
  
Q. Last night, after the Syracuse game, Jim Boeheim was talking about
the Virginia/UMBC result, and talked about how this tournament will break your
heart. You've been through some of these games before as a high seed. What is
it like for players and coaches on that side of an upset?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I watched Tony Bennett last night, and in fact I told
our media during the week that, I said, it's going to happen. And part of me
almost said, I hope it happens soon because some day, if I'm a 1 seed again, I
think that's going to be unbelievable pressure. And that's what we talked
about, right, in that one meeting.  
  
And the saddest part is we've had a couple times when we beat Tony, our team
did -- and if you know Tony Bennett at all, he's the salt-of-the-earth guy.
And I thought the class he handled that with in the interviews I saw were
spectacular.  
  
But like our team a couple years ago with Denzel and them, when you've got a
good bunch of guys -- and the way he talked he's got a good bunch of guys,
you've got everything going your way. But I've always said in this tournament,
you've got to be good enough to be knocking on the door but you've got to get
lucky.  
  
And does one injury make them unlucky? I don't know, I didn't get a chance to
see them that much. But give UMB -- give them credit, you know, they did an
unbelievable job in just the highlights I saw.  
  
But, yeah, I feel for Tony, because I think his team has been knocking at that
door. We beat them twice, I think, by a point or two when they were a high
seed. And one year they were a 1 seed, I think in New York, maybe, or I don't
know where.  
  
But I just -- my hat's off to him, how classy he was about it. The pain of it,
kind of depends on the team you have. It's always going to be painful. But if
you got really good guys, like I had, that lived, eat and slept to try to move
on in this tournament and get beat in the first game, there was nothing like
that locker room. All the joyous ones I've been in or all the sad ones I've
been in, that one will live with me for the rest of my life because it was a
combination of incredible kids that gave me everything they could give me.  
  
We shot 58 percent. We shot 50-some percent from the 3. We just got beat by a
team that played better than us that night because I think we shot 54, they
shot 58, whatever it was. And Middle Tennessee beat us fair and square. There
was no luck. I tried to find an official to blame. Couldn't do that. And we
just got beat. So I feel for Tony.  
  
Q. I asked the players this question and I wanted to ask you this: On
Saint Patrick's Day I'm wearing these clothes because I'm proud of who I am
and where I'm from. And I wanted to ask you, what are you proud of where
you're from, who you are and your team?  
COACH IZZO: Wow. Well, I'm an Italian guy, so I can celebrate any holiday. I
just go that way and I'm a Yooper; I'm proud to be there. And I'm a Michigan
State Spartan, I've been there 33 years and I'm pretty proud of that.  
  
The green fits with Saint Patrick's Day, being a Spartan. And as far as my
heritage, I love Rocky Balboa. I can keep the Italian way. And I guess being a
Yooper means a lot of things. But hopefully some day I can put them all
together. How is that?  
  
Q. You've talked about not being entitled, but your dream was to build
Michigan State to an elite level where other schools are at. And I'm not sure
if you're aware but there are tickets for tomorrow night going in the
secondary market for as much as two grand. What does that tell you about your
fan base and the fact you've arrived among the elite in college basketball?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I will admit that 21 years, I think we'd have to say that
we're one of the teams, but it's measured in so many different ways. And it is
measured by your fan base, the interest in your program.  
  
I think there's no question that the texts and letters I got when they knew we
were going to be in Detroit, so more people -- I think a lot of people bought
tickets early hoping we'd be here. Unfortunately, the fans don't necessarily
win you the game, but they help you win the game at certain times and they
have, they did last night.  
  
And I don't apologize for that because I've played in some down at Carolina
when Duke and North Carolina were there. So everybody has his day in the sun.
Kansas did last year when we had to play them in Tulsa. And this happened one
other time 18 years ago.  
  
But I appreciate our fans. I appreciate -- I love coming down to Detroit. This
facility is phenomenal. And the people here have been great. So all those
things are good. But still gotta win the game.  
  
And I am proud of where this program is at. I think we've come a long way, and
yet I think we've got a long way to go to get where I'd like to get.  
  
Q. How do you coach Cassius to go for singles? He talked about last
night he likes to go for home runs. And your thoughts on Syracuse point guard
that you have to go up against, Frank Howard?  
COACH IZZO: I think Cassius last night, he threw that one lob. I didn't see
what happened with Nick. All I saw is I thought it went off the other guy. I
was complaining about that. I knew Nick was tough enough. And I don't know, I
think he was taking his time down there and maybe he was a little tired. The
way he bounced up, I said, Nick, were you faking that or what?  
  
And yet it was a tough hit that he took. I mean, if you look at it on film, I
guess we were lucky. But then the other one, when he threw it, we kind of had
Nick in and Miles coming in -- hey, Cash is Cash, but he's improved so much,
so much that I didn't even get upset with him on the lob to those guys. I just
felt like he's had 10 assists and two turnovers and done some great things.  
  
He's going to have his work cut out for him tomorrow, though, because Howard
is a very good -- he's big. He's athletic. This will be a great test for
Cassius. And we're going to have to guard him with multiple guys, and
hopefully we can keep him in front of us. I think that will be the big key to
the game.  
  
Q. I know I read earlier in the year that you wanted your team to be
more physical. How would you assess kind of where they're at now, because they
certainly look like they found the weight room?  
COACH IZZO: Last night was a night when I thought that game got a little
crazy, a little chippy. And it bothered me for a while. And then I just said
in the huddle, maybe we need this. It's about time we -- we're not as physical
as most of my teams. We're physically strong. We don't always play as
physical.  
  
And last night -- and Miles was a big part of that -- I think he did a great
job of being more aggressive and assertive. And I think everybody else kind of
followed around him. But we'll see, because there's some trees we're going to
play against tomorrow. It is the biggest team -- I sat behind the bench for a
while, and I sure as hell wouldn't want to coach that team. I'd be looking up
all day long. I'd probably have a broken neck by the time the game was over.
I've never seen such size. But we're also looking forward to it.  
  
Q. What was Josh doing last night that allowed him to have such a big
game? And what kind of growth have you seen from him over this season?  
COACH IZZO: You know, Josh went from a great offensive player to a phenomenal
defensive player, and I think last week, that week off we had -- we talked
about, he's such a good mid-range shooter, but when he does, he's always kind
of kicking his feet and off balance. So we really worked hard on getting him
to be straight up and down and get him to look for those 3s a little bit more.  
  
He's a good shooter, but if you're not thinking 3s, if you're always thinking
driving, you've got to think shot first and drive second, if you ask me. And I
think that's what he did a better job; he looked so much more comfortable and
yet he did an unbelievable job defensively.  
  
I mean, that was the first night when I recruited him I thought he could be
the next Gary Harris. And last night was the first night when I saw it on both
ends. He was very good defensively, very good offensively. And Josh is going
to be a hell of a player. He's coming along great. He's improved a lot since
the beginning of the year, more defensively than offensively. And now he's
starting to catch up with his offense. And it couldn't come at a better time.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the differences between Syracuse's
zone versus Duke's that you faced earlier? And what you saw in the ball
movement yesterday that could help or needs to be a little different against
the zone?  
COACH IZZO: Syracuse's zone is different than anybody's in the world. Duke
plays a pretty good zone. But I think Mike would be the first to admit that
that's not his normal defense.  
  
I mean, Jim doesn't come out of a zone no matter what. He's played more zone
defense than I've played man. And we play a lot of man. So it's a system. It's
a culture there, to be honest with you. I mean, you go there and you just
you're going to fit into that culture.  
  
He recruits to it. He believes in it. He sells it. And he does a hell of a job
coaching it. And so it's something that most people don't see. It's a little
wider.  
  
I think Mike, because he has some size and because Jim coached with him on the
Olympic team -- Jim didn't talk him into doing that with the Olympic team, but
maybe he kind of talked him into showing him some of the things, because
there's some similarities. Syracuse lives, eats and sleeps it. And that's all
they play, and they play it very well.  
  
Q. You've signed this sophomore group. Everybody thinks it's the best
you've ever had. What went through your head when Josh knocks down 15 in the
first half, Bridges gets 19 in the second half, Cassius gets 10 assists? What
went through your head?  
COACH IZZO: In all honesty, Nick doesn't get enough credit but he started it
out where he hit, I think, three out of the first four baskets. So every one
of those guys came through in some ways. The only guy that maybe didn't that
next year was Jaren. We just couldn't keep him on the floor long enough.  
  
But, yeah, that's what you hope would come. And yet it's not always easy when
you have four or five guys like that. Thank God they're all unselfish and
they're all ego-less, but there's still only one ball. So sometimes that's
when Miles has a problem. He will defer because he believes in those other
guys and that's kind of a neat problem to have.  
  
But it was good to see that. I think last time I saw something like that was
out at the tournament we were at in Portland, the Nike tournament, where we
had three different leading scorers and Miles wasn't one of them. And I think
that's the kind of team we have. But I think Miles is starting to realize that
he's got to be that go-to guy, and we have to go to him when games are on the
line.  
  
The one thing that has been pretty good for us is we've played in a lot of
close games that upset some people but it probably makes us more tournament-
ready, I hope.  
  
Q. Last year when the season ended I know you were really excited about
having more big bodies coming in -- Kenny Goins is guarding guys last year
twice the size. Going against the tallest team in the NCAA, how much do you
think that that front line and the depth of that front line can really sway
things to help you here?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I hope I can. Normally you try to get people in foul
trouble, but with the zone they play, this team has not been in foul trouble
that often. But just having different bodies to throw in there. I mean, last
year it was Kenny. Sometimes it was a walk-on, 6'5". And that wouldn't fare
too well here, as it didn't against Purdue in our league.  
  
So we have the weapons but the ball's still got to go in the basket. That's
the way this game was meant to be played. So you still have to be able to make
shots. And making shots against that size and making shots against that zone
is more difficult than maybe some other ways. You don't just get to attack it
inside before it's all over.  
  
They make great adjustments. Jim's done a great job. If you try to get it in
the middle more, he makes adjustments. If you try to beat it from the outside,
he makes adjustments. If you're trying to go inside, they make adjustments.  
  
So I think they played it so much and they know it so well that there's a lot
of adjustments they make. So we've got to be kind of solid in all areas to
beat them.  
  
Q. You mentioned Gary Harris. I'm sure Josh has that kind of goal after
Michigan State. You mentioned last fall, I remember him dealing with
expectations, both that you guys had as a staff and him for himself and maybe
some other places. How has he navigated all that this year?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I think he's done a great job. I mean, once in a while
if you watch Josh's facial language, I think it's kind of like Jaren's at
times. Josh came in with Miles, and both of them kind of McDonald's All-
Americans. And Miles and them, they're best friends.  
  
But there's been a little bit of separation between the two. I think he had to
learn how to deal with that and realize that there's a process, and the
process takes longer for different people. It doesn't mean Josh has started
here two years -- and trust me when I say he's made great progress. I mean,
he's defending about as well as anybody I've had since Gary. And that's going
to benefit us and benefit him. But now he's starting to find his offense.  
  
And I think it's difficult when expectations are so high for yourself and your
team and that fine line of being selfish enough to be successful and not too
selfish so that you become a problem. And he's -- I think he's done a great
job. And I think the reason he's done a great job is the chemistry. Everybody
knows that Miles and he and Tum are like brothers, sometimes like three
stooges, but they're all together and that's important.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse student-athletes Tyus Battle and Frank
Howard as well as Coach Jim Boeheim. Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Tyus, seeing what Michigan State was able to do yesterday, go up big
against a Bucknell team, what do you know about them? What's the best way to
take a defensive standpoint and stop them?  
TYUS BATTLE: We know they're well-coached. Have some really good players.
They're going to be a tough team. They have good bigs, good shooters, a good
point guard. So just a good all-around team. But if our zone is active,
moving, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Yesterday before halftime you allowed Butler to score a lot of
points. Anything you're going to be doing tomorrow to stop Michigan State from
scoring before halftime?  
FRANK HOWARD: We've got to be active, use our length, use our athleticism. I
think when our activity level is high, I think that's when the zone is very
effective.  
  
And shoutout to you, too.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: We're a defensive-minded team. We know we win our games based off
our defense. We put teams well below their average when we're playing good
defense, and that's what we're going to have to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Frank, how do you see your role? When you're doing your job for
Syracuse, what are you doing? And what are your thoughts so far on Cassius
Winston with what you've seen from Michigan State's point guard?  
FRANK HOWARD: My role is to first lead the team, be a leader first, command
the offense, kind of be the spark on defense as well, kind of do whatever I
need to do to help us get the win. Some games I have to score the ball more.
Some games I have to facilitate more.  
  
So I just try to do whatever it takes to get the win. And I know Michigan
State, they have a lot of great guards. And we've just got to keep them out of
the lane, use our length to our advantage and just be active.  
  
Q. With the two games that you've played during this week, is there any
kind of fatigue or mental wall, physical wall that you hit going to Dayton to
play Arizona State and then playing TCU?  
TYUS BATTLE: I don't think so. We're a mentally tough team. We're used to
playing a lot of minutes. We're used to battling the entire game. So I don't
think there's any fatigue.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: I think at this point in the year we're kind of used to it. It's
kind of routine. Just gotta take care of our body. This is what we wanted all
year, we want to be in this position. We're happy to be here, just ready to
attack.  
  
Q. With this kind of short turnaround is there anything special in
particular that you guys do to take care of your bodies during your off
days?  
FRANK HOWARD: Just sleep a lot. Getting a lot of rest. Drink a lot of fluids.
We have a great staff. Brad Pike and Ryan Cabiles, they do a great job of
stretching us out, icing up after each game. And we've got to be smart about
it.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Like Frank said, stretch, ice, a lot of sleep and just mentally
preparing yourself for the next game.  
  
Q. Obviously your guys' zone is unique. Do you find opposing teams early
on sometimes get frustrated, or do you kind of wear them down frustration-wise
over the course of a game?  
TYUS BATTLE: I mean, if we're playing the zone the correct way, we're moving,
active, talking, we definitely frustrate a lot of teams because we're so long
and athletic and with shot blockers down low. And when you finally get that
open shot, you start second-guessing it because you haven't got an open shot
the whole game. So it makes things tough on the opposing team.  
  
Q. You guys will play a team that last night played 11 different guys;
you guys usually play the whole game. Will that affect how the game plays out?
Do you think that helps or hurts you?  
FRANK HOWARD: I think every team is comfortable with at this point in year
with what they do. We go seven deep. So we're used to playing minutes. The
other team making subs is nothing but a personnel issue for us.  
  
So we just pay attention to who comes in the game or what they do on both ends
of the floor. But for us we've just got to stay focused on our tasks, get some
good movement on offense, try to get some penetration and just be active on
defense.  
  
Q. Do you guys think that playing the zone helps you guys stay fresh in
this sort of a compacted schedule?  
FRANK HOWARD: Shoot, nah. The zone is, to me, almost kind of a tougher demand.
I haven't played man in college. But the zone, you guard an area, you don't
guard a man, you know what I mean?  
  
So in man you kind of gotta worry about your man, help side. And in the zone
you might have one or two dudes in your area that you've got to take care of.
So I think the zone, it's a tough thing to do, but I think when you get it
down pat it's really effective.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Like Frank said, the zone, you're constantly moving, never
stopping, constantly talking. And if something breaks down, the next guy picks
up the slack and get to the correct area. So it's tough. And you're constantly
moving.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by head coach Jim Boeheim. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: We're excited to be in this game. It was a heck of a battle
last night. And we're really excited to be able to play again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Wondering, how did you find Marek and how difficult is it to project
what he might be able to do --  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've only taken one player off tape and he was before Marek, he
was the worst player I had. He looked great on tape. Normally we wouldn't even
think about taking somebody off of tape. But we were in the summer. We had
lost a player late or knew we were going to lose a player pretty late. So our
numbers were really sketchy at the time.  
  
We had got some tape and we liked what we saw. We knew that he was a
productive player on his junior team. And you watch him on tape, he is what he
is. He's quick, he runs. He's got a good feel for the game.  
  
He's one of the only European players that can't shoot that I've seen in the
last few years. But he's more athletic than a lot of European guys. He came
in, Adrian has worked with him really hard. I've tried to help him a little
bit. We changed his shot a little bit.  
  
And he's pretty good from about 15 feet in. He makes his free throws and he's
got a good touch from 15. When he moves out, he goes back a little bit to his
old form. But last night, maybe because he had to hurry it, the 3 he made he
shot perfectly.  
  
But he's a really smart player. If he weighed 200 pounds, 210, he'd probably
be one of the better players in the country. He weighs 175 and he's a good
player, but he gets muscled. He has some games where he gets muscled.  
  
We have a really good three-man offensive team that people try to help on our
other guys, and it creates openings for him, and he sees where those openings
are. And he can be very productive in those open situations. And when people
play him straight up it gives our other guys a little bit more room to work
out there. But he's gotten better all year.  
  
But he's pretty much what we thought coming in. Really knows how to play and
has a good feel for the game. And at the time, again, it was a necessity move.
And the way things worked out, it became even more of a necessity move.  
  
Q. Frank Howard, what do you say or do to help him cut down turnovers?
And your thoughts on Cassius Winston's game?  
COACH BOEHEIM: He started out the year at a horrific rate but he's been really
good. He's been really good over the last half, three-quarters of the season.
And Cassius Winston, I've had him with USA Basketball when I was the chairman
of that committee. He's a tremendous player. Really, really good player. But
he's one of 10. Michigan State's a team you can't focus on one guy or two or
three or four; you have to play the whole team.  
  
Q. Could you please share some memories of when you coached against
Jaren Jackson, Sr., and maybe your thoughts on his son who you're going to be
seeing tomorrow?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, he was a really, really good player at Georgetown. Didn't
like him too much. I don't like anything about Georgetown. But he's a really
good player. His son's an even better player. He's a really good player.  
  
Q. I'm curious how you think the fact you've got so many guys playing
35, 40 minutes a game affects the personality or the character, I guess, of
this team?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm not sure I understand that.  
  
Q. Do you think that they enjoy that or it affects the way --  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've never had a play that didn't enjoy playing every minute of
every game. You ask them if they're upset playing every minute, I don't think
you'll find one of them upset. I remember I had a player once, many years ago,
he was playing 36 minutes a game. His father came to me and said, you know,
he's not happy. I said, what do you mean? He wants to play the whole game.
Well, we're up 30.  
  
They all want to play. Obviously -- in reality if you play, the really good
players play about 37 minutes. I mean, you're telling me you can play 37 and
you can't play 40? That's three minutes. It's not like if you're not playing
40, you play 28.  
  
The really good players -- Michigan State's an exception; they have tremendous
depth -- but the really good players, if you look at the top three players on
every good team, they play 38 minutes, the top three guys -- Duke, Rhode
Island, they're playing today. They play those guys the whole game, virtually.
They only come out when they get in foul trouble.  
  
Our defense keeps us out of foul trouble for the most part, for the most part.
Not always, but usually. But players want to play. And as I've said many, many
times, every four minutes you've got, seems like about a five-minute timeout.
It must be two and a half to three, whatever it is now. I'm sitting there for
at least two minutes, I know that, not saying anything, because they're going
to get about 30 seconds worth that they're going to remember. So the other two
and a half minutes is just looking around.  
  
So they get that rest. That's very helpful. But there's no question, our
players are going to get tired at some stages. And a really good, tired player
is better than a average fresh player. Tyus Battle has made five or six 3s to
either win the game or keep us in the game. If you're really tired you don't
do that. But whenever we lose, somebody will say, well, you're tired. We win,
I guess they're not tired.  
  
Q. Do you remember when you sort of had an inkling that Tom Izzo would
get the program rolling at Michigan State? I know you faced them in 2000. Did
you know that before that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I knew him when he was an assistant coach. I knew Tom when he
was an assistant coach. He knew the game. He was a hard-charging guy. I knew
when he took over Michigan State, he'd do a great job. I loved Jud Heathcote.
Jud was a great coach, but he wasn't the kind of recruiter that Tom would be
and has become.  
  
But there was never any doubt that he'd be a great coach. He's an absolutely
-- one of the great coaches we've ever had. And I think he's even better off
the court. He's one of the nicest people I know. I've known him -- I've been
on the board with him. I've been around him for 40 -- probably close to 40
years now, and -- from when he was an assistant.  
  
And there's no guy that has better character that you would want to be your
head coach more than Tom Izzo. I've seen countless situations where I've been
around him where he always does the right thing, 100 percent of the time. Tom
Izzo would never do the wrong thing. And anybody that thinks other than that,
they don't know Tom Izzo. I know him.  
  
I've been involved in stuff -- you're not supposed to say things -- but Tom
Izzo is not going to do things that aren't right, 100 percent of the time --
on the basketball court, off the basketball court. He's a great guy. He's a
great leader. And I'm very proud that he's a friend of mine.  
  
Q. Going off your comment on timeouts, what's sort of the key to running
a good timeout organization-wise --  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think if they get one thing that you say, you had a good
timeout. There's many times that we put one thing in and we're coming out of
the huddle and I see one guy going, what play are we running? You get one
thing across or so -- usually you take a timeout, it's better if the other guy
takes one, you don't need one. But if you take one, you're just trying to sit
them down and get them on track.  
  
I never used to believe it really helped that much. But I think I've learned
over the years, I think sometimes it does help. Coach Wooden used to say
whoever takes the first timeout is going to the game. I'm not sure that's
really true, but he was pretty smart.  
  
Q. With Michigan State having the five starters averaging double figures
scoring, what's the best way for your team to slow down a fast-paced offense
like Michigan State's?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Play good defense. Make them take time, make them have to work
for their shots and then make sure we take time and get good shots on our end.
Those two things.  
  
Q. You were pretty eloquent last night talking about the Virginia
situation. A lot of people have been coming at them, the team and the program,
pretty hard over the last 16 hours --  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, there's a lot of idiots out there. I know that.  
  
Q. When people say that they would rather have had a 15-16 season than
to have what Virginia had, what's that say about our sense of perspective and
what would you tell those people?  
COACH BOEHEIM: That group of people, if there really is a group like that,
probably are unemployed or idiots, never went to school. Or they're really,
really smart lawyers and doctors that think they know everything and really,
in reality, probably know what they're doing and know nothing else.  
  
And Tony Bennett is in my top two or three coaches in the country by far.
Unfortunately, in our business, it's all about the tournament when you're a
good team. When you just get in, like now I'm a great coach. I'm, shit, I'm no
better than I was two weeks ago. But, oh, you won two games, he must be really
-- no, nothing to do with that.  
  
I've seen coaches win games in this tournament, two, three, four games and
they're terrible coaches. Things just went right. And it's what you do over
the course of 35 games that determines what kind of coach you are. You win 17
games in the ACC, win the ACC Tournament? He's got -- I think he's got one guy
who was hurt that will be an NBA player. The other guys are -- they're pretty
good. There's a couple. They may sneak in. I don't know. They may sneak in
there.  
  
But he's won the ACC against Duke and North Carolina what four or five years?
I don't know what it is. It's beyond even trying to understand it. With maybe
two recruits in the top 40. And he's playing against 15 guys on each team over
those period of time that were in the top 20 or top 10 or top 5 in wins? Come
on. It's one game. It's one game.  
  
I can, no, I can't -- but a reasonably good player on the pro tour can beat
Tiger Woods in one round. When he was in his peak he got beat a lot.  
  
This is college basketball. I saw the Spurs get beat in their first game of
the playoffs one year. They won the championship. Golden State, I think, got
beat in the first game. They won the championship. It's one-and-done. You're
off your game a little bit, you know, and it's not that, like, people will
say, they're just good in the regular season they're not good -- that's just
stupid. That's just stupid.  
  
You look at every year they've lost -- and I'm not going to recite the whole
thing, but they lost to Michigan State in the Garden when Michigan State had a
great team. I don't remember all the other ones. But, I mean, you play in this
tournament, you're going to get beat.  
  
Pittsburgh, they didn't like their coach because he didn't win the tournament.
They're doing really good now, aren't they, in Pittsburgh? I know all those
people were yelling, too. They wanted him out.  
  
They pay this guy about $10 million, which they're trying to renege on, which
is great for a university to do, you have a signed contract with a guy and
then say, well, he yelled at his players. That's -- 350 coaches are going to
get fired tomorrow for that.  
  
Come on, the tournament is -- I've lost in this tournament, everybody has.
I've looked at the list of bad losses, and I couldn't believe we weren't even
on it. But Mike Krzyzewski has lost, I've lost, Roy Williams has lost, Bill
Self has lost. Dean Smith lost. There's nobody that hasn't lost.  
  
I think you could easily make the case that Tony Bennett's way overachieved in
the regular season and they played like they probably are in the tournament.
You could possibly make that case. This year's a little aberration, obviously.
That was a bad -- but the other losses, you know, it's a tough tournament.  
  
And really good coaches, good teams get beat. Tom Izzo is one of the best
tournament coaches ever, and I sat there two years ago and watched Middle
Tennessee beat them. They played a perfect game. We beat Middle Tennessee the
next game by 30, by 30. It's just basketball.  
  
We lost to Vermont and the next day Tom Izzo, next game Tom Izzo beat Vermont
by 20. It's just the game. It's a crazy game and the tournament's a crazy
thing. We all know that. We all say that, but then we don't follow through on
that.  
  
If I could hire a coach in this country and I could get Tony Bennett, there
would be nobody in second place. Nobody. He's kicked our ass every time we've
played him except we got lucky once.  
  
Q. Going back to Marek, how have you seen him adjust to a new country,
never mind the adjustments that come with --  
COACH BOEHEIM: Seems to be doing pretty good. He's doing well in school. He's
got a blond cheerleader for a girlfriend. He's starting on a team in the 32 in
the country. I guess he's doing okay. She drives him all over, too. It almost
should be illegal. Probably is. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Obviously Michigan State is going to have a tons there. But you're
going to have Dave Bing and Derrick Coleman?  
COACH BOEHEIM: If I could play them we'd have a shot, a really good shot.
(Laughter) had dinner with Dave and Derrick the other night. And it's always
great to see those guys. Great guys, great people.  
  
Dave Bing was my roommate in college and he taught me how to do a lot of
things that have helped me in life, really the most mature, most well-rounded
individual that I've ever been around in my life. And made a huge impact on
me. I was from Lyons, New York, 5,000 people. I didn't know who the Supremes
were when I came into my room. And he taught me an awful lot.  
  
Although the first day of practice, I thought I was pretty good, I guarded
him, he had 15 straight baskets against me. And I called my mom. I said, mom,
I don't know about this situation. My mom was pretty smart. She said, well,
how about the other players? I said they're not that good. Then you'll be
okay. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Happy Saint Patrick's Day. I'm wearing these clothes today because
I'm proud of who I am and where I'm from. And I wanted to know what are you
proud of for who you are, where you're from and for your team?  
COACH BOEHEIM: That's a great question, best one of the day, which figures.
I'm proud to be from Lyons, New York, town of 5,000 people. Small little town.
And got to Syracuse when I was 17. And didn't know much about anything. And I
remember I was a freshman playing on the freshman team, one of my best friends
said, you're doing okay, but why did you come to Syracuse? You're never going
to play here.  
  
So, he's still a good friend of mine today, but I do remind him of that about
every time I see him. But I'm very proud to be from Syracuse. Syracuse is a
great place. It's a great city. The people are great. Four months the weather
is bad and we play basketball then. So I don't really think about that too
much.  
  
But it's a great community. They support our basketball program and they
support all our causes. We raise a million dollars a year in Syracuse for
charity, and most coaches can't raise 100,000. So we're very fortunate to be
in that city.  
  
200,000 people in the city, and we averaged 22,000 people a game this year. So
tremendous support. We have parking for 500 cars. And it gets cold. It does
get cold. I don't talk about that a lot.  
  
Q. You have a few guys that play, obviously, a lot of minutes. Tyus says
he doesn't even look at the bench anymore. He doesn't even look over there.
How much do you see it as a point of pride for those guys -- they don't even
think about coming off the floor?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No, they know they're going to be out there. And there's a
comfort to that, too. As a player, I never liked to come out. You always want
to be in the game. And when I would come out I hoped the guy that came in
played bad so I could come back in -- unless it was a close game; I might not
do that. But all players want to play. They want to be in the game as much as
they can.  
  
And they're going to get worn down. They're going to feel it sometimes. You've
just got to play through it and go from there. That's all you can do. You
can't think about that. You can't think about the negatives in this game.
You've got to think about the positives. And this team's been great at that.  
  
We shot the ball horrifically last night. Against Arizona State, we did not
shoot it well. And we were able to get, at the end of the day, get the win.
And they've been good at that all year. We've had a few good shooting games
and we're probably going to need one pretty soon here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Dedrique Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26084)

### [Kyle Allman Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35024)

### [Arkim Robertson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35027)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Purdue - 74, Cal State Fullerton - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Taylor, who is
joined on the dais by Kyle Allman Jr., and Arkim Robertson.  
  
COACH TAYLOR: Tip their hat. Got to the free-throw line an exuberant amount.
Having said that, I thought our guys came out and fought, particularly in the
first half, just hit a little bust there in the second half.  
  
But I shared this with our staff last night and I shared this with this group
of guys in the locker room: In spite of the outcome, this group of guys made
history for our school. In spite of the outcome, no matter what happens the
rest of their life, they'll always be able to go back to Cal State Fullerton
and be honored in the history of Cal State Fullerton basketball. And so for
that I'm extremely proud of these guys. I'm extremely proud of their
sacrifice, what they've made, what they've done, the maturity they've shown
and the ability to get better day in, day out. So I can't express my gratitude
to each one of these guys enough, but as we always talk about, a part of our
program is impact.  
  
And I think these group of guys made a heck of an impact, not only our school
but our community, the students, and most importantly themselves, their life.
So I tip my hat to our guys and our program. Excited for what's to come in the
future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kyle, your coach mentioned kind of the slowness that you guys ended
up having in the second half. What do you think happened?  
KYLE ALLMAN: Shots we usually hit weren't falling and their size kind of
messed with us a little bit. So it was tough.  
  
Q. Arkim, being the sole senior on this team, what does it mean to get
this far even though you didn't get the outcome you wanted today?  
KHALIL AHMAD: It means a lot because last year we lost in the semifinals to UC
Davis and this year we won the championship and came here. So it means that
the work we put in over the summer really, really helped us. To get this far,
it's amazing. As Coach said it's an accomplishment we'll never forget.  
  
Q. Kyle, what was the key to your efficient night, game from an
offensive standpoint?  
KYLE ALLMAN: Just being confident in my shot, being confident in the drives
and trying to get to the free-throw line as much as I can, just going high
middle ball screen and just playing off that.  
  
Q. Kyle, you guys hit two 3s in a row to cut it 19-18, at that point how
were you feeling? I know you needed your team to play great offensively to
that point, but you're right in the game near the end of the first half. How
confident were you at that point?  
KYLE ALLMAN: I was confident throughout the whole game. My confidence didn't
waver just because of those two shots. But right there seemed really good,
like we had a really good chance to finish, but it slipped away in the second
half.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you guys had the lead there with ten minutes to play
in the first half, as he mentioned before, down to three minutes to play
within the first half. Did you get the sense, hey, we belong here, with a team
like Purdue?  
COACH TAYLOR: I just felt like this group of guys, if they could just continue
to give their best, we would see what happens. And I thought during that
stretch they were at their best in terms of playing hard, in terms of
rebounding the basketball, getting down in transition. Kyle and Khalil were
aggressive getting to the paint.  
  
We talked a tremendous amount about attacking the paint. And I thought if we
could continue to do that, we'd give ourselves a chance to get some open
looks. Just in the second half, just didn't go the way we had hoped it would
go, just in terms of the open looks, didn't knock them down the way we did in
the first half.  
  
Q. Kyle, could you talk about Carsen Edwards hit 13 points in the first
half, was really key when they started to pull away. What was he able to do
that you weren't able to slow down?  
KYLE ALLMAN: He's a good player, started hitting shots, offensive rebound,
ball screens and he made some tough shots, had some good looks.  
  
Q. Thoughts on playing Haas, you watched him on film obviously, how does
film compare to reality trying to defend him and push him around?  
KHALIL AHMAD: He's a big dude. Like I didn't expect him to be that big, but he
was tough to guard. So I just have to match his physicality. And as Coach
would tell me, do my work early. So meet him before he meets me at the post.
In the first half I was doing a pretty good job of it. But coming down the
second half, it just slipped away.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Despite Purdue's size, you seem to be very hesitant to double into
the post. Was that the game plan from the start? And how do you think it
worked in the first half as opposed to the second half?  
COACH TAYLOR: Yeah, our game plan was to try to guard the 3-point line and let
Haas do what he was going to do. And in my calculation, too, is less than
three. And so we wanted to guard the 3-point line. I thought in the first half
we did a pretty good job.  
  
I think Edwards got going there a little bit, caught us on some high ball
screen stuff and got open looks. But for the most part I thought we executed
our game plan in terms of letting Haas go one-on-one in the post and try to
make it difficult for him. And I thought he missed some easy bunnies there and
maybe thought we were going to double him but ended up not doing it.  
  
So I thought maybe it took him out of rhythm a little bit. But again, they got
going there in the second half. The first two or three shots they hit I think
there were 3s and got themselves into a rhythm. And I thought the first team
that could find their rhythm offensively would come out on top and
unfortunately for us Purdue did that.  
  
Q. What were the elements toward not being able to find your rhythm, and
also when it was 19-18 and they had not really shown a lot of rhythm
themselves, were you thinking that if you can get to halftime like this you
might have a chance?  
COACH TAYLOR: I thought we just needed to have quality possessions on both
sides of the ball. Our possessions are very -- they're defined by certain
criteria. And I thought the first half, even to that point, we hit each
benchmark. But again Purdue is a really good ball club. They're not a No. 2
seed on accident.  
  
And they continued to stay the course and continued to do what they do, and
they're a good ball club. I thought defensively their physical presence kind
of bumped us off our path a little bit and got us out of rhythm.  
  
It was difficult to get into a rhythm with the level of contact on us, against
us. So we kind of got back on our heels a little bit on defense and I thought
they took that as an admission to be even more aggressive.  
  
Q. You've talked about the importance of rebounding throughout this
season. How crucial it is for your ball club? In the first half you guys were
leading for most of the half as far as the rebounding battle goes, but it kind
of slipped away in the second half. What do you think was the cause of that?  
COACH TAYLOR: I think their size and their aggressive nature, and just their
physicality. I mean, I think they got 12 offensive rebounds there, and that
was a key point of emphasis for us.  
  
In these types of games, you can't afford to give up transition baskets or
second-chance points. And I thought that was a key element that Purdue did a
really good job of executing. But I thought they had some 50/50 plays that
they got to and hit a couple of 3s based on that. But, again, our kids battled
and we came up short.  
  
Q. What was the overall experience of these couple of days like in
contrast to what they and you might have expected it to be, and also how much
of a springboard do you think this will be toward next year and knowing that
that's out there for you?  
COACH TAYLOR: I think for this group of guys, I hope that they enjoyed the
moment, because I just encouraged them to do that and document it the best way
they knew how. It was an awesome experience, you know, to me. A little
interesting, just the motorcade and the police escort, those type of things. I
was sitting in front of the bus with a smile in my heart because I know these
guys deserve this and deserve to be in this moment.  
  
They put forth the necessary work. They met the challenges throughout the
course of the year in terms of dealing with adversity. And for us to be able
to come here and experience this, I think it most definitely is a springboard
for this group moving forward, just like last year's, little bit of success
that we had, it catapulted us to another level.  
  
And I think we've got to take this to another level, especially with having a
majority of our guys back in that locker room, all of them will be back in
uniform, and we've already started talking about the work that needs to be
done.  
  
It's not going anywhere. We've got to get better individually, which in turn
we'll get better as a group, and I'm excited to get back to campus, give them
some days off, but get right back to the work that needs to be done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

### [Vincent Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32308)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Purdue - 74, Cal State Fullerton - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Painter and
then we'll open the floor to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH PAINTER: I thought we did a really good job all around from a defensive
standpoint. We knew what they wanted to do in their isolations and some of the
things they run for Allman and Ahmad, two very good players. And I thought we
did a good job of being in help and just making it hard on them.  
  
Allman still had a really good game for them, getting 21 points. But I really
like the effort that we had. We had a tough time settling into the game from
an offensive standpoint. And as we started to make a few more, I thought we
had a really good run to start the second half, and our guys did a good job of
finding each other and we got into a good rhythm offensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You had that crowd-pleasing block in the second half. What was that
like with the crowd behind you, the Purdue faithful, how did that make you
feel?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: First, I was upset I turned the ball over. But secondly it
was just hustling, making that hustle play and just not giving up. It doesn't
matter what you're up in this tournament; you've always got to play hard from
the time of the tip-off to zero.  
  
Just trying to keep playing hard and fortunate enough to get the block. It's
the risk of getting dunked on or it's the risk of getting the block. So I took
that risk.  
  
Q. Vince, how thankful were you that Carsen was making shots when it
seemed like nobody else on your team was during that cold start?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I mean, it's what he's been doing for us all year. He's
always that guy that we can count on, it seems like, down the stretch to make
a shot when we need it or be able to get his shot. That's been big for us all
year. And he's been consistent on doing it.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys came out with a ton of energy early in the
second half. What was Coach's message for you in the locker room at
halftime?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Just to -- our defense was good. He thought our defense was
really good in the first half. Like you said, we got out to a slow start. He
said don't worry about offense, just share the ball, move the ball, we'll be
fine. Our offense will continue to do what we did on defense in the first half
and tying up some things, and just don't let them get going. They have really
good guard play. Rowe's a really good player. We couldn't let those guys get
going. I thought we did a good job overall.  
  
Q. Carsen, in that first half, when you pulled away, what were you
trying to do, what was working for you? Did you feel like during that stretch
when Purdue kind of made that run, that sealed it?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: First half or second half?  
  
Q. First half.  
CARSEN EDWARDS: We came down, we just focused on getting stops. It's been a
while since we played a game. We was just getting our legs under us. We were
just focused on getting stops and we was able to hit some shots in the first
half, but as we focused on getting stops, hopefully turn it into offense.  
  
Q. Vincent, this is now about your third tournament counting World
Games, Big Ten Tournament, Battle 4 Atlantis. Does that experience really help
coming into the NCAAs now?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Of course. I feel like getting that experience to go
represent your country is always special in Taipei, and being able to go out
in the Bahamas, and of course we didn't start the way we wanted, but we
finished strong and that carried us momentum.  
  
We ended up going on a 19-game winning streak which is really good for us. The
Big Ten Tournament didn't go the way we wanted it to, but the regular season
didn't either. We just gotta responded by giving ourselves a chance, keep
playing hard and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about the Big Ten Tournament, the lay-off you
guys had. Now you're in the first game this morning. Is that playing in any of
the sluggishness to start? Carsen, you said finding your legs?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I was speaking for myself, I believe, just kind of
little winded for that first media timeout. But we also kind of look at that
break as a positive thing. Everybody get back healthy.  
  
But I felt -- I felt fine later into the game. I started getting back into a
groove, and I believe a lot of us did too coming into the second half as well.
So, yeah.  
  
Q. You and your coach have both talked about what you liked on defense.
Moving forward, after this game, what's an area that you see you guys could
improve on?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Definitely just communicating as a team. During ball screen
or being help side wherever that may be, our communication has to be better
for us. Our coaches can't do all the talking all the time, so as seniors, and
Carsen being experienced with us as well, we've all got to do a better job
talking.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What's the latest on Isaac's right elbow?  
COACH PAINTER: I have no idea. He obviously fell on it and he hurt it. So then
he was going back. He kept holding it. I don't know if it was his elbow or his
wrist, I don't know exactly what it was. But he kept holding it, and that's
the reason I took him out there at the end of the game.  
  
Q. You played all manner of games, early games, late games, all of that.
What is different about playing the first game on a Friday morning?  
COACH PAINTER: We've actually been good this year in noon games. As a coach
you always worry about that. We played Butler in a noon game. We played at
Minnesota, at Iowa, noon games, played well in all three of them.  
  
So just kind of being ready. It's the same for both teams, obviously, but just
trying to be ready. I think, going into the NCAA Tournament you can look at a
little bit of a lay-off, you can look at a lot of different things. It's hard
to quantify what it actually is when you don't shoot as well.  
  
But a lot of times you can't forget about giving credit to the defense. I
thought they played pretty well and did some good things, too. But you just
gotta get yourself ready, gotta get yourself mentally up and get the guys
going.  
  
Obviously we don't have shoot-arounds on noon games. So sometimes we do when
it gets kind of pushed down -- 2:30, 3:00, 4 o'clock, in that mid-afternoon
we'll have a shootaround. It just depends on your team, how they play and what
they do.  
  
Q. You wanted your guys to keep playing even though you're up huge. You
got that block that was referenced earlier. That pleased you and also seemed
like Vince is back. Do you feel Vince is back with his ankle?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, I thought he played well. I thought he did some good
things for us. He's a versatile guy. So a lot of times rebounding the
basketball, passing the basketball, defending, doing a lot of different things
for us.  
  
He obviously sprained his ankle a month ago. So any time you can have those
type of experiences and positive experiences I think it just builds
confidence.  
  
Q. And the block?  
COACH PAINTER: The block was a great play. They tried to jump switch at the
play before. And we were trying to yell out, watch for that. And they did it
again and got the steal. I thought that was just a great play. You kind of
stayed with it. And anytime you can give one up you want to get it back and he
was able to do that.  
  
Q. You had P.J. picking up full court in the second half. Why did you --
and Nojel, too -- why did you both of them picking up full court there in the
second half?  
COACH PAINTER: We always do. Since I've been at Purdue, we've always picked up
and we go pick up the ball and pressure the ball. We always try to, just try
to take them out of rhythm, take some time. It's no different than the
philosophy if someone did a 2-2-1 zone press, just to take some time off the
clock. Just try to push them out a little bit when they start their offense
just a little bit more, so they're not in that sweet spot.  
  
A lot of people do ball screen motion stuff, and then if they can get out a
little bit, you can get under ball screens to keep the ball out of the paint.
Just kind of little things help. But that's how we play. We've always done
that.  
  
Q. 3-point shooting has been a strength all year and was in the second
half. The first half, do you just chalk that up to rust?  
COACH PAINTER: I chalk a couple of them up to decisions. I thought we took a
couple of ill-advised ones, but for the most part I thought others ones were
good shots, just didn't go down. And you'll have that. We always try to focus
on our decision-making and taking good shots.  
  
Whether that goes in or not, you know, sometimes guys will hang their head.
You've just got to stay positive when you're doing good things because the law
of averages, they're going to balance out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [LaVall Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34451)

### [Kamar Baldwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33252)

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Butler - 79, Arkansas - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Butler. Coach Jordan, an opening statement.  
  
COACH JORDAN: First, I want to say congratulations to Coach Anderson. It's a
great year. That's a really good basketball team. He's doing a heck of a job
with their program.  
  
We knew today was going to be a fight, obviously, with their ability to press
and extend the floor and apply pressure. We knew we had to handle that. I
thought our guys responded. I was really proud of our effort on the glass
because they're a heck of a rebounding team as well with their length and
athleticism.  
  
It was all about response, and really proud of our seniors for stepping up,
owning our huddles and making plays when we needed them. So we just talked
about survive and advance. That's the nature of March. We knew it was going to
be a 40-minute game.  
  
We got up big early. And we knew they had a run in them and we knew we had to
hold on and get it back. But guys had a really good demeanor about them and we
made good decisions late when it mattered.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sean McDermott, Kelan Martin or Kamar Baldwin.  
  
Q. Sean, a lot of games have runs in them, but these were two absolute
extreme runs -- 21-2 on your part, 27-6 countered by them. What's going
through your mind and your emotions after they've put that 27-6 run on you
guys and they take the lead after you guys were up so big?  
SEAN MCDERMOTT: Yeah, we were just moving on, focused on the next play, just
next-possession mindset, try to get a stop if we're on defense, or if we're on
offense try to get a bucket to get ourselves going again. But like Coach said,
they're a heck of a team. So we knew they would have a run in them.  
  
Q. Kelan and Kamar, you guys combined for 61 points. Arkansas' big
scorers, Barford and Macon, they didn't have anywhere near, they had 27. How
did you feel outscoring their top scorers 61 to 27?  
KELAN MARTIN: I think Kamar and Aaron did a tremendous job on Barford and
Macon. But they just did a tremendous job. I seen them watching film with the
coaches last night, and they were just locked in on personnel. So give them
credit. But those two are great players.  
  
KAMAR BALDWIN: To go off that, it was a team effort. It took all of us out
there to shrink the court, and that's what we did. We just made them take
tough 2s and limited their touches. So it was a team effort tonight.  
  
Q. I know Sean just referenced the next-play mentality you guys had.
But, Kelan, there was a possession with about nine minutes to go when you miss
a 3, long rebound, Arkansas went on a 2-on-1 break, and your freshman guard
got a great stop and you came right back and answered with a 3. Big swing.
Talk us through what your mentality was and how big of a play it was for you
guys?  
KELAN MARTIN: It was a great play that Aaron made for us, and he found me
again, just told me to keep shooting. I just knocked it in. Coach always says
if you're open shoot it. Just don't pass up open shots.  
  
Q. Kamar, obviously you guys advanced to play Purdue, a team you're very
familiar with, close by, you've already played this year, and they beat you
guys handily in the first game. I know in conference play there are times you
have to bounce back from defeats to other teams. Is it the same mindset going
against Purdue that Sunday will be a different game, that what happened in
December has nothing to do with what happens on Sunday?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Facing Purdue again. They beat you badly the first time, two months
ago. They beat you badly. How do you bounce back from that?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: We're just going to play Butler basketball, just stick with our
system and just play together as a team like we always do.  
  
Q. Any of the players, you guys held them to 4-of-18 3-point shooting.
They'd been shooting 40 percent. What was the key to holding them to
4-of-18?  
KELAN MARTIN: Just try and run them off the line. We talked about it in
pregame. Just run them off the line and make them make tough twos, and I think
we did a great job of that. And they missed some open shots as well. They were
good looks, but just give credit to our defense. We were just locked in on the
scouting report and the game plan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I want to start with the next round. I don't know if you've heard
yet, but Isaac Haas has fractured his elbow, will be out for the next game. I
wanted your thoughts on that.  
COACH JORDAN: They told me in the locker room there as we headed down here.
Obviously the first thought goes out to Isaac and his family and Purdue and
their program. You hate that for anybody, but especially a senior and his last
run for that to take him out when they had a really good team, a really good
chance to make a deep run.  
  
So I think our mentality doesn't change. It's not like they're going to play
four guys. They have other players that are really good. We've got to be
prepared for them.  
  
Q. What was your thoughts on holding them to 4-of-18 on 3s? And they
made the big run at you, took the lead, then you guys then regained the lead
at halftime and held it the rest of the game. How big was that run you made at
the end of the first half to get the lead back up to five?  
COACH JORDAN: In regards to the 3-point line, that was a heavy discussion
point throughout the week. We actually shot more 3s than them on the year by
about five. And they shoot a high percentage, so when they take them they make
them.  
  
We had to get them off the line. They do a good job in their motion offense,
setting screens. I thought guys did a good job chasing them. We were good off
the ball, which was a big emphasis.  
  
And then transition was the other part, where we gave up maybe two in
transition, but we found them as they were flying up the court because we know
that they play with pace. And so that was a big deal.  
  
And then the other, we got up big and I didn't expect to beat them by 20. Like
I said, they've got firepower and some offensive weapons that can get you back
in the game. I thought our guys just had a really good response when they came
back to the huddle they made the run. It was all about the next play, as Sean
said. So that mentality helped us keep a poise about us, even when they made a
big run.  
  
Q. With Purdue, obviously a 7'2 " guy goes out. They'll replace him with
a 7'3" guy. Is it pretty much the same scouting report or is there some
different strategies that you'll need to use on Sunday?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I think offensively it changes things for them because
Haas is such a factor on the offensive end of the court. Obviously the
freshman, a big kid, he's a defender, shot-blocker, very mobile. So they had
kind of a double-edged sword there where they can do a little offense/defense,
and they're both 7-feet tall.  
  
Now you know the Edwards guys and the other players will get more aggressive
because the points have to come from somewhere. We have to do a really good
job with personnel. Matt's a great coach and they run really good stuff. And
we've got to guard anything they throw at us. They've got veteran players, and
they'll be ready.  
  
Q. Two-parter: You guys seemed like you did a nice job on Gafford. He
was 2-of-9, kept him from going crazy. What was the key to that? And I think
Butler is 11-1 in openers since 2001. I think you're the fifth coach in that
run. So obviously you guys are all doing a pretty good job. What do you think
about 11-1 and being the latest guy to win that first game?  
COACH JORDAN: 11-1 is because we've got pretty good players. And they've got a
lot of pride in the program. So our seniors weren't satisfied with just
getting here and getting to the tournament. Obviously we had to earn that. But
they got bigger goals in mind. And so that's been the case the past two
decades.  
  
And I think that -- you can feel that. You can see it. I think we worked with
that mindset every day. And these guys have done a heck of a job this season.
And what was your first question again?  
  
Q. About Gafford, holding Gafford.  
COACH JORDAN: The big fellow, obviously he presents a problem. He's big, long,
athletic. We just wanted to keep him away from if basket. We got caught a
couple times fronting a little bit too high and they threw it over the top and
he was able to use his length.  
  
We wanted to stay between him and the basket and make it hard for him to score
and give him no angles. So I thought Tyler and Nate did a great job.  
  
And we kept him off the glass. He had zero offensive rebounds -- or he got
two. So it wasn't a big factor because we know that's part of his ability to
help them is going to rebound and get putbacks.  
  
Q. I know this was your first tournament victory; congratulates on that.
Was there any advice you had gotten leading up to this week of preparation
that kind of prepared you for this moment, being your first time in the
tournament as a head coach?  
COACH JORDAN: You know, I reached out to a couple of mentors just on prepping
for the week, because you have Selection Sunday and then game's on Friday, so
what to do with the four days in between. And outside of that, you just have a
mindset of trying to do your best for these guys.  
  
They deserve it. You know they're going to work. You know they're going to pay
attention to the game plan. So just making sure we're really clear on what we
were asking of them, so that they can come out and play with big hearts and
execute.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Miles Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32885)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

### [Joshua Langford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32884)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Michigan State - 82, Bucknell - 78  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: It was a game that I thought was one of the more bizarre -- I
thought we were playing Purdue. It was a fistfight. It was physical. It was
kind of out of control. I thought we did some very, very, very good things
when we had the 11-point lead.  
  
And then Nick, as good as he was in that stretch, I didn't think we took over.
And I blame Miles and I blame Cassius and I blame myself. I thought we got
sloppy there for a while, and that lead changed like that with a couple of bad
shots.  
  
And the second half we got rolling again. And thanks to Cassius running the
thing and we really went to Miles and Josh we went to all night. So I thought
everybody stepped up and kind of ashamed they hit all those 3s at the end, but
at the same time give them credit. They made some shots.  
  
I thought for the most part the second half we played very, very well even
defensively. And I thought offensively we moved the ball very well and even
missed some good shots.  
  
So considering the lay-off, I thought we were pretty sharp in maybe 30 minutes
of the game but when we weren't sharp, it was really disappointing how we --
it wasn't one mistake, it was like 3s and 4s and that's got to change if we're
going to be moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Miles, talk about dueling a little bit with Thomas and how
unfortunate it was that he fouled out, even as a competitor, that he fouled
out there, the technical?  
MILES BRIDGES: He's a great player. But it was good for us that he fouled out.
(Laughter) but, no, he's a great player. We don't want to give him any open
looks. We had him work for every shot he got today. But he did a great job.  
  
Q. Miles, can you please talk about the night Xavier Tillman had
tonight. He didn't play like a rookie, did he?  
MILES BRIDGES: No, he's actually been great for us all year. He plays like a
veteran, big. He talks on defense. He likes to move the ball on offense. I
love when X is on the floor.  
  
Q. Josh, hitting that first shot, how much did that take maybe a burden
off your shoulders as you continued to hit shots? Take us through what was
going through your mind getting in rhythm.  
JOSHUA LANGFORD: It felt good hitting that first shot. But I think the biggest
thing I was trying to focus on was just trying to help my team win, and that
was on the defensive end, not just on the offensive end. And my team did an
unbelievable job finding me.  
  
Q. Cassius, what was it like playing this first round game in Detroit?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It was great. You look up there, I saw my brothers and my
family, my grandma and stuff was in the crowd. So they don't get a chance to
come to a lot of games, especially at this stage. So to have an opportunity to
play in front of them at this stage was amazing.  
  
Q. Cassius, talk about Langford and the way he began today. And at that
time Bucknell was making some nice shots. Can you talk a little bit about the
game that Joshua had tonight and you facilitating the ball to him a little
bit?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely, when Josh hitting shot my assists they
skyrocket up a lot. He was due for this type of game. The amount of time he
puts in the gym, his shot is going to fall. We knew it was coming.  
  
So he picked the perfect time to get it going. So we always are looking for
him, always getting pin-downs. We trust him with the ball making those shots.  
  
Q. Josh and Miles, first half it looked like it was going to be Josh's
kind of game. Second half, more of Miles. What does that say about the threat
that you guys can be in this tournament?  
JOSHUA LANGFORD: I think that speaks volumes about how deep our team is, and
it's something that we've always talked about since the beginning of the year
is how good our depth is. And anybody on the team can get going and it just
speaks a lot about the team and how unselfish we are as players.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: We were opening the floor for everybody else. Nick did a great
job by posting up, getting us open looks. And Cash did a great job by
facilitating to us. Try to take every shot they gave us.  
  
Q. Miles, 29 points for you, a whole lot of green and white cheering you
on. What role did the atmosphere play for your team tonight?  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, our fans, I feel we have the best fan base in the
country. They really came out and supported us today. And that really helped
us when we were down a little bit. When Bucknell was going on the run, our
crowd really got us going.  
  
Q. Cassius, can you talk about your alley-oops that didn't make your
coach really happy and one that got Nick hurt?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Man, you had to bring that up, huh? (Laughter).  
  
COACH IZZO: I don't care right now. No big deal.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Sometimes I get in the habit of trying to make a big play or
a home run play, which I got better at, but I've got to break that habit. I
tried to make an alley-oop to Miles and one to Nick that almost got him hurt.
I've got to do a better job just playing smarter, just looking at the
situations.  
  
Q. Did you feel any affect from the long lay-off from not playing for
about two weeks?  
MILES BRIDGES: No, I feel like our practice really helped us get going because
our practice, when we're practicing hard it feels like games. So it got us
ready for the tournament.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely. If you would have been in the gym with us,
you would have seen that we was going at it for sure. We wasn't sitting back
and chilling or nothing. We were going at it a lot. It almost felt a little
better to be out there playing in a game.  
  
JOSHUA LANGFORD: I agree with those guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, where is this team at compared to where you need them to be to
go forward in the tournament, especially against some of the bigger teams
coming up?  
COACH IZZO: We said going in, you know, T.J. and I talked about, we kind of
talked about our substitution pattern and we said we were going to put X in
there early. We said we were going to get Ben in there. Kind of unfair to Ben
because he hasn't played much, and yet he's been doing such an unbelievable
job in practice, especially against zones and that. Our offense works better
through him. We wanted to get his feet wet.  
  
Like I said, I was really pleased. It shouldn't have been a 4-point game. And
taking nothing away from them. But I thought we played very well for most of
that game. They're a good team. I mean, I saw some of the 3 and 2 and 4 seeds,
or 15, 14 and 13 seeds, and I swear to God, when I first watched them on film
I said, you know, this is Middle Tennessee-plus.  
  
And I just -- I think what we didn't do, and I did tell Cassius and Miles
this, when we made a mistake, we let it carry over to two and three and even
four a couple times. And I told Nick that.  
  
And so we're still growing. I mean, we're still trying to get better. But we
really took a big step, because it was a physical game. I can't believe Josh
Langford got a technical. He hasn't said a word since he's been on campus.
There were some questions I had on some things. But I thought in general,
considering we're playing without Jaren Jackson, who, when he was in there,
was awfully effective for the, I don't know, five minutes he was in there.  
  
And so I think this team still has a ways to go. I think we found out what we
said, that a tough player makes a difference. And Xavier was just tougher than
everybody. And Miles is right. I did get on Miles. I got on him at halftime.
But, boy, we started running some stuff from him and he started answering the
bell, one after the other, and the tip dunk kind of typified it. And so I
think we're making some progress. We took a step forward. There's no question
about that.  
  
Q. Xavier Tillman, you saw he was going to get a lot of playing time and
we were going to see him on the floor early. He didn't play like a rookie, did
he?  
COACH IZZO: No, I think the best thing that's happened at our place is over
the years I've always taught guys that are players that aren't getting enough
reps to be on the scout team. And that kid is so good on the scout team, he
never took one rep with anybody other than he played Bucknell all night.  
  
But he's so smart. A little bit like Draymond, he's got a little bit of that
cerebral basketball smarts. And he picked up everything from watching film and
running their offense. And it was amazing, I think, what he did, and I think
those guys were excited about it.  
  
Yet, I thought Nick, you know, did some good things. So the two of them
together was a pretty good combination.  
  
Q. Miles Bridges' selfish basketball is fun basketball to watch. Is this
the tip of the iceberg or maybe more of what's below the surface for him?  
COACH IZZO: It's funny, most coaches, we're always dying to say, we have an
unselfish team. And I keep telling this guy he has to be more selfish. That
shows you how sick I am. But I have to agree with you. I like the selfish one.  
  
But it was a combination, too. We went to him; the players wanted to go to
him. But he wanted the ball, too. So, yeah, I think you're going to see more
and more and more of this. And yet the guy that didn't get many shots tonight
that I think has played a pretty good game, too, was Cash. I guess he got
eight.  
  
But maybe the key to this game was we finally got in a fistfight and dealt
with that. And number two, 10 turnovers in a game like that was pretty good.
And that was probably the difference in the game.  
  
Q. There's madness and then there's chaos. I'm thinking back to 2000,
Iowa State, and how crazy it got. And where this compares with the technical
foul on Thomas, he's gone but then they come back, they get 3s. Take us
through what's going through your mind?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, I wasn't -- I'm not setting up a birthday party
with those guys, that's for sure. I didn't like the way it went. I really
didn't. But they probably didn't like the way I was either. So I understand
that.  
  
But I thought it got so chippy. And just like you said -- and that technical
on Josh Langford, I'll go to my grave saying there's no way. Just because I
know the kid. There's times I wish he would get one.  
  
But at the same time, they made all the 3s. If they didn't, we would have
probably had an incredible defensive night. I think they hit like four at the
end and give them credit. But this time of year I thought we played well
enough for a large stretch of that game that we can build off that.  
  
Q. What was the biggest challenge in defending Zach Thomas tonight?  
COACH IZZO: There really wasn't much of one. We didn't defend him. So I mean
it wasn't -- what we were going to try to do is not let him drive left. He did
that. Not let him shoot 3s. He did that. And not let him get to the free-throw
line since he gets there nine times a game. And he got there 11.  
  
So I'd say that in general the coaches did a poor job on the game plan because
we didn't take care of the things that we needed to take care of. I was
disappointed. But Jaren did a hell of a job on him. And then -- but I don't
know how many minutes he played. Sure didn't seem like many. And that hurt us.
It hurt us a lot. And normally I'm talking about Jaren. I said he makes some
dumb fouls. I didn't feel that way tonight.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you could walk us through when you see Nick take
that fall, it looked really scary when it happened live. And then also when he
came back in the game with great defense in the post, and kind of what he
brought.  
COACH IZZO: Nick, at times Nick's an interesting guy to coach. But he's grown
up so much. And he's so much better of not letting things get to him as much
as he used to. Now, he still has his moments.  
  
But I've been really, really pleased with Nick Ward, his play. His practices
have been off the charts. And those guys are right. We had a good couple of
days. We took a little time to kind of bond, and then we went at it from last
Thursday on. And I thought that helped Nick a lot.  
  
Xavier and Gavin really beat him up and Nick handled it well. And when he
stayed within himself, he was great. And it seemed like he got a little
excited and all of a sudden started running plays at a different speed. And
when that happened, it wasn't as good.  
  
But I wasn't worried about him being hurt. Nick's probably my toughest guy on
the team. But when he did lay there a little while longer, I don't know, and
he jumped up, I don't know if he was just taking a rest or what, because when
he jumped up he looked great to me and he wanted to go right back in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Ahmed Hamdy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35060)

### [Kenrich Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32824)

### [Vladimir Brodziansky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32826)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Syracuse - 57, TCU - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH DIXON: We have our three seniors up here and -- as I told them I told
them in the locker room -- I can't tell them how much, how thankful I am, how
appreciative I am, how appreciative the school is for what they've done in
changing a program and getting it to a tournament and how they've handled
themselves on the floor and off the floor.  
  
So we've created a program to be proud of, and these guys are the main
reasons, because you need senior leadership on and off the floor. I can't
thank them enough. I told them that in the locker room.  
  
And I thought we'd be playing more, but we didn't get it done tonight. And we
didn't play as well as I had thought we would. And with that said,
congratulations to Syracuse. But we simply just didn't get it done and that is
on us. But I can't tell them how much and how proud I am for what they've done
for our program and going forward here. And this is a step in the right
direction for us going forward.  
  
Q. Kenrich, how tough is this? I know you don't ever want to lose a
game, but the excitement that you guys had going into this tournament,
expecting to win some games, how tough is it?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: It's tough. Because we just didn't want to be continually
getting in the tournament, we wanted to make a run, win some games. But we
came up short and it's tough. And it's going to be tough for a while for me
and the seniors, the rest of the seniors.  
  
Q. Vlad, you came on strong in the second half. What was changing? Did
you guys change up the game plan a little bit or how did that happen?  
VLAD BRODZIANSKY: I didn't want my career to be over. So I was trying to help
the team to win.  
  
Q. You guys had a great season. What can you take away from that?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: You can take away -- we kind of made history this year
getting in the tournament for the first time in 20 years. I mean, I learned a
lot on and off the court, learned a lot from my teammates, from the coaches,
from Coach Dixon. And so, yeah.  
  
Q. Kenrich, you went on an 8-0 run to close out the half. What allowed
you guys to take the lead entering the half?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: I think we got a few buckets in transition. We got a few
stops late in the half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The shooting struggles from outside the last three or four games,
anything you can put your finger on?  
COACH DIXON: Good defensive teams, I think that's part of it. If you look at
the teams we've played, I think slower-tempo teams. And, you know, you're not
going to shoot, we're probably not going to shoot 50 percent against them.
What they do -- you've got to get second shots, you've got to get put-backs. I
think that's one of the things that hurt us and keep your turnovers low.  
  
The field goal percentage, obviously 34 in the second half, that's going to
get you in trouble. But there was the other things, too. I mean, free throws,
makes, shoot them at a higher rate, 64 percent. Obviously, putbacks and second
shots, as I said, we had to outrebound them. You're probably not going to
shoot as high a percentage, but you've got to do the other things, and we
didn't do those things.  
  
Q. Rebounding, it sort of improved when Ahmed was put in there. Is that
a give and take? You have him in there for defensive purposes, rebounding
purposes but he's not going to score as much?  
COACH DIXON: It's an interesting thing. We probably -- and in looking at it,
we got, obviously, Vlad at 13 points, so we could point at different things.
But he came with some nice rebounds. Defensively, did some pretty good things
defensively for us. I'm happy with the production we got out of that spot.
There's no question. We'd been getting good production all year long.  
  
We had some guys not play as well down the stretch, and this game included.
And I hope that they're going to have their best games in the NCAA Tournament.
But we didn't. And that's offense and defense. So we got good production out
of them.  
  
This was a game we could have played them both together. But that hadn't been
our best team all year long. So looked at possibly doing, talked about it
afterwards but obviously if you know that the other guys aren't going to be as
productive, it obviously gives you -- with Kouat getting off and getting a
couple 3s early. You feel pretty good about how he's playing, but it didn't
continue.  
  
You can look at it different ways. But again we hadn't played those guys
together much at all.  
  
Q. Do you think that there was any benefit to Syracuse having played,
with TCU having such a long layoff since their last competition?  
COACH DIXON: I mean, I could look at it -- obviously you get the time to
prepare. We don't really get an advantage because we don't know who we're
playing. So it's a unique setup in that regard. But, you know, we had plenty
of days to prepare. And we worked on Syracuse's zone and their plays, things
we'd all seen before.  
  
But we just -- we didn't get -- our play wasn't as good the last couple of
weeks, the last three games. But, again, we played really good defensively
teams. They slowed the tempo down. And I guess we're going to have to get used
to playing against that type of style in certain situations, or at least
winning against that type of style. And we didn't. So that's disappointing.  
  
They did it differently, being in the 2-3 zone. But they're obviously very
patient on offense and they want low-scoring games. It affected our offense to
some degree but we've seen that before.  
  
Q. You guys have had a great season. What's the most positive thing that
you can take away from the season?  
COACH DIXON: I think for us the positive is what we've done. We haven't been
to the tournament in 20 years, as people have reminded us. So as I spoke about
our three seniors, they came to a place that hadn't been there. So it's a
special thing to break a 20-year drought. I think it's the longest Power Five
streak in the country to be broken. So that's hard to do. And they did it. And
they should be proud of that.  
  
Right now they're not going to feel that. They're going to be solely
disappointment in the loss. But the season gave us -- we created a lot of
fans, a lot of interest in Fort Worth and I think we created a great future
going forward here of how to handle things on and off the floor and how to put
together a great program and high character kids.  
  
Q. You talked about building off of that. Do you use this loss as
something to build upon and going into next season, to work harder and
capitalize on the mistakes you may have made in this game?  
COACH DIXON: And I think the last couple of games. We were on a nice run, we
won the last four. But we didn't do as good a job down the stretch. And
offensively we had some struggles, which obviously hasn't been an issue with
us all year long. We've been as good as there is offensively. Defense got
better down the stretch, a lot better, and even we saw it tonight, we hold
them to 36 percent from the field.  
  
But at the end of the day, you've got to find ways to make plays down the
stretch. We had our opportunities and we didn't. So it doesn't feel like it
right now, but we'll look back at some point and say this is a dramatic -- we
don't use the word rebuild, but, again, it's a dramatic step in the right
direction for us going forward. We've got a great group coming back, a lot of
guys with a lot of experience now.  
  
I guess, as I told them, this must be part of the process, playing in the NCAA
Tournament and not playing to your level. Simply put, we didn't play to our
level. And that hopefully prepares us for going forward next year.  
  
I know we worked hard. But almost too excited, almost too much emotion in
warmups and all day long. So maybe that caught up with us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Nathan Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33043)

### [Stephen Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33044)

### [Nana Foulland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33046)

### [Zach Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33045)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Michigan State - 82, Bucknell - 78  
  
COACH DAVIS: First, I thought our guys came out, competed, never backed down,
never stopped playing. That's why we were in the position we were in to be
here in the first place. Gotta give our guys a lot of credit for the way they
played, the poise we played with. But at the same time, give Michigan State a
lot of credit. I thought they played well.  
  
Every game you go into, you say if you're going to get beat you want the other
team to just play better than you did. And I think that was certainly the case
today. I don't think our guys have anything to hang their heads over. It's
certainly disappointing when you don't advance, but again give Michigan State
a lot of credit for the way they played.  
  
Q. Zach, can you walk us through what in the world happened on that
technical?  
ZACH THOMAS: I'll try. So I drove from the top of the key, bounced it to Nana,
and I thought he got fouled. But I was backpedaling. It was a physical game. I
thought he maybe -- missed a couple of calls, or got fouled on a couple of
others before that.  
  
I was just backpedalling. I said, "What are you watching?" from about, like,
half court. And he was still on the baseline. I didn't think he was looking at
me. But apparently he heard me and he didn't like it. I shouldn't have said
it, but I mean I didn't agree with the call. At least warn me or something.  
  
Q. Nana, your last game with these guys. Reflect back on your time at
Bucknell with this special, special class?  
NANA FOULLAND: Like Coach said, we've got nothing to hang our heads on. They
were a good team. Last year, West Virginia was a good team too. It's hard to
win games. Only one team can win this whole tournament. So it's hard to beat
these guys.  
  
And it's just been fun. It's been a fun four years. I've grown a lot as I
player. These guys have grown as well, not just as players but as individuals.
I'm going to miss it a lot. I'm going to miss them, miss the team. But, like
Coach said, we've got nothing to hang our heads on. It was fun. Just sucks
that it has to end.  
  
Q. Stephen, every kid dreams of hitting that last-second buzzer beater
and the NCAA Tournament. Yours was a little bit different. Could you walk me
through that moment?  
STEPHEN BROWN: It was kind of disappointing for me because the ones that were
early on in the game didn't really fall. But in situations like that, just
trying to get the ball down as fast as I can and -- work on it a lot of times.
Just trusting the shot, for it to go in. And then the last one it was kind of
a lucky shot, I guess. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Zach, can you talk about your first half and the rhythm you were in?
And then in the second half, Miles Bridges seemed to take over. Just your
thoughts on his game seeing it in person?  
ZACH THOMAS: Yeah, coming in I thought it would be an interesting matchup. I
wasn't really sure because I know I was giving up some size, but I thought I
could play on the perimeter pretty well. I was able to do that, especially in
the first half. I was able to get 3s off, get to the rim. So I felt pretty
comfortable.  
  
And in the second half I still felt good. Got in some foul trouble there. And
then, yeah, Bridges, he played well. He made shots. He got to the rim. He got
fouled. He got put-backs. He was pretty impressive. He's definitely, I would
say, their best player, or at least he was tonight. Yeah, he was a tough
matchup for us.  
  
Q. Zach, curious if you can reflect on your four years and being with
these guys and then it coming to an end here.  
ZACH THOMAS: Sure. Like Nana said, I love these guys and the rest of my
teammates as well. We've kind of made a name for Bucknell and the Patriot
League a little bit. We've competed the last two years.  
  
Obviously we'd like to have won a game, but I thought we competed well. I
think we got a tough draw this year for sure, which kind of sucked. But
besides that, I'm really proud of how we've competed. And each one of us, I
think, each year we've gotten better, like Nana said, as basketball players
but also as people.  
  
And I think that's a big statement of why you come to a school like Bucknell
and then also how the Patriot League represents itself. So we're proud to
represent our school and our league.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Zach scored 27 tonight. But I was doing the research, he's actually
scored in double figures 10 consecutive games against Power 6 opponents. So
the national TV audience may have been surprised tonight, but you probably
weren't. What makes him so effective when he's going against guys that are
longer, stronger, more athletic than him?  
COACH DAVIS: I think, one, he's a really confident kid. Kid -- he's 22 -- I'm
not sure he's a kid. But he's really confident.  
  
Once we were talking in the locker room or after practice about something. He
goes: I've been scoring all my life. He's like the second all-time leading
scorer in the state of Maryland. So it's not by accident. He's very skilled.  
  
He can shoot the 3s. You saw the range. He can put the ball on the floor and
finish. He draws fouls. Maybe not on Jaren Jackson Jr. but on other guys he
can post them up. A lot of guys post up Jackson. He's a very versatile
offensive player.  
  
And he's smart. And so he doesn't force it. He kind of lets it come to him,
knows how to play with the other guys and to get himself in position to score.
I wish it was something we could teach to everybody, but I think it's one of
those things that's just kind of an innate ability.  
  
Q. You've been around basketball quite a long time and have had a lot of
success. Can you tell me how good this Spartan team is in your opinion? You've
watched them on film; you played against them, just your general thoughts on
them, please, sir.  
COACH DAVIS: Usually I enjoy watching Michigan State play but this week it
wasn't a whole lot of fun. They are, in the time I've been -- I think I've
been in Division I on some level for probably 16 years -- they're as good as
anyone I've seen.  
  
I think that obviously when you have guys like Bridges and Jackson, who are
going to be lottery picks, I think the pieces fit well together. They have
balance in that they can throw it inside. They can score from the perimeter.  
  
The first half we were actually kind of forcing them to take the shots we
wanted them to take and they were making those, too, with Langford with those
pull-ups.  
  
They rebound it well and then they're long and can defend. You watch them,
they don't have a lot of weaknesses. They're as good as I've played against in
a long time.  
  
Q. I don't know if you're a woulda, coulda, shoulda-type of guy, I'm not
trying to get you in trouble here, but would you have liked to have played
that game maybe with a little more flow to it, with some less whistles and
different types of things to see the outcome?  
COACH DAVIS: I think you always want there to be flow to the game, and we're
at our best when there's pace and it's going up and down and the ball is
moving side to side. Certainly that's better. But a lot of that's on us, too.
There's things we could have done better as far as reaching in and rotations
and boxing out and taking some better shots. So the answer to your question,
yes, flow is always better. Sorry.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Miles Bridges, film versus in person, and how is he
able to kind of take the game over there in the second half?  
COACH DAVIS: He was pretty impressive on film. I would say the same about in
person. I think the thing that you don't quite see as much on film is how high
he gets when he shoots the pull-ups.  
  
I thought we were there to contest a lot. Just because of how athletic and big
he is, he's able to get up and get a clean look anyway. He's very strong. You
don't see as much of his strength when you're watching film until you see him
in person, but he's a really, really good player.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, did you get more of an explanation from the
referees about Zach Thomas' technical foul?  
COACH DAVIS: No.  
  
Q. When a team goes 12 or 13 deep, can that be a difference-maker in a
tournament where they can go with guys? It's hard to game plan for 13
people.  
COACH DAVIS: I think the biggest advantage it is, and we typically do that,
too, is that you have a lot of -- you have a lot of guys you end up having
confidence in, and a lot of guys on the floor that the other guys are
confident in because you've seen them do it before. There's some nights some
guys are playing a little better than others, gives you a little more
flexibility to get through those nights.  
  
And then obviously with foul trouble. I mean, games are officiated differently
and fouls are called differently. And if you have more guys available, if
there's fouls, it allows you to sit some guys longer, especially in the first
half, where you don't pick up a third or a cheap second one late. So there's
certainly major advantages to it.  
  
Q. Do you wish you could have played Michigan State on a neutral
court?  
COACH DAVIS: I'd be okay never having to play that team again. (Laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: And on that note, Coach, thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Tyus Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34258)

### [Frank Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34259)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Syracuse - 57, TCU - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought that our defense was really good tonight, the whole
game. We just had trouble getting things going on offense. And the last three
possessions we just decided to go with Oshae.  
  
We thought he had an advantage there. He wasn't having a great game, but it
turned out to be the right move. He made three almost impossible shots. But it
was our defense. Our defense was tremendous. They're one of the better
shooting teams in the country from the 3-point line. And these guys just
played.  
  
They didn't get any easy shots the whole game. And I thought that was the
difference. We did a good job on the boards and didn't turn the ball over. It
was a really good win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Frank, there were a lot of lulls down the stretch, both teams
struggling on offense. What did you tell your teammates to keep them in the
game, keep them focused?  
FRANK HOWARD: We just wanted to stay poised down the stretch. We didn't want
to get frustrated or start to force anything. They did a great job of keeping
our guards out of the paint, kind of levelling up in the paint with the help
side.  
  
And Marek had a great game today. And Oshae, he was great down the stretch,
passed guys, some big free throws again. And kudos to TCU. They played a hard
game. But I just think our confidence and poise got us through.  
  
Q. You're used to games like this, slow scoring, sometimes a little
struggle. Was this the type of game that you were hoping to get with the pace
of play and kind of mucking it up?  
FRANK HOWARD: Nah. No, this wasn't ideal for us. This team is going to fight.
Whatever situation we're in, if the pace was a little different, we have to
adjust. So Coach did a great job of putting some new schemes in, getting the
ball moving better, and putting guys in the right spots. And guys made plays.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Just like Frank said, we would like to score a little bit more
than that. They made it tough. They kept us out of the lane. When Frank, Oshae
and I all struggled to score the ball, we still come out with a win, that
shows you how much guys can step up tonight. And Marek played huge tonight.  
  
Q. First couple minutes, the ball was really moving on offense, passes
every few seconds. Then it slowed down. Is that something TCU or is that
something you guys, just have to keep the ball moving the whole game?  
TYUS BATTLE: I think it was a mental lapse on our players' fault. We should
have kept moving the ball. Once we started moving the ball in the second half
we started getting easy shots, easy buckets, cuts to the basket, stuff like
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. TCU went 3-of-5 from deep in the first five minutes of the game,
didn't make another 3-point shot. Did you adjust how you were playing them
from deep?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No, we just got lucky. We played the same way the whole game.  
  
Q. You were talking yesterday about parity in basketball and maybe 16
over 1s. Did you happen to catch the UMBC score?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I saw the score. This tournament just breaks your heart. The
better you are, the more it breaks your heart. And I've been there. I've been
in that position.  
  
I was looking today through some recount of all the upsets. And I don't know,
they didn't have us in there. I was really happy. But all the great teams that
get beat, you know, I mean, it's a heartbreaking tournament. That's what it
is. That's the only way to describe it.  
  
Our league was really hard this year. Virginia could have been 18-0. They had
several chances to win that one game they lost. So you know, it's unfortunate.
But everything revolves around what you do in this tournament when you're
good. When you're not so good, it's good just to get in it.  
  
Q. All three of the big guys were struggling to score today, including
Oshae. What did you see there at the end when you wanted to go to him?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Nobody else had done anything. We thought he had a good matchup
there. And he had gotten shots. He got a lot of shots. But he really -- really
I didn't probably realize it at the time that we decided to make that
decision, he was 1-for-13. If I had known that fact I might not have done
that.  
  
But, really, Frank was struggling and Tyus was struggling to get by. Our best
player, Marek, was out of the game so we had to make an adjustment. Marek was
unbelievable tonight. The only reason we were in the game was the way he
played early. He made some really hard shots, probably two or three really
hard shots, the 3 at the shot clock buzzer.  
  
You know, I mean, he was unbelievable today. I mean, you can't play better
than that as a freshman. But we go with Oshae a lot late in the games because
we think he can get to the foul line. And I thought he would have gotten to
the foul line on all three of those plays, but that didn't happen. But he's
the guy we usually try to go to late in those situations.  
  
Q. What does it say about the resiliency of your team that you were able
to overcome your best player in the game fouling out with several minutes
left?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I just made the decision to go with him. I think he got his
fourth with 12, 13 -- I don't know what it was -- he lasted five or six
minutes. I thought if we had taken him out early -- he's smart. Generally he's
able to stay out of foul trouble. Close call on the one he got caught on
there.  
  
But Matt went in, Matt did a good job. He played good defense and made a foul
shot for us. But it's a little gamble when you go with guys. But he was good
there for a long period of time.  
  
This was just a defensive game. Our defense was -- we didn't give them good
looks from the 3-point line. And then at the very end of the game, when you're
trying to shoot a 3, it's really hard to make one when you haven't made any
during the game. It was a great effort. Our defense was fabulous. We just held
two teams that averaged 80s, well in the 80s, to 56 and 52. That's pretty
good.  
  
Q. Given where Marek started the year, he was coming off the bench early
and was struggling early in ACC play. Was there a moment where you noticed his
game kind of change at some point in the season?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, he had some good games early. And he had a little
struggle the first couple of ACC games. But then after that he was good. He's
a good defender. He's capable of scoring if he gets in the right situations.
And everybody that we play is worried about the other three guys. And he gets
into some really good situations. He gets the ball open 10 feet a lot. And
he's gradually been able to figure that out. And, again, he was great tonight.
I mean, he was fabulous.  
  
Q. How important going into this one was pace of play going to be for
you --  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, we're going to play the way we play. And we're not
running up and down. Couple times we try to go for the fastbreak, we missed,
completely screwed up. The end of the first half, Frank thought he had a
fastbreak, and we had the ball up 3. He holds the ball. If we just hold the
ball and don't take a shot we're up three at halftime.  
  
It was a bad clock-management situation at the end of the half. He thought he
had it, but you can't take that opportunity when you just think you have it.
You have to know you have it. That was a really bad end of the first half. And
fortunately we were able to overcome it.  
  
Q. You had some great battles with Coach Jamie Dixon over the years,
whether in the Big East or the ACC. Was this kind of the typical game that you
expect?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, he's a tremendous coach. He's really -- you know, he beat
us with his defense most of the time at Pittsburgh. The games were like this.
And most of the time we were underdogs or even. We were never really -- he had
really good teams for that stretch and we weren't so good.  
  
The year we went to the Final Four -- yeah, the Final Four team, we beat them
twice. But the other years they were pretty good. And they played really well
against us. But their defense was really, really good. He had the best
defensive teams in the Big East for a number of years. And that's what really
carried them through, I thought. Their defense was tremendous. This team is
more of an offensive team, I think. But, I mean, they play good defense but
they're really a tremendous offensive team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
Butler - 79, Arkansas - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: First of all, congratulations to Coach Jordan and the Butler
Bulldogs. I thought they played an outstanding game. We fell off behind early
in the game, but I thought we actually kind of battled back and got ourselves
back into the game by halftime.  
  
And I thought we really got into the fold the second half. But give them
credit. Their all-conference guys, they stepped up and made big, big plays.
When you think of Martin, some guarded 3s that were big. We cut it to six. We
had three opportunities to actually cut it a little further, like within that
11- to 10-minute mark. And then I think they went on a barrage of 3s.  
  
But give them credit. I thought they were the more physical team. And it
showed in rebounding the basketball. And, of course, they made shots and we
didn't shoot the ball particularly well. And that first game is always -- you
never know how the psyche, how they're going to come out. True enough I
thought we came out on our heels.  
  
It was such an uphill battle once we got behind. We got behind by 19, I think.
But with our team it's a game of runs. We just kind of stayed true to who we
were. Had some outstanding performance, guys coming off the bench. And I
thought that was really kind of spur us on. But it didn't. Give them credit. I
thought they played well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have seniors Daryl Macon and Jaylen Barford. Questions for
the players.  
  
Q. I know you guys came back. You talked about unfinished business, and
this obviously wasn't the way you wanted it to end. How tough is this? You had
a great season, but it's not ending the way you wanted it to?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: It was a great season, a good run while it lasts. Butler did
good tonight by making tough shots, getting rebounds, getting key stops. They
just made plays down the stretch that hurt us a lot.  
  
DARYL MACON: Kind of what he said. It was a great season. We got back where we
wanted to be, which was the tournament. Can't thank this man enough right
here. He gave us a chance to show our true talents. That's what we went out
there and did all season. I can't thank him enough.  
  
Q. You guys obviously are both really good 3-point shooter, team shoots
40 percent. But today four out of 18. Was that a tough day for you? Was it
something that Butler was doing? What do you think contributed to that
shooting?  
DARYL MACON: I think it just comes and goes. One of those -- today was one of
those days where it just wasn't falling. And we just didn't adjust to it. It's
nothing they were doing. It was a great team tonight. They made shots, made
tough shots, and we didn't execute on either end of the floor. So these were
the results of it.  
  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I mean, they didn't do nothing specific from shooting. I mean
everybody got good looks on the team. We just weren't knocking down shots and
they were knocking down shots. So they won.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys made a great run, got the lead, I think 29-27, and then they
regained the lead. Is that deal when you come from that far down, it kind of
takes some gas out of your tank; and how big was that you think for Butler
they were able to regain the lead, because they never lost it after that?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought it was big for them. But I think we had some
opportunities where we could come down and execute. I think we came down,
turned it over one time. And one time I think we just came down and hurried
the shot. I always talk when you've got momentum you take it as long as you
can, and we didn't. But credit them, they didn't go away. I think you're
right, it was 29-27, and I don't think we even scored.  
  
I think we ended up scoring 31 right at the end. We scored two free throws
something like that at the end. But they went on a run.  
  
But it does, it takes a lot out of you when you go uphill. I've got to thank
our bench. The guys came off the bench, gave us some great minutes. Darious
Hall, Arlando Cook, Trey Thompson, C.J. Jones, those guys were the catalyst, I
thought, today.  
  
If there was a game ball, it goes to those guys for getting us back in. But it
takes something out of you. And no question about it, especially going down
the stretch.  
  
Q. I know your seniors, especially Daryl and Jaylen, talk about coming
back for unfinished business because they obviously had opportunities to turn
pro somewhere. How disappointing is it that you guys weren't able to go
farther, because obviously they came back to do something?  
COACH ANDERSON: In one sense you say you're disappointed. But just because --
they had an opportunity to actually participate in this tournament. You want
to see them advance and continue to play good basketball. I thought we was
playing good basketball. This game here wasn't, to me, how we were playing. We
just didn't make shots. So I don't think it's a disappointment.  
  
I'm sure they're disappointed right now, where there's a lot of people
disappointed. But they gave themselves an opportunity. I thought these guys
had a fantastic career.  
  
You're talking about two guys that, especially those two guys, 1000-point
scorers in two years, two NCAA Tournaments. All-conference in the SEC. That
doesn't normally happen for guys coming from junior college. You may have one,
but not two. But I think they've evolved as players. They got better and they
impacted this team. They impacted this program.  
  
We're going to miss those guys. And our fans surely can relate to those guys.
I thought those guys were some of the fan favorites. And not only -- but this
team, I think they like the makeup of this team. But like I said, right now
I've got a real disappointed locker room in there, because guys thought they
were a much better basketball team than they put on display today. But give
Butler credit; they were much better today.  
  
Q. I guess only 22 points in the game or in the paint tonight. What did
they do, I guess, to kind of limit Gafford in there and make it so difficult
for you guys?  
COACH ANDERSON: I just thought we weren't in attack mode. I thought there were
times we did attack. I didn't think we finished strong around the basket. I
think they pushed us around a little bit. That's what you get in -- they let
you play. And that's what you get in this tournament. And so I think the
physicality. Not only that, we had some opportunities where we didn't finish
as well. But, again, they made shots. We didn't make shots.  
  
And they beat us 20 on the boards. You get pounded on the boards like that
there -- and obviously they're going to have more defensive rebounds because
we didn't shoot the ball well.  
  
But I thought the killer was when those offensive rebounds or rebounds that we
have on our hands, they come up with them on offense.  
  
And whether they stick back or have an extra opportunity, those are killers
there for you. And we had some of those in this game here. And even go back
to, as I said, when we cut it to six and we had, like, three or four
opportunities to cut the lead and I think turnovers that took place and all of
a sudden they get on the other end, they make a 3. But, again, it just wasn't
our day.  
  
Q. What did you think of Daniel's game overall today?  
COACH ANDERSON: I didn't think Daniel played one of his better games. I
thought his intentions were there. I just didn't think he didn't finish well
around the basket. But I thought he played with his heart. That's all you can
ask.  
  
Q. You got five seniors that have done a lot for the program. How would
you sum up those guys' careers, what they meant to you and the program?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think they've impacted this program in a mighty way. And I
always say that -- it's funny because two of those guys were true seniors,
when you talk about it. When you think about Anton Beard, he's been on three
NCAA teams. Started his freshman year in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Trey Thompson graduated in three years. And those guys have been like the
core, I think the backbone of what has taken place, what has transpired. They
may not be the high major players or the impact players that everybody thinks
about, but they fit in; they played a role and they played a role. And they
were winners.  
  
When you look at Jaylen and Barford and Arlando Cook, as well as Daryl Macon,
they just got here. And you can see the impact. Normally takes junior college
players a year to get it figured out a little bit, but these guys jumped right
in and they became mainstays.  
  
And those guys, they imparted some great, great things on our program. And I
think people recognize we have some talented individuals and we had a really
good basketball team. And I think it just continues to set things up for the
future.  
  
Q. With the rebounding, you guys missed the last shot, you could have
got more offensive boards. Was that frustrating? Because you guys have done
--  
COACH ANDERSON: We've been doing well. We've been really rebounding the
basketball. That's why I say you get to this game here -- that's the thing
about it, you never know how a guy is going to come out.  
  
And we've been really, really good on the glass in most games. But tonight we
just didn't have that energy to come up -- we got our hands on a lot of them;
we just didn't come up with it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with the students from Cal State Fullerton. We have
Arkim Robertson, Jackson Rowe, Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman. Questions.  
  
Q. Anyone who wants to talk about not a lot of NCAA Tournament
experience on this team. This is obviously new for a lot of you. What's been
the most interesting thing about this experience, and how do you guys try to
use, I guess, that to your advantage?  
KYLE ALLMAN JR.: It's pretty interesting. Like you said it's all of our first
time. So just soaking it in right now and just back to business as of right
now and into tomorrow. Just taking it in right now.  
  
Q. Congratulations, I know this is a big deal for the program. Third
time in school history that the Titans have made it to the NCAA Tournament.
When you look back on that, does that make things even more special, or have
you had the time to even let this sink in yet?  
KHALIL AHMAD: It's definitely special. Making history like that, it's been 10
years or whatever it is for the school and ourselves. We're going to remember
this for the rest of our lives pretty much, going to the tournament, and
competing against really high competition that we're going to.  
  
Q. Jackson, obviously you guys were so close last year, a shot away from
making it back to the final, the Big West Tournament final against UC Davis.
You beat them on the way to this tournament this year. Was last year any
motivation in terms of the run you guys made this year?  
JACKSON ROWE: Just knowing that it was UC Davis we were going up against.
Since we lost them last year, this year we had to play them that much harder.  
  
Q. Jackson, your initial thoughts on Purdue?  
JACKSON ROWE: Purdue is a really good team. Obviously they're a 2 seed. If
we're going to come out and play them we can't have a scared mindset. You have
to play them like they're any other team, and just keep in mind it's not going
to be easy. It's going to be a tough battle.  
  
Q. Arkim, what have you seen from Kyle in his game this year, a breakout
year for him? How have you seen him develop throughout the course of the
season?  
ARKIM ROBERTSON: He's being more aggressive. He's taking what the defense
gives him. I think that's been a major part of his game and his success right
now. Like over the last, what, six games, six or five games, he's been playing
like his best basketball. So I think that will give us a spark to beat Purdue.  
  
Q. Kyle, when you look at Purdue offensively, obviously they have the
big guy in the middle, but shooters as well. What kind of challenges does that
present for you defensively?  
KYLE ALLMAN JR.: It's going to make us work harder. We've got to try to stop
the big, but also get back out to the shooters. We have to help each other,
we've got to all be on the same page. So just emphasis on having each other's
back.  
  
Q. Kyle and Khalil, what does it mean to be here after you've gone
through the last couple of years?  
KYLE ALLMAN JR.: It's a stepping stone. We started off pretty much nothing,
but to be able to build the program up the last few years means a lot to the
both of us, actually.  
  
Q. Khalil, you haven't played ranked competition like this since early
in the season against USC and Saint Mary's. How much do you think you guys
have grown as a team to prepare you today and tomorrow?  
KHALIL AHMAD: It's meant a lot, offensively, defensively. We've come together
more because of all the challenges that we've gone through the course of the
season. I feel this is the best time to play them because we're at our best
right now. So we're going to give them our best shot.  
  
Q. Khalil, you mentioned it, but for both of you, Kyle and Khalil,
obviously three games, three wins in three days. Kind of a similar format to
the NCAA Tournament. You lose and you go home. Obviously the Big West being a
one-bid league, now is kind of all that pressure off you guys? Are you guys
just feeling free and like you've got nothing to lose at this point? What's
the mentality right now?  
KHALIL AHMAD: We definitely kind of have the underdog mentality kind of
because no one really expects us to win because we're a 15 seed, but I feel
like that's just motivation for us because we're all really competitive. And
we all feel like if we go out there handle our business we can beat Purdue.  
  
KYLE ALLMAN JR.: If we keep the same mindset that we had in the Big West then
we'll be successful.  
  
Q. To build on that, you've seen, I'm sure, all four of you grew up
watching the NCAA Tournament, and now you get a chance to play in it. You've
seen 15 seeds take down a No. 2 seed before. Does anything kind of run through
your mind saying, hey, we can be the next one?  
KYLE ALLMAN JR.: We all know that upsets happen. We're just trying to be the
next one, like you said, and just play as hard as we can and whatever happens,
happens.  
  
Q. Arkim, thoughts on that as well, just growing up watching the NCAA
Tournament and now getting a chance to play in it?  
ARKIM ROBERTSON: I think we stand a chance. Like the way we've been playing
the last three games coming up to winning the championship, if we stick to
what Coach Taylor gives us to do and we stick to the game plan, we're going to
be okay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll start with coach Dedrique Taylor and an
opening statement.  
  
COACH TAYLOR: Good morning. Hi. It's early for us. It shouldn't be early for
you guys. Obviously really excited to be here. Just had to take a moment there
and just step back as a coach, I guess, and as a mentor, a leader and be
extremely proud of this moment, but more importantly be proud of these guys.  
  
To be on this stage and handle things the way they've handled them and be as
professional as they were and try and answer the questions as best they could,
it tells me that we're heading in the right direction, and I think that's what
we're most proud of. And obviously we're here to do a job and participate in a
game tomorrow. But to be able to enjoy this moment and soak it up and
appreciate what those guys have been through and watch their maturity has been
nothing short of exciting and, again, lets us know we're heading in the right
direction.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously not a lot of NCAA Tournament experience among the players.
This is a new experience for all of them. How do you sort of, I guess, prevent
them from being a little bit in awe of the surroundings? And is that the type
of thing that could work in your advantage once the game starts?  
COACH TAYLOR: I don't know if it's preventible. I think more than anything we
embrace it. We've worked hard for this. This group of guys, in particular,
have bought into what it takes to get here. And so I think we embrace this
moment, allow our butterflies to run their course, allow the anxiety to run
its course.  
  
One thing that we've talked about since the conference tournament is just
trying to keep things simple, keep things as easy as possible and make easy
happen. Attach something that we know we can do to your mind mentally. Focus
on that and then just see what happens at that point. But I don't want these
guys to not enjoy the moment, but I also obviously don't want them to get
overwhelmed. I think the most important thing is to embrace it, accept it and
enjoy it as much as we can.  
  
Q. You've run a pretty strict practice regimen all season. Do you have
any plans changing anything you do going into this game?  
COACH TAYLOR: Not at all. I think that's the most important thing is to stay
to our routine, the things that have gotten us here, we don't want to get away
from them. We don't want to add anything. We just want to be as comfortable as
we can doing what we know we are capable of doing. And their routine is
something that I've asked them to make sure that they're cognizant of -- don't
change it. Just continue to be themselves. And, quite frankly, if we can do
that, we can expect good things to happen.  
  
Q. Are there any 7-footers in your conference? And how do you plan to
deal with the fact they've got a 7'2 " guy and a 7'3" guy?  
COACH TAYLOR: Yeah, you know that's interesting. We don't have any 7-footers.
Actually we do; UC Irvine has one, they had a couple, three to five last year
and the years previous. So we have a little bit of experience.  
  
But I think our preseason schedule kind of prepared us for this. We played a
very good Saint Mary's team. Played a very good USC team. Both of those teams
had size. They had athleticism. So they did a good job of preparing for us.  
  
And again, like Kyle mentioned, we still have to stick to our guns and our
defensive concepts and our principles and see if they're good enough.
Obviously Purdue is an extremely good ball club. Watching them on film and
watching them statistically, I'm trying to figure out if they're not an NBA
team the way they shoot the basketball.  
  
And they have the best of both worlds in terms of their inside presence, and
then they shoot the ball extremely well from the perimeter. We'll have our
work cut out for us.  
  
But, again, we can only control what we can control, and those are our
defensive concepts and we're going to do that to the best of our ability and
see what happens at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, congratulations on making it this far. Obviously
as mentioned before the guys don't have a lot of NCAA Tournament experience.
They do have that Big West experience, which is a similar format. You as a
coach have been to the NCAA Tournament with Arizona State. Have you used any
of those experiences and talked about those experiences with the guys?  
COACH TAYLOR: I haven't really talked about them with the guys, just because
these guys, they're different. They're different. I'll save that for another
day. But for me personally, yes, I have in terms of just organizing our staff,
trying to get ready for the trip. Trying to explain to these guys, our staff
in particular, what's coming next once the field is announced, what needs to
happen, and again just trying to stay organized and control what we can
control and get ready to get out here.  
  
Obviously it's an early start. It was a long travel day but nonetheless we're
here. The guy outside asked me if it was a little cold. I said, yeah, but you
know what? We're here. We're going to do what we can to stay here. So
California, they'll be there when we get there. We're going to enjoy this
moment and embrace the cold, because I'll tell you what, this is bone-chilling
cold to me.  
  
Q. Obviously I know it's never about you. But for you, have you had a
chance to reflect on how far you as a coach, as a person have come to lead
this program from really, quite frankly, nothing into what it is now?  
COACH TAYLOR: Not really. Not really. I try to stay focused on our players,
our staff, their families, and just try to make sure that everybody else
enjoys this moment. At some point I will probably step back and realize what's
been accomplished.  
  
But I think the most important thing about the whole scenario with Cal State
Fullerton is it's not about me, it's about us. And the more we can preach
that, the more we can understand that it's about a selfless nature, not
selfish. I've said that from the first day that I took this job, is if we can
be a selfless group, then we can expect good things to happen.  
  
Again it's validating to be able to sit here and realize that the last three
games that we played we had more assists than turnovers. And to me that's the
epitome of selfless. To me, that's the epitome of playing for a teammate. And
quite frankly that's what life is about in my opinion. If you look out for the
other guys eventually you'll get taken care of.  
  
And for me, I've had a couple of moments where I've been in awe, like, wow,
this really happened. This is what we thought we could do. But it hasn't
really hit me yet. It hasn't really set in yet. And hopefully that doesn't
happen until who knows when. I just want to enjoy this moment with our guys
and make sure that they appreciate it and understand it and most significantly
enjoy it.  
  
Q. Just the matchup with Kyle and Dakota Mathias, the All-Big Ten
defensive player. How do you see that shake out and what have you liked
offensively from Kyle this year?  
COACH TAYLOR: The thing I've liked from Kyle is just his control, his pace. I
think what he's done is he's really, really sharpened his skill set. But most
importantly not only has he sharpened his skill set, but his mind and
understanding of the pace.  
  
Slow to fast for him has been extremely important and he's really, really
bought into that. He's aggressive. When he's aggressive he's productive for
not only himself but for the rest of our team. So we've been able to rely on
him and create space for him to play and create for his self and again his
teammates.  
  
And that's been the most fascinating thing in my opinion with Kyle Allman Jr.,
is just to watch him grow physically, but more significantly mentally to be
able to engage and understand how to play the game with his pace and his
rhythm.  
  
Q. After watching video, what sorts of challenges does Carsen Edwards
pose for your team?  
COACH TAYLOR: I think the term Goliath comes to mind in terms of us being able
to deal with that size. And again with a guy like Carsen, his speed, his size
-- I mean, he's small in stature, but he's as physical of a guard as we've
probably faced all year. And so we've got to be ready for that.  
  
But again there's only so much that we can do. And if we can just rely on what
we've done up to this point, I think we'll give ourselves a good chance to at
least contain him -- not stop him, but contain him. He definitely presents a
challenge for us and is going to put a lot of pressure on our defense. But
we're going to rely on what we've done up to this point and see what happens.  
  
Q. Kyle was 3,000 miles away from Fullerton. Talk a little bit about
that recruiting process. How did you find him? How did you recruit him? What
was your sales pitch, all of that?  
COACH TAYLOR: Actually, a relatively unique recruiting experience. There's a
gentleman out of New York by the name of Tippy who is friends with myself and
John Smith, our associate head coach, and our staff. And he's been responsible
for a lot of players out of the New York area coming west.  
  
And he sent us a YouTube of Kyle. And John and I were sitting in the gym, I
don't remember where we were, I think San Diego, we were sitting in the gym
watching another kid play, and John shows me the YouTube video. And I'm, like,
really? Is he messing around with us? Is he serious? I said let's go outside
let's call him.  
  
We go outside and we call Tippy and he starts to tell us and gives a little
bit of a run down of who Kyle Allman is. And we get on the phone with him and
fortunately his dad and mom, they brought him out on an unofficial visit,
unofficial visit. We got the MVP of the Big West Conference tournament off of
an unofficial visit. Just think about that. All the recruiting that goes on
and all the money that's spent. We got one of our better players off of an
unofficial visit.  
  
But nonetheless he came out with his parents and immediately his energy and
his personality jumped off the page to you. And within 24 hours of meeting him
and sitting down and talking to him and understanding that the type of
character that that young man had and how important it was to our culture, how
important it was to what we thought could produce a winning culture, we
offered him a scholarship and within 48 hours he decided to commit.  
  
And that was literally how that whole scenario went down. I mean, we spent
countless hours chasing guys all over the world, and not gotten them. And we
get this young man on an unofficial visit based off a YouTube video. So that
just goes to prove that recruiting, it's an anomaly, it's never the same. It's
always something different.  
  
But in the same token, if you are in search of high-character young men and
good people, the relationships that we've built over the years, they produced
that opportunity for us both. I mean, it's unique for Kyle to come, but it's
also unique for him to be a part of what we're trying to do.  
  
And obviously Southern California is what it is. It's one of the best places
in the world. And I can say that because I live, I grew up 35 minutes from
where I work. And so for me it's, I'll say it again, it's one of the best
places in the world. It's hard to beat, especially from a recruiting
standpoint. When you say Los Angeles, immediately you have everyone's
attention. And so we use that to our advantage.  
  
And Kyle wanted to get out of the snow and experience Newport Beach and some
of the other areas that we have access to within 25 minutes. So it's a
phenomenal story. It's a unique story, but, quite, frankly I think that's what
college athletics is all about -- giving a student-athlete an opportunity
outside of their immediate world, to come experience something different,
something unique across the country.  
  
And we have young men on our team from all over the world, quite frankly. So
it's a phenomenal experience to be a part of their success.  
  
Q. You go back and look at way back in December or excuse me November,
the Wooden Legacy Tournament to the conference tournament, not only the teams
you were able to beat in those two tournaments, only one loss in those two
tournaments combined. But the format of those tournaments, do they kind of
prepare you to what you're going to be doing in this bigger tournament?  
COACH TAYLOR: Sure. They do. Everything we try to do in the preseason is in an
effort to bring us to this point, in particular, the Big West Tournament. The
preseason, playing in the Wooden Legacy, that was a phenomenal experience for
our guys because they got a little bit of this feel. The only difference was
we were in Southern California. It wasn't 27 degrees when we got off the bus
or off the plane.  
  
But just to be able to understand the process of how you have to prepare and
once you play the game you immediately have to turn the page and get rid of
the emotions and get ready to prepare for the next team. Because they're
coming. And so the same thing is true for the Big West Tournament and the same
thing is true for this opportunity that we have here.  
  
Everything that we've done up to this point, you hope it prepares you for this
moment. And I think this group, they understand most significantly how
important it is to be locked in, how important it is to keep our routine as
far as preparation is concerned. And so I think they've done a good job up to
this point, but we'll see the real test is tomorrow at 12:40.  
  
Q. From Kyle going from an under-recruited kid out of high school to
where he is now, what have you seen from his journey kind of evolving into the
player he is now?  
COACH TAYLOR: I've seen -- everybody talks about hard work. But I think he's
the epitome of hard work. Not only is he the epitome, it goes back to the
selfless mindset that we've talked about earlier today, is just not only was
Kyle in the gym but his work and his activity promoted other guys on our team
to join him in the gym, to join him getting shots up at night and join him in
getting shots up in the morning and just working on his game and working on
his craft.  
  
And so now in our gym, you can walk through there and at any point in the day
you'll see one or two guys or three guys in there working on their craft. And
I think that's all a direct result of what Kyle has gone through and his
impact on our program. Khalil Ahmad is the same way. Jackson Rowe is the same
way. He has his own time and regimen. The dude is in there 7.00 a.m. every
single morning.  
  
I've asked him, I've begged him, pleaded, Jackson, please don't shoot this
week because I can see it wearing on his legs. But that's his routine. And so
it's hard to discourage a guy from working. I think it's a huge part of our
program now is just the pillar of guys working on their craft individually,
but not only working on it, but seeing the result of it and the impact of
their activity at the end of the year.  
  
Q. Throughout conference play you guys talked about having a target on
your back after that 4-0 start, that teams were going to come get you. Now
that you're the underdog do you feel it changes the mindset and preparation
going into it knowing that you aren't the favorite?  
COACH TAYLOR: I don't think so. It's weird. I'm a little bit funny that way in
terms of always feel like -- we're Cal State Fullerton. And we're always the
underdog. Even when we're picked, I still feel like we're the underdog because
not really am people expect us to do anything.  
  
And so to be on this stage, I just want to encourage our group of guys to just
continue doing what you've done. And the underdog, overdog, whatever that
analogy is, I don't really buy into it. I don't really care. I just want our
group of guys to go out and play as hard as they can and compete and do it
together. That's what's important.  
  
And at the end of that, whether you win or lose, you can be proud of the fact
that you gave everything you had. If it's enough, then you'll win. If it's
not, then you gave everything you had and you probably got beat by a better
team. And quite frankly, once again, that's life and that's what we're trying
to do is teach life lessons through the sport of basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a great season so far. And good luck
tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Vincent Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32308)

### [Isaac Haas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27912)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue student-athletes Isaac Haas and Vincent
Edwards and Coach Painter.  
  
Q. How did you spend your past eight or nine days without playing? And I
know you haven't played yet, but do you feel refreshed and was it a benefit do
you think at this point?  
ISAAC HAAS: I think we feel refreshed. Did a little light shooting getting up
and down the floor a little bit. Nothing too serious, just letting our legs
get back under us, letting our bodies get rejuvenated, doing the things we
need to do, getting treatment, things like that.  
  
So I feel like everybody's on the right track. Our minds are fresh, our bodies
are fresh. So we're ready to go into the tournament with a sound body.  
  
Q. I think the Big Ten schedule was rough on a lot of people, nonstop
the way it went through February. Did you feel you needed that chance to kind
of regroup and get healthy again?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I mean, yeah, I think it was good for us not just physically
but mentally as well to get them all out of the way and being able to have
this week that we've had to kind of rest. It's the first for us, but we do
some nagging injuries that some of us had, and little things like that allowed
us to get back in and correct some mistakes that we made throughout the
tournament and also get our bodies ready.  
  
Q. Vince, how are you physically now, and do you have some of that old
explosiveness back after these two weeks?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: For sure. It helps to have had that week off, definitely been
doing a lot more treatment with our guy Chad, the trainer. And it's been great
to actually be able to see some of that explosiveness come back. The last
couple of practices have been really good. So been moving a lot better.  
  
Q. You were in a position to be ranked in the top 10 all year. You
didn't have a conference championship regular season or tournament to show for
it. How much of a motivation is that now to prove yourself going forward?  
ISAAC HAAS: I think it's a big motivation. Obviously disappointing to not win
your conference or your tourney. But I felt we played really well throughout
the majority of the season. But we had a few bad stretches, but it's just a
matter of learning and improving.  
  
I think going into this tournament we're going to have to really get used to
each other on the court again and -- because we haven't played in a while. But
at the same time we've been going hard in practice recently and so I'm sure
that we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Vince, Grady Eifert could you talk about his development from the
time he joined the program to today and how he's helped you improve, because I
would assume you go against him every day in practice?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Oh yeah, Grady has been great. First of all, he should be
playing tight end for Purdue, not a power forward. But Grady has been good for
us. Always came in with the work ethic. He works hard, never complained and
just goes hard. I mean, everything he's gotten, with me being hurt and him
starting, I think he deserved that for how hard he's played and just his
approach to everyday life in practice.  
  
He's always coming in ready, he's not complaining, not doing anything of that
nature, just comes ready to work. So going against him every day has
definitely pushed me, being physical and all those sorts of things. So gotta
give him a lot of credit for that.  
  
Q. For both of you, with the condensed schedule you played in the Big
Ten, could that be an advantage if things go well and you hopefully have a
series of one-day turnarounds? The first part of the question. And what was
the most fun or non-basketball thing you did during the break that maybe you
didn't get a chance to if you didn't have so much time off?  
ISAAC HAAS: I think, yeah, it is an advantage at some point. When you're going
throughout the conference season, it kind of gets daunting on you, you have so
many games in a row and you start so early. But at the same time when you get
into this latter part, you realize this actually is going to help you get back
on the right track in terms of your body and your mind, because it wears down
on you throughout the season.  
  
But I would say personally the most fun thing for us was the Dave & Busters
trip we had as a team. We all went to Indy and we all just played the games
and stuff and just ate dinner. And it was a really fun time.  
  
Q. Obviously for Fullerton one of the things they do really well is they
shoot a ton of free throws. How important is it for you guys to stay out of
foul trouble?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: That's going to be huge after watching film with them and
seeing how they really get into putting their players into position to score a
lot of isos and ball screen, things of that nature. They do a good job of
going to get their own baskets at the same time.  
  
So just have to do a good job of staying down, keeping our hands out, making
them score over the length. Can't worry about how the game is going to be
officiated. We've just got to go out there and play.  
  
Q. Vince, the Big Ten has been disregarded for a lot of years as just a
top-heavy conference, four teams in the tournament. What does that mean to
you? And how important is it for all the teams in this conference to win this
week?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: It always happens, like you said, it's always been
disregarded or top-heavy. And somehow we always end up with at least a team or
two somewhere in the Elite Eight or Sweet 16. It speaks for itself in that
nature. We're always being overlooked and I don't really understand why.  
  
But I mean it is what it is. Everybody in the country, whoever does their
conferences thinks their conference is the best conference, and of course
we're going to think we're the best conference regardless. But we're just
going to come out and every Big Ten team is going to try to represent and play
their hardest.  
  
ISAAC HAAS: Just to piggyback off what he said, there's a lot of really good
teams everywhere. I felt like Nebraska and Penn State played really well
towards the end of the season, and I felt like they deserved it as well. But
obviously the committee didn't think so.  
  
That's how the Big Ten is, that's a tough conference, no matter how you look
at it. All the teams that are at the bottom, even Rutgers, those guys play
hard. They really give a lot of credit to our conference as a whole. And it
just makes it tough towards the latter part of the season for the decision
makers like the NCAA to choose who gets in or who doesn't.  
  
Q. Watching the tournament over the year and experiencing the
tournament, when a 2, 3 or 4 seed struggles with the lower seeded team in the
first round, why do you think -- what do you think the reason is usually? Is
it looking past them or is it maybe the teams are more even than we think?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I think it's really because sometimes that 2, 3, 4 seed is
not as happy to be there as that 15 or 16 seed. Because they earned their way
there. Coach Painter preaches everybody earned their way there, so why can't
we just be as excited. There's no guarantee you're going to be in the NCAA
Tournament. If you know you're a team that's going to make it, why can't you
be excited even if you're a 2, 3, 4, or even a 1 seed?  
  
I think that's what it is in a lot of the cases, I think that team is just
more excited to be here.  
  
Q. Compared to a lot of the teams in this tournament, you guys are
experienced or really old. What kind of advantage does that give you having
gone through it and losing games in the past as a less experienced team?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: We have to let that show, the experience part of it and us
having four seniors that start, which you don't see normally in today's game.
We've just got to let that show. We've got to stay together and play together.
I think that's our biggest thing. We can't really get worried about what's
going on.  
  
We've been through adversity. We've been through any type of situation that
you can just about think of, besides, of course, getting to an Elite Eight or
a Final Four. So when it comes to us and having that experience, we've got to
stick together, stay together and we just gotta know what to do in certain
situations.  
  
Q. Do you think the Big Ten was undervalued in terms of the seeding? And
do you root for the other Big Ten teams obviously when they're not playing
you? Potentially you could all meet somewhere down the line with a lot on the
line. So your thoughts on that?  
ISAAC HAAS: Yeah, I root for the other Big Ten teams. I think it speaks a lot
about our conference when they do well. You know you played against those
guys, you make friends with some of those guys, so you want them to do well as
a coinciding event. I mean that's just my opinion.  
  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I would say the same. Like I said, make some friends with
some of the guys on other teams. You go to Big Ten media day, you meet with a
lot of guys, you sit there and you talk just like any conference does at the
beginning of the year. So you want to root for each other, you gotta stick
together at some point. Then when you meet down the road it's about bragging
rights. That's the most fun part of it.  
  
Q. You talked about being happy to be here, the lower seeds are. And
obviously you guys have much bigger goals than just getting to the NCAA
Tournament. How do you balance focusing on this one game with looking ahead
where you want to go?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: That's the story of it. It's always going to be that way. You
preach it in the season. You preach it before the game. You can't look past
what other opponent whether you and that opponent you're going to play later
in the season, you're going to be neck and neck. But you're worrying about
what they're doing; why can't you just worry about yourself and what you need
to take care of?  
  
I think that's our main focus, well, we've got to have -- we have to worry
about what is in front of us and what we can control. We can't control who
else loses. This tournament will go from 64 to 32 or closer to 16, going into
the next weekend. But we have to take care of our opponents first.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll start with an opening statement from Coach
Painter and then open the floor to questions.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Really excited to be here. I know our guys are really looking
forward to it, being able to play in Detroit. We've worked really hard to get
to this point and very grateful to get a 2 seed. Obviously we've earned our
way into the tournament like everybody else and had a lot of experiences with
this group in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We've had a lot of highs, a lot of lows. So just trying to dig into Cal State
Fullerton and be prepared for them. I think that's the most important thing,
just to keep your focus on your next opponent and go out there and not beat
yourself.  
  
I think a lot of times you lock into your opponent but the most important team
is your team. And so not beating yourself, taking care of the basketball,
executing on the offensive end and being stingy defensively are so important.
Like I said earlier, just really looking forward to this opportunity of
competing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Three and a half, four, four and a half hours away, something like
that, give or take. Is that an advantage as opposed to having to get on a
plane and fly and travel long distance?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't think so. I don't think it's a disadvantage either. I
think it's just one of those things when you have a lot of experiences with
your team, whether you're flying on a bus or playing internationally or
whatever -- by the time you've become who you are at the end of the year,
there's a lot of experiences that go into it, especially with this group right
here and what we've been able to do, really kind of starting our journey in
June, preparing for international play and then getting ourselves ready for
this season.  
  
Q. What impresses you the most about Cal State Fullerton, and also
what's it been like handling that interim between the Big Ten Tournament and
now? It's kind of a great unknown as far as how that's going to affect your
team. What did you do to handle that?  
COACH PAINTER: I think the thing that impresses me the most about Cal State
Fullerton is obviously their ability to play the three days in a row in tight
games. Really the last game got away from their opponent the most. The other
games were very, very close. And they were very different type of games.  
  
UC Davis game in the 50s. Their first game against Long Beach State was in the
70s. And then at the end they push out the championship game, being able to
win. They have good guard play. They can break you down. They can make plays
for their teammates.  
  
They can make plays for themselves. They're stingy on defense. They do a good
job of down and ball screens and just kind of getting into the basketball. But
they have two really good guards. I think Rowe gives them that third score.  
  
I think a lot of times when you get at that mid level you get a couple guards.
But do you have that center or combo forward that can really help with that? I
think he gives them that third scorer and makes it really difficult for teams
to just lock in on those two guards.  
  
Q. And the Big Ten?  
COACH PAINTER: I've only answered it 500 times. So I don't think it's that big
of a deal. We took a couple days off. We practiced a couple days. You want to
have your team on edge but you also don't want to go full bore and then
somebody gets hurt.  
  
The last thing you want to do is come in here and be shorthanded. You want to
have all your guys healthy and be ready. So we took off three total days.
Another day we had just a walk-through and so the other days we practiced for
about an hour, hour 15 minutes.  
  
Q. We talked about this in New York, but just talk about Vincent Edwards
and how much did that two weeks, do you think, help him maybe in recovery?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it's going to help him a lot. He sprained his ankle a
month ago. This isn't something that happened last week for him now. He's been
able to play four games. He's been able to practice. He's been able to take
days off, get a lot of treatment. So we're expecting big things from him.  
  
Q. Isaac talked about a team trip to Dave & Busters, whose idea was
that, and did you participate in that?  
COACH PAINTER: It was not my idea and I did not participate. I did not go with
them. I don't know whose idea it was, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. You have seniors and some of the other prominent teams have really
gone a long way with seniors this year. When you recruit a player, what's it
like to hit that sweet spot between a guy who might not be good enough to go
to the pros but might be able to help you for four years, how tricky a process
is it to identify a player like that?  
COACH PAINTER: You don't know, it's all guesswork. They all have that dream of
wanting to play. Normally when you get a guy that stays four years, we've been
able to do it and develop guys in four years and make the NBA and play.  
  
So I think that ultimately is the best thing because you know you get your
degree and you go to the NBA. So you have that to fall back on. That's what
it's all about. But you're reading into a lot of things. You're trying to help
them. You're trying to develop them, trying to get them better.  
  
But when they're 15, 16, 17 years old, there's a lot of uncertainty. You just
don't know. Obviously somebody like Isaac, who has massive physical skills,
other guys have to develop because they're like everybody else, they're 6'4",
6'6", 6'7" in that world and you have to be versatile, have to be able to have
guard skills.  
  
The game now, if you're versatile and you can guard a lot of different
positions and play a lot of different positions, you know, it really helps
you. But we really tried to search out outside of our size. We've had great
size but the guys that haven't played the post for us, just trying to get guys
that can dribble, pass and shoot that are competitive, that are about winning,
I think sometimes that gets lost in recruiting.  
  
We all get judged, whether you're a player, you're a coach, even
administrators, you get judged on winning, do your programs win? And that's so
important.  
  
Q. This has been an odd nine months for you because of the international
trip. And that international trip was different than most international trips
because of the intensity and representing your country and all that. Where is
your team mentally, and did you manage this nine months differently to make
sure your guys are fresh on March 15th and not just worn down?  
COACH PAINTER: Right. We did manage it differently. We didn't do any
conditioning in the fall when we got back from our trip. We missed the first
week of school and so when we got back from that we had about a month, whereas
10 years ago you would have had about six weeks starting on October 15th.  
  
Now you start at the end of September. So we did some individual workouts. We
did things, obviously, in the weight room. But we didn't do any conditioning.
I would say as it goes on, our practices haven't been as long. We've taken a
couple extra days off here and there.  
  
But for the most part I think it's being smart no matter if you go on that
trip or not. I think people always say things can get long. And I understand
that in theory. But in reality, if we didn't go on that trip, we still would
be playing basketball somewhere. We'd still be working on our game. We'd still
be doing things.  
  
I think the travel sometimes, for young guys that aren't used to it, I think
that can kind of wear on them a little bit. But I don't think in the long run,
if you're a basketball player and you worked really hard, now you've got to
this point, it's pretty exciting; you're going go out there and lay it on the
line.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DETROIT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DETROIT)

### [Tyler Wideman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30738)

### [Kamar Baldwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33252)

  
_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Butler players, Tyler Wideman, Kelan Martin
and Kamar Baldwin. We'll open the floor to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Arkansas likes to trap. They like to do a lot of things, speed you
up. How do you go about dealing with that, and what sorts of experiences have
you had throughout the season that will help you deal with the pressure?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: I would say first thing is obviously taking care of the ball in
the game. But just attacking, when we do get out of those traps, just handling
it. And the experience we had, I would say, a little bit of Villanova in the
Big East Tournament game, they kind of played a little of the same way --
aggressive, denying. But I think that prepared us well for this game coming
up.  
  
Q. Last year Arkansas played Carolina. If they had won that game they
would have played you guys in Memphis. When you were watching the
Carolina/Arkansas tape getting ready for last year's game, did you guys notice
anything about Arkansas? Did you get a sense for what a tough loss that was,
because they've kind of talked about that being a driving force for them all
year?  
KELAN MARTIN: Yeah, I just noticed that they played hard and they were tough.
They never gave up. And they got a lot of guys with experience. I mean if we
would have played them it would have been a great experience just to see that
pressure that they have defensively.  
  
Q. You guys lost your entire coaching staff pretty much overnight in
June. And for Tyler and Kelan, I was wondering when that happened what was
your first reaction? And what about your new coaching staff let you guys not
miss a beat this season?  
TYLER WIDEMAN: I think it was, when it happened, we were surprised but then we
understood why it happened. And I think being here all four years, I mean
we've been through, I think, three or four coaches, however many it is. So it
wasn't something that we didn't already go through. So we knew we still had
our teammates to count on to be there regardless of who the coach was, the
program was still going to run the same way.  
  
Q. Tyler, as a senior leader, then, with the coaching staff coming in,
what did you have to do to keep the younger guys on pace?  
TYLER WIDEMAN: I mean, myself and the other older guys on the team that have
already been there, we just had to show them the way that Butler was ran for
the most part as far as academics and athletics. I mean everybody in the
program does a good job making sure everything stays consistent from the AD
down to the academic advisor. Everybody does a good job keeping everybody in
line.  
  
Q. How is your coach different from other coaches you had? How would you
describe his coaching style?  
TYLER WIDEMAN: I would say he's probably the youngest coach I've had. So, I
mean, he's a player's coach. He understands stuff that's going on and our
generation for the most part. So he's a player's coach. He's easy to talk to.
So I like the coaching staff that we have.  
  
Q. Kelan and Kamar, on drivers with Gafford, he comes from the weak
side. He's long. Much like Texas, St. John's, Georgetown, some other teams
that you guys have had to drive the ball against, what problems does he
present with his length and his ability to come off that weak side and block
shots?  
KELAN MARTIN: He averages like two and a half to three blocks a game. We just
have to get in there and draw shot fakes. And if we just put it up, I mean, we
crash the offensive glass. That's a strength of ours. He's a good player, he's
a good defender, so he can protect the rim very well.  
  
Q. Kamar, for anybody who doesn't understand what kind of team Butler
is, how would you describe from your perspective your basketball team and what
you guys are made of?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: I would say we're a group of tough guys that like to get the
job done. No matter how we do it, we're going to get it done. Like our motto,
we're gritty, not pretty. So we're ready to fight and ready to work hard.  
  
KELAN MARTIN: I agree with that. We get after it defensively, and we have a
lot of guys that bring different intangibles to the team. And we just go out
and play hard. And we surprise a lot of people.  
  
Q. Kelan and Tyler about Gafford, obviously he's a good defensive
player, but what do you think of his offense? He's been making strides pretty
good. And he's a guy that's gotten in foul trouble. Do you feel like that that
would be a big part if you guys can get him in foul trouble?  
KELAN MARTIN: To be honest, I never really watched him offensively. I never
heard of him until we scouted him. But that's our goal, just to attack, attack
the paint and just try to get easy scores offensively.  
  
Q. Kamar, Jorgensen, what does he bring as far as helping out the
supporting cast?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: He's a great guy. New York, he'll bring a source of energy for
us. New York, he's just -- he just wants to play, play hard, you know, come
off scoring, defense, whatever the team needs. That's what he's going to do
for us. He's been great to have this season.  
  
Q. Kelan and Kamar, how familiar were you guys with Arkansas? You kind
of touched on it a second ago, but how familiar were you with them before you
got the draw in the tournament?  
KELAN MARTIN: I actually watched them play against Tennessee in the SEC
Tournament. And I've seen that they played hard. They were physical. They like
to get up and down the court. And they just look like a great team. They play
together. They've got a lot of older guys. That's all I've really seen.  
  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Same thing he said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue with Butler and head coach, in his
first year, LaVall Jordan. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH JORDAN: It's exciting to be, obviously, a part of the NCAA Tournament.
We're very proud of our group for earning this opportunity. And it's been, I
think, a unique experience just to be back at Butler, my alma mater, and lead
this team and this program.  
  
So I'm proud of our seniors for their leadership to get us to this point. I
think they've grown a ton. Our entire team has grown and learned a ton in our
season, along the journey. And so it all culminates here. This is where you
want to be at the end of it.  
  
So we're looking forward to the opportunity. We've had a couple of good days,
I think, of preparation. We'll finalize some things today and try to compete
with our greatest energy tomorrow when it matters.  
  
Q. You've been in the tournament as a player, as an assistant, and now
in a new role as the head coach. What's different about taking a program to
the tournament as far as just being part of a program?  
COACH JORDAN: I don't know if it's different. I think at each role that you're
playing, obviously, when you're a player, it's what you dream of, getting to
the NCAA Tournament, competing for a national title. But I think the same
thing when you decide, when I decided to become an assistant coach and now
being a head coach, that is definitely the end in mind.  
  
And I think just trying to -- you lose some control as a coach. You can't make
a shot. You can't make a play. You can't guard anybody. And so you're trying
to just make sure our team is as prepared as possible. And our staff does a
great job. Our assistant coaches have been phenomenal since Selection Sunday
up until today. And so you just try and make sure that they know what to
expect so they can play with free minds and great energy.  
  
Q. The Butler job came open in mid-June, which is definitely later than
normal. How surprised were you when it came up and how did you build trust
with your new staff to keep it a Butler team?  
COACH JORDAN: I think June is a unique time for turnover in this profession.
And so that was definitely a surprise. I was here last year in Detroit with
our Milwaukee team and we fell just a little bit short of being at this point.  
  
But after everything happens obviously we're excited. My family was excited to
come back to Indianapolis and this opportunity. And fortunately the timing
worked out because we had a foreign tour, a foreign trip with our team to
Spain. And that allowed us to really get to know them. We had 10 practices
leading up to the trip. And we had a couple -- a 10-day trip. So there was
ample amount of time to get to know guys one-on-one, listen to hear them talk
and hear their stories and backgrounds, what led them to choose Butler and
their goals and things like that.  
  
So that was really important, I thought, for our staff. It just felt like the
right time. You got to spend time getting to know the players.  
  
Q. You guys struggled at the end of the regular season. Do you think
your team took something out of that experience or did they grow from that
experience?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I've been proud of this group throughout this entire
journey for their mindset. And it's been a growth mindset. I think there's a
humility about them, where they want to learn. They don't think they know it
all. So it's allowed us, from day one, to just teach. And that's been the most
fun part has just been teaching and there's been questions along the way.  
  
Obviously some things we're doing are new. A lot of things we're doing are
kind of Butler standard principles. And so toward the end of the year their
mindset was the same. We lost a couple that hurt to lose. It always hurts to
lose, but they came into practice the very next day just wanting to learn from
that loss and be better the next time out.  
  
Q. Wonder what your take was on Daniel Gafford after watching him and
the way he runs the floor for a big guy and just the things he can do on both
ends? His wing span is 7'3 " or something like that.  
COACH JORDAN: He's a tremendous talent. You watch him on film and he looks
like one of those guys, some guys you can't really judge on the video, when
you see him in person they look like they're 12 feet tall. But he's one of
those guys that for his size and his length he's so mobile. He affects the
game without scoring points. He really affects the game at the rim. So he
makes it tough to go down there and get easy baskets because of his shot-
blocking ability.  
  
And on the other end he's around the rim for them offensively with tip-ins and
lobs and I can't even remember -- he's got more dunks than our whole team by
himself.  
  
And so it's a challenge. We've seen a few guys like him with Mo Bamba and
Jessie Govan in our league, guys with great length. It's not the first guy
we've seen like that. But he's an unbelievable talent.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask you about your time at Michigan. How did Beilein make
you a better coach?  
COACH JORDAN: In a multitude of ways. I think by the time I became an
assistant at Michigan, I had been an assistant for a few years there, five
years. And so Coach was, always having been a head coach is extremely unique.
So just being underneath him and learning how to run a program.  
  
Obviously teaching the game is one thing. But I feel like I had great mentors
and our coaches at Butler that I coached -- played under and then coached
under, in terms of basketball itself. But he's never been an assistant.  
  
And so all the decisions that you have to make, the presence that you have to
have, the constant messaging that you have to do, handling all the other
things outside of the team was something that, I think, he's a tremendous CEO,
outside of a brilliant basketball mind.  
  
So, on top of the management piece, it was learning the concepts with offense
and spacing and some of those things as well. But I think my biggest takeaway
was running the program. I was able to ask questions and go into his office
and have conversations about that. And he's still a tremendous help in that
area.  
  
Q. I'm wondering what you learned when you were an assistant at Butler.
Just seems like Butler turns out such great coaches. And I'm wondering what it
is about when you're playing there or you're an assistant there early in your
career that you learned that eventually helps you become a head coach some
day?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I think the thing as a player, there was such a belief and
a buy-in to the way we did things and we just fully believed it and committed
to it. And it was not overcomplicated. Simple is not easy. So doing it every
day and there's a commitment level.  
  
And then how to teach the game. I think Coach Collier, Coach Matta, Coach
Lickliter and the staff and the coaches I was underneath were tremendous
teachers. I as a player absorbed as much as I could possibly take in. And then
as an assistant just asking questions about how to do that well because you
want to make sure that you're clear when you're teaching these guys, what you
want from them.  
  
And so that was probably the biggest takeaway of being able to teach with
simplicity and so that they could go out there and execute.  
  
Q. You guys were 18-1 when you outshoot your opponents. How confident do
you feel your team will be able to scrap and claw given the fact that
sometimes in the first round those nerves are really in full effect? How do
you think you guys have evolved in that way?  
COACH JORDAN: I'm trying to figure out the 1. That's what I'm trying to figure
out. No, I think, you know, what this team has shown is a resiliency, whether
we're making or missing shots. And that's something that's, I think, a
character piece to that in terms of who our guys are.  
  
We've been down and we fought back and so we've had those moments to grow
from, learn from. Obviously if we're making shots, everything's going right.
Everybody can operate during those times.  
  
But I think one of the things I'm proud of with this group is it hasn't gone
our way a lot. And we've had to fight our way back and claw our way back and
still figure out a way to get it done.  
  
So should that be the case, I feel like we had that in us. Obviously I'd love
to come out and make every shot and win by 40. But Arkansas is really good,
and I don't think that's going to be the game.  
  
Q. Mike Anderson has talked about you guys having a visit at the PK80.
Wondering if you could relay what was that like, what that conversation was?
And did you pick anything up in that conversation that might help you in this
matchup?  
COACH JORDAN: No. You know, Coach -- I think I've got a tremendous amount of
respect for Coach Anderson. I was an assistant coach; we played him when I was
at Michigan. And then we were out in Portland.  
  
It was -- our conversation was more about team management, just kids these
days, and trying to relate to them and get messages across to them. He's had
that experience for much longer than I have, and just picking his brain on how
he communicates with his staff and his team, not as much about what they're
doing on the full-court press. I wish I would have asked him those questions.  
  
Q. You guys have taken pretty good care of the ball. Arkansas obviously,
they try to turn people over a lot. How do you think you guys will handle
that? What do you think of their defense? And also do you know if your dad's
going to be able to make the game. I heard you talking a lot about that.  
COACH JORDAN: Unfortunately he's an athletic director for a high school in
Michigan. They have a conference. So he won't be able to be there on Friday.
So he's putting some pressure on me to make it back on Sunday. But I think the
first thing that you look at when you're facing Arkansas and Coach Anderson's
teams in general is their pressure. And you have to be able to handle that.  
  
And we've seen a few teams that have pressed us and we've done a fairly decent
job with that. But we take a lot of pride in taking care of the ball. And so I
think that will be a battle of wills. Obviously we have to have a plan to
break the pressure and take that. I think we've worked on that the past few
days.  
  
But when you get out there, sometimes you can't simulate the quickness and the
length in practice that you're going to see in the game. So we'll have to
respond in the moment. But I believe that's a big part of the game.  
  
Q. We've talked about this, but I'm wondering if you can elaborate on
how -- even when you're coaching other places -- how you stay connected with
like the Butler community and your teammates and the coaches, and you can
bring that kind of culture to places you go, and then so when you come back
you know exactly what you need to do?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I think that's, the Butler family, is truly that. It's one
of the unique places in the country in that regard, from the university
president on down to the athletic director to all of our coaches and all of
our student-athletes. So it makes it for a great college experience. I mean, I
loved my time there as a player for as much as the winning and things that we
accomplished, but the way that you felt supported.  
  
And I think that is what you're excited to come back to and you never really
get away from. I've got a number of former players texting me with
suggestions. I've got more assistant coaches than the three on the bench. But
also with, pick your head up, Coach, when we lose one, and, you'll get them
next time, or a congratulatory text, and the other coaches from the other
sports.  
  
And so it's a very connected group. And I think that was something I was proud
of at Michigan is rebuilding that connection with Coach Beilein there with
former players of the past and being able to communicate what I experienced
here at Butler.  
  
Q. If you could talk about the seniors when you took the job,
specifically Tyler, what did you kind of lean on them a little bit in your
transition to taking over the job here?  
COACH JORDAN: I leaned on Tyler a lot because he was one of the guys that I
knew the best, having recruited him when we were at Michigan. So we had spent
time together. I had been on the phone with him and his mom and people around
him. So the next call, after Barry called me and I accepted the job quickly,
was to call Tyler because I still had his number and tell him we're going to
have to lock arms and do this together; that I wasn't the guy to come in and
think I knew everything. Obviously I know Butler, but I didn't know the guys
in the locker room that well. And he did.  
  
So we had a number of conversations upon our arrival just about the team,
about the guys, about how things were done with Coach Holtmann and what they
were used to because obviously we all have different styles. So he's been a
tremendous arm of leadership for myself and for his teammates.  
  
Q. When you first saw that you were playing in Detroit, what was your
reaction? What does it mean to you to be playing in your home state and to be
able to stay in the Midwest?  
COACH JORDAN: Well, I was excited to see our name in the tournament. I think
that reaction was -- it was just, okay, now we're in. Wherever they send us,
we're ready to go and we'll see who we're going to play against. And obviously
with Detroit being at home and Michigan, my grandparents can make it. They're
not too far away, over in the Auburn Hills area. So that was exciting.  
  
And then I think our Butler community, a lot of them will be able to drive up
and be here for the weekend. And so that will be great for our guys to get
that amount of support, and I think we'll have a good turnout.  
  
Q. What are you wearing on your right -- what do those say?  
COACH JORDAN: One says open practice. So we're going to have that in a minute.
And this one says, stay positive. And then there's two, one is Seth, we
adopted a young man with our program through the Friends of Jaclyn Foundation,
Seth Dennison, so this is "Prayers for Sethy Boy." And this one is Joel
Cornette's famous quote, "we're still here." So things that kind of come along
the way that you want to remember and keep things in perspective.  
  
Q. I just started following your Butler blue dog mascot last year
because it's kind of funny. Seems like everybody in Indiana gets their picture
taken with that dog. I've seen your picture with him a lot of times. How big
is that dog to you guys? Is that just --  
COACH JORDAN: He's got his own seat on the plane. Obviously it's, I think, an
iconic mascot. He's part of the family. And so it's good when we can have him
on the trips and I know he's a popular -- he's more popular than me.  
  
Q. Arkansas has a smaller back court with a couple of 6'3 " guys and a
6-foot guy. I know you flipped between Paul and Sean depending on matchups and
all that. How will, if you go with Sean or when Sean's in the lineup, how will
you handle the matchup personnel-wise with him maybe on a 6-foot point guard
like Anton Beard?  
COACH JORDAN: We had some conversation leading into the game -- that's a good
question -- just about how we wanted to match and which was better on both
sides of the basketball. And I think both guys are ready. Obviously Sean's got
good length and can challenge, and he's one of our better rebounders. So that
helps us because they're a pretty good rebounding team and they've got length
and athleticism.  
  
And with Paul, he can help -- a better ball handler to help make the press and
smaller and quicker to chase guys around in their motion offense. And so I
think both will obviously play healthy amount of minutes, starting versus not
starting. I don't know if it matters as much, because they both give us
something really good on both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. You were gone from Butler, I guess, about a decade after you left the
staff in '07. When you got back to campus and resumed as coach, what did you
know, what changes did you notice not only with the basketball program but
even more specifically the whole university and the campus?  
COACH JORDAN: Well, you know, there's more buildings than there were when I
was there. There's a new, couple new -- a new dorm and new communications
building. There's another new dorm being rebuilt. And so those were the
obvious standouts.  
  
It looks a little different. It's still Butler and it's similar to what I
experienced, but it's definitely not the same. And the Hinkle Fieldhouse has
had great renovations. Coach Collier has done a good job and people have
contributed to make Hinkle have a renewed feeling to it.  
  
And so you walk around, just aesthetically, it looks a little different. And
obviously when you look up there, see the Big East banner hanging in Hinkle,
that's a lot different than the old MCC that I played in. So it was exciting
just to knowing what you could offer students as they come to visit and show
them around and point some things out that we feel are unique and special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State student-athletes Cassius
Winston, Tum Tum Nairn and Miles Bridges. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Specifically for Cash and Tum, address this as point guards, what
sticks out to you specifically from Bucknell?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Their guards have a lot of experience and they're playing
with a lot of confidence. They're going to make and take tough shots. We gotta
keep funneling them into tough shots. Don't let them get their rhythm going
and stuff like that early.  
  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: I think their experience, with so many seniors, makes them
a really good team. Like Cash said, they have that experience, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Tum, with Bucknell being such a senior-laden team, how exactly do you
go broaching that to such a young core group of guys?  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: Just understanding that they've played together for a
while. And in the tournament, experience helps but we're a pretty young team
but we have a lot of experience. Me being a fourth-year senior guy, a fifth-
year senior and a sixth-year senior, but also our freshmen and sophomores,
they have a year of experience under their belt, too.  
  
Q. Miles, obviously you came back for another run at it. Why do you
think you might be better equipped and ready to handle the run this time than
you were at this time last year?  
MILES BRIDGES: We have way more depth this year. We have a lot more bigs, and
our guards have way more experience. We've kind of been through the wars last
year. I feel that prepared us for this year.  
  
Q. Miles, you've done a lot for McKenna, you've dedicated your season to
her. She was actually a classmate of mine. What's it like knowing that this is
for her and she's out there?  
MILES BRIDGES: Man, that's a great question. She's inspired me a lot ever
since the day I met her. And after her birthday, I dedicated the season to
her. I wouldn't thinking of any other way to send her out the right way than
to win a national championship for her.  
  
Q. Miles, for you attacking the rim, how important is that, especially
if you guys are going to win six and get a national title? Do you have to be
aggressive, thinking attack the rim?  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, I definitely have to be aggressive. It's going to open up
the floor for my teammates and myself if I do that. And it kind of put me in
the mindset to take over the game sometimes if I get going to the basket.  
  
Q. Cassius, you're playing in your home city once again this year. Just
what are you most excited for as far as getting to play in Detroit again?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like, the city has shown me a lot of love through my journey.
So this is a chance for me to give back, and I know a lot of my friends and
family are going to be there firsthand just to see how much I've grown, see
how far I've came this year.  
  
Q. What do you guys think it is that's going to help you to move through
the tournament if you do it well? And what is it that's going to get you an
exit if you don't do it well?  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: I think consistency is going to help us in staying
focused. They all count the same now. It's win or go home. So, I think the
teams that can stay consistent for the longer periods of time that helps them
advance through the tournament.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: I feel like also overlooking teams, like, if it's a higher seed
playing a lower seed, they tend to overlook teams. But everybody in this
tournament is a great team. So we can't overlook anybody.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, I would say our effort, how hard we play. If we play
our hardest, eventually we're going to meet a team that matches our talent
level and things like that. So the harder teams, the harder-playing team is
going to win those games.  
  
Q. Tum, you've talked about Cash and your pride in his maturity and how
he's changed as a player. How have you seen him mature from where he was a
year ago today?  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: I think in every way you can change as a point guard,
especially in our league. He got better defensively, changed his body,
shooting the ball extremely well, leads the Big Ten in assists. I think every
area of his game has improved and especially him being vocal on and off the
court.  
  
Q. Cassius and Tum Tum, you guys won a game last year in the Friday
game. So you know how to get through the weekend. Does that help you feel any
more comfortable as you're going for this first and second round?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I still believe that all of last
year and everything we went through was built for this point right here. This
team's been through a lot of ups and downs together, a lot of wars, things
that tested us. And I believe now we've got the experience and the talent and
our minds are ready to make this run.  
  
Whatever happens things aren't going to go perfectly every moment, but we've
got what it takes to dig down, just put wins together.  
  
LOURAWLS NAIRN JR.: I second that.  
  
Q. I'm sure you heard by now that President Obama has picked you guys to
take it all. Does that put any pressure on you?  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, that puts a big bull's-eye on our back. But, hey, we've
just got to go out there and play and see what happens.  
  
Q. It's been about a week since you last played in the Big Ten
Tournament in New York. How have you been able not only to rest up but still
keep your edge coming into tomorrow night's game against Bucknell?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: I think this team, we're always going to be motivated. We're
in our mindset where if it's not a national championship, then it's probably a
bust for this team, just because of how many players, what we think we're
capable of.  
  
So every game we're going to be motivated to go out there and play our best
just because we know we have that end goal in mind. That was a good week for
us to get off our feet a little bit and then we came to practice and we got
better. So it wasn't -- we didn't really let up. We didn't take our foot off
the gas. We got better this week.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by coach Tom Izzo.  
  
COACH IZZO: We're excited. We had a good week of practice. I think the week
off, you never know how it goes, but it was as good as it could go for me and
for us. And I thought coming to this venue, which I think is gorgeous, having
spent a little time here in December and coming down early on for a little
tour to see the inside and outside, I think it's one of the premier arenas in
the country and we're looking forward to playing in it.  
  
Q. What do you think Bucknell does well as a team? What challenges might
they be able to present for your team?  
COACH IZZO: I said I looked at Middle Tennessee, not to bring that up, but I
looked at Bucknell, and I kind of shake my head that they're a 14 seed. And I
mean that. You've got three seniors that can all put the ball in the hole.
Brown is a very good point guard. They all shoot 3s. I think seven or eight of
the nine players, I think seven of the nine all shoot 3s at a regular basis.  
  
They have experience. They have some depth. They have some speed. And as I
said, you know, when you play in games like this, if anything's called an
upset anymore -- and I don't know if it is -- but the way upsets are made a
lot of times is by the 3-point shot, and they have a lot of players that can
make 3-point shots. And we're going to have to defend that.  
  
Q. For you, when you watch Bucknell, what stands out to you most from
them that you just noticed really and think that's an area that you have to
concentrate on?  
COACH IZZO: Well, again, they've got inside/outside -- they've got a guard,
they've got a forward and they've got a center. The center was MVP last year.
The forward is MVP this year. The center is defensive player of the year this
year. The point guard is quick and can do a lot of things. So they've got a
lot of pieces right there.  
  
Sometimes it's easy to say, (indiscernible), if you've got a good inside game,
sometimes it's easy to press up if you've just got a good perimeter game. They
really do have maybe the ultimate balance. And that center is, the way he can
shoot it right hand and left hand, is effective and good and we're going to
have to do a job good on him.  
  
They also get to the free-throw line a lot. And Thomas gets there seven times
in their conference, I think nine times throughout the year, and that's a lot
of times getting to a free-throw line.  
  
Q. You guys score big on the court, but you also score big off the court
such as doing things like helping with the flood water crisis, helping with
people with cancer. What's it like to know you're representing those people?  
COACH IZZO: What a great question from the most well-dressed guy in the room.
Don't grow up to be regular writers, you won't be able to dress that good. I
would say it's a privilege and an honor to be a head coach. It really is. And
it comes with its goods and its bads, but the goods are you get to do things
for other people.  
  
I think it was Magic Johnson at our place who coined the phrase many years ago
that good players play great but great players make other people play great.
And I think that's always been the theory I've had there. Our job is to be
role models and to try to help out other people.  
  
And going up to Flint a couple times like we did was great. And trying to be
involved with a lot of things with cancer, a lot of things that regular people
outside of our basketball family deal with, maybe as -- I'm as proud of our
players of that as I am of their accomplishments on the court.  
  
Q. With such a short amount of time to practice today, what would you
say is the most important thing for you guys to fine tune and work on before
going into tomorrow?  
COACH IZZO: We just want to get some shots up. I think when you get into --
there's always this myth that at pro arenas it's kind of harder to shoot in. I
don't see why; the basket's the same height and the diameter is the same and
everything else.  
  
I think that's what a lot of people try to do here. Like we practiced this
morning somewhere else and then we'll try to come in here and 80 percent of
what we'll do is just get shots up, get the guys comfortable with the arena.
And that's really what we'll do now as they kind of say, the hay is kind of in
the barn. We've done everything here the last three, four days to get ready.
And we'll fine tune a couple of things. But I think the big thing is just feel
comfortable with your shooting.  
  
Q. Today, with the technology, it's easy to get information on other
teams. Since your tenure at Michigan State, is it easier now to just get
video, get information quickly on a Bucknell so you don't have to wait maybe a
day or two to get some film or video?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it is easier. We've always had an incredibly successful --
we have a very good video program in our place, and, I mean, to the point
where we've taped 16 or 1800 games a year. So we don't rely on anybody else
but ourselves.  
  
So when that thing, we find out who we got, my managers are like a bunch of
elves. And they had all the game tape we had immediately. And then you make
some calls and you try to look at some teams -- how did they play them, how
did the Big Ten teams play them? How did North Carolina play them?  
  
And you look at all those things I'm sure at the same way they looked at ours.
But getting film is easier now, for them on us -- or it's easier for teams
that don't maybe spend as much money as we do on those kind of things. But all
the technology, all the work you do, at the end of the day as they say in
football you still have to block and tackle. And here you still have to defend
and rebound and put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Middle Tennessee State, you remember. Kansas is having a heck of a
battle right now with Penn. Coming out right out of the gates, if a team gets
a little momentum it becomes a struggle as you know from that experience. So
is there anything you're doing to prepare right at the beginning of the game
to come out and hit them hard?  
COACH IZZO: I'm preparing to come out and hit them hard. I don't know if
they'll respond that way. But you're right. It's the underdog mentality that,
first of all, everybody in the arena is always pulling for the underdog. And
that's one thing. And trying to convince your players to play the team, not
the name on their shirt.  
  
And sometimes they're looking at the opposite. Maybe they're sitting there at
Penn saying, wow, that's Kansas. So it can affect you one way or the other.
But I just say that the parity in college basketball now is so incredible and
I look at this team that we're playing and I say, wow. I mean, they're a 14
seed.  
  
And I look at some of the other teams and some of these teams don't get the
credit. When you've got juniors and seniors, as I said, in the case of
Bucknell, three seniors that are a thousand-point scorers that have been
through the wars, that have played West Virginia, that are tournament tested,
all those things, there's an advantage to that.  
  
And we just gotta make sure, and I think we've done a pretty good job. We had
some players that played in that game. I don't think we'll take anybody for
granted. But sometimes the difference between really ready to play and not is
this small but it can make a big difference.  
  
Q. You've played in Detroit in some of your runs in the past. How much
of an advantage can your guys get from the fact that you're playing so close
to home?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, it probably would be unfair to tell you that I
think a lot. Unfair to the other teams. But then again I've played in North
Carolina against North Carolina. I played there against Duke. And it seemed
like every year they were in Greensboro or some of those places.  
  
So a couple times it's been in Detroit. And I really believe that when it was
here in 2000 for the regionals, you know, we were down both games to Syracuse
and Iowa State and found a way to win. And there's no question that 18,000 or
however many fans we had there -- it might not be the same now because there's
more teams in the first round -- but we had a lot of fans there and it helped.
And I think it does.  
  
Some people ask me the question: Are there going to be more distractions
because you're here with families and everything. It's flip a coin. I think we
make a lot of a lot of things. At the end of the day, this team has won eight
out of nine Big Ten games on the road. We understand how to win on the road,
too, when people are booing you and things like that. I think it's going to be
a little bit of an advantage; how much, I don't know.  
  
Q. You've been through so many of these tournaments. I just want to ask,
you're trying to win six games. How much more difficult are these games in the
tournament compared to in the regular season or the Big Ten Tournament? Is
there a different feel? Is it just the a regular game? Or how much more
difficult is it to go out there?  
COACH IZZO: No, it's not a regular game, I can promise you that. Anytime
you're in a situation where you're one-and-done. And that's kind of, as I
said, when we played Illinois at home, we kind of try to tell our players
we're kind of in one-and-done time now. If you win this game, the worst you
can do is tie for the Big Ten. If you win the next game you win it outright.
So one game makes a difference.  
  
Then you get to the Big Ten Tournament, it's the same thing. And I think that
pressure, you know, everybody deals with differently. And there's no secret
that we're still an awfully young team. Talent matters. But it doesn't always
matter over experience. And if there's one thing that worries me a little bit
it would be that.  
  
We played in the tournament last year. But we didn't really, we weren't as
competitive as you needed to be because we just had so many injuries and what
we went through. I think we're ready to play. So I'm excited about getting
started.  
  
Q. I know we've talked a lot about Cassius and his development on the
floor this year. But I want to ask you a little bit more off the court about
him, because from our perspective we've seen how he's kind of taken this step
this year. When everything was going on around the program, he's a guy that
kind of emerges this voice of the team. I was just curious, from your
perspective, how have you seen him grow off the court?  
COACH IZZO: That's an exciting question. And it's going to be interesting
because he's had a great week of practice. But he did kind of do that. And
without us really saying anything. He handles himself, which doesn't surprise
me, he's a very intelligent kid, as we all know.  
  
But sometimes, last year, a quieter kid. And I think that's the part of his
game that he's improving on. And as he grows in that area, I think you're
going to see the rest of his game blossom. And under some tough circumstances
he did an unbelievable job of handling it without any direction from us.  
  
And I think as he does off the court such a good job, if he continues to do
that on the court, be more demanding and be the quarterback of this team, I
think his progress is going to rise and I think our team's going to get
better. And he's really had a good week. So I'm kind of excited to see how
Cash does in this tournament.  
  
Q. There are a lot of kids out there who admire you and there's a lot of
people who admire you. Any specific advice to them?  
COACH IZZO: You got some good questions. Were you talking to my mother and my
sister, or who are you talking to? (Laughter) you know what? Like everybody, I
think all coaches and all people, you know, they try their hardest to do the
right thing. And I've kind of withstood the test of time because I've stayed
at a place that I love greatly. And when you stay at a place a long time, you
gather friends and you gather people and you get to do things in your
community.  
  
I mean, I don't look at myself as a basketball coach at Michigan State, I look
at myself as a member of the East Lansing/Lansing community. And so when you
go to church with people, when you go pump gas with people, when you take the
garbage out and there's people there, you get to meet a lot of different
people when you stay in the same place a long time.  
  
And for the most part, I think I try to treat people like I'd want them to
treat me. And so if those people are saying that to you, God bless them.  
  
Q. You mentioned about last year in the tournament and that was, Josh
had a big game in that first game. I guess with him, what do you want to see a
little bit more? Does he need to be more aggressive going to the rim, to set
up the mid-range? Or does he just need to hit more shots?  
COACH IZZO: He was shooting it really well from the 3. And I think he started
looking, his mid-range game is as good as anybody's. But I think he was
looking for that so much he was forgetting that he was open at the 3. So we've
really spent some time looking at film and saying: Boy, you're open here. Are
you seeing what you need to see?  
  
And you know there's no question that if I looked at this week -- I mean, I
think we had a great week. But I think in order, Nick Ward might have had the
best week, Cassius and Josh. Those three guys. And I think those three guys
are guys that needed to.  
  
So we'll see tomorrow whether that, what that does. But I think the time last
week and this week to really look at film, we went through that seven games in
-- seven out of 11 on the road, and it seemed like we were just spending so
much time on our opponent that the coaches didn't do a very good job of
analyzing what are we doing right and wrong.  
  
And in saying that, we won some big games in tough places to play on the road.
I just think we're just off a little bit. And some of it was our shooting. And
his shooting went down maybe as much as anybody's over that six, seven games.
But he shot it well recently, and I think he sees the difference.  
  
So it's hard to say how teams will play you. If they play up on you, you gotta
take them to the basket; if they're off on you and you've got 3-point shots, I
think he's just got to just shoot them. And that's what we've talked about
this week.  
  
Q. How have you seen your guys kind of block out the noise over the last
few weeks? And do you think having that week off maybe helped in that
regard?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I think we've had a great two weeks. I have no complaints
about the two weeks. We spent some time together. It was a little freakish to
have no games and spring break. Like I said, I know Michigan had it the week
before. I think Purdue had it the week after. I don't know what Ohio State
had.  
  
But you have a week off of no games and then you have spring break. It's kind
of strange. And yet I think we balanced it the best we could. We used some
film. We used some individual workouts. We used some shooting. We used some
practice. And then on Sunday we got right back on track.  
  
And I was actually, even though it was a day longer, I was happy we're playing
Friday because I think the routine of school, practice, meetings at night is a
good routine, and I think that routine has helped us this week piggybacking
off of what we covered last week in the film part of it.  
  
Q. Piggybacking a little bit, how close are you as a program to being
back to normal, so to speak, after the turmoil around the season? And are you
any closer to talking about everything? Or are you still sticking to the game
plan, so to speak?  
COACH IZZO: I'm definitely sticking to the game plan now. But how close are
we? You know, that is a million-dollar question that I'm not sure that anybody
will be able to answer. Only because anytime there's any adversity of any -- a
loss, some people take it one way. Some people take it the other.  
  
But when there's noise and, I mean, no matter what it's from, every player
kind of acts differently and accepts it or doesn't accept it. And probably of
all the things that I've had to coach this year, that's the hardest is trying
to figure out, is it because of this, is it because of this or is it because
of this?  
  
And so there were times I was maybe a little harder on them. But probably more
often than not I wasn't. And I'm not sure that's good either. But that's the
balancing act that you had to do. I mean, that was the situation we were
presented, and I think, as I look back on it, whenever it's all over, I'm
going to appreciate how well our guys handled it but I will also say how
probably difficult it was for them.  
  
And so I'm just proud of the way they handled it. I'm proud of my team right
now. I'm excited to start playing, and I'm looking forward to getting it going
tomorrow night. So thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU student-athletes Vlad Brodziansky, Kenrich
Williams and Ahmed Hamdy.  
  
Q. Just what can you say about Jamie Dixon as a head coach and what he's
done for this program and how he's helped you to this point and back in the
tournament?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: I think he's a great coach. What he brought for our program
is a winning mentality coming from Pitt. He's been to the tournament many
years. So he brought that back to TCU. And he was able to come in and teach us
some things and really just guide us to get here at this point where we're at
right now.  
  
Q. First impressions of Detroit, the weather, anything jump out at
you?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: It's cold. It's way different from Texas.  
  
AHMED HAMDY: It was snowing today.  
  
Q. It was snowing or snow on the ground?  
AHMED HAMDY: It was a little snow.  
  
VLADIMIR BRODZIANSKY: Cold, but, you know, like home.  
  
Q. Ahmed, you're the only Frog with NCAA experience. Have you talked to
your teammates about that and what to expect and how to prepare at all?  
AHMED HAMDY: I talk to them all the time. I said it's the most fun part of the
season. I told them, like, we need to make it to the NCAA Tournament, because
they're a lot of fun. And we're going to enjoy it a lot. And that's what
happened. We played hard and we competed and we came here.  
  
Q. Kenrich, what does Desmond Bane do for you all in how well he shoots
from 3? What does that give you, besides the obvious? He's a weapon
offensively. But as far as spreading the floor out.  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Definitely spreads the floor. Desmond is a great player for
our team. He brings the scoring in. He brings energy to the lineup. He's got
better -- I can tell you he's gotten better from last year to this year,
transitioning. I think he just feels more comfortable out there. And he's able
to shoot it out there with confidence and just play his game.  
  
Q. Ahmed, have you detected Kouat becoming more and more at ease out on
the floor? And do you see an improvement from him from early in the year?  
AHMED HAMDY: Yeah, for sure. I mean, he improved a lot since we started this
season. Like, he became more, like, comfortable playing the game, playing his
game, you know. He didn't put a lot of pressure on himself. Probably he did at
the beginning of the season because he's a freshman. It's his first time
playing.  
  
But once the season started going, he started playing, like, more comfortable,
and we had more chemistry with the team and stuff. That's why he started
making shots, and then start playing good.  
  
Q. Vlad, playing Syracuse coming into that play-in game, did you have a
preference as to who you played? And now that you know it is Syracuse, does
that mean a little something extra special with the tradition they have?  
VLADIMIR BRODZIANSKY: I really didn't have a preference. We were talking about
it with a few teammates. We were just saying whoever comes we have to play. We
really didn't want to choose who we wanted to play because it was out of our
hands.  
  
Q. Did a group of you get together and watch the game?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: We watched it in our rooms because it came on kind of late
last night. So we watched it in our rooms. And Coach texted, saying we're
going to be playing Syracuse.  
  
Q. Do you get the sense, have you talked to your teammates, did
everybody watch it? Or did some people go see a movie or something?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: No, we all stayed in the room last night and watched it.
We're focused on Syracuse right now. We were focused on Syracuse whenever they
won the game. That was our main goal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, we'll start with an opening statement.  
  
COACH DIXON: Great to see Jim here to support the Horned Frogs, to make the
trip. But excited to be here for our guys. It's obviously a new experience for
our program, and I'm very excited to get them here.  
  
Good practice today as far as light. But we'll get some shots up today and get
ready for Syracuse. Quick turnaround as far as knowing who we're playing for
us. So really unique and first time I've been through it. We're playing the
winner of the play-in game. So certainly something that a little different.
You get some time, but not time to focus on just one team.  
  
And then obviously for us it's an exciting time for TCU and getting to the
tournament. And so exciting, I think our band's at the shoot-around and our
cheerleaders are at shoot-around. I don't know if that's been done but first
time I've seen it. Excited to be here and looking forward to playing a really
good team.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously with TCU, a little bit different than Pittsburgh in
the tournament, but the guy on the other side, Jim Boeheim, and Syracuse you
know all too well. What you can say about getting that matchup?  
COACH DIXON: Obviously the Pittsburgh/Syracuse matchup was a rivalry and
historic games. And so many great matchups and so many, over such a long
period of time. But I joked with somebody earlier that maybe we can start up
this Syracuse/TCU rivalry and get that going, the Northeast versus the
Southwest and see how that carries.  
  
But certainly, obviously, I have great respect for Coach Boeheim, and we can
talk basketball and different things, but as I mentioned earlier, with Coach,
I mean when I went to Pittsburgh as associate head coach, I knew Coach
Hopkins, was friends with him. Through that, I think, we became pretty close
with Coach Boeheim when Ben and I came that way.  
  
And then there was Jim Zezetich (phonetic), some of you guys know, a Syracuse
guy who's lived in Pittsburgh, was a good friend. Through that, seemed like we
were closer attached to those guys right away.  
  
Once I became head coach, he was really forthcoming and welcoming, I should
say, to me when I became a head coach -- young, I think I was 36. Similar to
him in a lot of ways, taking over the program. And I think similar in that
they didn't want to give him the job either and they didn't want to give me
the job either, but we kind of got it at the same time.  
  
Always looked to him with great respect because he'd been at a place for so
long and certainly something that I was able to do too as well. And very proud
of that. But the thing I remember most is how he reached out to us and reached
out to me. And I watched him how he was involved in other outside activities,
whether it be the Coaches Vs. Cancer, he got us involved in that, me and my
family and my wife Jacqueline and his wife Juli.  
  
They communicated on how to get that started and running that. NABC, I think I
got the approval from him that I could be on the NABC, I got the okay. I think
that helped. Jim knows how that stuff works, the politics. And all different
things.  
  
And I often joked with him that I spent my offseason listening to Jim speak at
different events, whether it be the Nike trip, which he pretty much ran that,
too. USA Basketball, he got me on that to coach the U.S.A. Team in the world
championships. So he got me involved in that. So I would joke and we'd hang
out in the Nike trip and we'd talk about different things. And I'd laugh, here
we go, I'm listening to him give him the state of the game.  
  
So obviously I respect him more so for all the wins and I think everybody
knows about that, but all the things he does outside basketball. And invited
me in and pointed me in the right way, I think, too.  
  
Q. When you look at -- assess Desmond's season. How do you characterize,
did he surpass your preseason expectations or how would you characterize the
season he's had and what he's brought to --  
COACH DIXON: On the way up, getting better, improving. And I'd like to say
here we thought he'd be just the guy he is, but you've got to remember he had
no Division I scholarships going into his senior year and a guy who obviously
we took late. The only high major offer. And he just keeps getting better.  
  
He's becoming a better defender. He's becoming a better guy off the dribble,
rebounding better. That's the one the last couple of games -- he had seven in
our last game. So obviously he had a knack for scoring around the basket,
finishing. I think he became a better shooter as a freshman to the point he's
a 50 percent 3-point shooter.  
  
He's improved in every aspect. And he continues to do so. Great energy, fun
kid, great kid, well-liked and well-known on campus. And just the type of kids
we want to have, kid representing our university. So it's fun.  
  
Proud to see a guy that's done so much, and I kind of respect -- I didn't get
much recruitment coming out of high school and TCU took a chance on me, I
guess. We took a chance on him, and he's made us look good.  
  
Q. When you were at Pitt obviously you went up against Syracuse in the
zone. You went up against the Syracuse zone quite a bit. What were your keys
to attacking it? And is that going to correlate to tomorrow night when you
have kids who haven't seen that Syracuse zone, like maybe your kids at Pitt
had?  
COACH DIXON: The thing about the Syracuse zone, it's changed over the years. I
think it changes year to year. You just can't do the same things time and time
again. It's morphed. It's changed. The thing we did, and I've told the story
before, that when I became the head coach, I realized if you're going to win
in the Big East, you want to win championships, you've got to beat Syracuse.  
  
And they're going to play the zone, 2-3 zone. But also at that time Louie was
Seton Hall, Coach Welsh was at Providence, Pitino was at Louisville. So you
were seeing that zone pretty much through the conference, and they're all
pretty much disciples of Coach Boeheim.  
  
Our belief was you had to be good at it and you weren't going to be good the
day before you played them; you had to be good at it from start to finish of
your season. We worked on it from October 15th on. And also we practiced it
because that was our secondary defense. And so I would watch it and see what
they did to implement when we played that defense, but also to help us go
against it.  
  
So that's -- I think as you see, when they get into the NCAA Tournament and
you see teams struggle against it, it's hard to prepare in one day. And you
can simulate it in practice, but the thing is, better than anything, probably
the best thing he does in basketball is he recruits to his system, recruits to
what he does.  
  
So we looked at the size of the -- KenPom has the tallest teams. I don't know
what the phrase they use -- they rank the tallest teams. Number one in the
country in length is Syracuse. 351 teams, they're the tallest guys. So he
recruits wings and guards that are big and long. Everybody says that, there's
the number to prove it.  
  
So he recruits to it. So it's going to be good. And but you have to adjust
each year, I think, and I think he adjusts during the game. I remember one
game where they changed what they were doing. We were hurting, so we had to
change what we were doing too halfway through. And took us a little while.  
  
So they adjust and it's just not going to come out. I know everybody thinks he
just puts the -- the 2-3 just shows up, but there's adjustments to be made.  
  
Q. What can you say about turning TCU around and just where it is at
this point? 1998 was the last time. You've been there a couple seasons and
back in the tournament. So just what you've seen through these last couple of
seasons?  
COACH DIXON: It's been a lot of fun. Obviously Trent Johnson was a very good
coach before. Recruited some really good players. He coached them hard. Had
some tough breaks with injuries and things that occurred. So I mean I took
over what was probably a better program than people knew.  
  
The support from administration has been unwavering and committed, and
sometimes we got -- we say this is how it's got to be done and what we need.
But Chancellor Boschini and his commitment to me and belief, belief in what
we're doing is -- coaches need that. And he gave it to me and so I thank him
for that.  
  
But, yeah, it's been a process. And, yeah, we never put a timetable on it. The
belief was to win and win right away. And I said that at the press conference.
You're probably not supposed to say that, but I did. And I wasn't into just
give me a five-year plan and -- just I believe you've got to turn it right
away and start turning as much as you can, get every guy you can to buy in.
And sometimes guys won't. And you move on.  
  
But we got a good group and we're lucky. Got high-character guys in our senior
class that took to less playing time, less scoring, sacrificing. But the end
result was an NIT championship, which was huge for us. Huge for anybody.
Because you see the teams playing last night and tonight and going forward,
those are all high-powered programs.  
  
So it was huge for us and just a great step in getting us better. So it's been
-- it seems like it's been quick, but there's been a lot of work put in, a lot
of sacrifice. I really call them the four believers, the four seniors. Their
numbers -- we've got a big picture on the wall and in our practice facility of
those four guys. They're great kids. All graduated and all four are around
campus all the time. Couple of them play overseas.  
  
But they really believed in what we were doing and sacrificed. And you need
things like that and that's hard to do, that's hard to do. So it's been fun
and but at the same time we don't want -- I don't want to be the team just
here, happy that we reached the NCAA Tournament. We're good enough to win some
games and beat some people. But we've got a tough one the first one already.
So that's what it is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with Bucknell student-athletes Stephen
Brown, Zach Thomas and Nana Foulland. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Zach, explain your senior project again. Can you do that in laymen's
terms for the uneducated?  
ZACH THOMAS: Yeah, I'll try. Okay, threw me off guard there. So I'm working on
a senior design project. As a biomedical engineer, we have to do that as our
senior design. So my group's working on a device that stabilizes the coronary
artery during bypass surgery. So we're basically making improvements to the
current device that's being used.  
  
Q. What interests you about that?  
ZACH THOMAS: You're talking about biomedical engineering?  
  
Q. That particular field, medical, all of that.  
ZACH THOMAS: I didn't know I wanted to do it when I was a freshman, but I got
into it through a program that they put you through your freshman year, gives
you a little taste of a couple of different engineering fields. So I chose
that my freshman year.  
  
And then for this project it was kind of, we were able to choose a couple
different topic areas and ours was cardiology department. So we then focused
that idea, on that idea after a couple of weeks of probing in that area.  
  
Q. All three of you have been honored for academics. Is there peer
pressure among your team to excel, maybe Stephen and Nana can answer this. Is
there peer pressure among everybody to perform academically within your
program?  
STEPHEN BROWN: I wouldn't say necessarily peer pressure. We all come to
Bucknell to get a good education and also play sports. So we just always try
to keep each other accountable with our school. If anybody needs help. I mean,
a bunch of us are usually in similar classes with electives and stuff. We do a
pretty good job of keeping each other accountable. There's really no pressure,
especially when everybody is motivated to do well in school.  
  
Q. I remember last year you took West Virginia almost to the end in
Buffalo before falling. How much can you draw on that experience into your
game tomorrow night against Michigan State?  
NANA FOULLAND: Just we've been here and we knew what to expect this time. And
we've prepared all year, we've had tough non-conference schedule to play big
teams like this. So we're up for the challenge. We're better prepared this
year, so it should be fun.  
  
Q. Zach, you're a biomedical engineering major. What do you plan on
doing next year at this time?  
ZACH THOMAS: I plan on playing basketball. Hopefully that major will pay
dividends down the road. But for next year I'm trying to play professionally.  
  
Q. Your matchup is Jaren Jackson Jr. I'm sure you've seen him. How do
you prepare for a guy like that who obviously has the length, 7'4 " wing span
and all the skill and talent?  
ZACH THOMAS: Obviously he's a draft, a lottery pick type. So it's going to be
a tough matchup. So I think with that you just kind of have to look at where I
could limit him as best I can. And then I think I'm a matchup problem as well
for him.  
  
So just try and exploit his small weaknesses that he has and then play to my
strengths and use my knowledge of the game since -- you know, he's a freshman
so hopefully I have a little bit of experience on him.  
  
Q. In the one-and-done era, it's increasingly rare to see three seniors
up here at the podium, leading scorers and all that. First of all, just what
does it mean to be up there together and to go through this journey together
and have it come to an end in the NCAA Tournament? And also in what ways do
you think that the experience is going to show itself?  
STEPHEN BROWN: It's definitely a blessing being able to be with such a great
class. Being able to go to the NCAA Tournament back-to-back years, being
seniors, couldn't ask for anything more, especially a way to end your four
years here at Bucknell. And to be in it among these guys, you couldn't ask for
anything better.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo says he, quote, shakes his head whenever he sees that you
guys are a 14 seed. What's that like to see a Hall of Fame coach so widely
known for March success giving credit to your team like that?  
ZACH THOMAS: Yeah, we shake our heads when they're a 3 seed. No, it's just the
way it worked out, I guess. We feel like we could probably could have been
maybe a little bit higher, but we like our chances either way. No matter who
we're playing against, we've just got to play solid. If we don't come out and
play solid then we're going to get beaten.  
  
We know we just have to be focused. Didn't matter really what game we got or
who we drew. We knew it was going to be tough. So we're ready to have that
focus today in shootaround, and then tomorrow in the game.  
  
Q. Nana, you start off the season with a bunch of high-major, tough
challenges this year. Did Coach Davis talk to you guys about, we're going to
start off in our non-conference schedule with a lot of really difficult tests
so that we can get back here and be better prepared? Or did the coaches just
do that and you looked at it, like, oh, that's what they did?  
NANA FOULLAND: It was a little bit of both. We wanted to be better prepared
for like when we do get here. And the opponents we face -- we played Carolina,
played Arkansas. So, like, we played some big-time schools. So when we get
here, we knew that we were going to face potentially a big-time school again.  
  
So part of it was to prepare for this time. And part of it is just because we
want to compete. We want to compete with the best. We didn't want to play all
the worst teams in college basketball. You want to play some of the best. As a
competitor, I feel like you owe yourself to do that, to go at the best of
anything, really.  
  
Q. Stephen, when you look at the NCAA Tournament field, Vermont's not
in. Rider, Wagner, Middle Tennessee State, a bunch of programs like yours that
won 25, 26, 27 games. Meanwhile there's Power Five teams that didn't even have
winning records in their league and they get in. When you see stuff like that,
does it bother you? Or did you not even notice that Vermont's not in or
somebody like that?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah, I mean, definitely saw a couple of those games that they
were playing in. I mean, it's just -- it's kind of tough. You go a whole year
playing and your season kind of comes down to you win or lose in a tough
matchup or a tough game, no matter if you play well or not. It's kind of
tough.  
  
It's just how things go with the NCAA Tournament. I didn't really think about
it that way, the way that you described it. But, I mean, it's just how things
kind of go, especially being in kind of like the mid-major, low major leagues
as well. You face a lot of those situations, all those challenges, and it's
kind of disappointing to see those other kind of teams, kind of exciting to
see those teams that have a great season don't have an opportunity to be here.  
  
Q. Zach, a year ago you guys were in this position almost similar seed
and put the test to West Virginia. What did you guys take from that into this
year to keep the success going? And how do you apply that in the next few
days?  
ZACH THOMAS: So coming here last year was obviously a great experience for us.
It was a first-time for us. So we use that as motivation to get back here. We
use that all season long every game. We know where the main goal was to get
back here and we didn't want to just get back here. We wanted to set the goal
of winning a game or two in here and get as far as we can, because we think
we're talented enough.  
  
We've got a great group coming back. We've got us three as seniors who are
kind of leading the way. So, you know, we kind of had that experience under
our belt. And we wanted to take that into every game and do as best we could.
And we have the confidence.  
  
This year's a little bit different for us. Last year it was fun to take in
everything. This year, I'd say we're a little bit more focused. Still enjoying
it, but definitely want to play as best we can and hopefully give ourselves a
shot to win.  
  
Q. Nana, how do you deal with Nick Ward? He's obviously a guy a lot of
people double team. How do you deal with him?  
NANA FOULLAND: He loves getting into deep position, getting easy buckets. It's
hard. But at the same time it's fun playing people like that. You don't want
it easy. You want someone who is going to go at you. And I'm going to go at
him.  
  
You gotta work, fight around and try not to give him easy touches, make
everything hard. Good players are going to do what good players do. But you
have to make every possession hard for him.  
  
Q. Nana, you mentioned about the high majors, but also the Patriot
League, you have two of the service academies in your league in Army and Navy.
I asked football players, they said it's very special to play in that type of
environment. Is it the same for college basketball players when they go into
West Point and go into Annapolis as the season goes on?  
NANA FOULLAND: I think all three of us, the whole team, we love to play those
places. Not just because of Army or Navy theme, but just cuz they just
compete. They play hard the whole game. They make you earn the win. So it's
just fun.  
  
They're competitors and they're good people. So I can't really speak to the
environment, whether it's different from football or not. Because I don't know
about that. But just overall, them being competitors and everything like that,
it's a great spot to play at.  
  
Q. You guys are playing in Detroit. Obviously real close to Michigan
State. What's it like, what's going through your minds when you think, you're
thinking of kind of the fan turnout as far as the other team goes?  
ZACH THOMAS: Obviously we know that there's going to be a lot of Michigan
State fans here. So we're hoping that we can kind of quiet them early. And
then for the fans that are here that aren't Michigan State fans, hopefully
they jump on our side.  
  
I know we'll have a good amount of Bucknell fans there, too. So hopefully we
can kind of limit that crowd, having as much of a factor trying to shut them
up early.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll open the second part of the press conference
with an opening statement from Coach Davis and then we'll open the floor to
questions.  
  
COACH DAVIS: Obviously we're very excited to be here. We know it's going to be
a great challenge. Michigan State's got one of the best teams in the country.
I think we've got a pretty good team, too. So we'll go out there and see what
happens.  
  
We don't need to be better than them for four games or four days. It's only 40
minutes. We'll see what happens.  
  
Q. I understand you have a relationship with Fort Wayne men's basketball
coach Jon Coffman. Talk a little bit about your friendship with him and what
you get from each other being peers in this business.  
COACH DAVIS: Jon and I played against each other in college. We were in the
same class when I was at Randolph-Macon and he was at Washington & Lee. And
then twice I've had jobs that he replaced me when I left, once at Emory &
henry College, then at Colgate.  
  
John's a really good guy, great coach. Obviously he's done pretty well down
there. Very smart. Someone that you can trust. Someone I feel I can talk to
when there's things I want to talk out or I have issues or I want to bounce
ideas off. So it's been very beneficial friendship for me.  
  
Q. This senior class, you could coach a long, long time and maybe not
have this type of level of athlete and student in one class. Talk a little bit
about how special it's been to work with these guys.  
COACH DAVIS: Well, certainly they make my job a lot easier. It begins with,
obviously they're serious students so they take care of all the stuff that
needs to be done off the court so they can focus when it's time to get on the
court and practice or play. They're great leaders in that they show up every
day. They never complain. They're the hardest workers on the team if those
guys are going to work harder than everyone else, how can anyone else ever
take a day off?  
  
And obviously they're excellent players. It's nice as a coach when you draw
something up and someone just goes and makes a shot anyway, or finds a way to
get a loose ball. But they're certainly very special individuals and hopefully
we have a little while longer with them.  
  
Q. When you scheduled your first few weeks of the season and your
Carolina and Arkansas and I think Maryland was in there, was today or
tomorrow, I should say, in your mind when you did that? Or was it some other
motive?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, I think anytime you play you don't want the best team in
your league to be the best team you've got to play against. So you want to get
your flaws exposed so you can get to work on those and correcting them as soon
as possible.  
  
But the reality is that with the team we had returning and the success we had
a year ago it was hard for us to schedule. It was hard for us especially to
get home games.  
  
And so playing in the PK80, which got us North Carolina and Arkansas, got us
another home game. And Maryland was willing to play. So we had to fill the
schedule out. We figured, well, we have a good team, we might as well go play
people and challenge ourselves, than play some smaller schools or some non-
Division Is to try to fill out our schedule.  
  
Q. When you look back to last year's game against West Virginia, I
guess, first of all, from the venue standpoint, did you feel like the general
crowd was getting behind you guys when it was close at that point? And then,
secondly, what did those guys take into this year that they can make some
noise in the tournament?  
COACH DAVIS: The crowd's a good question. It's been a while. So I don't
remember as well. But I thought that there was a good buzz as that game was
going close and people were getting behind us. I think the biggest things you
take away from being there before is just that, again, it's one game. It's a
basketball game. So it's nothing special going on out there. It's about
playing the game itself.  
  
But I think what it helps you with a lot is like today, is having been through
the press conferences, the open practices. The day's more full today than it
is the day before the game of a typical game, so just getting your feet under
yourself and understanding what you're going through and how to manage your
time and prepare properly is the most advantageous thing to having done it
before.  
  
Q. You mentioned the crowd. How critical do you think it is early in the
game to not let that slide -- you would expect there to be a big crowd on
their behalf tomorrow night -- to not let them go off on a run early, to keep
your guys --  
COACH DAVIS: I think to have a chance to win is the most important thing is to
not fall too far behind. They're really, really good, one of the best teams in
the country. They're talented, have a great coach. I think we need to play
well for 40 minutes to give ourselves a chance at the end to win the game.  
  
And the better team you play the smaller margin for error you have, so if you
fall down 10, 12, 13 points, you've dug a hole that's hard to get out of. So
being able to stay as collected or hopefully be able to lead the whole way,
but at least being able to stay in contact is going to be a big deal.  
  
Q. I think Bucknell's made the NCAA Tournament -- I'm sorry, you've won
22 games eight of the last 14 years. Does the success feed on itself and kind
of the snowball's rolling the right way now?  
COACH DAVIS: I think what it does, I think certainly in some ways it does. I
think what it does is it creates a culture and an expectation that guys, when
they decide they want to go to Bucknell are embracing -- the idea that you've
got to be a great student, that you've got to be a great athlete, that you
want to play at the highest levels, that you want to play in games against
Michigan State or North Carolina or Arkansas. I mean, you can go right down
the line.  
  
That's why guys come to school at Bucknell, and they come because they want
the opportunity to do that. So they want the opportunity to play for
championships and those types of things. And I think that and the culture
itself certainly helps it. But you've got to continue to get good players.
Coaching staff's gotta do a good job. You've got to have the support of the
administration to give you the resources you need to be successful.  
  
But I think that it does, to answer your question, it does help because it's
the expectation now as opposed to it's not an aberration.  
  
Q. Zach Thomas, I think he was the number two scorer in Maryland public
school history. How does he end up in Bucknell and not in the ACC or not in
the Atlantic 10 or, you know what I'm saying? Or did he have those
opportunities?  
COACH DAVIS: I think that everyone develops at different times. And to be
honest Zach as a freshman, even as a sophomore wasn't ready to play at that
level. But he kept working, he got stronger, he kept improving his game, and
now he is. Same thing goes with Nana, the same thing goes for Stephen Brown,
the same thing goes with other guys on our roster other like Kimbal Mackenzie
and those guys. Yeah, they weren't there when they were 17, 18 years old, and
if you're going to play at that level at that age you've got to be. But if you
keep working and developing, you put yourself in a position to be as good as
anybody.  
  
Q. When you see Vermont doesn't make the NCAA Tournament, Rider, Wagner,
Middle Tennessee State, Saint Mary's -- programs just like yours that are
highly successful, but meanwhile Texas or other programs that don't even have
winning records in their league out of Power Five leagues get in, does that
bother you?  
COACH DAVIS: No. To be honest, no, we all know what the deal is when we get in
it. We're in leagues where you need to win your conference tournament to get a
bid in most instances. This is my ninth year, I think, overall at Bucknell.
The one year, in 2005-6, we end up as a nine seed, that might have gotten us
an at-large if we'd lost. But the reality is you're not going to get the
opportunity through your schedule and things to do that.  
  
We all know the deal going in. It's the way it is. So I don't really think --
I'm just glad that our guys were able to rise to the occasion and find a way
to play their best when we needed it. And we're very fortunate that was the
case. It's not easy.  
  
I do feel -- I was texting with John Becker from Vermont the other day,
because it's tough. They had a great year. And to have a guy make a shot at
the end to send you to the NIT and then you gotta go to Middle Tennessee State
from Vermont is not easy.  
  
I do, I feel bad for him because I understand where he's coming from. But we
know the deal. There's no reason to complain about it or anything like that.
We had an opportunity to win games and our guys got the job done. Good for
them.  
  
Q. In preparing for Michigan State, a team so highly ranked throughout
the year, is there kind of one kind of focus point as far as your preparation
and kind of slowing a team as talented as them down?  
COACH DAVIS: You've seen them play; they don't have a lot of weaknesses. No,
I'll say first off, we're not going to try to slow them down we're going to
try to play the way we play because that's when we're at our best.  
  
But they do a lot of things really well. Obviously you start with Bridges and
Jackson, and they're extremely talented. Coach Izzo does a great job. They
defend and rebound. They share the ball. I think they get over 19 assists per
game. One of the tops in the country.  
  
They shoot over 50 percent from the floor. Shoot 40 percent from the 3. So
what we've got to do is go out there, we've got to just try to make sure that
we make it hard; that we don't give up open jumpers; that we box out. So if
they are going to get offensive rebounds, they're going to get some, they at
least have to go over us or around us, not able to go right down the lane to
get them; that we attack on offense, to try to get them on their heels, make
them guard us the whole possession and take shots when they're available. But
we have to make sure in order to get the good shots that we work together. If
we do those things, I think we'll have a great opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Those three guys, you've been with them a long time, the three
seniors. I wanted to ask: What makes them special? You said you watched them
flourish over these years. What makes them special and what makes your team
special?  
COACH DAVIS: I think what makes them special is the same thing that has made
us successful as a team. Very rarely do you come across guys that are
absolutely selfless. They honestly don't care who wins the award. They don't
care who gets the shots tonight. They don't care as long as at the end of the
day we win.  
  
Nana Foulland was Player of the Year as a junior. And Zach, Nana never said a
word, Zach's Player of the Year this year. There was never any animosity. They
were all supporting each other.  
  
Stephen Brown, I've been saying all year long, is the most underrated player
I've been around in a long time. He's going to score 1300 points and be third
in our school's history in assists, and no one ever talks about him, until
recently. He never says a word. He shows up every day. He leads. He's one of
the guys, whenever he speaks, they all listen to. He never has his head down.
He never complains, doesn't care.  
  
Zach scores 20 points in the game, I believe, in the semifinals, finals of the
tournament, he scores nine. Happiest guy we won. Didn't matter. Because
they're like that, everyone in that locker room has to be like that. When you
have that, you've got a chance to be pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse student-athletes Frank Howard and Tyus
Battle. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Frank, what can you say about the resolve of this team, and that no
matter what's on the outside, on the inside you guys have been through a lot
of adversity, playing six guys, five a lot of the time and just believing in
one another knowing you've got to be 40-minute guys this season?  
FRANK HOWARD: It's been something we've enjoyed, understanding we're playing
40 minutes a night. Every day, you kind of start -- once you understand it's
your job, you want to start enjoying it. So we enjoy it. It's a great time of
the year, we're in a great spot. We're still playing with that chip on our
shoulder, and we still have that identity as a team.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Well, we just focus on our circle, our teammates and our coaching
staff. That's what we're focusing with. And we don't try to listen to outside
sources and stuff like that. We're just going on the court, we play, and we
fight.  
  
Q. Frank, you were talking about playing 40 minutes. When you know
you're going to be asked to do that physically, what do you change about your
recovery or your stretching or anything, like all the other stuff that goes
into that?  
FRANK HOWARD: Every day, you know, you've got to get your treatment in. Drink
a lot of fluids. Have to change your diet a little bit. So you try to do
anything that gives you energy, to refuel your body. We all want to, want
basketball to be a job one day. So it helps you, treat it as a job early.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Like Frank said, we spend a lot of time recovering, resting,
sleeping. Our training staff does a great job helping us play this amount of
minutes in a game.  
  
Q. What has this season has taught you about yourselves personally and
about this group?  
TYUS BATTLE: It's the heart that we have in this team. That's what makes it
special. We've been down multiple games, late in the games, but we always find
a way to come back, fight and get wins, just like we saw the other night. So I
think that's the main thing about this team.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: Yeah, that shows the character of each guy on this team and each
guy on the coaching staff. Every day we understand we're playing basketball,
you know what I mean? So we're going to give it all we have.  
  
Coach Boeheim has done a great job of building a culture around campus and
stuff and around the gym. So every day we go hard and we're going to fight to
that end.  
  
Q. Tyus, Coach Dixon said he's been watching you a long time back from
recruiting days all the way, watching your career. He says he knows a lot
about you and loves watching you play. But what do you know about TCU? What do
either one of you know about TCU, your opponent?  
TYUS BATTLE: We know he's a really good coach, really good defensive coach,
offensive coach. We've gone over stuff through scouting and stuff like that,
so we'll be ready to play.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: TCU being a whole other conference, we didn't really get to see
them much during the year, but we've done a lot of scouting. And I know Coach
Dixon is a great coach. And I know I'm 0-3 against him. We're looking to get
one tomorrow. And we know it will be a tough game.  
  
Q. Have you been able to use stuff in past teams in other places that
they seem to do similarly that can help you out?  
FRANK HOWARD: I assume he might try to attack the zone the same way. But it's
different personnel. When he was at Pitt he had some tall guys who were very
versatile. So his team now, he has a great team.  
  
They still have a lot of guys who are versatile. But we're just going to look
at the team they have now, look at this game, look at how they played this
year and just go from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'll just take questions. I'm ready for that.  
  
Q. What you can say about the heart of this team, the drive of them? The
entire season, no matter what's happened, up and down, they haven't blamed
each other for anything and they've stayed close?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We've never blamed anybody for anything in 42 years. So we're
not going to start now. We go out. We do the best we can with what we have,
and this team has played as hard as you could ask them to play. Every game
they've competed.  
  
Because of the way our schedule ended upsetting up, everybody we played had --
in the way we are, everybody that we played this year had a legitimate chance
to play with us or beat us, starting with Texas Southern and Iona and Buffalo
and all the teams we played early. We had to maximize our effort in each one
of those games to win.  
  
We've struggled at times offensively and at other times we've done some really
good things offensively. But given the limitations and the numbers, I couldn't
ask anything more from this group.  
  
Q. What do you think your team did well last night that you hope to
carry over to tomorrow?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think our defense was pretty good. We made some bad mistakes
defensively. But Arizona is a high-scoring team. They average in the 80s and
we held them to 56 points. I think our defense was good. I think offensively
we struggled as we have for the most part this year. We hit a couple of
stretches in the game where we played well. But it was, again, mainly our
defense and rebounding were pretty good.  
  
Q. Do you see any similarities in this TCU team and Jamie's teams at
Pitt?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think this is a much better offensive team than most of the
other teams he had at Pittsburgh. They were more defense. We got hurt more
when we lost to Pittsburgh on the defensive end. We didn't really get much
offense, have much offense success against his better teams. We lost some of
those games in the 50s. We just couldn't score enough.  
  
But this team is a really, really good offensive team, I think much better
than any that I can remember at Pittsburgh. This team has got multiple guys
that can score and size and really good rebounding team. I think it's a much
better offensive team than any of those teams were.  
  
Q. A lot of kids like giving back to their community. And over the years
what have you seen, what community work that you guys have done?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, we're a rather small community. So our players have been
tremendously active. We do multiple things every year. We do a dinner for the
Make-A-Wish group that provides about eight to 10 wishes a year, which means
in the neighborhood of we raise around $100,000 every year in a luncheon for
ladies only.  
  
We do stuff through our foundation, our players are very active. We generally
grant about 500 to $600,000 a year in the community to the Boys & Girls Club
and any other organization that works with kids. Our players are very active
in our foundation and our fundraisers.  
  
We do a lot of other things in the community. Those are the big things we do.
But we do a lot of other things in the community and we work with soldiers at
Fort Drum, 10th Mountain Brigade, which is the main fighting group that
represents our country and about 14 different countries in the world and
specifically mostly in Afghanistan.  
  
But the players are very active and have really helped us in all the things
that we do in the community. And it's been good. We've raised a lot of money
for Coaches Vs. Cancer. They've helped us with that. And really proud of our
players being involved in the community.  
  
Q. I understand your daughter played a game yesterday is in the state
finals?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Tomorrow.  
  
Q. So number one question is as a parent, what has it been like to take
her on that journey? And number two, how do you keep an eye on that game,
hopefully avoiding the time conflict?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I hope it's live streamed. They play at 6:15 tomorrow night.
Hopefully it is. I was at her last game where they won the regional. And they
won the last two state championships in their division. So they have three
seniors who have played through, this will be their third try at winning the
state championship. It's fun to watch them.  
  
You watch them in the summer with AAU, and of course my other son played in
the state last year and played in the prep school championships this year. And
my other son's a freshman at Cornell.  
  
So I got to watch a lot of extra games this year. I'm really happy that
they're done with AAU basketball. Coaches complain that we have to go out for
a month. I was out four months last summer -- April, May, June, July. And a
couple in August. But it's fun watching them play. They like the game. They've
always liked it. Their mother pushes them pretty hard. And I like to go watch
them. She coaches them.  
  
Q. How do you handle such a quick turnaround with a group that's already
shorthanded and having to play another game in 48 hours?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, it's tough. But if you're in this tournament, you
play Friday night. You're going to play again Sunday. So you're going to play
twice anyway. During the season we played quite a few -- not as many as we
usually do, but we played a few back -- Sundays, Mondays and back-to-back
games. And we had a lot of three games in six days, seven days. So we're
prepared for that. But they'll be ready to play.  
  
Q. Earlier Coach Dixon talked about how you were very open with him
early on when he got the Pitt job and developed a really good relationship.
Can you talk and expand on that relationship that you have with him?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We were together a lot of years in the Big East and then the
ACC. And I gave him too many hints that were good, because he beat us a lot.
But I thought he did an unbelievable coaching job at Pittsburgh. Ben started
it, Howland got it started. And when Jamie took over they did even better. And
he's a really, really good basketball coach. And I just have a lot of respect.  
  
I was the chairman of the committee of the USA Basketball, and we had him
coach one of our teams overseas. It was a really hard tournament. It was a
really hard tournament. We had a team going to -- I'm not positive, I think it
was Australia. But I did it for about 15 years. I had 15 different teams in 15
different years. But I think he coached that one.  
  
It was a really hard tournament. We didn't expect to win, and he won the
tournament with the guys he had. It was definitely -- they were underdogs. But
he's a great basketball coach. And he's done a great job obviously at TCU, and
did a great job at Pittsburgh. We wouldn't be here if he was still at
Pittsburgh.  
  
Q. As a basketball coach, even when you're in the tournament, do you
watch other games in the tournament?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I watch every game. I watch every game all night, during the
summer, during the season. I text Mark Few after every game he plays, what he
should have been doing right and what he didn't right. I love basketball.  
  
When they're not on, I watch the NBA. When they're not on, I watch women's
basketball. If they're not on, I watch curling if that's not on. I know more
about curling than any basketball coach in the country. I can tell you that
right now.  
  
I stay up late. I like to watch TV, and I like to watch sports on TV. Soccer
is getting to be my favorite. My son and I have an argument, I think Messi is
the best player; he thinks Ronaldo is the best player. But he's never right.
He's just smarter than I am. I couldn't get into Cornell.  
  
Q. How is Bourama Sidibe's knee?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Same as he's felt all year, terrible.  
  
Q. Any indication how he's moving?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It's been bad for the whole year. I don't think it's going to
change today or tomorrow. He's doing the best he can at it. He's got pain
every time he plays. It's not going to hurt it anymore. But he needs to get it
fixed. And as soon as we're done playing he'll get it fixed. And it's not a
major thing, but he has constant pain.  
  
Every game, he can't jump. I don't know what happened at Pittsburgh, but he
had one of those, something happened. I don't know what it was. But he felt
good that one night, but that's been it.  
  
Q. Looking back with your time with David Patrick, is there any
particular memory that stands out most?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Memory of who?  
  
Q. David Patrick, the with TCU.  
COACH BOEHEIM: David. I was thinking what's he talking about? I was thinking
of David Padgett for a minute there.  
  
We recruited David. He came in, he was a good player but he came into Syracuse
and we had, I don't know, like I forget -- I'm not going to try to name the
player. We had a great point guard. So he really wasn't going to get a lot of
time. And he transferred, which transfers are -- I mean, sometimes -- not all
the time, but quite a bit of the time transfers, it's a good thing if you're
stuck, and you get an opportunity to play someplace else, it's good for
players to be able to do that.  
  
I think it will cause some issues when players are able to freely leave. But
the more that I think about it, even though there will be some just crazy
stuff happen. Some guy will just say, I'm going to play a lot here, but I'm
going to play more over there, so I'm just going to go over there. Or Coach
yells at me too much. I'm going to leave.  
  
There's going to be a lot of that. But on the other hand there's a lot of
cases where you'll have a kid that just didn't fit in your program for
whatever. And he can go over here and play and not have to sit out. So I've
always been against it because I'm afraid of what will happen. But in the
balance of everything, I think the players to have that freedom will end up
being overall a good thing, even though it will cause some crazy stuff.  
  
We need to -- we really don't need to do as much as people think about our
game, but we need to do more for the players. I've never -- I love Charles
Barkley -- I've never really been a fan of some of the crazy things he said.
But today he probably made about the best case of anybody I've heard today on
television about what we should do. I don't know who told him to say those
things, because I know Charles didn't figure it out himself, but somebody did.
And he had some great observations about paying players and what the deal is.  
  
And I think sometimes we forget there are 4500 players playing college
basketball -- 4500. And I was one of the 4450 that was very happy to have a
scholarship and play college basketball. There's 50 guys that probably could
get some more than they get in college, but those 50 guys, most of them end up
making $100 million. So they end up all right.  
  
But the rest of us, college basketball is a pretty good thing for us. And we
have made changes and we have helped the players in ways that have, I think,
been very good. And I'm hopeful that this commission finds some other way to
enhance players' experiences -- I mean, parents to games, parents travel,
hotels for the tournament or even for a game in the regular season or two. And
whatever else they can do to enhance the experience for players.  
  
If you sold T-shirts, one of our players, if they got about 5,000 bucks for
one guy. That's about what it would be. It's not like it would be 100,000. I'm
not saying some guys wouldn't get $100,000 someplace, but that's -- let's just
do some more the players if we can. Let them talk, get advice from agents who
are going to tell them to leave anyway, but that's all right, let them get it.  
  
Let them talk to them, see what happens down the road. There's so much made
out of one-and-done. I've even said it. It's like if next year there was one-
and-done-- let's think of this year's freshman class. Who would have come out?
Who would have come out this year? Who would not have gone to the NBA? Trae
Young? He hardly played on the U.S.A. Team last summer. He's going to be a
top-10 pick. Why? Why is he going to be a top-10 pick?  
  
Only one reason is, because he came to college. If he had come out last year
he would have been a late first-round maybe, and he would have played the
whole year in the D-League. Now he's going to be a top-10 pick and get a lot
of money and play.  
  
Who really would have come out? I think maybe, I'm not going to start naming
all kinds of names, but I think a couple of guys, two or three. And so more
might come out and they'd all be playing in the D-League for two or three
years, like a lot of guys that come out early now. So let them go. Let those
guys go.  
  
And, I mean, just look at Trae Young, for example. He can be playing in Idaho
someplace this year riding the bus. This whole thing about, oh, yeah, let's
get them in the G League. Have you ever been to the G League? Have you gone to
a G League game? You ever lived where those guys live?  
  
They're adults -- 23-, 24-year-old guys. Now you're going to be 17-year-old
guys there? You've got to be crazy.  
  
The other thing is there's 17 guys on every NBA team. Do people realize that?
Do you realize that? There's 17 guys on the teams. So if you're not a
superstar coming out of college, the Bagleys and those guys, where do you
think, you're -- how do you think you're going to get to the NBA?  
  
The guys up there at 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, they're you with three or four years
already in. And those guys up there in the league, they're not going anywhere.  
  
There's not many places up there. More and more people will start to
understand that as we move forward. Sure, you can have a G League team, you've
got 12 guys there. And you've got 17 on the -- or 15 plus the two guys with
two-ways. So where are those guys going?  
  
And so instead of paying them 30, what are you going to pay them, 100, 75,
100? By summer they will not have a penny. It's just not a good plan.  
  
We need to fix the college experience as much as we can. Obviously some things
went wrong; we know that. Let's try to fix it. It's still the best way -- if I
have a son, I want him to go to college. Even if he's a great player. Go to
college for a year or two. It does not hurt you to go to college, whether it's
one year or two years. It does not hurt you. It only helps you. That's enough
of that. Goodbye.  
  
Q. Want to go look up the end of the Loyola game? Loyola beat Miami
(indiscernible) --  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm not shocked. Miami struggled a little bit without Bruce
Brown. He's their guy. He's a great leader, great guy. And Loyola had a great
year.  
  
I mean, there's going to be upsets in this tournament. I really thought the
Penn game would be closer. They didn't shoot it quite as well as they can. But
Gonzaga is really good this year. And we played Greensboro last year, those
same guys, they're really good. They had a really good team.  
  
It's college basketball. There's nothing wrong with the game. The game is
good. We've got a lot of good teams. There's a lot of good players and a lot
of teams and it makes for I think great regular seasons, because you see great
games. And we weren't great this year but people that came to our games they
saw great games. Not only saw the league games but the other teams we played
that came in were really good.  
  
And the game's in great position because there's a lot of really good players.
There's a lot of really good coaches and the game will be fine. It's a great
game and we just gotta do some things and get things -- make some changes, do
some things that I think can be done, can help the game. We'll see what
happens going ahead. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Detroit, Michigan_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas student-athletes Anton Beard, Jaylen
Barford and Daryl Macon.  
  
Q. Jaylen, what do you know about Butler and what have you seen from the
scouting reports and the film that you've watched that you think hey we need
to do this against them?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: They're a pretty good team. They seem scrappy and remind us of
maybe Florida or Tennessee the way they shoot the ball, spread the floor out,
shooters all around the floor.  
  
Q. Anton, your young center talk about his development from the first
day of practice to today and where is he today as far as his ability to impact
the game?  
ANTON BEARD: His ability to impact the game is amazing, coming in from the
start of practice, he was a guy from a country town, El Dorado. And we didn't
know what he would do, what he would bring. He brought so much energy and so
much enthusiasm in what he do. He always works extra in the gym, gets it done.
So he's not even half of what he can really possibly do. But right now doing
real well.  
  
Q. Daryl and Jaylen, thinking back to last year when you lost to North
Carolina you made a decision to come back to Arkansas instead of going,
playing professionally. Now you're back to the NCAA Tournament. Is this kind
of what you had in mind getting back here and having another crack at this?  
DARYL MACON: This is exactly what I pictured it would be, having a great
season and hopefully trying to make a run in the NCAA Tournament this year. I
think last year really taught us a lot as a team and individually, and I think
we learned from that and I think we're ready to go now.  
  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I think it brought us closer together after the loss last
year. We've just been learning from the experience every day and just going
hard in practice and even taking those practices to the game and just holding
each other more accountable.  
  
Q. Daryl, how tough of a matchup is Daniel? And I guess if you were
preparing to face them what would you try to do?  
DARYL MACON: I would tell my big man to just play hard, just try your best.
It's no real way to stop Daniel -- he's a force on the offensive end and the
defensive end. A lot of people think if he's not scoring the ball he's not
impacting the game. Well, he's going down blocking big shots or he's getting a
big rebound. It's just other things that Daniel does outside of scoring. So
it's pretty hard to stop him.  
  
Q. Anton, seems like you've stepped into the leadership role at that
point guard spot this year. You've played a lot of minutes especially lately.
How have you evolved lately as a senior and taken that role with that team?  
ANTON BEARD: Just become more understanding of what these guys really need.
This is probably one of the best teams I've been on since I've been here.
These guys can score in so many ways, and just trying to keep them under
control and just understanding that they can do more than what they really can
do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
JAYLEN BARFORD: They call us Earth, Wind and Fire, by the way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with head coach Mike Anderson, University of
Arkansas. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: First of all, we're excited to be here in Detroit. Just right
off the bat, when we got off the plane to our hotels, the hospitality couldn't
be any more than first, first class. And so on behalf of -- I'm sure the
University of Detroit is hosting this tournament, and the people here in
Detroit were very gracious. And thank you guys for welcoming us and we're
looking forward to hopefully going on and playing an exciting game against a
Butler team coached by Coach Jordan out of the Big East.  
  
Very well-balanced basketball team. The thing that concerns you is they have
so many guys that can really shoot the ball on the perimeter. They're very
versatile. They rebound the ball well. They just do a lot of good things.  
  
Their bench comes in and plays well for them. The Baldwin kid, he is capable
of scoring. So we have our work cut out for us. But at the same time it's a
great opportunity to participate in what I think is one of the greatest
sporting events there is -- the NCAA Tournament, March Madness.  
  
When it's all said and done, there's going to be one champion. And we're here
and hopefully have an opportunity to survive and advance. That's what it's all
about.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been in this business a long, long time, not too
long?  
COACH ANDERSON: I've been in for a while, you're absolutely right, yes, I
have.  
  
Q. Is there a common theme from the Butler teams that -- and I know
maybe you haven't studied them super closely -- but is there a common theme
from, like, the Brad Stevens teams to today's? That this program always does
this really, really well?  
COACH ANDERSON: They do it well. You can go back to when Barry Collier was
coaching them and the coaches that have come through there, it's amazing how
the program just continues to evolve. And obviously they reached a tremendous
pinnacle with Brad Stevens there. But everything was already set in place.  
  
I think Coach Jordan, a guy that played there -- it's one thing when a guy
plays there, he embodies what it's all about. It's easy to see him continue
that success when you look at their basketball team. They're doing some of the
same things they did and they're only going to get better. And this is year
one for him and look where he is right now.  
  
So, again, it's a tribute to Barry who is now, he's the man that's kind of
over -- and bringing the coaches in there. And so it's kind of like his staff
that took place and it continues. I think for an AD or former coach, that's a
great thing.  
  
Q. Some people have asked, because you've talked a few times about how
your teams are built for tournament situations, and I know you've explained it
before. But when you say that, what are you talking about as far as the way
you build your roster for this time of year?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, we play, I think it starts from day one. We play a style
of basketball that I play a lot of people, a lot of guys on my team. As these
guys assume their roles and understand what their roles are, I think our team
gets better. I think there's a trust factor amongst them, with each other and
then with me. And so it's like, I always sometimes talk about an artist, when
you throw paint on a canvas, you go in there, it's everywhere. But as the
season progresses you clean it up, you clean it up.  
  
I think that's what we've been doing. You saw our team. It looked like it came
out of the gates running and then got popped upside the head once we got to
conference play. We have to recalibrate. And I think now, with so many seniors
on your team, I think guys now understand their role.  
  
We've had some guys moving on from our basketball team. Now you've got to
recalibrate again. But I think the key is that those guys now understand their
role. Let's say Daryl Macon, he's in a better place than he was last year.
Different role from last year. He's one of those guys, when you had Manuale
Watkins, Moses Kingsley and Dusty Hannahs. Those guys were kind of the core
guys. The core had to be reshaped.  
  
And I think now we're seeing that. We're seeing Anton Beard now in a much more
comfortable role. He's a little general out there on the floor. Whether you
know it or not he is that guy. Trey Thompson, and of course the emergence of
the young guys. It takes those guys a little while to get their footing.
Daniel Gafford, early in the year he had more fouls than he did points. But
now he's figuring it out, as well as a guy like Darious Hall. You go on and on
and now I'm adding pieces to the puzzle.  
  
Gabe Osabuohien, now he's giving us quality minutes. So what I mean by putting
it all together now, we're a team that when you get to this time of the year
you can have adversity, you get guys in foul trouble. Easy to plug some guys
in there. They and play meaningful minutes.  
  
A lot of guys don't play but six or seven guys. If somebody goes down, there's
some adversity there. But I think with our team here -- and then the
turnaround. Here you play a game and if you're able to survive and get past
it, the scouting reports are so intense right now. But one of the things we
always worry about what we do.  
  
And so going into that next game, I think it tends to favor us because I think
when you get to this end of the year fatigue becomes a factor. If that bench
isn't developed, and I think that's the strongest component of our team is our
bench, then you're going to have some issues as you move in this tournament.
If that makes sense.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on Anton Beard. 12 assists, two turnovers in the
three games combined in the SEC Tournament. How has he grown? And I get a
sense that he's really relishing this opportunity, the third trip to the NCAA
Tournament the past four years?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think I've heard him talk more about it, him being one of
the older guys now, being one of the guys who -- he and Trey Thompson. And I
think he's letting those experiences speak for themselves. He's doing it in
practice and now he's carrying it over in the game. And I think he's finally
figuring out, the byproduct of him being real productive is because people are
keying in on Daryl Macon and Jaylen Barford because of the all-star stuff --
as well as Daniel Gafford.  
  
So, sometimes he's going to be the beneficiary of some of the things that take
place. But he's got to be the little coach there out on the floor. He's got to
be the coach -- Coach A, coach Anderson, whatever you want to call it, out on
the floor. And like I say, it goes back to that trust factor.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a stretch in February, I think, of five games where
you had over 40 deflections in each of those games. How do you balance
aggressiveness defensively with being solid defensively and not gambling and
jumping out in the passing lanes too much? There's a fine line there.  
COACH ANDERSON: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We have a saying, you know, sometimes it's
no guts, no glory. You've heard that before. But there is a fine line. And
there's that fine line of, actually as a coach, you're letting those kids have
the freedom to go out there and make good decisions.  
  
But I still go back to what I talked about. You throw it on the canvas, you
clean it up, and we've got to clean up the fouling and we've got to be in the
right place. It's not feast or famine in terms of the defensive pressure. But
the deflections tell me that we're active. And if we're seeing the man and
seeing the ball we'll come up with some of those.  
  
Our defense is geared to not letting people get comfortable doing what they
want to do. But we don't want to put people on the free-throw line. But there
are games we've done that, but I just think through the course of the year, I
think our guys are starting to really start to figure out the system, if you
want to say that, or figuring out how to play without fouling.  
  
I think there's a lot of things, stealing the basketball -- this team here has
not forced as many turnovers as teams of the past. But this is a different
team than other teams. I think this team is better offensively. We can score.
But I know when you saw that period where we actually were doing a lot of
touching, we had to turn our attention to the defense because we were just
trying to win with offense. And you can't do that. So there's got to be that
balance.  
  
And I think we're more balanced now than we have been. We've been playing
really good basketball here lately and I'm anxious to see how we come out and
play. Our last game, I thought we just kind of ran out of gas, but I thought
the second half of that game we really fought to get ourselves back in with
Tennessee.  
  
So I'm anxious to see how we come out against a really good Butler team that
can spread you, can attack you, rebound the basketball. They have the Martin
kid, this guy had, like, four 30-point games. The Baldwin kid has had 30-point
games. So they got guys that are really capable -- McDermott, he's a sharp
shooter. Wideman, he just posts it up and he's got the whole length to
himself. So our team has got to make some adjustments on the fly, but we can't
let them get comfortable. And I'm sure Coach Jordan said the same thing.  
  
Q. You talked about not forcing as many turnovers this year. The
flipside of that is you've taken very good care of the ball this year and
avoided turnovers yourself. Is that something that's gotten overlooked about
your program over the years that you've been able to have your guys value the
basketball may be more than what people expect for a team that likes to get up
and down the court?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think that's true. That's been the case wherever I've been.
We value the basketball. If you look at some of the ingredients, some of the
things that take place when we have success, we value the basketball and -- we
should be a much better free-throw shooting team because we get to the line.  
  
Because we're an attack team. We'll attack you defensively. Offensively we're
going to attack you we've got balanced scoring. Of course when you have
prolific scores like a Macon and a Barford, they can score it in bunches, and
we see now Daniel is starting to score for us.  
  
But our team, again, we share the basketball. We're a team that shares the
basketball. So our assists totals, the turnover ratio is always, we've been
some of the top ones in the conference and maybe not as much as this year.  
  
And I think our rebounding is better than it has been. And if we can stay in
the ballpark and rebound, and we can continue to do those things -- the
assists, the field goal percentage; it's one of the better 3-point shooting
field goal teams we've had.  
  
But you go back to last year. It's one of the better free-throw shooting teams
we've had -- and the field goals. So we play up-tempo and we love to get up
and down the floor, but I think it's run and execute. And I think we're doing
more of it; we're being more efficient in what we're doing.  
  
Q. Does Baldwin remind you of anybody that you played this year?  
COACH ANDERSON: You know what, I just look at him in a different category in
terms of what he brings to the table. He's a guy -- he's a point guard that
can score. And he goes right, he goes left. He does whatever he needs to do
with that team to help them win.  
  
He's a very good defensive player. I think for a guy that's a sophomore,
certainly his upside is very big. I think this year he probably -- he really
stepped up his game and Coach Jordan has to be commended for that. When you
talk about guards we played, we played some really good ones in our league.  
  
You think about Chiozza with his quickness and he can create, he can score, do
a lot of different things. There are a lot of great guards that have been in
our league. But I just put them in a class by himself because he's left-
handed, but he shoots the ball with his right hand I notice that. He goes to
the right he shoots it just as effective going right as he does left-handed.  
  
But he's a very good basketball player. He's an important player for them.
Very much, let's say, like Daryl Macon is important for us. He's an important
player for them.  
  
Q. The players were saying in the locker room you've lost your
championship ring but that you found it recently. Maybe that was a good omen,
just wondered --  
COACH ANDERSON: I did. Man, them guys tell everything, don't they? (Laughter)
I guess no secret dealing with family. I lost the NCAA national championship
ring. I had no idea when I lost it. Gotta remember, we won that in '94. And I
recently, this year, someone called me from a pawn shop outside of New Orleans
and said, I did some research and this ring came in my shop and I looked at
the roster and there was only one Anderson. Are you that Anderson? Yep, you
got me.  
  
And lo and behold, to make a long story short, it got to the pawn shop. So
somebody evidently -- I thought I lost it or somebody took it from me. I
didn't know. And the guy called me and said, hey, you want it back? And we
went through all that.  
  
You know how sometimes you think about pawn shops, they're just trying to get
you, man. But true enough, it was my ring. And he sent me a picture and all
that stuff. And it's amazing -- Matt Zimmerman was my operations guy. And I
had the picture and I showed him. And all the guys, this guy, he don't forget
what took place in 1922. And he wasn't even born then. This guy has just got
an unbelievable -- Coach, I remember when you lost it. It was at a hotel in
New Orleans. We just played Tulane. And we got on the bus, the plane.  
  
You said, I think I left my ring in the room. Would you call back there? He
said he called back there. They had the maids look for it and all that stuff.
They never did find it. But it worked its way to a pawnshop. And so you can
imagine that was in, I think -- I must have lost it in '04, I think. So '04 to
2017 -- '18, 2018 -- '17. Lo and behold it shows up. So I got my NCAA national
championship ring back.  
  
Q. Did the pawn guy make you pay for it or did you take it as a good
omen?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, I had to pay for it. But it was an omen. It's because it's
something that's been on my mind. There's one you create as a -- we made up
ourselves with the one in it, the hall (indiscernible), the 40 minutes of
hell.  
  
This one came from the NCAA. And it was still like in the same shape it was
when I got it. So it's in a keep sake possession now.  
  
Q. When Daniel had that great windmill dug in Florida, I didn't notice
video, he sprinted back down the floor like it was one-point game or a tie
game. What do you think that says about Daniel, the game is won, few seconds
left, he sprints down the floor on defense?  
COACH ANDERSON: I said it before, he's got a big-time motor. This guy
exchanges ends faster than guards. He plays with a lot of passion and energy.
I think he's just out there having fun. He's having fun.  
  
Q. Right as your players were exiting the stage there, Jaylen made the
comment, they call us Earth, Wind and Fire. And so we didn't get to ask them
about that. That's a reference you and I would understand in our generation.
But what's the story behind Earth, Wind and Fire?  
COACH ANDERSON: I have no idea what these guys are talking about. I don't.
It's scary because I put all three of them together, and that's what you get
when you put all three of them guys together. You know what, I think they're
making up something. They're that kind of group. I'll tell you what, it's a
good group of guys. And they like each other. You can tell that.  
  
Q. Mike, if you guys had beaten Carolina last year you would have played
Butler in Memphis. I don't know if you've thought that, but here you're
playing Butler. Is that destiny or karma or do you put any stock in that that
you're playing Butler a year after you came so close to playing them?  
COACH ANDERSON: I didn't see it like that. I'm a day-to-day guy, game-to-game.
My focus was on North Carolina and beating them. We got our butts kicked. I
was pissed, ticked off. I didn't see it that far down the line.  
  
It's ironic, we played in the PK80 and I had a chance to sit down with Coach
Jordan and I actually had a chance to sit and talk with him a little bit. I
had never had a chance to meet with him and talk with him. Seen him out on the
circuit. So that was kind of cool there. And here we are in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Nevada - 75, Cincinnati - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Nevada Wolf Pack, representing the Mountain West
Conference, is with us tonight. First, they're the No. 7 seed in the south.
They're going to Atlanta. They will play Loyola Chicago.  
  
We have head coach Eric Musselman, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, and Josh Hall
with us. Coach will make an opening statement. We'll have a 12-minute session.
We'll have questions for all four gentlemen of the Wolf Pack.  
  
Eric, it's yours.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Can't say enough about our energy and effort. I mean, it
looked -- we were struggling so much, and they were just dominating the back
boards. We knew they were a great rebounding team.  
  
The thing that's amazing, when you look back on this game, is just the fact
that we just played 40 minutes and had two turnovers against arguably one of
the most aggressive, best defensive teams in the country.  
  
But eventually, kind of like the Texas game, eventually our pace of play won
out. And we got that thing above 40 points in the second half, and I thought
that was really important.  
  
The first half, we didn't run anything. Then, obviously, we changed our whole
defensive concept at halftime and went to a trapping defense that, quite
frankly, we haven't been very good at this year in that trapping defense.  
  
We were great in it in years one and two. But this year, we're struggled in it
for whatever reason. We had Josh as our trapper and kind of left their point
guard and we were just going to live with it.  
  
That locker room right now, I've never seen anything like it in my life. It's
the happiest I've ever seen. It's the happiest I've ever been in my life. I
couldn't be more proud of a team. Every single player in there, I mean, this
feeling's never going away the rest of any of our lives.  
  
Q. Coach, you said after the Texas game, I don't know how we just won
that game. How did you guys just win this game, down 22, the second largest
comeback in NCAA tournament history?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: We just didn't quit, you know. Again, we made a decision to
start trapping and to leave somebody, and we felt like it was just a barrage
-- you know, like they just hit us so hard with 3-balls.  
  
You know, that kind of uncharacteristic of us. We said at halftime and -- you
know, like San Diego State, we got down and we didn't have enough fight in us
and we lost a game that will sting us for a long time.  
  
Again, to play Cincinnati and have two turnovers is incredible.  
  
Q. For the student-athletes, tell us how that feeling was in the locker
room. We saw Coach lose his shirt off the video. Take us to the locker room.  
CALEB MARTIN: I don't know. Man, I don't know what to say. It's crazy. Coach
works out every morning, so his shirt comes off a lot. So I know he's
definitely going to use this as an excuse to take it off, show a little bit of
his muscle.  
  
Man, this is crazy. I forgot the question. I ain't gonna lie to you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: What's the locker room like?  
  
CALEB MARTIN: Oh, it's crazy. I mean, I think they started without me because
I was doing the radio on the floor. I came in the locker room and the whole
locker room was wet. I came in, I'm the only one dry. But it's crazy.
Everybody smiling, everybody jumping, everybody loving each other, man. We
just have a great energy about our team and our coaches and our staff.  
  
We just put so much work all the time. People don't see the behind-the-scenes
stuff. So whenever you accomplish stuff like this, you can't take it for
granted.  
  
CODY MARTIN: The locker room was ecstatic. It was crazy because you can see in
people's facial expressions and how they're acting just how much work we put
in over the summertime and how much we put into this, all the preparation our
staff does for us and how much we had to focus throughout the whole season,
how many times people counted us out.  
  
For to us overcome a lot of people doubting us and then to see us overcome
obstacles that we thought that were impossible, but our team is just resilient
and they work hard and they stay focused, and we have a lot of chemistry.  
  
We're like brothers and that's something that nobody can take from us,
regardless, and it shows in how hard we play, no matter how much we were down.
It didn't matter. We held each other's head and instilled confidence in each
other throughout the whole game, no matter how much we were down.  
  
I'm proud of these guys and wouldn't want to do it with anybody else.  
  
JOSH HALL: We're just speechless right now. We're just really excited to move
forward. A lot of people had us losing the Texas game. For us to keep winning,
fighting, battling, we can't keep getting down every game.  
  
But everybody is so excited and everyone is resilient, like Cody and Caleb
said. Everybody is just excited. We're trying to continue to prove people
wrong every game and keep working hard and keep taking it game by game.  
  
Q. Coach, do you harken back to the Albuquerque game? When you wipe out
a lead like you did, I mean, do you kind of -- the kids have to believe that,
hey, we can do that.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah, we didn't bring up the New Mexico game, but, I mean,
that was close to history, obviously, coming back from that big of a margin.  
  
You know, I mean, we just tried to set little mini goals each time out and try
to chip away and cut the thing to single digits.  
  
You know, I felt like we played a little tight early, and then I thought that
the roles were reversed as the game got underneath that six-minute mark.  
  
We just hit a lot of big shots, and I don't even know what else to say either.  
  
Q. Cody, can you take us through the last play, your shot and Josh's
put-back; was that the play that was called?  
CODY MARTIN: I wouldn't say it was drawn up that way, but the play was a
double ball screen, us coming off the right, and Coach was going to give me
the freedom to make a play.  
  
I ended up doing a step-back, going towards the middle. I shot it. It felt
good, ended up being short. But Josh, he came up with the ball, he came up
with a huge play, and I thought he was going to spread. I thought I was
getting a second chance at it, but he turned around and saw how wide open it
was. He shot it. It went in.  
  
So he just made a huge play, and that's what Josh does for us.  
  
Q. I was going to ask Josh, obviously, you could have held for the last
possession there with about ten seconds to go. What did you see just to get up
there and throw it up there? And as it hit the rim, what was your emotion as
you saw it fall through?  
JOSH HALL: When I got the rebound, one of the defenders reset the ball and
couldn't get it. I saw an opening and saw them going closer out to the
shooters because it looked like I was going to spread out, like Cody said.  
  
I saw an opening and tried to put as much touch on it as possible because of
how close I was.  
  
Q. For all the players, you guys had quite the celebration when the game
ended. Can you describe the moment when you knew that you had the game? I
think the first thing you guys had was the last shot.  
JOSH HALL: We were just really excited for -- we knew that we had to take our
time and get a good play, and we knew that we needed to, you know, crash the
glass as well, but not get burned going back on defense.  
  
So we just -- we all, in tight games, we seem to come together and seem to
always know what to do and find a way to win. We found another way to win and
we're just ecstatic for it to turn out like that.  
  
Resilience. We've been resilient all year and that comes with late game
preparation and being able to succeed late game.  
  
CODY MARTIN: Getting the last play and then Caleb hit a big 3 for us, tied it
up. We were able to get the rebound. It was a ten-second deficit and we wanted
to try to get the best option as possible and get the best look possible.  
  
I wouldn't say I got the best look, but I got it up on the rim, and we were
just fortunate enough to have Josh follow through for us. And that just shows
that he, you know, he could have just been ball watching or let the ball,
somebody else get it, but he was playing hard the entire game. And he made
huge plays. He was rebounding better than all of us.  
  
That's just what he brings to our team. He's a key piece to our team. We
couldn't do it without him.  
  
Q. Caleb and Cody, you guys have said almost after every one of these
games, we don't want to put ourselves in this position again. You keep doing
it. Do you feel more comfortable playing from behind? What has it been over
the last two weeks that has allowed you to make these comebacks that seem
impossible for other teams?  
CALEB MARTIN: I was telling Coach, dang, can we not start in front for once? I
mean, I don't know. Maybe it's just playing against the pressure. Obviously,
we don't mean to get down like that, but we just got to focus from the jump
and make sure that we can't -- from this point on, like it's not going to cut
it, trying to come back from 21, 22 points.  
  
But it's just the guys we're playing for, our seniors, and all the work
everybody's put in and playing with seven, playing with a limited bench, I
mean, it's just the fear of going home. We're not ready to go home. So, I
mean, we don't think it's impossible. That's why we play so hard.  
  
CODY MARTIN: Yeah, I can honestly say we don't like playing, having to play
down that much, by that much. But I guess our team likes to play under
pressure, like my brother said. I don't know. It just shows how hard that we
play. At the same time, it's like -- at the same time, like if you're
struggling at the beginning, we weren't making shots, they make a matchup
zone, kind of something that was tricky at first.  
  
Once we started figuring it out, our defense got us back into the game,
defense and rebounding. Yeah, we're going to have to find a way to start off
on a better foot and make sure we don't get down by that much.  
  
At the same time, we're fortunate enough to come out with a win, and that's
all we can ask for.  
  
Q. Eric, Evans seemed to be a tough matchup in the first half. He seemed
to be able to get to the rack pretty much any time. Was that how he normally
plays that you saw on film or is that just something he was able to do
today?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Evans is a great player. They were running pick and rolls, and
they knew we were going to switch. They were taking the switch and trying to
get mismatches. It really burned us in the first half bad.  
  
Then we made an adjustment, we stopped switching the pick and roll and started
going under or over, depending on where the screen was set. That really
changed the game for us.  
  
Then, at halftime, we slid Cody over to guard Evans and by not switching, Cody
stayed on him, and I thought that was a big, a big key to the game because he
was kind of having his way in that first half.  
  
Q. Eric, I wanted to ask you about the technical foul that you got. You
guys were down 18. You got the technical and things started to change. Was
that strategic in any way?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I mean, I didn't know that we were going to win the game when
I got it. But I wanted it. So I'll leave it at that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Congratulations. See you in the
Sweet 16.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 18, 2018

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Paul Scruggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35160)

### [J.P. Macura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30563)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Florida State - 75, Xavier - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Xavier Musketeers are with us now. Head coach Chris Mack is
also with J.P. Macura and Paul Scruggs. I'll ask Chris to start off with a
statement on this game and we'll go for questions for all three gentlemen on
the dais.  
  
Chris, please.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Obviously, tough loss for our group. Pretty emotional ending, the
finality of what I think is the greatest sporting event in our country.  
  
It's tough. I've got a group that I love being around, I love coaching. Our
seniors have been amazing not just this year, but throughout their entire
career. I couldn't ask for a better group, a more selfless group, a group that
thinks about team before self and so I'm going to miss coaching them.  
  
I tell you, the reason that we're not moving on, turnovers on our part caused
by a tremendous amount of pressure from Florida State. We didn't hit our free
throws when we had the ability to maybe stretch the lead. That really hurt us.
We've been a really good free throw shooting team all year. And then we gave
up some offensive rebounds. It was sort of the cumulative effect of all those
things.  
  
So Florida State moves on. And it was tough for our group, but a year ago it
was tough for them. I'm proud of what our group's accomplished this year. I
wish we could just keep going.  
  
Q. Chris, I know a lot of the conversation you have with your guys, you
like to keep in-house. Speaking in generalities, what was your message to the
group after an experience like that?  
CHRIS MACK: I told them I loved them. I love coaching them. I felt bad for
them. Wish I could have done more, you know, to earn the right to keep
playing.  
  
My high school coach, the late Dick Berning, said, No matter how bad you feel,
the sun's going to shine tomorrow. If this is the worst thing that happens to
our group as individuals, we're going to live a pretty good life.  
  
So I'm just sad I can't keep coaching them.  
  
Q. Chris, Coach Hamilton said yesterday that Trevon, obviously, is a
very good player, a big lynchpin to your team. Today, do you think that they
did anything special on him defensively? Was he getting shots that he normally
would have, in your opinion?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, he didn't have his best game. I give a lot of credit to
Florida State. They're an excellent defensive team. They pressure. They didn't
lose him often.  
  
Playing Kaiser at the four pushes Tre to the three a little bit and now he's
guarded by a little bit more of a versatile athletic guy instead of their
four.  
  
You know, Naj couldn't play the amount of minutes that he's been playing
normally here as of late. He played 12 minutes and he was hobbling through
those 12 minutes. So, you know, it pushes Tre to a position that there's a
little bit more athleticism, a little bit more quickness on him.  
  
But, you know, that didn't win us or lose the game. We've won games this year
where, you know, Tre didn't score 20 or 25. We've been so much more than a
one-man team. That's a credit to him and our seniors for having that type of
mentality.  
  
So, again, credit Florida State. They're a little quicker, a little bit more
aggressive. They didn't leave him.  
  
Q. Paul, congratulations on a fine season. What would you like to take
from this experience going forward?  
PAUL SCRUGGS: Well, this was a wonderful experience, and I think all of the
seniors, they taught me so much. They're a great group of leaders, and I just
thank them.  
  
Q. J.P., obviously, you couldn't be on the floor after you fouled out.
If you could be in your teammates' ears as the game was kind of winding down,
what would you have told them in those big moments?  
J.P. MACURA: I mean, what I did tell them was to stay poised and take care of
the ball, and make plays. Unfortunately, down at the end of the game, they
made more plays than us, and they won.  
  
Q. Chris, with 21.6 seconds left, I believe, they're up 73-70. You guys
get the ball. Kerem takes the shot and it's an air ball. Is that the shot you
wanted? I mean, it's a shot he's taken before and made. It didn't have a lot
of muscle behind it.  
CHRIS MACK: So we had two plays, in essence. Florida State does a really good
job of denying. And so as Quentin brought the ball up, it was hard for Paul to
necessarily get open to run the play that we wanted to, which would have
resulted in the quick two.  
  
We had made the decision with 21 seconds, if we could score in eight to ten
seconds and cut it to one, had a timeout, we could implement a press, put a
little pressure on them, maybe turn the ball over or at the very least foul
and have them go to the free throw line. And if they made both free throws,
we'd be in the same situation with a little less time.  
  
And we had given them the second play, which was for a 3, knowing that their
five-man was probably going to flat hedge on that middle ball screen. So we
got a really clean look, and disappointed for Kerem.  
  
If you followed our program, he's made so many of those plays all year. It's
one shot. I think if you look at the stat sheet, we missed 26 shots. If we
make some of the other ones, that one's not under the microscope as much.  
  
So it was the best we could do in that circumstance, and we would run it again
if we had that opportunity.  
  
Q. Going back to the first half, you guys, I think, went nine minutes
without a field goal. What was it about them that was keeping you on your
heels? Was it their physicality?  
CHRIS MACK: I think it's two-fold. Number one, my two best players, my two
best scorers, two of my better playmakers had two fouls for the majority of
the first half. I elected to still play them at times but certainly not all
through the first half.  
  
And, you know, it makes it tough. We got two shotmakers, two guys who have
been in key moments, and not that they're the only guys that can score, but it
alters what we're running.  
  
Again, Naji was out as well, so it was tougher for us to score and you add the
fact that we're playing a tremendous defensive team with length and
athleticism and quickness.  
  
So we survived scoreless droughts before. I mean, we did just fine. We got
right back in the game, took the lead. It was the missed free throws, the
offensive rebounds, and the turnovers down the stretch that prevented us from
playing next Thursday.  
  
Q. J.P., did you feel like tonight that the floor was wet? And I ask
that because just watching games since Friday, it seems like players have
slipped on it. Didn't know how you felt about it, if it bothered you
tonight?  
J.P. MACURA: No, it didn't bother me at all. It was just fine.  
  
Q. Coach, with the seniors you guys are losing, is this the end of an
era for Xavier basketball? How do you guys move forward?  
CHRIS MACK: That's a bad question to ask me.  
  
Q. (No microphone) Trevon Bluiett and J.P. Macura era, is that fair to
say?  
CHRIS MACK: Two really good players. I don't know how much you follow our
program, Byron Larkin graduated, David West graduated, Trevon Bluiett is going
to graduate, James Posey graduated. We've graduated 105 seniors. If you think
our program is falling off a cliff, you haven't followed Xavier basketball
very long.  
  
Q. Will the expectations for next year be the same as they are this
season?  
CHRIS MACK: To ask me about next season, what my expectations are, that would
be unfair to team 96, the group I'm coaching.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [P.J. Savoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35159)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Florida State - 75, Xavier - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Florida State Seminoles are first up. They
represent the ACC. They are the No. 9 seed in the west and they are going west
to Los Angeles to play Gonzaga in the Sweet 16.  
  
The student-athletes up here are Trent Forrest, Terance Mann and P.J. Savoy.
The head coach is Leonard Hamilton. We'll have him start off with a statement,
and then we'll have questions for all four gentlemen from Florida State.  
  
Leonard, please.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Xavier's a really, really good basketball team. They're well
coached, they're extremely talented. They shoot well from the free throw line.
They shoot well from the 3. They are extremely physical.  
  
They defend, they changed their defenses and they gave us a lot of challenges
throughout the game.  
  
But I was especially proud of our players, because the body language, the
mannerisms, their level of communication, when they came out of the -- with
each timeout, they never showed any lack of confidence that we couldn't win
the basketball game.  
  
As a matter of fact, during those moments where it appeared to be more
challenging, they were challenging each other, in an extremely aggressive way,
and in each other's face with a lot more determined attitude.  
  
I think our poise down the stretch and our determined attitude and, obviously,
the leadership that Phil and Trent and Terance gave us, and even P.J. came and
made some big shots for us down the stretch there. Everybody contributed.  
  
They have this saying that they're 18 strong, and I thought each time we came
to those moments where we were -- there was a timeout, I could hear all of
them getting closer and closer together.  
  
In closing, I think that the challenge that we faced last year obviously was a
time of learning and growing. We probably were a lot more talented than we
were last year. But the challenges that we had to endure, I thought we gained
wisdom from. As a result of the wisdom we had last year, we're more focused
and I thought that pulled us through today because of the wisdom we gained
from the challenges we had to overcome last year.  
  
Q. P.J., on your go-ahead 3, it looked like you hesitated for a second.
Could you maybe take us through that sequence there?  
P.J. SAVOY: When Trent had threw me the ball, I was -- I did hesitate just to
see what the defender was going to do, and I seen he backed up and let it fly.  
  
Q. Trent, what's that feeling like when you see that ball go in and all
of a sudden now you have a lead over No. 1 seed with a minute left?  
TRENT FORREST: It means with a lot. We just kind of credited the defense,
really, being able to get stops and being able to get out. I feel like that
just transitioned right into our offense being able to get stops.  
  
Q. Leonard, can you describe this tournament as a whole? There have been
so many upsets and it seems like this is such a wide open field this year.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think what you see happening in college basketball, it's
almost like a revolution. And what happens is you start categorizing people by
the reputation that their players get going into college. But in reality, kids
are playing basketball all over the country and teams are getting better.  
  
Just because maybe they might not be in one particular conference or maybe
they're not considered to be one of the more traditional rich schools, people
are playing basketball. And I really don't think at this level that you can
really call them as much upsets as it's just what they call March Madness.  
  
See, sometimes the team that's the most talented might not necessarily win the
game. It's the team that's playing well at that particular time.  
  
I can't say that we maybe are extremely -- are much better than Xavier, but we
were much better than Xavier in the last two and a half minutes of the game.
Sometimes when the games are close, that's all that's important.  
  
I think that's what you see happening there. There are teams that find a way
in that moment to get that message and emotional challenge or advantage and
they make plays, and that's why I think the NCAA tournament is the greatest
sporting event in -- of all sports.  
  
Q. Terance, your coach wasn't sure you'd be able to play today when we
talked to him yesterday. What was the healing process for you? Was there ever
a chance you weren't going to play?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I didn't know that Terance -- I had put my starting lineup
in, and I didn't have any idea that Terance would be able to play. But I
noticed he started riding the bicycle and warming up, I could see in his eyes
he wanted to be with his teammates.  
  
After I put the lineup in, he said, Coach, I think I can go.  
  
And I asked him, I said, Are you sure?  
  
He said, Yes, I'm sure.  
  
I didn't -- I went out on the court and I found out that he was going to be
able to play maybe two minutes before I walked out of the locker room.  
  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I just did a lot of stretching, a lot of ice, stayed off
of it. I honestly didn't know if I'd have been ready and I saw it in my
teammates, I wanted to be with them, like he said, and I wanted to play. So I
just played on it and I got through it.  
  
Q. For the players, as the game tightened up at the end, did you sense
that Xavier was tightening up as well? Did you sense anything with the way
they played?  
P.J. SAVOY: I mean, I feel like everybody on the court tightened up. It's just
the instincts of basketball. When the game gets close, everybody wants to win.
So that's just the nature of the game.  
  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, like what he said. Everyone was out there, tightened up.
We knew the game was getting close. They sensed that we was coming back. They
missed a couple shots and they took good ones. But, you know, we ended up
getting the rebound headed our way and doing what we had to do.  
  
TRENT FORREST: I mean, they kind of said it all. Just at that time, it was
just two good teams playing really good basketball and I kind of feel, like
Coach Hamilton said, at that time we were playing a little bit better than
them and were able to get the stops that we needed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, congratulations.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 18, 2018

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

### [Jacob Evans III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35141)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Nevada - 75, Cincinnati - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cincinnati Bearcats are with us. Jacob Evans III, Kyle
Washington to represent the student body. Head Coach Mick Cronin will open up
with a statement, and then we'll go to questions for all three gentlemen from
Cincinnati. Mick, please.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we had watched, obviously scouted Nevada, and we knew they
were an older team, dangerous team on offense, and I knew the game was far
from over. We tried to continue to say that.  
  
Our guys did a great job until the last ten minutes, where obviously they took
the gamble and just started trapping Jacob.  
  
We were playing 4-on-3 and got the deer in the headlights look. Ball stopped
dropping for us. We got fouled a lot of times and it wasn't called around the
rim. And that got in our heads. It affected our defensive execution.  
  
But give credit to Nevada for the win. The game's never over, obviously, in
the NCAA tournament especially if you turn the TV on until the clock hits
zero.  
  
Obviously, feel terrible for our guys. But it's been an honor to coach Jacob
and Kyle in particular that are sitting here with me and, obviously, Gary
Clark and all the guys. We've had an unbelievable season, and I appreciate
their attitude and their effort.  
  
We play really hard. We demand a lot of our players, and they're accountable.
They work hard. They're good kids. And they allow us to try to bring out the
best in them. I appreciate the guys. Been an unbelievable season, obviously.
Wanted to win the tournament and came up short today. Unfortunate.  
  
Q. Mick, one thing I noticed, they had -- I don't have a book, but I
think they only had two turnovers. Obviously, that's not you.  
MICK CRONIN: But they play five guards.  
  
Q. Talk about that.  
MICK CRONIN: They only average nine a game. Give them credit. Jordan Caroline
is a small forward, playing the five. They don't play really a big man. So
they're not a team that turns the ball over. They're top 5 in the nation in
turnover margin.  
  
So it's not a surprise that they didn't turn it over. Obviously, it gives them
a better chance. That's why they score so many points. But that didn't beat
us.  
  
Look, we had a big lead. They gambled and just started trapping at half court,
gave us a lot of wide-open shots that we didn't make. And it got real, real
physical around the rim, and I'll let you take it from there on that. When we
had chances around the rim, it was unbelievable what was happening.  
  
Q. For the players, just 22-point lead goes down, down, down. What are
you thinking at that point? And I guess just your post-game reaction, also.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Honestly, we thought we were still going to win, regardless.
We knew they were going to try to make their run. Who wouldn't try to make
their run at the end of the day? So, you know, we were confident we were going
to win.  
  
I don't think it's different from any other game. Obviously, our sense of
urgency was up because this is the NCAA tournament. But, honestly, I would be
lying to you if I told you we didn't play like that the whole year. Doesn't
matter if we're playing Bellarmine in an exhibition game. That's how we play.  
  
I'm proud of these two sitting next to me. I'm proud of everybody in the
locker room. Obviously, we wanted to go further, but if you look at this team,
we accomplished a lot. I'll never forget it.  
  
JACOB EVANS III: Well, you know, we got a 22-point lead. Like Coach said, they
was giving us some open looks, couldn't go down for us. And they made their
open looks and they made some tough ones also.  
  
You know, we don't lose too often around here. So whenever we do lose, it's a
shock. Especially when we wanted to send out our seniors, Gary, Kyle and Bart
out the right way. They work so hard to keep everybody in line. Make sure
we're working hard and becoming better basketball players and also better
people off the court. It just feels bad that we couldn't get it done for them.  
  
Q. Obviously, you never think you have the game won with 11 minutes
left. When you started to see them come back like that, what went through your
mind? How did you react to that?  
JACOB EVANS III: You know, the game is 40 minutes. Coach kept telling us that
it's not over. We got to keep playing until the clock hits zero. And they
started to make their run. Like I said, we missed some open ones, and we made
open ones and tough ones.  
  
Team like that, that can score the ball, you can't let them get it going in
transition and that's what we did.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I would say the same thing. Honestly, I thought we was going
to win the whole time. No matter what was going to happen, Coach said no
matter what was going to happen, we're going to win. I believed it. Everybody
believed it. So obviously, we're still upset about the loss. But that's how it
goes.  
  
Q. Maybe this isn't a good time for this, but could the two players
reflect on what you did accomplish this year?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: You know, I was proud of this group. We came together and we
weren't -- we weren't worried about each other's success. We were happy for
everybody. And that would ring true the whole season.  
  
I was proud of that because in college basketball, people can get worried
about all that. We weren't. If it was Gary, it was Jacob, it was anybody, you
know, we celebrated that success. We said, Way to go, great job. You know, how
we took care of the AAC, we got those two titles. But we wanted to go further.  
  
Like Jacob said, we're not used to losing around here so it's a tough feeling.
It's the same feeling every time.  
  
JACOB EVANS III: We accomplished small goals, the conference tournament,
regular season conference title. But this is the big goal for us. So we had a
pretty good run this year. We won 30-plus games again.  
  
But at the end of the day, there's no more victories. Come to Cincinnati, we
prepare to win a championship every year and we fell short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach of the Wolf Pack is here, Eric Musselman. We're
going to ask him to open up with a statement in this day between games and
then we'll go to questions. Eric, please.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: We feel fortunate with the outcome of last night's game,
obviously. Texas played phenomenal and controlled most of the game, and we
were able to get hot towards the end.  
  
You know, as we told our team last night, we have to turn the page and have
great maturity. Obviously, we enjoyed the win last night and it was the first
win in a long time for our program in the NCAA tournament.  
  
And so now, we have to get ready for Cincinnati, which is one of the best
teams in the entire country. They play with great consistency, great
toughness. They're one of the best-coached teams in the entire nation, have
great talent, and one of the best rebounding teams playing college basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, Cincinnati is statistically one of the best defensive teams in
the country. From your point of view, what makes them so effective on that end
of the floor?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: They have a great matchup zone. They switch everything. Any
time a team can switch things and keep the ball in front and then defensive
rebound, it's going to make you really good. They do a great job of defending
the 3-ball.  
  
They create turnovers. Their steals ignite their offense. For all those
reasons, again, the switching, matchup, zone, ability to defensive rebound and
then, you know, they have three guys that are high volume steal players. All
those things are what I think ignite their defense, and we're going to have to
do a great job taking care of the basketball.  
  
We're still going to be who we are. We're going to try to take 3s. If they
take the 3s away, just like we did against Texas, we've got to do a good job
of driving the basketball and not settling for 3s if they do a good job of
closing out and taking away the 3-ball. They've done a tremendous job all
year, taking away 3s from opponents.  
  
Q. Asked the players this when they were in here. For you, though,
getting transfers on campus, what makes getting them working together so
quickly, building chemistry, what is the big challenge in doing that and
what's made it so effective?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think for us, you know, the transfers, all of them have sat
out a year. So we've had a year to try to get them involved with our
terminology and get them involved in our culture.  
  
To me, it's easier than a freshman because a freshman comes in, and he's in
uniform right away. With our transfers, again, they have 12 months to
practice. They have no games. Their practices become their games.  
  
We don't call it a, you know, a transfer year, a sit-out year, a redshirt
year. We call it a player development year. It's all about our staff investing
in that player's career, trying to get him to become a better basketball
player, looking at his deficiencies and trying to turn those deficiencies into
strengths.  
  
And so, for us, the transfer thing, even though it's really hurt our depth
over the last three years, having four transfers sit-outs each of the three
years. When you only have 13 scholarships and four guys are sitting out, it's
going to, you know, have wear and tear. You can't get in foul trouble and all
these other things.  
  
Having said that, we had a plan that in year four, we wanted to be as good as
we possibly could. We're in year three, we've made steps each year in the
development of the program.  
  
And then I think just from my standpoint, being a coach who comes from the
minor leagues, you know, if you're coaching the L.A. Lakers D-League team,
they might take a guy up, send a guy down, take another guy up two weeks
later, send another two guys down.  
  
So it's a constantly revolving door. So, for me, the roster changeover is, I
think it's pretty easy and there's really not much change.  
  
Q. How you doing, Coach? You've heard this adage, you've been around
long enough. You dress ten, play eight, trust five.  
Your depth issues have necessarily worked in your favor where you
consolidate your lineups, but you play them heavy minutes. And even in the
chaotic style that you guys are playing and running and shooting 3s, it really
hasn't hampered your efforts.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think a lot of it begins in the summer. We go up to Lake
Tahoe and do our training. One thing we talk to the guys about over and over
is the conditioning. If you look at last night's basketball game, we played
six players, we got better in overtime.  
  
As a coach, you have to evaluate what you're doing. In year one, year two, the
lack of depth didn't hurt us at all. One thing I know, when I walk in that
locker room after each and every game, everybody's happy because everybody's
playing.  
  
One thing, when you're able to sit back and be an assistant coach, I couldn't
figure out, coming from the world I came from, which is pro basketball, where
there's a 48-minute game instead of a 40, you're playing four to six games a
week, it felt like in the minor leagues or the NBA.  
  
You've got to have some depth just because of the 82-game schedule compared to
a 30-game schedule. So I think the most overrated thing in college basketball
is depth.  
  
Now, having said that, we can't afford to get in foul trouble, and we
understand that. We didn't plan on Lindsey Drew, a three-year starter, blowing
his Achilles out. Obviously, you know, we wish we still had Lindsey and our
depth would be a little bit different because he was a guy who played 30-some
minutes every single night for us.  
  
So that injury has taken a big-time toll on us. But we've kind of adjusted on
the fly. Our power forward is now our point guard, and we've done an
incredible job taking care of the basketball, regardless of who our point
guard is.  
  
And, obviously, getting a shot on goal is extremely important against
Cincinnati. We can't turn the ball over and have live ball turnovers and let
them get out and their athletes get out and finish in transition.  
  
Q. Coach, Kendall said that your pitch to him was, you know, playing the
NBA style. How did you identify him? And can you talk about the recruiting
process with him and, also, how he has worked so beautifully into your
system.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, the recruiting process with Kendall, his father,
Everette, played for the Pacers and played in the minor leagues in the old CBA
and I coached in the old CBA against Everette. So that helped a lot.  
  
I mean, when he was on his visit, his dad winked at me and said, Kendall's
coming here. He doesn't know it yet, but he's coming here. So that helped a
lot.  
  
We talked about how he would have a green light if he came to Nevada, there
wasn't a yellow light or a red light. It was going to constantly be green. He
had three green lights.  
  
So, you know, when we got the job, our program was like 320th in 3-point
shooting and we knew that that was a big-time deficiency. And we wanted to
play fast and stretch the floor out, and he was perfect. Our ideal player is a
6'6" guy who can play multiple positions. Obviously, Kendall can play the 2,
3, or 4 for us. We makes a couple more 3s and he's going to go down in the
history of the Mountain West as the greatest single season 3-point shooter
ever.  
  
He had a really good year prior to his last year at Purdue. He went through
some things off the floor where a friend had passed away, and so I looked at
that last year at Purdue and we kind of threw those stats out because of his
mental state, because it was a really hard year for him.  
  
So we watched film of him the year before. When he did have confidence and
when he was getting consistent minutes and we felt he was going to be a
perfect fit for us, his attitude was going to be perfect, and he's -- you
know, he's helped us with our identity and style of play. And I love reading
The Fieldhouse, by the way.  
  
Q. Cincinnati's kind of known for its toughness. It's a program that's
built on that with the defense and rebounding. How would you describe the
toughness of the team you're going to face tomorrow?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Coach Mick just does an incredible job. I've watched from afar
for many years. To get his guys to play as hard as they do, I think that's a
number one, you know, trait that you look for in any coach, whether it's the
NFL, college football, any sport, MLB. Like, how hard do your guys play?  
  
That's more important than X and Os. And then how hard can you get them to
play over the course of an entire season? Nobody can respect what he's done
more than I do because, you know, I think that for our program, that's one of
the things we talked about from day one is how do we gain respect from
opponents, how do we gain respect from referees, how do we gain respect from
national media members that we play really, really hard?  
  
Cincinnati's one of those teams that you know year after year after year after
year, you can turn their game on in November, December, January, March.
Doesn't matter. Those dudes play hard. We're going to have to play harder than
we've played all year to stay with them.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got to be one of the most hydrated coaches on the
sideline. You always have a cup of water or something in your hand going up
and down. The question is have you ever had to use the restroom while coaching
a basketball game and seriously thought about leaving?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yes and yes and yes. They're small sips that I'm taking. As
you get older, you've got to use the bathroom a little bit more. And so I do
worry, especially when the timeouts are longer in this tournament. It's been a
great concern of mine. Our staff's well prepared in case I have to leave. So
far, so good, though.  
  
Q. You mentioned that the team was a little bit tight in the first half
of the Texas game. Do you feel like they'll be looser in this game, just being
out on the stage once? You guys are the underdog in this game. The pressure's
not on your guys, per se.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think as long as we can keep me out of the locker room and
not do pregame, they'll be a lot looser, because I'm wound pretty tight.  
  
One of the assistants said, maybe I should chill a little bit before the game
and the guys will chill. At halftime, I looked over to my left as I was
writing on the dry erase board ask Cody was throwing up. Which happens almost
every game. He was not sick. But Cody finds a trash can every game and throws
up.  
  
I looked at Caleb, and Caleb said, Hey, coach, he's cool. Don't worry about
him, just ignore him.  
  
I do think we were tight. I don't think we'll be tight because I think every
team -- I think Cincinnati's going to feel freer. I think we'll feel freer. I
think anybody that advances, new arena, you're playing in an NBA-type arena,
sold-out building. You know, incredible for the student-athletes to be able to
play in this environment.  
  
So, yeah, I think that, you know, we should be a little bit looser. I don't
think it matters who we're playing. I think that it was trying to get that
first game out.  
  
But I do know that, you know, the more film we watch on Cincinnati -- maybe we
should stop rolling the film on Cincinnati, because they can make you a little
bit tight too, the way they play and how hard they rebound the ball.  
  
Q. Cody is kind of known for his halftime throw-ups. What was your
thought process when you first saw him do that?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Our trainer said don't worry about it. Ignore it. At first, I
thought the guy had the flu. But then you can't have the flu for 31 games. So
now it's just part of our routine.  
  
Q. Mariah was a little bit of a social media maven, was trending for her
little hit during the game. Says she wants to be a sports anchor. What's your
advice on her future career?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I just hope my daughter can make as much money as my wife did
at broadcasting. That would be awesome. Really, really be great for our family
if she could start on her broadcasting career as soon as possible.  
  
Last night was a great start. It was a great interview process for her. We
have tape now that we can roll and send to people.  
  
It was a big, big moment for her, Chris, for sure. Big moment for our family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Before we dismiss, we had Mick comment on the big upset last
night, 16 over 1. Do you have a comment on that game? Observation?  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: My only observation is that's why this is the greatest
sporting event in the world. When things like that happen, it's so cool. So
cool for all of us to be a part of this environment.  
  
I played in two of these -- well, I don't know if I played, but I was in
uniform in two of these. I'm 53 years old, and it's still putting on a
uniform. And walking out for an NCAA tournament game as a player or coach,
there's nothing better.  
  
Coaching in an NBA game doesn't compare to what goes on here. When you see an
upset like that, it's absolutely incredible.  
  
Q. Mick also was correcting media members who don't know how to say
Nevada and his players who don't know how to say Nevada. Did you always know
how to say the name of the state correctly? What is your reaction when people
call it Nevada?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I always knew because I took a visit, and Coach Allen, Coach
Sonny Allen made sure the day I got off the plane for one of my five official
visits that I knew how to pronounce it.  
  
I give Coach Mick a lot of credit for being on top of his states, knowing
exactly how to pronunciate our wonderful state.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the Wolf Pack tomorrow against the Bearcats at 5:10.
Thank you, Coach. Good luck.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Caleb Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35053)

### [Kendall Stephens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27911)

### [Cody Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35052)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Nevada Wolf Pack out of the Mountain West Conference is
next. Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, and Kendall Stephens represent the student
body.  
  
We'll go right to questions.  
  
Q. For all the players, what was it that drew you to Nevada, if I said
that rightly, I hope? What was the attraction when you were looking for a
place to transfer and what has made the school and the program work so well?  
CALEB MARTIN: I mean, for me, I say Nevada too. But when I first got there,
people said you're saying it wrong. It's supposed to be Nevada. I still say
Nevada, so it's cool.  
  
Just the attraction to the school was you could see the uprising of the
program and Coach Musselman and his NBA background. And the style of play was
very important for us, especially coming from NC State, which we ran a UCLA
offense.  
  
I just think the main attraction was how he wanted us to gamble on defense,
how freely he wanted us to play, how fast he wanted us to play and just how he
-- the player/coach relationship was a big thing for us.  
  
CODY MARTIN: For me, it's pretty much the same thing. But another thing that
kind of attracted us here was he recruits a lot of transfers and it's easy to
connect with those guys because you're coming from somewhere where you kind of
had the same experience and, you know, I think that's what our chemistry has a
lot to do with. You get here and you connect all on the same level. Once you
figure out that people have the same experience as you, it's just a lot better
playing for the guy next to you. So it makes it a lot more fun.  
  
KENDALL STEPHENS: Yeah, I think it being a winning culture and kind of what
the coaching staff presented to us on our visits, really they mapped out and
gave us a good blueprint of what they expected individually and as a team.
Once they did that, it kind of felt like the right decision. It was a kind of
a no-brainer for my part.  
  
Q. In looking ahead to tomorrow, when you're facing Cincinnati, they are
statistically one of the best defensive teams in the country. But what do you
guys see on them, on film, that makes them such a good team defensively?  
CODY MARTIN: After watching film and prepping for them, I think the biggest
thing is they rebound like mad men and all of them go to the glass. That makes
them a really hard team.  
  
They don't initially score on their first shots, but they always get second
chance rebounds. They score a lot. They draw a lot of FTAs. But because of
that, there will be things we can take advantage of.  
  
But that's what makes them really good. They're tough guys. They're gritty.
We're in for a dog fight.  
  
KENDALL STEPHENS: Exactly everything he said. They're just very physical team.
They pride themselves on defense and toughness. But at the same time, they
still have deficits, weaknesses that we're looking forward to taking advantage
of.  
  
Q. Cody and Caleb, you'll see a familiar face on the other bench
tomorrow in Kyle Washington. Can you talk about the relationship with him and
do you stay in touch during the season?  
CALEB MARTIN: Yeah. Kyle's my guy. I just saw him walking over there. I talked
to him for a little bit, talked to him before the game yesterday. He's rooting
us on, stuff like that.  
  
But at the end of the day, whenever the clock starts tomorrow, we can't be
friends no more. We'll have to wait until afterwards. He knows that.  
  
Gary Clark is my boy too. We get together a lot over the summer and hoop in
Raleigh a lot.  
  
But yeah, I got a couple guys. Those are my guys. But, I mean, they know, same
thing goes for us too. Whenever the clock starts, we can be friends
afterwards, but we're all here for the same reason. That's to advance.  
  
CODY MARTIN: Same thing pretty much. Those are our guys. At the end of the
day, it's nice to see your friends and stuff succeed. But at the end of the
day, in this situation, only one person can advance. So we want it to be us.
At the end of the day, it's going to be a dog fight and we know how much we
put into it. And we all have the same mindset, so I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. To go off that question for both you guys, Kyle said he was really
impressed when you came into NC State that you held your own as freshmen, that
you were able to kind of talk mess, as he said, in a way that he wasn't
expecting.  
What are your memories of Kyle or any good stories you might have of playing
with him at NC State?  
  
CODY MARTIN: I have a lot of memories of Kyle. He was there for me when I had
some tough situations when I was there. But he's a king of trash talk when we
were there and he kind of rubbed off on us. We were pretty decent at it when
we got there, but he took it to another level.  
  
It was nice, having the experience with him. Like I said, it's nice to see
that he went somewhere and succeeded in doing what he wants to. Yes, we just
have a lot of memories of him. Good dude.  
  
CALEB MARTIN: Pretty much the same thing off that. He was kind of our big
brother there, when we came there as freshmen, and he got us through the whole
entire college experience while he was there. You know, we loved each other
like brothers and we fought each other like brothers.  
  
I remember me and Cody in practice would be on the same team and Kyle would be
on the other team. Somebody would go for a rebound, somebody would get hit
hard and next thing you know, we're all squaring up against each other. It's
all love after practice. It's nothing changed. So everything's the same.  
  
Q. Kendall, kind of like Texas, they like to play at a slower pace.
What's going to be the key to getting your rhythm early rather than having to
take kind of the first half like you did against the Longhorns?  
KENDALL STEPHENS: We feel like we have a better offense than them. At the same
time, slowing them down, transitioning on defense is going to be key for us.
They get a lot of points off of transition points and fast breaks and off of
turnovers.  
  
So I think if we take care of the ball like we've been doing this season, as
well as stopping them in transition, it's going to work for our favor.  
  
Q. They say a brother is born for adversity. What's the earliest memory
that you guys have of you guys really competing and going at each other and
not wanting to stop until one of you guys won?  
CALEB MARTIN: I'll go first. I mean, ever since I honestly can remember,
honestly, like we used to fight over -- it wasn't even only about sports. It
would be just about anything.  
  
But one memory I have, just playing outside, and I think we got mad at each
other for some reason and somebody, I think Cody had grabbed -- we went to a
carnival or something like that. He had one of the balls I won from a contest
and he kicked the ball in the woods for some reason, because I beat him or
something. He didn't know his was laying three feet next to me so I grabbed
his, kicked it in the woods.  
  
Next thing you know, we were rolling around in the grass fighting each other
until the next door neighbor had to go get my mom, tell her to come out there
and grab us, because she knew we wasn't going to stop.  
  
I mean, there's so many of that -- certain situations like that, we used to
just fight over anything. Doesn't matter if it was cards, basketball,
whatever, a video game. It doesn't matter.  
  
CODY MARTIN: Pretty much. I mean, there's a lot of them, but another thing is
whenever we're playing Madden and stuff, it's like at the end of the game, he
gets a pick six to win the game, I get mad.  
  
Next thing you know, we're fighting on the couch, put a hole in the wall. It
is what it is.  
  
Q. Follow-up question to that, have you guys ever said let's take it to
the court to sort of iron out the differences, like have those late night
sessions on campus or whatever, where you say look, meet me in the gym and
let's go at it?  
CODY MARTIN: We do that regardless, but it always ends up in a fistfight
anyway.  
  
CALEB MARTIN: We can never finish the game. That's why a lot of times when we
play pickup, we can't guard each other because we can't finish the game,
because me and Cody will be over there fighting, and it will be football. It
won't be basketball anymore.  
  
Q. Cody, how would you describe Nevada's offensive system and what is
your guys' mentality on that side of the ball?  
CODY MARTIN: For our offense, I think a lot of it is Coach Muss has an NBA
mentality in terms of spacing and position-less basketball. I think that's
what really helps us out, playing five guards. And we can really spread the
floor. It's something that you don't really have to worry about getting the
ball to necessarily a 1 guy when you get the rebound and go.  
  
I think that has a lot to do with our team and how versatile our team is all
across the board. Being able to switch 1 through 5 makes life a lot easier. I
know for our offense, for our offense, we can drive and kick. If people try to
take away the 3-ball, we can get to the lane and finish. I think we just have
a lot of things that we can go to in terms of, like, tough situations and
things like that. There's nothing that we primarily rely on.  
  
Q. A light question for Cody and Caleb. Since you guys are so identical
with your beards and hair styles, has there been any point in your career
where you've tried to fool an official during the game?  
CALEB MARTIN: Fool an official? I mean, I'm sure there's been a couple times,
like, during halftime where somebody's playing bad or maybe one of us has got
too many fouls. If somebody's playing good, they want to switch. Say if I'm
playing well and he's not, and I got like four fouls and he's got like two,
I'm sure we've been tempted a couple times to switch jerseys. But I don't want
him playing my minutes and he don't want me playing his minutes. I'm
definitely not going to let him take mine.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I mean, pretty much the same thing. I feel like sometimes they do
a pretty good job at that, messing up themselves. I don't blame them. So it
is.  
  
Q. Your competitive nature, does it have anything to do with the fact
that your mom had to take three jobs to make sure you guys had everything that
you had and you didn't have to worry about anything? And the sacrifice that
she made, it's like just the fact that you're paying her back by living your
dreams out?  
CALEB MARTIN: I mean, for sure. Just like you said, like the way we grew up
and stuff, like nothing was ever given so I think that plays a big role in how
we went through our college career and how we play on the court.  
  
She's instilled that kind of, you got to earn everything, mentality. Just the
way she got it. So that's just the way we try to instill our play into our
games and make sure that we show everybody that our game isn't just, for my
own example, just shooting 3s. I want to go get a rebound.  
  
At the end of the day, we want to be the last people standing. I think that
just plays a big role in the way we play too.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I think that has a lot to do with it too. I think the biggest
thing for us is seeing her go through that and her sacrificing what she had to
sacrifice for us to allow us to do what we want to do.  
  
We have that kind of mentality that we're going to fight for everything we
have and nobody is going to take it away from us at least without us giving
100 percent. I think that has a lot to do with it. I know that she's proud of
us. Every time we step on the court, every time we practice, everything like
that, it's bigger than just us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, very good job. Congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The head coach of the Musketeers is with us, Chris Mack. We're
going to ask him to start off with a statement and then we'll go to the first
questions right here. Chris?  
  
CHRIS MACK: Sure. I mean, we'll always feel fortunate any time we can advance
in the NCAA tournament. Now there are 32 teams. Probably less now, 30 teams
left to win a national championship. And we play a very talented, together,
hard-playing group in Florida State tomorrow.  
  
We're going to have to be at our best, certainly have to take care of the
basketball. And keep them off the glass. If we do that, hopefully we can
figure out a way to win.  
  
Q. Chris, the old adage about, you know, anything can happen in the NCAA
tournament, that's why they call it March Madness seems to always hold true.  
I'm wondering, as the head coach of a No. 1 seed that had just hours prior
completed your 1 versus 16 game, how did you experience hearing or watching
the Virginia result? And was that a little bit jarring as the coach of a
fellow 1-seeded team?  
  
CHRIS MACK: I don't know if it had anything to do with what we were seeded.
But, you know, maybe we can relate a little bit to it more, because, you know,
in the history of our program, we had never been a 1 seed.  
  
I thought UMBC played -- at least I watched the last 10, 15 minutes of the
game, played amazing. They played with such poise. They played together. They
didn't let the moment rattle them.  
  
I think that no matter who you are, 1 seed, 10 seed, 16 seed, that's how you
have to play this time of the year to advance, because the moment, the
environment can start to be overwhelming if you start to think about that and
not of the task at hand.  
  
So amazing game. Those kids will be remembered for the rest of their lives for
what they did last night. It was pretty school. I can also feel for Tony
Bennett who does it the right way. He's a phenomenal coach. He's a great
person. He had a special year. Tough to see him go out like that.  
  
Q. Chris, going into the tournament, there was some talk about Virginia,
as well as they were playing, that their style of play, so reliant on the
defensive end, that maybe it was a little precarious in the NCAA tournament
where some might say you have to score to win in the tournament.  
Do you have any thoughts on that?  
  
CHRIS MACK: Well, you better score if you want to win. I think that Virginia
could certainly win a national championship. I think you're fooling yourself
if you don't think a style like that could do it. You look at the history of
the NCAA tournament, you know, whether it's UNLV, the Runnin' Rebels of the
'90s, Syracuse with their zone. Any type of team can win.  
  
But I will say that it's a little difficult, when you play mostly in the half
court and you get down 10 or 12 points and you're not used to manufacturing
points in a hurry, it's probably hard to catch up a little bit more.  
  
But that doesn't mean that their style or our style is more conducive to win a
national championship, in my opinion.  
  
Q. Chris, with a year in hindsight, how did you guys do what you did to
Florida State last year? Can you take anything away from that game this time
around because they have such a different team?  
CHRIS MACK: Yeah. We were and we are now petrified of their ball pressure and
their ability to rattle offenses. They get out in the passing lanes and deny.
They have such incredible makeup ability when you get around them at blocking
shots and that leading to the break.  
  
We talked an awful lot a year ago about handling the basketball, handling the
pressure that Florida State brings. We ran a few set plays. I think we got
Florida State on their heels early in the game, and then I think, you know,
the game sort of avalanched.  
  
I don't think we, as a team, were as good as we played for 40 minutes, and I
don't think Florida State was as poorly of a team as they played for that 40
minutes.  
  
Having said that, it will have nothing to do with tomorrow. We have to be able
to handle their ball pressure and not let them turn us over. So that they're
getting out in transition. No team in the country is stopping 2-on-1s and
3-on-1s.  
  
Q. Chris, I was wondering, is preparing for Florida State, is it similar
system-wise, or is it different because they have so many different players
than the key guys from last year's team?  
CHRIS MACK: Good question. From the defensive end, I would say it's very
similar because of their style of play. It's personnel driven when you start
to talk the offensive side of the game.  
  
To me, Florida State is a more together team. You know, I don't want to say
it's equal opportunity, but you have three guys averaging around 12 to 13, 14
a game. You have three guys that are almost at ten a game.  
  
You know, you have their 4-man using ball screens just as much as their point
guard. So I see a team that plays for one another, that plays together. I
think it's a much better sum of its parts team than maybe a year ago.  
  
That's no disrespect to the guys that were on the team a year ago, but that's
sort of what happens when guys start to climb up the draft boards and they
feel like they're auditioning in March a little bit.  
  
So we just have to worry about keeping those guys, as best we can, out of the
lane and off the glass and then handling ball pressure that we're going to see
tomorrow.  
  
Q. With that said, when you're going up against a team same position as
a year ago, second round, trip to the Sweet 16 on the line, how much do you
prepare your team for Florida State looking for some revenge and payback, and
a trip to Los Angeles?  
CHRIS MACK: I mean, I don't know how you would prepare them for that. You just
say it. Hey, they want revenge. I mean, it's not going to change anything X
and O-wise. Our guys want to go to Los Angeles too.  
  
You know, this year's a new experience. This is our 96th team in school
history and these group of guys will never be together again.  
  
So if we want to keep playing, then we'll figure out a way to win. It's not
going to be easy. I'm sure Florida State's going to do the same in their
locker room.  
  
Q. So I guess Trayvon Reed ends up being pretty good preparation for the
kind of front court you're going to face tomorrow night. What?  
CHRIS MACK: I just don't get why we keep seeing these 7'4" guys. When I go
recruiting, they're never around.  
  
Q. Last year too, right? Arizona.  
CHRIS MACK: Yeah.  
  
Q. Same approach? You want to go at those guys? I mean, that's your
philosophy? And does two inches of difference for the 7'4 " player make any
difference for you?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, the difference is what's surrounding their big guys. You
know, Florida State, as a whole, they have bigger, stronger, more talented
players than Texas Southern.  
  
No disrespect to Texas Southern, but you have Trayvon Reed and a bunch of guys
who are 6'4". No you have Phil Cofer, 6'8", 6'9", shooting 3s. Every one of
their wings are 6'5", 6'6", 225. I mean, they're high major, ACC caliber,
talented players.  
  
So we know that, and we're going to have to deal with that.  
  
Q. Do we know any more about Naji today?  
CHRIS MACK: He didn't feel great this morning so we held him out of practice.
We're hopeful that he'll be well enough to play tomorrow. But I'm not trying
to be coy. I just don't know. Hopefully, his back loosens up over the next 24
hours.  
  
The good thing is, as you guys know who have had lower back problems or any
type of problem physically, usually feel a little bit better at night than you
do in the morning so I'm glad our game's later on in the evening.  
  
Q. Out of all the basketball places we have in this country, I wonder if
you could describe maybe what distinguishes and characterizes the City of
Cincinnati.  
CHRIS MACK: From a basketball standpoint or just in general?  
  
You know, I would think that we have two programs that have a lot of pride in
their traditions, in their history. I think you have two programs that are led
by guys who played high school basketball right there in the city.  
  
You have two very passionate fan bases that hopefully are handling their
alcohol here in Nashville on St. Patrick's Day.  
  
You have really good basketball players. You have some great players over the
years. One of the best players of all time, Oscar Robertson, you know.  
  
So there's a lot of tradition. There are a lot of other things that go on in
the city. You have the Reds, you have the Bengals. So maybe college basketball
in college towns may be a little different.  
  
But it's pretty school what we have going on right now in our city.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Chris, thank you. Good luck.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach of the Florida State Seminoles is with us, Leonard
Hamilton. We'll have him open up with a statement and then go to questions.
Coach?  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Obviously, I was very pleased with the outcome of the game
last night. I thought that our guys were connected defensively early in the
game, and we were able to get some significant stops and deflections and
steals that gave us some easy opportunities. A lot of that is because
Missouri's similar to us in terms of youthful inexperience.  
  
But tomorrow's game is different because we're playing against an extremely
experienced team with a lot of quality depth, a team that's very well
connected together, and that we're going to have to be a little sounder
defensively. We're going to have to execute a lot better offensively because
this team has earned the right to be a No. 1 seed.  
  
They've been ranked in the top three or four teams all year long, at least the
latter part of the season. They deserve that recognition. And we know in order
to be successful, we've got to be at our best to pull this off.  
  
Our kids are excited about it. We're looking forward to the challenge.
Hopefully, we can accomplish our goal by moving on in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, Xavier's Trevon Bluiett is considered one of the best scorers
in the country. What makes him so effective, from your perspective?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, he's extremely confident. He's a typical, born and
bred Indiana basketball player. You hear about how passionate Indiana's fans
are and how basketball is a way of life in Indiana. He represents that.  
  
He's a confident, talented scorer. And within their system, he is a guy who is
their go-to guy, at least one of them. And he plays with an extreme amount of
confidence. They depend on him and he delivers night in and night out.  
  
He is very clever and smart in how he utilizes his abilities within their
system. No one has seemed to have had an answer for him all year long.  
  
Q. Leonard, what, if anything, can you take away from a game that
happened 12 months ago when you played them? I know you're a completely
different team. Are they similar to what they were last year? Better?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think they're better than they were last year, because
they're older, more experienced. They have basically the entire team coming
back, maybe with the exception of a couple role players. I think they're
older, more mature.  
  
Emotionally, they don't get rattled during critical parts of the game. I've
watched several game films of them. Even some of the games where they have
been challenged, they never seem to lose their composure. And so they're not
going to miss shots unless you make them miss.  
  
Defensively, they have a sound, fundamental defensive system that's connected.
They have the right balance offensively of an inside and offensive outside
attack. They execute in the half court when time comes. They have a system
that really fits who they are.  
  
And so at this time, when you're in the NCAA tournament, the challenge for all
teams is for us to be the best of who we are. I think their experience,
they're going to be consistent with being who they are.  
  
Hopefully, the challenge of the moment will bring the best out of us. I think
our effort will be good. I think we're who we are in terms of an experience
standpoint, but I know we're going to give a tremendous effort. I like our
kids' attitude, and we know we've got to be at our best in order to be
successful.  
  
Q. How's Terance Mann doing and is he going to be able to practice
today, his status for tomorrow?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We won't have what you call a typical practice today,
because we were here until about 12:30 last night. I think we probably got to
bed around 2:00. So we will have, basically, a game preparation-type practice,
understanding that we've got to be full go tomorrow.  
  
Terance has gone to the doctor today. I have not gotten any results from that.
I think he's had a couple of -- an MRI to see kind of where he is. I think he
has a groin strain. He was quite sore last night.  
  
I don't expect him to play, unless the doctor comes and tells me something
different. But we have to wait and see. I don't have anything officially I can
tell you other than that he had been bothered by that prior to coming to the
tournament.  
  
If you noticed last night, there was several kids that slipped on the floor.
Obviously, I hope that's not the case when we play tomorrow night, but he did
take a -- he did slide, and it was very painful, and we just thought that he
was not at the level that we could utilize him for the remainder of the game.  
  
I'll know more hopefully when I talk to the doctors, maybe before or even
after practice.  
  
Q. Leonard, just in terms of preparation on a short turnaround, does it
help at all going against a team that you do have some familiarity with, you
otherwise wouldn't, who still has some of the same players?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think because they've been so successful, they've been on
TV so much, our kids are somewhat familiar with them. It's one thing to watch
them and to see them on film. It's another thing to go out and execute against
them.  
  
They are very talented, very well coached and they're one of the top three or
four teams in the country. But because we're in the ACC, we play against this
level of competition on a regular basis. I'm hopeful that that will allow our
kids to have a certain level of confident maturity or at least the right
mental approach to understand that this is an ACC caliber type team and that
we've faced them before.  
  
The bottom line is you've got to go out and play. We've got to come as close
as we can to reaching our full potential because with their experience that
they have, they've shown that they're pretty much going to be on point.  
  
Q. Also, P.J. looks like he's rounded into form over the last couple
weeks, hit some big shots last night. How much did that injury affect him. Now
that he's healthy, has he kind of given you what you want to get out of him?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We've had three major injuries this year, obviously with
Trent being out for seven weeks and Christ Koumadje being out seven weeks. It
kind of slowed our progress up.  
  
But when P.J. went down with a bone bruise, we lost our best shooter. It took
him a while to get his confidence and get back in the groove. Obviously having
a guy like that who's capable of knocking down shots from anywhere on the
floor is important because we're playing against a team that has several guys
that are capable of shooting the ball as well as P.J. shoots it.  
  
So we definitely need him, and he's coming around. His defense has been
consistent. He's finding a way to play within our system. He's confident that
he's -- we're confident in him that we can get him a number of open looks that
the majority of those shots will go down.  
  
There have been games this year we have not shot the ball well from the
perimeter. Hopefully, this won't be one tomorrow.  
  
Thank you very much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Jacob Evans III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35141)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Bearcats are with us. They will play Nevada tomorrow at
5:10 central time, the first of two games of a doubleheader. As mentioned,
Jacob Evans III, Gary Clark, Kyle Washington are with us. We'll go right to
questions.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get your reaction to Virginia's defeat last night.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think it's one of the biggest upsets in sports history,
honestly. I mean, it was just crazy, you know. Tony Bennett is a great coach
and a great person. Playing against Virginia in the ACC. They're a great
program. It was pretty shocking, honestly. But, you know, Jairus Lyles and
UMBC did a great job. They competed. That's what the tournament is about and
that's what basketball's about. If you believe you can achieve anything, you
can do it. It sounds cliche, but, I mean, I believe it.  
  
JACOB EVANS III: It just shows that in this tournament, that every team in it
is pretty good. No matter what the seeding is or what the record was with the
16 and 1, you just got to make sure you're always ready to come out and play.  
  
Q. With that being said, you're now the highest seed in the South
Region. Is the target now maybe transferred to your back? How do you have to
make sure you respond to that?  
GARY CLARK: You can agree with that, being that our defense is -- they say
defense wins championships. So with that, us being so good on defense, I think
a lot of teams will probably be keying, having like such a good game to where
they can't make mistakes because they know we'll capitalize on that.  
  
So you wonder why teams have such good halves with guys hitting five or seven
3s against us. The scouting report is you can't make mistakes, and just try to
get buckets.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you talk about your relationship with the Martin twins from
your days at North Carolina State and what kind of players you think they are.
What problems do they present?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: No, I don't want to hype them up too much, but they are great
players. And they're competitors. They play extremely hard and they're fierce.  
  
I have a great relationship with them. I'm not going to hide. I'm not going to
deny it. That's not going to translate when we get in the 94 feet. I'm going
to compete against them like anybody else, because we're trying to achieve
something as a team.  
  
But, you know, we're extremely close. We were talking during the season. They
changed that program over at Nevada and I'm happy for them. They've been
through a lot, and I'm just happy to see their success.  
  
But, you know, we're going to compete hard against them no matter what.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, what do you -- I guess in what you've seen so
far, what does Nevada do particularly well, and how can you combat that?  
JACOB EVANS III: Well, they score the ball. They're a high efficiency
offensive team. They can push the ball in transition with either five guys on
the court and they have shooters, you know, even one through five, everyone
can shoot the ball. That's dangerous.  
  
You also have guys that can attack off the dribble.  
  
GARY CLARK: I agree with what Jacob said. They spread you out and everyone can
make a play or make a shot to where they really can hurt you. And being that
all five guys push the ball, you've got to be on high alert at all times. One
guy can't run back and just guard their man. Everybody got to get back and get
set up because their shooters shoot from deep and none of them have really a
slow trigger.  
  
Everyone's -- they're looking to get it up fast.  
  
Q. For any of you, 5'10 " point guard. Nevada measures 6'7" across all
five spots. Would you expect them to do a little post-up on your smaller
guy?  
JACOB EVANS III: We've seen that over the course of the year, teams try to
post our point guards up. But we're game planning for it, preparing for what
comes that way.  
  
Q. Kyle, were you closer to one of the Martin brothers than the other?
And what do you think about the fact you guys played together on a Sweet 16
team and now you're playing each other for the right to go to the Sweet 16?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think it's just funny how the world works, how it all comes
full circle. I told my best friend on the team, I said, I'm not going to be
able to tell the difference when they came in the first, like, day or so.  
  
They're very different, the two. But I was close -- I was just as close as one
with the other. So, you know, like I said, we're going to compete hard and if
people know me the way they know me, it doesn't matter who you are. I'm going
to compete against them as hard as I compete against anybody else.  
  
Q. Gary, you mentioned defense wins championships. There are those that
say that Virginia's style of play, relying so heavily on the defensive end, is
a style that's a little precarious in the NCAA tournament. There are those who
say you need to score to be successful in the NCAA tournament.  
Where is that balance for you and what do you think -- where is that
defensive/offensive balance for you in terms of success in the tournament?  
  
GARY CLARK: I think being able to -- our team being versatile defensively
adapting to whatever teams throw at us, like, you know, all year, we've seen
different things as far as teams throwing at us with no post guys or having
one dominant post guy.  
  
So, you know, we have to turn our defense into offense. And a lot of times, it
doesn't work that way, where we have to score the ball on the offensive end.
So I think we just, as a unit, we recognize what we have to do that night and
just get it done.  
  
Q. Does this team remind you a lot of SMU with their length and the fact
that they play a limited amount of players?  
JACOB EVANS III: Yeah. Most definitely, because they only play six, seven
guys. They're really close. They have great chemistry on the court. Also, they
can attack you different ways on offense, how SMU was last year. And they
cause matchup problems, one through five.  
  
But we're going to prepare for them and be ready to play tomorrow.  
  
GARY CLARK: Yes, definitely. They spread us out, you know. You think -- you
try to wear them down, because they only have six guys, but, you know, they're
so used to it all year, playing that way, where they make adjustments and, you
know, they try not to foul.  
  
But SMU last year definitely was one of those, just like this team, where
everyone could kill you on any position and just cause terrible matchup
problems, offensive rebounding, and it all just spread you out, gives them
several different weapons they can use.  
  
Q. All three of you came to Cincinnati from elsewhere. I wonder if you
could describe or maybe play tour guide, what it's like as a basketball city.
What it's like to live with the two big programs right there next to each
other and so on.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think it's interesting. Xavier's obviously a pretty good
basketball program also. But I just think that Cincinnati as a city loves
basketball, and they embrace the college atmosphere and the two programs and
two styles. Two different cultures, so I think it's interesting.  
  
GARY CLARK: Yeah, definitely. I didn't realize the exact -- the intensity
between the two. You know, being from Carolina, you have Duke/Carolina/NC
State. You don't really see much of it unless you're born into one of those
homes.  
  
But it's intense. You love -- the city loves a rivalry. It's like split right
in the middle of some households. It's funny to hear one brother say UC, the
other brother says Xavier.  
  
But, you know, you live for the rivalry.  
  
JACOB EVANS III: Honestly, coming from Louisiana, it's just exciting to see
fans around the city that actually like basketball. Basketball is not a big
sport where I'm from. So just having people that's interested is great for me.  
  
Q. Mick likes to talk about your program as a developmental program. He
doesn't get a lot of one-and-done guys. He likes to bring players in and
develop them. Gary and Jacob, you've been there the longest. Can you talk
about what it's like to be in a program like that? Do you take pride in that?
And what you think that means.  
JACOB EVANS III: Most definitely, you know. Just showing how much your hard
work pays off, year after year. It's actually -- it just helps you grow as a
player, you know. Once you see that improvement coming from your hard work, it
just makes you want to keep working harder and keep getting better as a
player.  
  
GARY CLARK: Definitely. You know, every year, to see the development I was
going through, you know, it was tough sometimes. But I think now, as a senior,
I really get to -- I'm glad I stayed the course. I talk to our young guys,
Keith and Trevor, about how important it is, every summer, to really lock in.  
  
Talking to Trevor now about playing with confidence. Just never get
discouraged and constantly keep working at it. And I just can't be more
thankful that I had coaches every summer that constantly just show me film and
just get me to develop my game.  
  
Q. Speaking of development, just talk about the progress that Jarron's
made this year. He had an amazing game yesterday.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Jarron has always been a great player, from his freshman
year, he's had impact games. Whenever he had his chance and whenever we needed
it, he was always there.  
  
So Jarron, the sky's the limit for him. Going off of Gary's point, we just
kind of keep on -- reinforce the idea of keep on working hard. Don't worry
about adversity. Keep on striving. Because, you know, they're going to be
great.  
  
But Ted, you know, sky's the limit for him. I love him.  
  
Q. To follow up on the developmental thing, do you think it's good for
college basketball to have more programs like that, given some of the things
that are going on now across the country? Is it good for the game?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Do I think development is good for the game in college?  
  
Yeah, I think it is, for sure, because sometimes people want instant success.
Some people want that overnight success. Sometimes when you want something
great, it's going to take a long time. You have to put a lot of time into it
and you're going to have to make a lot of sacrifice.  
  
But at the end of the day, I think it will be more -- the long-term
gratification will be more satisfying, honestly. Just to stick with something
and for people to see examples of it. Sometimes people aren't going to wake up
and just be a number one pick. So I like it.  
  
GARY CLARK: I agree. I talk to our guys about running their own race and not
getting discouraged when you see the other guys you played against and see
them going one and done and get really discouraged each year seeing those guys
making their dreams come true.  
  
You've just got to focus on yours. It's definitely good for the game because
it just shows other guys that just because they didn't take, you know, they
didn't take one year for him to get it, he take four years and look at his
career that he's had, the four years and not just one year and out.  
  
Q. Gary and Jacob, a hallmark of this team is you guys don't get too
high during a game or too low. You're very even keeled. What do you attribute
that to? Is it your personalities? Is it your coach? Is it the way the program
is set up? How has it served you this year?  
JACOB EVANS III: Well, you know, it's a long game. Coach preaches that to us
all the time. He tells us teams are going to go on their runs, we're going to
go on ours, just make sure at the end of the game that we're winning. No
matter what happens during the game, we just try to stay focused, stay locked
in on our game plan and make sure we're doing the right things offensiveily
and defensively.  
  
GARY CLARK: I said it yesterday in one of the interviews, a team can't be hot
the whole game, whether they start off hot or end in the second half hot, you
know, you just got to waver the storm. I think it comes from Coach constantly
telling us play defense and rebound. All else will just come full circle for
us.  
  
And we typically do that. Whether we're down 18 when we're home against
Houston or, you know, up and lose a lead. We just constantly keep digging at
it and eventually, you know, we'll be successful.  
  
Q. I guess this would be for any of you guys, but between Virginia
losing, Arizona going down, Miami also being upset, it seems like the South
Region in general is kind of -- is kind of opening up for you.  
Is it hard for you guys not to look ahead and sort of say, yeah, you know,
there's potential here for us to advance pretty far in this tournament?  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think the point you're alluding to is looking past this
game. I think if you look past anything, you could fall short. And in this
tournament, you don't get a second chance.  
  
So if we look past Nevada, that would be our first mistake before stepping on
the court. So we're definitely not looking past Nevada. Like I said before,
the benefit of going to Cincinnati is we're going to prepare for everybody
like it's a round of 32 games.  
  
We've been preparing for people -- we've been preparing for Western Carolina
early in the season before anybody was, you know, talking about this.  
  
So that's the benefit of going here. We're not going to overlook anybody, and
we're not going to underestimate our competition.  
  
Q. Guys, I don't know if you're aware of the phrase on social media,
"Gary Clark is a problem." But just curious, for Kyle and Jacob, what makes
Gary a problem? And then if Gary could talk about that as well.  
JACOB EVANS III: Well, you know, he can do everything on the court: pass,
score, rebound, defend. He's a great leader. He leads with -- he's not that
vocal all the time, but he'll tell you when you need to step it up.  
  
He also leads by example, you know. So just him being a problem in all phases
of the game, you know, I could definitely say that statement is true.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Yeah, I mean, Gary Clark has done so much for this program. I
mean, people can say it, but then they don't fully understand the aspect of
that idea and that statement, because, you know, first of all, he has meat
cleavers at the end of his wrist and he jumps out the gym.  
  
And his defensive IQ is -- his IQ for basketball in general is out the roof.
He's just a great leader. We understood, you know, the three of us and the
rest of our team understood what it took for us to be good and for us to keep
on making big strides.  
  
He was one of the catalysts for it. He understood what it took. He's been here
the whole time. I'm just glad to see all the success that he has. He deserves
all of it.  
  
GARY CLARK: I think when I hear it -- or, you know, first thing I think about
is rebounding and defense. When people -- the scoring is cool and all, but I
think when I'm really a problem is when I'm blocking shots, rebounding and
just dominating on the defensive end in any aspect.  
  
I think one of my favorite plays would probably be at Memphis when I fell and
got back up, and I was like, okay. That's when I realized, okay, I play
defense pretty hard and I think that's -- when you say Gary Clark is a
problem, I think of rebounding, blocking shots and just dominate.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. That was wonderful. Good luck
tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach of the Bearcats is here, Mick Cronin. We're going to
ask him to start off with a statement, then we'll go to questions. Mick,
please.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Well, Happy St. Patrick's Day to all my Irish friends out there,
Terry Nelson. Anybody streaming this back home, make sure you go to Salem
Gardens. It's the best Irish place on the east side.  
  
Obviously, we're happy to still be playing. But focused on Nevada. I hope my
guys said their name right. I tried to tell them it's Nevada.  
  
Eric's a great coach, has been for a long time, and they're a veteran team
that's ninth in the nation in offensive efficiency. So they present a
tremendous challenge as far as their offense.  
  
They spread you out, they can really pass. It's a mark of great coaching when
you watch a guy's team play and they pass a ball the way Eric's team passes
the ball. And it's impressive.  
  
Obviously, they have shot makers, and they compete. They got veteran guys
because of the transfers and the sit-out stuff. They're an older team. And I
think for most of us, we have to be older to win. We don't get the one-and-
done guys. So they're really good.  
  
Impressive comeback yesterday that did not surprise me at all because of the
resolve of their team.  
  
You know, they're a team built on competitive toughness. So I watched them
closely never give in. You could see they would not give an inch. They would
not back down. They kept digging in until they finally got some shots to fall.
Once they got some shots to fall, then they were able to keep grinding and get
enough stops to win the game.  
  
So I expect an extremely hard-fought game with them.  
  
Q. At this point, Virginia's gone, Miami, Arizona. Do you look at how
open this region suddenly is, or do you use Virginia, maybe, as a cautionary
tale for your players before tomorrow?  
MICK CRONIN: I say this with all due respect, I think every region is open.
Every year, whether we're an 8 seed, a 6 seed, everybody puts their pants and
shoes on the same way. We try -- I try to build my program not to take a back
seat to anybody. I try to teach my kids that. All of them may not hear this
growing up, but they're going to hear it from me, that they can be whatever
they want to be, whatever they're willing to work to be.  
  
And they should turn off the TV. People are going to tell them whether they
can win or not or how good they are, it's irrelevant -- if you let that stuff
affect you. So I feel bad for teams that lost. But other than that it doesn't
really mean any -- we won't talk about that.  
  
We're worried about Nevada. That's all that matters. We don't beat Nevada,
whatever happened at some other site is completely irrelevant to us.  
  
And I say that with -- you know, I hold Virginia in high reverence because of
their defensive numbers and they have one of the classiest coaches in the
country. But that being said, my point to you is we always think that we can
win the tournament. We always think that we can win the game, no matter who
we're playing.  
  
Q. Mick, you alluded to that just a second ago, about having to have
older guys to win and you've talked about your program as a developmental
program. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Is that a conscious decision
you made when you got the job that you were going to have to approach it that
way? Do you think it's good for college basketball to have those programs,
given what's going on in the country now?  
MICK CRONIN: I don't want to bore people, but when I got the job, we had no
players, old or young.  
  
But I think whatever -- when you get a job, you've got to understand the
demographic of your situation, of the 99 percentile. Obviously, we got Lance
Stephenson, but we got him really late because the blue bloods didn't take
him.  
  
So you've got to figure out who you can get, and then you've got to figure out
who you can get that you can win with and what is your pathway to success.  
  
And if you get away from it, there's plenty of examples of people that maybe
stayed on it, then got away from it and lost their success, and they had to
get back to it.  
  
So we have to develop players. That's just who -- that's just really who we
are. Doesn't mean we don't try to recruit a lot of guys, you know. Luke
Kennard is in the NBA, played two years at Duke. He's from 45 minutes north of
Cincinnati. We tried hard to get him. It wasn't going to happen. It was what
it was.  
  
Instead, we got a guy named Jacob Evans.  
  
So sometimes you win because you get a guy for four years instead of two. But
there's a lot of decisions to be made when you're running a program, and I
think that you got to have a mix.  
  
It doesn't mean that we wouldn't like to get a guy like Marvin Bagley. So you
get the best guys you can get that are going to help you win games, and you
got to make them better players.  
  
My message to all those one-year guys is we're pretty good at development. We
have to develop players. Give us a shot. Imagine what you could do with Larry
Davis working you out every day. Look at the guy. He looks like he's 27. He's
62.  
  
Q. We're here in Nashville with two large Cincinnati-based programs
here. I wonder if you could play tour guide for a bit and explain what you
think distinguishes and characterizes the City of Cincinnati among the
basketball places that you've been.  
MICK CRONIN: I haven't been that far, because I went a little south to
Louisville and a little further south to Murray State.  
  
So, you know, I wouldn't just say Cincinnati. For the people in college
basketball, you know, there's Tobacco Road. But the NBA scouts would tell you
they fly to Cincinnati because you can stay downtown Cincinnati and go see
Cincinnati and Xavier practice. Then you can drive to Louisville in Kentucky
the next day. You can drive back and go to Ohio State and Indiana. Dayton's
got tremendous basketball history. And I didn't mention Butler.  
  
You know, so we're in the college basketball elite belt. I mean, it's hard to
recruit in our area. There's a lot of big-time programs. Purdue is, what,
three hours from us. You keep throwing them out there.  
  
So it's very competitive. It's hard to continue to be good, because you have
to get some kids from outside the region, because it's tough. It's just tough.
There's not enough kids for all of us to win.  
  
And I will tell you, you know, obviously we both have higher seeds this year.
But Cincinnati and Xavier have been good for a long time. But it's not just --
it's not just in our city. I mean, we're surrounded by it. I would throw this
to you. We both have 13 scholarships, and there's only one guy from Ohio on
our teams. And Chris and I recruit Ohio. It's just hard. You know, there's a
little conference called the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Mick, it's been said in the wake of Virginia's loss that their
reliance on defense -- and one of the best defenses in the country -- but
their reliance on defense is kind of a precarious way to live in the NCAA
tournament that you need to score to be successful in the tournament.  
Your thoughts on that?  
  
MICK CRONIN: I say this, and I'm not trying to be funny. What other people say
doesn't really mean anything to me, unless, you know, like this morning I was
talking to Ralph Willard about something that I think Nevada might do
strategically to us, because I think he's a retired genius of a basketball
coach.  
  
Later today, I'll talk to Rick Pitino while Kevin Willard is playing and I'm
rooting for Seton Hall. But what people say is irrelevant to me.  
  
I think that, you know, people want to bang on Virginia. They ought to look at
Pittsburgh. Because they relied on toughness and defense, and it wasn't enough
for them. And they caused a great, great man to go back to his alma mater, and
now TCU is in the NCAA tournament. And Jamie Dixon, one of the best coaches in
our game.  
  
I know how Pitt won. I was in the Big East with them. I think the NCAA
tournament is a one-game shot. It's called March Madness for a reason. So I'm
going to start rooting for Tony Bennett now when he's not playing me every
game. I think it's just unfair.  
  
You do know -- do those people know he lost one of his best players to an
injury? I think that's more important than the style of play. Let's give the
other team some credit that played great against them.  
  
Q. Nevada goes out with a very perimeter-oriented approach.  
MICK CRONIN: It's Nevada.  
  
Q. Nevada, okay, comes out with a very perimeter-oriented approach.
Obviously, your front court is a strength. Do you see any situation and what
would be the situation where you would go small with Gary Clark at the 5?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, usually, when we do that, it would be Tre Scott at that
position. We change a lot during a game. Sometimes we go big, and we snuck one
in on you where we had Gary at the 3 in the conference tournament for a little
bit. We had foul trouble. Jarron Cumberland was in foul trouble. I was playing
Gary, Tre and Kyle together.  
  
So it's just matchups. We try to adjust as we go. Look, Eric's a really good
coach and his pro background has -- they do a good job of figuring out what
you're doing and getting the isolation situation that they want.  
  
So I think it will be a game of multiple adjustments. That would only be just
one of them. But yes, I could see that happening.  
  
Q. Two questions. What did you know about Nevada before the tournament
started and what have you learned as you've started to delve into it a little
bit?  
MICK CRONIN: You mean as a team?  
  
Q. Yes.  
MICK CRONIN: I got to watch them because they play late. During the season,
I'm a basketball guy. Out of the season, I get away, other than July.  
  
So I've seen them play games on -- they play a lot of CBS Sports Network
games. So, you know, not focusing in on them, I was like, you know, these guys
are a nightmare to play defense against. Just watching them, a lot of high
scoring games. I think they've only scored less than 70 twice this year, which
is unbelievable.  
  
And then, you know, since doing game prep for them, really impressed with the
Martins and their development. They're way better, which is a credit to Eric
Musselman and his staff. Way better players than they were.  
  
Jordan Caroline we recruited when he transferred. Way better player than he
was at Southern Illinois. And Kendall Stephens, you know, those are guys that
-- I didn't get to see Hallice a lot. Darren Savino knows Hallice Cook well.
They're both St. Anthony's guys.  
  
Those four players I had seen them in high school and at their previous stops.
They're way better players. So their player development on those kids has been
tremendous. They're really, really high level players.  
  
Q. Second question, if I may. How much have teams tried to post up
Jenifer a little bit, given the 5'10 " height?  
MICK CRONIN: Not as much as -- we've prepared for it more than you would
think. He and Cane Broome, teams that have tried to post him. Our changing
defenses, you know, I don't know if a lot of college teams do that. But to be
able to post up guards, your other guy's got to be able to shoot.  
  
So a lot of teams, they can't post up our point guards because their other
guys can't shoot. So whoever you go -- you take your 5-man, stand him outside
the line, we're not going to go out there.  
  
So the challenge, what they do a good job of is when Martin goes to the back
down, obviously, Jordan Caroline, Jordan, he can shoot the ball. So they can
go to a spread and a back-down and put four shooters around their posted-up
point guard, which you rarely see. SMU was the only team that did it when
Shake Milton was healthy. They did it to us when he was healthy.  
  
Florida did it a little to us in Newark in a neutral site game. But, again,
they didn't have the shooters quite. But we've seen it.  
  
Q. Mick, if you could speak to Jarron Cumberland's fearlessness, his
tenacity, but also what does he need to do at both ends of the court to take
his game to an even higher level?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, he's got to learn to eat a salad first. The guy's -- I
mean, if Jay Bilas is right and these kids are going to be able to get
endorsements, he's Kraft Mac & Cheese's main man. You've never seen anything
like it. He's not a man of many food groups.  
  
So it's been a fight, you know, because of his body type, when I recruited
him, my pitch wasn't that he was great. I was going to let him shoot every
time.  
  
He came with us because I sat there and told him what he needed to get better
at. He needed to get his body fat down, because he's a guard. And he's down.
And I'm still fighting with him on the food groups.  
  
And he's got to work on his flexibility. His strength's not an issue. So I
have the best guy in the country for that, Mike Rehfeldt. So continuing to try
to get his body loosened up and his body fat down and just get his
conditioning to where he can be a guy that, you know, when we had Sean
Kilpatrick as a senior, it's hard to average 21 a game. You've got to run
around, shoot every ball, and not get tired.  
  
So conditioning is big, maturity is big. He's made a huge jump, though, from
his freshman to his sophomore year. But just continue to develop his body, get
his body fat down, his conditioning up and his ball handling, his left hand.  
  
But these are all things I presented to him during his visit. And fortunately,
he was somebody that respected that. He wanted coaches that were going to help
him get better.  
  
Q. The Wolf Pack are known for their offense. What challenges does their
defense present to you?  
MICK CRONIN: I will say, in fairness to a team that scores the ball as well as
they do, and they can score it fast, their possessions are higher. So your
points per game that you're going to give up is a little higher.  
  
They front the post. They're similar to us in a lot of ways. They scrap, they
fight, they front the post, they switch a lot. And their scouting report,
they're a scouting report team. All you got to do is watch their bench while
they're watching film.  
  
They know every play you run. They're going to be sitting all over -- you're
not going to trick them. You're going to have to take whatever they decide to
take away from you, you're going to have to use it to your advantage.  
  
But their preparation is tremendous. They've got a lot of fight in them. It
all starts with Jordan Caroline. He plays so much bigger than he is. So much.
That's why we wanted him. We tried to get him when he transferred, because
he's got a lot of his dad's traits as far as physical toughness.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mick, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

### [Phil Cofer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35069)

### [Mfiondu Kabengele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35137)

### [Braian Angola](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34253)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Florida State Seminoles are with us out of the ACC. They have a
date with Xavier, tomorrow's second game, 30 minutes after the first.  
  
Student body is represented by Phil Cofer, Trent Forrest, Braian Angola, and
Mfiondu Kabengele.  
  
We will go right to questions.  
  
Q. Trent, going back to last year's game, what happened with the year of
hindsight? And with you guys having such a different team this year, what can
you take from that game last year?  
TRENT FORREST: I feel like just where we came up short, I feel like we've
learned a lot from that time last year to now. And being able to prepare for
this moment, even better than we did last year.  
  
Q. Trent, when you look at them on film, do they look similar to last
year's team? In what ways are they similar? In what ways are they different?
Is it familiar?  
TRENT FORREST: Very familiar. They have a lot of the same players and
personnel. They do a lot of things they did last year. I feel like it's
basically the same team we played last year with a few additions, two freshmen
that they have. I feel like it's basically the same team.  
  
Q. With the differences on your roster, is the focus at this point get a
little payback or just trying to get a win to get to the next round in Los
Angeles?  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: I feel like we have to make sure we just focus on our
principles first, just defend. We look at this game as the next step to get to
the Sweet 16. They're a talented bunch. We knew they got us last year, so it's
in the back of our mind. We have to focus on the goal ahead and focus on the
game.  
  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: Like Mfiondu said, it's another game. We're trying to make a
run to the national title and Xavier is in the way. We'll just try to do what
we do and take care of business.  
  
Q. This would just be for any of you guys. Trent, I think you just
mentioned that they are very similar to what you saw last season. But what, in
particular, does Xavier do well?  
TRENT FORREST: I would say their physicality. They're pretty physical, same as
last year. They got two pretty good scorers with J.P. and Bluiett, so I feel
like those are two key things that they had last year that they have returning
this year.  
  
So I would just say their physicality as an overall team and then they have
two pretty good scorers.  
  
PHIL COFER: Going off what Trent said, definitely a physical team and they're
a great shooting team. So we'll have to do hard contests and keep our
composure even if they make shots and stick to our game.  
  
Q. Phil, Trevon Bluiett, what do you remember about his game from last
year? What makes him such a challenge to defend?  
PHIL COFER: He's a tough shot maker. Like I said, we'll have to hard contest
on him and stick to our principles. I think his shot's going to fall
sometimes, and sometimes they're not. I think we just need to keep doing us on
defense.  
  
Q. Braian, last year against Xavier, you guys shot -- had a hard time
from 3-point range. Given the way that you guys have been able to shoot at
times this season, and shoot lately, do you maybe have a little more
confidence knowing if they give you some looks that they want you to shoot out
of, you can be able to do it?  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: We really don't know what's going to happen during the course
of the game, but we're just trying to follow our principles, do what we do,
move the ball, throw the ball inside to our big man and just play inside out
and just run the floor, take good shoots. If they fall, good for us. If
they're not, just keep doing what we're doing and everything's going to be
fine.  
  
Q. This is, again, for any of you guys. If you could just comment on
Virginia's loss yesterday and what you guys think about it.  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: Virginia's a really talented team. They're really
successful throughout the season. We played them. They're really consistent.
They stayed together. They never folded. To see them lose like that was
surprising because they're a solid bunch.  
  
They lost one of their better players in De'Andre Hunter. It was surprising
because they're such a good team. To see them lose like that was just
shocking, really.  
  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: For myself, it was just they showed you how March is and no
matter -- you made it here for some reason. Nobody here is thinking of losing
a game. But any one night, you can get beat by anybody. That's my point of
view.  
  
TRENT FORREST: I was definitely shocked. It was a big shocker for me. Kind of
going off of what Braian said, it's just that time of the year. You can't look
past anybody, no matter who it is. Whether it's a 16, 15, whoever you're
playing.  
  
So I feel like just not looking past the competition and going out and playing
and do the things you need to do to win the game.  
  
PHIL COFER: I didn't get to see the game, but I seen the after score. But
definitely, you got to look at every opponent the same, like you're playing an
NBA team or something like that. Besides that, I think they're still a great
team no matter what. I think they'll still be pretty good next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

### [Kerem Kanter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34918)

### [J.P. Macura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30563)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Xavier Musketeers are with us. They have a date with
Florida State tomorrow. It's game two, 30 minutes after the conclusion of game
one. They're out of the Big East. J.P. Macura, Trevon Bluiett, Kerem Kanter
represent the student body.  
  
We'll get right into questions.  
  
Q. As members of a 1 seed that played your 1 versus 16 game yesterday,
how did you experience the Virginia result? Whether you watched the game or
heard about the final score later, how did you experience that?  
KEREM KANTER: They call it March Madness for a reason. Things happen in March.
I think Virginia is a great team, but every team that plays in the March
Madness plays with a purpose. It's their last game of their season so I give
UMBC a lot of credit.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Pretty much what Kerem said. Kind of how I've been saying the
whole time, I mean, when you're in the March, tournament seeding doesn't
really matter. It's all about who wants that game more. So, you know, at the
end of the day, it really doesn't matter what seed you are.  
  
J.P. MACURA: I mean, I agree with both of them. Like Kerem said, anything can
happen in March, and it's crazy that a 16 seed beat a 1 seed. But anything can
happen.  
  
Q. Trevon, you tested the NBA waters twice. In retrospect, looking back
at that now, do you think it would have been a mistake had you gone and what
have you gotten from these past two years at Xavier, not just on the
basketball court, but as a person that you would not have gotten had you gone
to the NBA?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Well, whatever decision, if I did decide to go, that I would
have thought it was the best decision for me, not necessarily a mistake.  
  
But, you know, the fact that I did stay, a lot of beneficial things did come
out of it. You know, I don't regret my decision at all, and I've been saying
that ever since I made it.  
  
I knew we had the potential to do everything that we've done, and everything
that we can do, and just looking to achieve those goals.  
  
Q. Tre, not long after you guys won last night, you wrote on twitter,
and I quote, Xavier will be the first No. 1 seed to drop out. And it got 2,000
likes. You say you're worried about yourselves, you're not worried about the
outside noise. For you, do you feel like you've always had to prove yourself
at Xavier? What does it mean that people thought you would be the first No. 1
seed out and obviously you weren't?  
TREVON BLUIETT: We don't have to try to prove ourselves. That's not what any
of that is about. We focus on us, focus on the team. What that tweet was just
how the outside world thinks about us and the respect that we don't get, in a
way. Like I said, we use that as motivation. We don't really look too much
into that. More of a fun tweet. But, you know, yeah. Is what it is.  
  
Q. Going into the tournament, there was a lot of talk about Virginia and
just how their focus on the defensive end of the court. Going into the
tournament, how that might be precarious, that people say you have to be able
to score to have success in the NCAA tournament.  
For any of you guys, where's that balance for you? One, do you believe in
the adage that you've got to be able to score a lot of points to win in the
tournament, or where is that balance between offense and defense for you
guys?  
  
J.P. MACURA: I mean, I would just say we need to focus on the defensive end
more than the offensive end as of now.  
  
I think our offense is really good. I think we play together and, at times, on
the defensive end, we get beat off the dribble. Everybody down the line has
been working on that, keeping guys in front of each other. I just think if we
continue to defend, we can win a lot of games.  
  
KEREM KANTER: I think we're a really good offensive team. We scored 100-plus
points last night. That's not going to be the case going forward maybe. We're
going to have off nights, so we've got to make sure we lock in on the
defensive end as well.  
  
Q. J.P., Florida State's Trent Forrest, No. 3, he really pushed the pace
for them last night. What are some things he does really well and what are
some things you guys will have to do to try to to slow him down in order to
get a win tomorrow?  
J.P. MACURA: He's a fast player and I think he can get to the rim and I think
that on the defensive end, we need to be able to do our game plan the right
way and really focus in on him.  
  
Q. Tre, following up on that question, and all three of you, if you
could answer this, you said you don't feel like you've gotten a lot of
respect, you're the team that won the Big East regular season title and are
very high in the RPI and have done a lot of things.  
Why do you think Xavier has not gotten respect from a national vantage
point?  
  
J.P. MACURA: I mean, there's been multiple things that have been said about us
of being the first No. 1 seed to lose and I just think that little things like
that people say have kind of -- you know, that just seems like they disrespect
us in a way.  
  
We've been saying it for a while, that we don't really care about what they
say, because we're worried about the guys in the locker room and the coaches
and playing together.  
  
So they can continue to say whatever they want, but we know how we need to
play.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, I mean, everything J.P. said is right. I couldn't tell
you why we don't get that respect on a national level. It is what it is. But
we're going to continue to work on ourselves and be the best team that we can
be within ourselves.  
  
KEREM KANTER: Yeah, I mean, like they said, we could care less about how much
respect we get. We deserve to be a 1 seed for a reason, so we've just got to
play our basketball and not listen to outside voices.  
  
Q. Kerem, this one's for you. You were able to kind of finesse your way
to success against a 7'2 " front liner last night in Trayvon Reed. Florida
State has quite a massive front court. Do you think -- one of them is 7'4", I
understand. Do you think you, in particular, can finesse your way to success
again, or is there a different approach you would want to take to a player
that's two inches tall? How much of a difference does that make?  
KEREM KANTER: Hopefully, I can have a good game like I did yesterday. I'm not
going to go out there and try to force shots. I'm going try to stick to the
game plan and do whatever my coach asks me to do.  
  
Q. Kerem, you had mentioned this was one of the reasons you wanted to
transfer to Xavier, to be exactly in this position. How does this experience
this year kind of compare to your other experience in the tournament and is it
everything you expected?  
KEREM KANTER: I haven't had an experience like this before. Back in 2016, I
played in a tournament and lost in the first round. But with this team, I
think we're going to be really successful, really experienced, you know, older
team. So hopefully, we can go as far as we can.  
  
Q. For Trevon and J.P., what's the familiarity like with Florida State?
It's been a year since you all met in the second round. When you start talking
about them, how much do you flash back to last year's game and do you prepare
for them maybe to come out with a little bit more desire for revenge, payback,
to get to the Sweet 16?  
J.P. MACURA: I mean, they're a very athletic team and they play well together,
and they're tough, and we got to keep them off the glass.  
  
They got some of the same guys as they did last year, and I have a feeling
that they're going to try and come out and get some revenge.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, you know, since we played them last year, some of the
things that they do, sort of similar. Some of the things they do is different.  
  
Like J.P. said, they've got a couple players returning from last year and
they've also got new players as well. I think with how things ended last year,
they're definitely going to look for revenge and try to give us their best
shot.  
  
So we just have to be able to take their shot and withstand that and do what
we do best.  
  
Q. Trevon, you said Sunday night, as a senior, there is a heightened
urgency to keep playing games. You also said that you sacrifice for your
fellow seniors because you guys have been together and through it all.  
Can you elaborate a little on that, on the sacrifice?  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah. I mean, we all come from schools where we were the guy,
you know. We got every shot. We called all the shots, got to tell people where
to go, do this. You know, we each had to scale back a little bit on our --
everybody has a little selfishness in them, and we each had to scale back on
that.  
  
To be able to do that, to be able to make that sacrifice, to not be as
selfish, to be willing to play with other teammates, I think that's what
separates us and makes us a better team.  
  
Like I said, any guy on this team, 1 through 13, 1 through 8, the guys that
play, they can be the guy on any given night. So it's just a big credibility
to them to not get big-headed and just stay and worry about the team first.  
  
Q. First, for Kerem and then for Trevon, looking back to December when
Coach Mack changed the lineup, starting you and Naji Marshall, what impact do
you think that had so far this season?  
KEREM KANTER: I think it gave me a little more comfort coming off the bench.
You kind of want to do a little bit more to stay on the court more.  
  
But I think it gave me a little more comfort, knowing I'm one of the starters,
obviously that.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah. So, I mean, having Naji and Kerem in brings a lot of
versatility to our group, our lineup. You know, you have Kerem who can push
the ball from rebounding. He's a 5. Bring him out on perimeter.  
  
Then you've got Naji, who I think is an all-around, solid player. One of our
best defenders on the team. He just brings extra athleticism and extra length
and I think that's kind of what helps us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

### [Matt Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34898)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Nevada - 87, Texas - 83 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Texas Longhorns are now with us. Head coach Shaka Smart, also
with Matt Coleman, Mohamed Bamba, Kerwin Roach II.  
  
Going to ask Coach Smart to open up with a statement, then we'll go to
questions for all four gentlemen from Texas. Shaka, please.  
  
SHAKA SMART: It's a devastating loss. It's a terrible feeling right now.
Nevada deserves a ton of credit. They made some huge, huge plays, huge shots.
In the second half, in overtime. They're a really, really good team.
Obviously, we put ourselves in position early in the second half to take the
game. We didn't play with enough aggressiveness down the stretch. I thought
they were the more aggressive team and that gave them an edge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Snoop, the way that final part of regulation unfolded, the back and
forth and the missed free throw, what did you all want to do when Dylan got
the ball with 3.6 left? Did you have something drawn up? What was supposed to
happen there?  
KERWIN ROACH II: We had a play drawn up where we threw it to Jericho. He was
supposed to throw it back to me. We didn't complete the pass. But we just
didn't execute that play, turned it over.  
  
Q. Shaka, you guys got up, I think it was 40-25. A lot free flowing,
just a lot of driving, kicking, moving the ball around. Did they do anything
to change, get you guys out of rhythm offensively? It seemed like from that
point on, you kind of struggled to generate good looks.  
SHAKA SMART: They did a good job taking away some drives at that point, but I
did think we got a little hesitant for a stretch there. You know, we talked
about it many times before. When you have a lead, you've got to stay
aggressive and keep attacking. They did a really nice job trying to take away
some of the driving angles. We were trying to look to throw the ball inside.
They doubled. They doubled before the ball even went in.  
  
And we missed some shots. We had some possessions where at the end of the
clock, we didn't get anything going that we wanted to. So that was a big
difference in the game.  
  
Q. Shaka, what were the conversations like at halftime? You're up 9, but
you knew a 3-point shooting team was going to continue to shoot and they were
3 out of 12 from distance. What were those conversations like?  
SHAKA SMART: We just talked about the fact that the two biggest keys on
defense were transition defense and then taking away the 3-point shot from
them. So we talked about that. We reinforced what we needed to do.  
  
Being up 9, you know, in an NCAA tournament game, you know the other team's
going to really do everything they can to make a run. Our guys started the
half really, really well. But, again, I thought the crucial part of that
second half was when they took control in terms of being the more aggressive
team.  
  
Obviously, at that point, they had nothing to lose. They were behind, they
were attacking, and we just didn't do enough to match them.  
  
Q. Obviously, you foul out late, you're stuck watching them through the
sideline. What's going through your head? You looked almost sick that you
couldn't be out there in overtime. What's going through your head while you're
watching that?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: During that, I was just trying to impact, you know, rub some
energy off my teammates, try and impact the game as much as possible even from
the sideline.  
  
Q. Matt, when overtime began, did you feel like you had to take over,
needed to take over? What was your kind of mindset there?  
MATT COLEMAN: Find a way to win. But that didn't happen. Came up short.  
  
Q. Shaka, kind of a loaded question, but just overall, what does the
program need to add to get to that next step, to get to that NCAA tournament
win? What do you think needs to be fixed or added?  
SHAKA SMART: We obviously are minutes removed from a devastating loss. So
right now, our mind is on that game. And what we'll do as coaches and players
is focus on what's next. But now is obviously a time where we're extremely
upset about the game.  
  
But off the top of my head, a simple answer to your question is, in a game
like today, we need to add, you know, one or two more winning plays. That's
the difference. One more stop, one more rebound. It's a cruel, you know, hard
assessment. But, you know, in games like this that go in overtime, and we've
been in as many as anyone in the country, one play does make the difference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Best of luck in the future, guys.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Nevada - 87, Texas - 83 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Wolf Pack are represented by head coach Eric
Musselman, Caleb Martin, Kendall Stephens and Josh Hall. We'll ask Coach
Musselman for an opening statement and we'll go to questions for all four
gentlemen from the Wolf Pack here in a 12-minute session. Eric, please.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: First of all, we'd like to apologize for any language that
might have been caught on TV. Obviously, we had an excited locker room. We
apologize for that.  
  
So the game, I thought, you know, the second half, you know, we had to play at
a faster pace. I thought that Texas and Coach Smart did a phenomenal job of
controlling the tempo for those first 30 minutes. Then eventually, we started
knocking down some 3-balls.  
  
Once we started driving the ball a little bit more in the second half, I
thought that that opened up our 3-ball. Couldn't be prouder of the team.
Obviously, the size advantage that they had inside on the back boards, we did
a much better job in the second half of scrapping around and trying to get
loose balls and really proud of the job our team did of taking care of the
ball. We thought that Texas could, you know, could cause some trouble if they
jumped in the passing lanes and with Roach and Coleman's ability to get out
and get steals. These guys did a great job, only have seven turnovers in a
game that we score 87 points.  
  
Q. Caleb, you guys are fighting from behind basically the entire game.
Your last lead before overtime was 5-2, down 14 in the second half. Did just
getting to overtime feel like a second life? Seemed like you guys played a lot
looser in the final five minutes.  
CALEB MARTIN: Yeah, for sure. With a team like us, it felt like the Texas Tech
game. We knew we were going to be in trouble if we got in overtime at their
place and I feel like that's exactly how it was for this game. Vice versa for
us.  
  
Jordan had big free throws at the end and had one that was huge for us. We got
in overtime, like you said, it gave us more life. It's a whole 'nother game,
five-minute game.  
  
Q. Coach, what was that feeling? Looked like you jumped into Johnny
Jones' arms with two seconds to go. Can you describe what you were feeling in
that second?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I don't know how we won, Chris. I mean, just the progress of
where the program's come, you know, we made it here last year. We've grinded,
you know, all of us hard since the beginning of the summer with a goal in
mind, and that was try to advance.  
  
Again, we didn't play very well, but just the ball movement in the second half
when you look at the stat sheet and you see Cody's assist, Caleb's assist,
Jordan Caroline at the center spot to have five assists. I mean, I thought we
really, really shared the basketball.  
  
We might have played a little tight in that first half, and I think that the
guys started to settle in in the second half, and once we started knocking
down some 3s, you know, and, again, the pace of the play, I mean, for us to
score 26 points at the half is frustrating for us.  
  
But we got out and got some transition baskets and it really opened the game
up for us.  
  
Q. One for Eric, and then one for Caleb. Coach, the play call at the end
of regulation that Caleb shot, was that the shot you wanted or did they defend
and make you do something else?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: No. We had two options. 1A was the shot we got. If we get
close again, we'll probably run something pretty similar. The other one was
Kendall running the baseline and he was open as well.  
  
You know, you just want guys that are playing well and that you have good
confidence in to take a shot. And I thought he got a really, really good look.
It didn't fall, no big deal. We got back into the timeout in overtime, and
said hey, it's a five-minute game now, and Bamba's out of the game and he had
such a big impact on our dribble drives and stuff.  
  
I thought Jordan did a great job of getting into his body on dribble
penetration in the second half.  
  
Q. Caleb, you had, I think, three 3s off the bat to start the overtime.
Did you feel a little more pressure going into the overtime in terms of trying
to take on yourself?  
CALEB MARTIN: I mean, not really. Honestly, I felt looser. I felt like the
regulation, you know, regular regulation, I just played like Coach said. I
felt like I was playing tight. The ball felt for me when I was putting it on
the floor. I was probably a little nervous.  
  
Like Chris said, when we got to overtime, it's just like more life. Like Coach
said, just trying to settle in. I felt better, honestly, in overtime.  
  
Q. Kendall, that first half didn't look too dissimilar from the first
half against San Diego State. I guess how did you guys keep looking forward
and not getting kind of stuck in how you played offensively in the first 20
minutes?  
KENDALL STEPHENS: Yeah, man. We knew that it was a team that we could beat. We
were confident in ourselves. We were kind of disappointed in our effort and
kind of our mishaps on defense. I think once we cleaned it up and moved the
ball more on offense, we was able to get confidence from getting stops,
consecutive stops. And then that kind of allowed us to use our momentum from
hitting jumpers and things like that.  
  
I think the biggest thing for us was kind of working on our self and kind of
making sure we were getting consecutive stops.  
  
Q. Josh, you played really well in the NCAA tournament last year. What
is it that you like about this stage that seems to bring the best out in
you?  
JOSH HALL: I want to win. Plain and simple, I just want to win. Not only do I
want to play good, but I want my team to play well. I want to advance. We
didn't win last year. Winning this game was really big for us and shows we're
a better team than last year and moving in the right direction. So I just want
to win.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit, Coach, about Josh's play. Seemed like he
buoyed you guys in the first half and kept you in it and kept you in striking
distance in the second half.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: He had really good shot selection. He's such a good basket
cutter. Defensively, he gives us another dimension. He gives us a fifth guy
out there that's across the board. We're 6'6" and, you know, I mean, we had a
conversation at the very beginning of the year about whether to start or not
start. You know, he told me, and he told other guys on the staff that he was
fine coming off the bench and so that's kind of been his role.  
  
We look at him in the entire season as a starter, and obviously, to play him
the minutes that we did last year, you know, over even guys that were seniors
and stuff. I mean, I have great, you know, confidence in him. Late game, we
had him as an in-bounder because I have confidence in him.  
  
He just gives us another dimension of a guy who can rebound, defend and make
shots.  
  
Q. Kendall, they hit a 3-pointer to start overtime. They hit a 3-pointer
with a foot on the line, then they get a four-point play. They're coming out
of that, into overtime, really strong. What kept you guys thinking that you
could stay in this game and pull it out?  
KENDALL STEPHENS: Across the board, we just got guys that have played in
hostile environments. We've been there before so we know that all we need is a
chance. We're confident. Once we get back down the court, we're able to score
effectively and that's what we did.  
  
We just got to tighten up defensively towards the end and that's what we were
able to do, get more stops than they did and we made more plays than they did
down the stretch. It was a tough game. Gotta give credit to Texas. They made
it tough.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Bamba not being in there in overtime. How much
did that affect the game? Seemed like a different game in overtime. Pretty
much a grind through regulation on both sides. Overtime, everybody starts
hitting shots.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: It kind of changes the complexion of who Texas is. Instead of
being a team that's dominant throwing the ball inside, the guards are so
talented in Roach and Coleman.  
  
Look, we tried to do as good a job as we could with our size on Bamba, and I
thought we did a great job. He averages 12 points a game. He got 13. They play
in a league with great size.  
  
We're undersized even in a league that doesn't have much size. So I just
thought our guys really, really battled on post defense. I mean, all my
friends, people in the media, everybody was asking how are we going to defend
Bamba inside. I thought we did a phenomenal job with our fronts and really
battling, had great weak side help as well.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Coleman's play. We haven't heard a whole lot about
him when you talk about Texas. He seemed to keep them in the game in the
second half.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: He played a great game. Obviously, if you look at his 3-point
shooting over the course of the year, it's a lower percent. We wanted him to
take shots. And sometimes when you make a coaching decision, it can backfire.
And he played extremely well. And we kind of stuck with the philosophy of how
we started the game. We didn't alter it. We thought that over 40 minutes, if
we could just try to keep him out of the lane, you know, the more film we
watched over and over and over, he's so great at getting in the lane and
throwing lob passes to Jericho Sims or Bamba. We didn't want that to happen
and we kind of lived with the 3-ball.  
  
Obviously, he went 4 for 5 and he and Roach played phenomenal basketball
games. But we felt like, you know, their guards, if they score, that means
that they're not getting, you know, shots by the rim and Jericho's percentage
and Bamba's percentage is above 50 percent. We were going to live with the
guards shooting.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys are down 14 in the second half. How would you describe
the heart and resiliency of this team to be able to pull out a victory in that
situation?  
JOSH HALL: It helped us a lot with the non-conference schedule we played,
especially on the road at TCU and the tougher games we played. That helped us
this time of year. That's what these games were meant for.  
  
When we got down, we knew we had to keep fighting and working hard and not get
down and stay positive. We knew we would come out and win.  
  
Q. Kendall, you transferred here, knowing you only had one year to play.
You had a goal to get to the tournament but to win games. What does it mean to
you to pick up this program's first victory in this tournament since 2007 and
only the fifth in the school's history in this tournament?  
KENDALL STEPHENS: It means a lot. When you play the game, especially for as
many college years as I have, you want to be known as a winner. I wanted to go
out winning one game at least.  
  
So the biggest thing for us as a team is just to use this game as confidence
and build on it, going into the next game with more energy and more focus.  
  
Q. Caleb, did you feel like there was a turning point in this game that
swung things in your favor?  
CALEB MARTIN: Probably just the overtime. I just think that us fighting and
Jordan going up and hitting the big free throw to tie it up to go into OT gave
us confidence. You could kind of tell when we walked back on the floor, you
could tell the energy of their team was low. It's one of those things like
dang, I wish we didn't go into overtime.  
  
I felt the same energy with us walking into Texas Tech when we walked back on,
when guys were in foul trouble and we had the same energy. We were like dang,
we shouldn't have got in overtime. We felt the same way with them, walking
back on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys are 0-2 in overtime so far this season. Do you feel
like they took any lessons from the games going into this extra session?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think so. As I look back on the game, the conditioning, I
thought, was very important. I thought both teams have limited benches and I
thought our conditioning, like I didn't feel we got tired at all. And I do
think that, like, certain plays that we run, because we've been in close
games, I thought they did a really good job executing like our wing pick and
roll down the stretch, which we've done pretty well for three years.  
  
I thought we looked at some different options and I do think that there was
confidence going into the overtime, even though, you know, we would have liked
to have won in regulation. But I sensed the huddles were much different in
overtime than they were in the first half, especially.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck. See you Sunday.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [J.P. Macura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30563)

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Xavier - 102, Texas Southern - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Musketeers are right here with us. J.P. Macura, Trevon
Bluiett represent the student body. Head coach Chris Mack is ready to give a
statement on the game and we'll go to questions for all three gentlemen on the
dais. Chris, please.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Any time you can advance in the NCAA tournament, you consider
yourself tournament. The game was one of the choppiest ones I thought we
played all year.  
  
Texas Southern's kids never quit. We had a couple issues with fouls,
specifically with our point guards. Sort of hampered us and made us a little
bit nervous in terms of like how we were going to finish the game. So we
played way more zone than we were used to, than we wanted to.  
  
And then, you know, you compound that with Naji Marshall going out with his
back, we had a thin deck, and so fortunately, the scorer's table corrected the
error. We knew that was Quentin's fourth. It wasn't aesthetically pleasing by
any means, but we will play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Chris, Tre and J.P. looked like the Tre and J.P. of last March. How
good was it to see them get in a rhythm early in this game?  
CHRIS MACK: It was great. They're seniors. They've been in this moment before.
We've talked a lot about experience mattering. I thought those guys did a
really good job of getting us off to a great start. Something I've grown
accustomed to, having coached them for four years.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you just said this was one of the choppiest games that
you've played over the entire season. I guess maybe some big picture positive
takeaways that you can take away from your first game at the tournament
here.  
CHRIS MACK: Well, you go into a game and it's the first time in the history of
our program that we're a 1 seed and everybody asks us about the pressure, the
pressure.  
  
I try to be really honest and say I didn't feel -- you can ask these guys. I
didn't feel any different. But when you get asked that question a thousand
times over a 48-hour period, maybe you're supposed to. I was just glad that we
came out with great energy. They made a heck of a run and our guys responded.  
  
I wish that at the end of the first half we'd have closed a little bit better,
because I have a feeling the second half may have played out differently.  
  
A year ago, we played a tough first half against Maryland, rebounded in the
second half and I thought we really got going from there on out. Hopefully, we
learn from this game. Some of the mistakes we made, we correct. Some of the
guys that maybe didn't play as well play better with another opportunity on
Sunday.  
  
Q. You guys had talked about your desire to put two full halves
together. Aside from that -- the run that they had in the first half, do you
feel like you did that tonight?  
CHRIS MACK: Again, I give Texas Southern credit. They made the game really
choppy. Going over to the monitor and trying to get the foul situated, it just
became, you know, one of the longest games I feel like I've ever been a part
of. I looked up and there were twelve and a half minutes left to go in the
game.  
  
But I give our guys credit of being able to stay with it. We played a defense
that I think we've probably played maybe three minutes in the last 15 games or
so because of foul trouble.  
  
It wasn't perfect, by any means, but we did the job well enough to advance on
Sunday.  
  
I thought offensively, played pretty well. Could have made a few better
decisions. But we're going to have to play better, and we recognize that, on
Sunday against either Florida State or Missouri.  
  
Q. Since Chris kind of addressed this for J.P. and Tre, how do you view
this as a tune-up for a game against a so-called power five -- a team from a
so-called power five conference? What are your big takeaways from tonight?  
J.P. MACURA: I would just say taking care of the ball. I feel like we came out
and we were loose with the ball and that affected them in transition.  
  
I feel like if we can start to take care of the ball better, it will help us.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, I mean exactly what J.P. said. I think us just taking
care of the ball, focusing on the little things. I think that's something that
can be tuned up. But I think that's something we needed to work on a little
bit this game.  
  
Q. J.P. and Trevon, talk about the fan support. Your fans were there all
game. Talk about the fan support, how that carried you on to the victory.  
TREVON BLUIETT: Having the fans there is good for us. Shows the atmosphere
kind of favored us in that game. We kind of looked at it, I mean, as a home
game, I suppose. But I mean, it's always good when you have a lot of fans that
travel, come and support you. Makes you feel more comfortable when you're on
the court, rather than feeling like you're playing at a neutral site.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Hopefully a lot more show up on Sunday from Xavier Nation.  
  
J.P. MACURA: I would just say it felt amazing that they all came out to
support us. They've been supporting us all year and hopefully they continue
to.  
  
Q. Chris, this is kind of the second year in a row you've had a major
role player in the form of a graduate transfer. I'm talking about Kerem. He
obviously had an incredibly efficient night tonight. How rewarding is that to
see these guys come into the program and -- you know, Malcolm played a big
role in last year's surge in March. Kerem has obviously put a mark on
tonight's game. How rewarding is it to see these guys come into the program
and do the things they've done?  
CHRIS MACK: Extremely rewarding. Obviously, I love watching guys like J.P. and
Tre develop throughout their four years, become better men and better players
and leaders.  
  
When you get a guy like Kerem, it's a very short recruitment. Might be three,
four weeks long. And you sell a lot and I didn't feel like we sold anything
that wasn't true. We talked about our NCAA tournament tradition. We talked
about trying to challenge for a Big East title.  
  
And to see it come to fruition, for a guy like Kerem who, quite honestly, no
disrespect to where he came from, but they hadn't had much success in the NCAA
tournament in the postseason.  
  
That's what he signed up for, and to see him have that opportunity on this
stage is very, very gratifying.  
  
Q. Coach, you had talked about how you thought the defense improved, I
guess, toward the end of the season. I know in this game, you sort of had to
change what you did a little bit because of foul trouble.  
Overall, what do you think that you did particularly well defensively or
particularly not well?  
  
CHRIS MACK: We have to do a better job no matter if we play man or zone, of
not fouling, especially more on offense. I know we're going to offensive
rebound, I get that. But we put them at the foul line maybe two or three times
when it was our ball, and they didn't have to earn the possession.  
  
We've got to be a little bit smarter with that. Right, Jack? Defensively,
though, for them to shoot 40 percent, they have a lot of very talented one-on-
one players. Demontrae Jefferson, as I said before we played the game, is a
blur.  
  
I thought we did a pretty good job. We blocked several of his shots around the
basket. We had a lot of those guys in foul trouble. Again, he's a special
player and they've got some good one-on-one players.  
  
Q. Chris, probably too early, but do you have an idea of, with Naji, is
it something to be concerned about for Sunday?  
CHRIS MACK: I'm concerned, but I'm also hopeful. Outside of that, I haven't
really gotten a definitive answer from Dave Fluker. He probably won't know. He
felt like his back locked up. It's muscular. He dealt with it in the early
part of the year. Hopefully, he can get it loose over the next couple days and
be ready to go on Sunday.  
  
Q. J.P., do you see any similarities between yourself and Demontrae?
Both have a lot of passion.  
J.P. MACURA: A little bit. I would just say we're both competitive.  
  
Q. Chris, just kind of one of those nights where you'll be running on
adrenaline. You'll have guys here watching Missouri and Florida State. Is this
kind of that time of year for the staff where you guys are just running on
fumes, getting ready for the next game?  
CHRIS MACK: I wouldn't say fumes. We're excited. It's our job to make sure the
guys have all the ammunition and all the intelligence that we can give them
over the next 48 hours. We're going to play a really good team, and it's our
job as a coaching staff, no matter how many hours we stay up, to get them as
well prepared as we can. That's what we're aiming to do.  
  
Q. J.P., you talk a lot on the court, sometimes you're smiling and
chatting, other times you're more intense. In tonight's game, what are things
that you talk about with the other players, or what do you say to them?  
J.P. MACURA: Honestly, I kind of forgot. Maybe I said "nice move", "nice pass"
or something like that.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Hopefully he says "nice move" a little less.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. See you Sunday.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati - 68, Georgia State - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Georgia State Panthers are with us now. Isaiah Williams,
D'Marcus Simonds, Jordan Session, represent the student body. Head coach Ron
Hunter is here as well. We're going to ask him to make a statement on the game
and then we'll go to questions for all four gentlemen from Georgia State. Ron,
please.  
  
RON HUNTER: I'm really proud of our young men. I thought we got wore down
under about the four, five minute mark. Their offensive rebounding kind of got
us.  
  
But I thought these kids represented our institution and the city of Atlanta
extremely well. This is a group that most of us will be back. I thought Zeke
coming off the bench was really big in the second half. We were able to get
the lead. But their size, their size was just really a factor.  
  
I was really pleased defensively. We had a goal that we wanted them to shoot
25 to 30 threes. We wanted under 40 percent shooting. We were able to get that
done. The only box we didn't check was the rebounding part. That's an Achilles
heel all year.  
  
I can't tell you how proud I am of these guys here. As we continue to build
the program and continue to make runs in this NCAA tournament, these kids are
unbelievable. And I just love them to death.  
  
Q. D'Marcus, you were hot early on. What did they do differently later
in the game to try to combat that?  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: If you're watching the game, you could see they went to the
zone. They took away my penetration. So I started facilitating the ball a
little bit more and, yeah, just really took away my penetration.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think you guys did that frustrated Cincinnati the
most?  
RON HUNTER: Well, we have pride in our defense. I challenged our guys. This is
the second best defense in the country, what are we? I thought defensively, we
were really good. I thought we really confused them. I'll be honest with you,
I wish we had played Thursday. The less preparation, our matchup is something
different. It's like playing Georgia Tech in football. If you don't see it
that often and we switched some things up and every other possession, we would
change some different things to kind of confuse them a little bit.  
  
Part of our defense is to have the confusion between the point guard and head
coach. We thought they were trying to figure out what we were doing. Our guys
feed off that. They know when a team doesn't know quite how to attack our
matchup. We never really call it a zone. It's not really a zone. We call it a
matchup. We wanted to prove defensively and we wanted to hold them under 40
percent shooting, which we did for most teams all year. I was really proud of
that.  
  
Again, Cincinnati is a great team, one of the top ten teams in the country. I
just told our kids, if they're one of the top ten teams in the country, what
we did defensively, just think how good we can really be if we keep growing.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned rebounding. Cincinnati had 20 offensive boards
in the game. How can you describe how detrimental that was, especially in the
second half when you were trying to make that run?  
RON HUNTER: The Maneater? That's cool, man. I never heard of that before. They
said the Maneater, guys. They man-ate us on the glass. That's about the best I
can say. Maneater, they man-ate us on the glass, buddy.  
  
We knew that was going to be a problem. That's what they do. They're a good
basketball team and they got a shot to get to the Final Four. The difference
in the game for us was just the rebounding.  
  
Q. Coach, the Xavier group we're talking about, D'Marcus and how he can
probably play for anybody in their conference. Can you talk about his game
today and what he's done for the team all season.  
RON HUNTER: He's done this all year for us. He's a tremendous player. As I
said to many people before, he's only scratching the surface. I think he's one
of the best guards in the country. I know he's the best player in the state of
Georgia. So he's tremendous and he's only going to get better. He's only going
to get better. We're very fortunate, we had a first round draft pick in R.J.
One day soon, this kid is going to be a first round draft pick. No doubt about
it. To be able to say that, coming from Georgia State, last three years, it's
a great accomplishment. But this kid can really play.  
  
He's got great teammates and he'll tell you that. He's got great teammates
around him that can make shots. So I'm proud of him, because his development
as a person is what I'm proud of. He's turning into a great young man, and I'm
more proud of that than I am the basketball part.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a question for everybody, really. I know the loss is
kind of fresh right now, but looking forward to the future, Kane Williams, a
freshman, where do you see him going in the future and what has he brought to
the team this year?  
ISAIAH WILLIAMS: Kane is going to be a great player for this program.  
  
JORDAN SESSION: Kane is going to be a special player for Georgia State. As you
can see, he handles the ball well. He's a great defender. He controls the
tempo so well. He's a great teammate. He cheers for every bucket that anyone
scores. He doesn't care who scores. He just wants to go out and play the game
the right way. So he's going to be very special for Georgia State in the next
couple of years.  
  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: Yeah, Kane's pretty good. Yeah, he's pretty good. He'll be
good next year. He'll be good the year after that.  
  
RON HUNTER: I'll answer this. Kane's a good player, but I'd rather you ask
about my seniors sitting up here. These guys have done a great job. They've
led this program and they've done nothing -- Jordan is the only player in
school history that has played in the NCAA twice. And more importantly in six
weeks are going to graduate.  
  
As I said in the press conference before, this is what Division I basketball
is about, not all the crazy stuff we read about. This is what it's about. It's
about these guys coming in here, playing hard, getting to the NCAA tournament,
graduating, and becoming great part of our society. And we get lost in all
this other mess that we talk about what college basketball is. We need to
spend more time about what happens about these type of young kids. That's what
college basketball is all about.  
  
Q. D'Marcus, do you think Cincinnati and you guys were feeding off each
other's energy?  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: Yeah, definitely. They play really hard and we knew they
were going to play hard. We watched the film on them and they played hard all
year. They knew we were going to come in, we were going to play hard. You
could just feel the energy everywhere. The atmosphere was crazy. We made some
runs, they made some runs, and at the end just the rebounding was too much. We
just ran out of gas.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Jarron Cumberland's game and why it was
hard for your team to slow him down today?  
RON HUNTER: You can't take everything away. So, again, we knew that -- we
don't particularly worry about a particular player, but we have goals that we
wanted them to shoot as many threes as we possibly can. We wanted that because
we wanted long rebounds. So he just made really, really good plays.  
  
We slowed him down early, but he has a great basketball IQ and really made
some great plays for them. Again, we can't neutralize all of them. One great
thing about Cincinnati is that you can't key in on one player. So you've got
to kind of take some things away. We wanted to take the paint away, take some
of the bigs away, wanted to make the point guard more of a jump shooter. He
made really good plays. He's a good player. That's why they're in this
position.  
  
Q. Ron, under eight time out, you're down four, you have to think we've
got the game we want here. Then the game goes away pretty quickly. What
happened there? Did they started making and you didn't?  
RON HUNTER: It's funny, because I said this to my staff coming out. We got to
the eight-minute mark and I looked at our guys and we looked fatigued. We were
tired.  
  
We were tired not because we weren't in shape. The physicality of Cincinnati
finally wore on us a little bit. And that was something I was concerned about
going into the game. But we were able to handle it.  
  
But the under eight timeout, I looked at D'Marcus and just the physicality,
Malik and some of the guys, Sesh, it just wore on us. It wore on us because
now all of a sudden we were missing those jump shots. We're a jump shooting
team. We couldn't come down and hit the jump shots. We had great looks. If
we'd hit a couple of those looks that we had, it could have been a different
outcome. The physicality kind of got to our legs. That's kind of what I saw at
about the seven-minute mark.  
  
Q. For the seniors, Jordan and Isaiah, can you describe a moment -- I
know it's emotional right now, but a moment through this experience that will
stick with you, that is kind of a bright spot in this enjoyable experience?  
JORDAN SESSION: During the course of the game, like you said, it got really
physical, and we got down, I think, ten maybe with about seven minutes or so.  
  
And I just, I looked at everyone's face, and we didn't fold. We didn't shake.
We didn't seem like we were going to lose the game at any point. We were all
smiling and clapping, ready to play, ready for the next possession. And we all
kind of picked each other up.  
  
And in that moment, I realized we were all a brotherhood. This is a great
group of guys. We're a great team. We're a great team. We have a great player
in D'Marcus, a great coach, great staff, and it's just moments like that, I
realize I really made a family here at Georgia State. It was a great moment
for me personally.  
  
ISAIAH WILLIAMS: On what Jordan said, at the end of the game, we're down 15
and it was pretty emotional for all of us, and we all huddled up and we
realized how close we really were, how close of a family we are.  
  
Q. Jordan and Isaiah, you guys had a great career here at Georgia State.
How will you remember your time here?  
ISAIAH WILLIAMS: All the --  
  
RON HUNTER: I can't get this guy to shut up most of the time too. You have to
ask him questions when I get him in a timeout. I'm trying to get him to shut
up. Now you get him up here and now he can't speak. You good, man. Sesh, you
got it.  
  
JORDAN SESSION: What was the question?  
  
Q. How will you remember your time at Georgia State?  
JORDAN SESSION: I remember my time at Georgia State is an exciting one. We won
a lot in the last couple years so I'll remember that. I'll remember we ran the
state of Georgia. I remember we win, I think we went to the conference
tournament every year, of course, but we've been to the NCAA tournament twice
for myself personally. A lot of these guys, the first time, but they'll be
back next year. So that's exciting for me.  
  
I think my favorite thing about Georgia State is the fact that we win every
year, consistently. So that's been big for me personally.  
  
Q. Final question for D'Marcus, what did you learn basketball-wise and
just personally life-wise from Jordan and Isaiah at your time at Georgia
State?  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: I mean, you know, basketball-wise, Sesh and Isaiah taught me
to just always keep that confidence in myself at all times. Points in the
season, I get down in myself. I struggled a bit, but they always kept me up.  
  
Life-wise, they're my brothers. So they always got some life advice for me. So
I really appreciate that.  
  
Q. And for Coach, despite only having three assists as a team, you all
hung in there for the most part until, like, the eight, seven-minute mark. How
were you all able to do that? What happened after that?  
RON HUNTER: I mean, our kids were ready to play. They were ready to play, and,
again, I just said toward the end, we just -- the physicality kind of got us.
I love how we came out in the second half.  
  
I thought we were extremely aggressive in the second half and kind of made a
run. We just got to the seven-minute mark and just their physicality wore us
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Congratulations on your season.
Best of luck in the future.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Florida State - 67, Missouri - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now the Missouri Tigers are here. Cuonzo Martin, the head
coach, is with Kassius Robertson, Jordan Geist and Kevin Puryear. Going to ask
Coach Martin to start off with a statement and then we'll go to questions for
all four gentlemen from Missouri. Cuonzo, please.  
  
CUONZO MARTIN: A great win for Florida State. They played well. Got off to a
tremendous start. In the first half, they shot it well. They executed. We
didn't get into a flow like we needed to. Give them a lot of credit for
pressing us, getting out in the passing lanes, forcing us to make extra plays.  
  
We settled in the second half and played more like we're capable of playing a
team we're used to seeing. Good effort by our guys. Great win by Florida
State.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, what was the issue in the first half, especially
on the offensive end?  
KEVIN PURYEAR: I think we just struggled to move. I think we were a little
stagnant. Of course, our open looks, I think we had some good looks at the
rim. Didn't go in. Just one of those games for us.  
  
But like Coach said, I thought we fought really hard in the second half.
Things were flowing a little bit better, and proud of our effort. Credit to
Florida State. They played a great game, made shots down the stretch and
really just put a complete game together. So credit to them.  
  
JORDAN GEIST: They put the ball in the basket more than we did. That's what it
comes down to.  
  
Q. For Kassius, I wonder if you could describe what Coach Martin tried
to get across to you guys after the game. I know it's early and raw. But can
you sort of sum up the ups and downs of the season and what you're going to
take away from this?  
KASSIUS ROBERTSON: It's a tough question. There's so many things. After the
game, it's more about trying to keep our heads up. And in the second half, we
showed some fight. In the first half, thank God we didn't -- we didn't do the
same thing in the second half but it would have been a really hard thing to
swallow if we went out like that.  
  
I think we showed some type of fight in the second half. Credit to them. It
wasn't enough. The season overall is moments like this where it hurts and
highs. Just being here obviously is a pleasure and making it to the tournament
is a huge accomplishment for us.  
  
Of course, we had higher expectations to go further, but that's not what
happened. So, you know, there's so many positives from this season and joyous
moments and playing with these guys and learning from the coaches and
experiencing the atmosphere and the fans of Missouri and the support.  
  
So all those things are takeaways for me.  
  
Q. Kevin, kind of a similar question. Coach has talked a lot about how
he's told you guys you can be remembered as the group that got Missouri kind
of back on the right track. Is that something you can appreciate now, or do
you have to get a little bit further away from this to have that be the main
takeaway?  
KEVIN PURYEAR: Yeah, I think this team will be remembered as far as turning
things around, given our past few seasons.  
  
But, you know, I'm beyond proud to call these guys my teammates and beyond
proud to call these coaches my coaches. We fought a lot of adversity this
season and people counted us out at times during the season.  
  
For us to make the runs that we did and play basketball the way we did, I
think it's pretty remarkable and I think that's something that everybody in
our locker room should be proud of.  
  
Q. For Kevin again. Two years in a row now losing and leaving Nashville
and ending the season here. Talk about the mindset and emotional difference
going back home to Columbia this year versus last.  
KEVIN PURYEAR: I mean, I think losing is the same. I mean, I've never, never
taken losing lightly. I mean, last year, of course, it was in the month of
March, wasn't really much for us to look forward to. The stakes were higher
this time. To me, when the season ends, it all hurts the same. It's all
extremely emotional for me.  
  
But, you know, you live and you learn from it. And I got one more crack at it
with Geist. I'm extremely thankful for everything that Kash, JB, Rau, all of
our seniors have brought to us. They've been a huge blessing to our program
and nothing but great things to say about them.  
  
Q. Cuonzo, all the energy you guys had to expend to get it back to six.
Mike looked worn down at the end. Did you sense that there was some fatigue
and exhaustion there in the last few minutes?  
CUONZO MARTIN: Yeah, I knew it would be that. But, I mean, this is it. I think
maybe in Mike's case, not Kash. Kash is fine. Kevin and all those other guys
were fine.  
  
But probably outside of Mike, no. I thought we were okay. I think we cut it to
six and had a couple breakdowns and it went over from there. Not at all. We
battle, we lift weights, we work hard. I wasn't worried about it.  
  
Q. Cuonzo, a little bit along the lines of what I asked Kash. I know
it's hard to see the big picture right now. What are you going to think about
when you think of this team and all the ups and downs of the season that you
navigated to get here?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I thought these guys had a great year, in my opinion. Of
course, you want to win. Not that you settle for anything. And just show
resiliency and perseverance, determination as young men.  
  
So I'm very proud of them. I don't get too down about losses. That first half,
I was very angry, because we didn't show fight. I don't -- like I said to the
guys, you fight, I don't have to worry about what the score board says because
I can see the effort. I can sleep at night. Yeah, we lost the game. But I can
sleep at night with that second half. That looked like us. We learned from it.
We moved forward.  
  
These are exceptional young men. This is a ball game, and we went into the
game feeling like we could win the game. It's wasn't about having this many
guys. We were trying to win a basketball game and they outplayed us in the
first half and, unfortunately, caused us to possibly lose the game.  
  
Q. Just sort of a follow-up regarding Michael. Was it in some ways just
too much to ask to think he'd be able to get in the flow and be in the right
basketball shape? Just seemed like he was never quite able to be in sync.  
CUONZO MARTIN: One thing I said when people ask about Mike, I say if he scored
30 points tonight, zero points, five points, he'll be a better player a month
from now. That's just what it is, when you're coming off of injuries, getting
the rust off your body, getting the flow of games, getting the flow of
situations.  
  
But for us, it was just asking to be part of the team. It wasn't necessarily
to score this many points because we play as a team and we flow as a team.
Whatever happens, happens. He scores ten, scores zero, scores five, it's all
the same, as long as he put forth an effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Best of luck.  
  
CUONZO MARTIN: Thank you.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Xavier - 102, Texas Southern - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Tigers from Texas Southern are with us. Head coach Mike
Davis is accompanied by Donte Clark, Demontrae Jefferson and Trayvon Reed.  
  
We'll have the head coach make a statement on the game and we'll go to
questions for all four gentlemen from Texas Southern. Mike, please.  
  
MIKE DAVIS: First of all, thank God for this opportunity to be the head coach
of Texas Southern. This is where I'm supposed to be as a coach. I'm proud of
my team. We made a great, great run, winning eight straight games this season.  
  
Xavier's a really good team, a No. 1 seed, you've got to take your hat off to
those guys. They made some shots. My team fought all the way through. The
effort they gave tonight in that game against this team was one that I'm proud
of.  
  
It's something for us to build on. It's a lot of great things that are going
to happen for Texas Southern in the next couple of years. We're going to put
together a team that is going to beat whatever seed it is we have to play.
That's our goal all summer long, starting from this point on.  
  
We're going to play, we're going to work, we're going to focus with the effort
that we gave tonight. That's what you build on right there. The effort that
they gave tonight is what you build in the off-season every single day. So we
look forward to being here next year and we look forward to doing something
special at Texas Southern.  
  
Q. For either player, talk about the ups and downs of the game, where
you took a run early in the first half and what happened in the second half.  
DONTE CLARK: I mean, the game, I feel like the game is about runs, so I feel
like each team is definitely going to make a run between the game with 40
minutes of the game. So they just made a run. We made a run. We were just
going back and forth. They just sustained the run a little bit longer than we
did.  
  
TRAYVON REED: Just to piggyback off what he said, like every game you're going
to have your ups and downs. You know, we started off, you know, we was ready,
you know, plenty of energy. Towards the end, you know, we kind of backed off a
little bit on our energy.  
  
But throughout the whole game, I feel like we fought.  
  
Q. For Mike and all of players, what did they do to disrupt you guys
tonight?  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I think they tried to disrupt us and make us play from
the outside, knowing we're an attacking team and an up-tempo team. I don't
think they had any plans on trying to stop us. I think, like, we score 80
points. I think they just -- I don't think -- I think their intentions was to
come in this game and play their game. I think they thought they was going to
get the results they got, which was the win.  
  
Like I said, I don't think that team doubted us coming into this game, not
with as much fire as we came into this game, knowing that we got the big run
against North Carolina Central.  
  
TRAYVON REED: I would just say they came out hitting shots, some shots I
didn't expect them to make. They was just hot, you know, throughout the whole
game. I'd say they disrupted us probably on the defensive end probably by just
scratching the boards, you know, getting after it a little better than us.  
  
That's all I can say. But they was on fire tonight.  
  
DONTE CLARK: I'd say the same thing. I just feel like they got off to a quick
start and we probably just started off a little bit slower than we wanted to.  
  
MIKE DAVIS: Well, they're the No. 1 seed and when you're the No. 1 seed,
there's not a time -- we learned this throughout our non-conference.  
  
Like I said last night, you can't have a two or three-minute spurt where
you're not really playing at that level, because it only takes two or three
minutes for them to make a run.  
  
I think the score may have been tied up, we're up two, they're going to run on
us. We come back, they go up again. So for a team that's a 1 seed, they don't
give those away.  
  
And for a team that's a 1 seed, you've got to have 40 minutes and we talked
about it being at a nine or ten with your effort, with your concentration,
with your chemistry. Because that team is going to play the same way
throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach Davis, you got some big shots from Robert Lewis. How did you
feel about his play coming off the bench tonight?  
MIKE DAVIS: Robert got hurt before the BYU game, so his rhythm's been off. We
just got him back, I think, for the last four games. He made some good shots.
Like I said before, we're going to build on this. We're going to build on
this.  
  
I think tonight showed us, we played harder tonight than we played any of our
non-conference games. Tonight. The only way you can sustain that and do
something special -- I always say March is a month of miracles. But it also
starts in the off-season.  
  
If we can build on this with the same focus and same concentration, and we can
train our mind to give the effort in the weight room, give the effort when
we're running sprints, when the season is four, five months away, we can train
our brain to work at that level and make sure we earn it every day, then we
can do something special.  
  
I'm so happy to be a part of Texas Southern. I'm proud to be the coach here,
and I always say anything that can be done in college basketball can be done
right here from Texas Southern.  
  
Then we have to build on this, and we can't not remember how hard, how tough
we played tonight when we're working out in the off-season.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, it seemed like there was an exchange --
you had a technical foul and you had an exchange with someone at the scorer's
table. Can you talk about that?  
MIKE DAVIS: It's emotional. I like to say when it's emotional, I get
emotional. The technical foul wasn't on me. It was on our bench. So, you know,
the referees that we had tonight, all those are good guys. When you're calling
in the tournament, you're a good official.  
  
And they'll go back and they'll watch the film like we'll watch the film and,
you know, one of my best friends always said that you have to give a referee
four missed calls a game. And that's a great game he called. When you miss
four, that's a great game that they called.  
  
So I'm trying to get my guys fired up and push them, and it was nothing
personal with the officials. I respect all those guys.  
  
I think they'll move on to the next round, but it's very difficult when the
emotion's going high. Then once everything settles down, you know, I
apologized to him and he talked to me, and we're good. We're very good.  
  
Q. For Mike and Demontrae, can you describe the growth of this team from
the game against North Carolina in the tournament last year to this year's
experience?  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I think this team this year been through more, so we knew
it was a fight. Our non-conference kind of gave us an edge to go into
conference and then finish in sixth in conference gave us another edge to go
into the conference tournament. Then winning the conference tournament gave us
another edge to make history the other night. And making history gave us our
confidence and our passion to come into this game and think we was capable of
pulling off a win.  
  
So I would say the difference between this team and last year's team was the
mindset and the adversity we faced, knowing that we had the toughest schedule
and going 0-13 and coming out on top in our conference. I could say my team,
we built and we learned from all those lessons in non-conference.  
  
Like Coach said, from this point on, we're going to build and we're going to
get better, and with the new guys we got coming in, I'm going to do my best to
get them locked in early and not late so we can get here next year and we can
do the same thing, if not better.  
  
Q. For the coach and the players, are there any administrators, people
in city of Houston, fans, the band, anybody that you'd like to give a shout
out to for supporting you this season specifically?  
MIKE DAVIS: I'll answer that. We have great fans, and the expectations for us
is to win the conference every year and win the conference tournament. That's
the expectations for us.  
  
I'm proud of our fans. They support our guys no matter what. If you're 0-13,
you shouldn't have anybody at the games when you start your conference.
They're there. They're cheering us on. There's never any negative.  
  
You see our band. I think our band gets more spotlight than anyone on our
campus. It's 9:00, 10:00 at night and they're out there practicing. You can
hear them walking up and down the campus, playing all over the campus. They
put on a great show for us.  
  
My AD, Charles McClelland, I thank him for giving me an opportunity. There's a
lot of ADs around the country, when they choose a coach, they choose a coach
to lead their program and make their program proud.  
  
For him to give me this opportunity to coach these guys, we have a special
group. We have a special group. Once they realize how special they are, and
how hard it is, and how hard they have to work, because right now, I think
we're happy with getting to the tournament.  
  
You know, we didn't celebrate winning the conference championship and
tournament. We didn't celebrate the other night when we won against North
Carolina Central.  
  
And what I want to change is the off-season. I want us to just fight like we
-- I mean, if you see this fight tonight that we had in us in certain moments
of the game, and what they don't understand and I'll try to get them to
understand this, if you can fight, if you can say this, if you can say that
you are doing something that nobody else is doing, if you can say people have
to know you for your unbelievable work ethic. And right now, we're not known
for that.  
  
Once they know us and recognize us for our unbelievable work ethic, then what
you'll see tonight, you'll see a win. I'm proud of this effort. We were down
on loose balls. We never quit.  
  
So now, when it's four months, five months away from your first game, let's
practice like that. Let's band together. Let's get each other up and 2:00 or
3:00 in the morning, we should be in our gym. We should be working because
that's what Gonzaga did. They've put together a program where basketball is
first. 1:00 in the morning, they're in the gym, they're working. They're
working. We need our guys to shoot two, three, four thousand shots a day.  
  
Because I'm telling you, we can do something special. That's why I'm here. I'm
here to do something special. I know why I'm here. So until we do it, I'm not
going to be satisfied with the results, but I am satisfied and proud of the
effort that our guys gave tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati - 68, Georgia State - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon. On behalf of the Ohio Valley Conference,
welcome back to the Bridgestone Arena for today's first post-game press
conference, featuring both teams from game one.  
  
The advancing Bearcats will play the winner of Nevada and Texas the day after
tomorrow, on Sunday. Head coach Mick Cronin is with us, and the student-
athletes are Kyle Washington and Gary Clark. We'll ask Mick to open up with a
statement. Then we'll have questions for all three members of Cincinnati.
Mick, please.  
  
MICK CRONIN: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Georgia State on their
season. Coach Hunter's done a tremendous job there since he's become the head
coach at Georgia State. We expected this to be a fight.  
  
Fortunately, I got mature kids that understood that they were far from a 15
seed. We believe in the KenPom and the efficiency ratings, which put them
around a 13. And then you combine the fact that they have a guy who can start
for anybody in our conference in D'Marcus Simonds, and they're an extremely
formidable opponent, especially in a one-game shot.  
  
Because of their ability to put the ball in his hands and put shooters around
him. Very, very tough defensive assignment for our guys. We tried a lot of
different things. The thing about my team, we've got guys that care about
winning. It's easy to make adjustments during a game when guys know that
that's the key to winning basketball games.  
  
Get better on defense as the game goes on, which we continue to do. And if we
want to continue to advance, that will be the key for us.  
  
I thought, early on, we were trying to win with jump shooting. That's not who
we are. Once we got back to focusing on what we do to win games, we started
looking like the team that we are, and we went from down to up and they made a
little run in the second half, but they're going to make some shots. They've
got a really good team.  
  
So, again, congratulations to Coach Hunter and his players on their season.  
  
We did not play bad -- or badly, I should say, or poorly. They have a very
good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for all three gentlemen.  
  
Q. Obviously, your goal is to go farther than this in the tournament. Do
you see reasons to celebrate this win?  
MICK CRONIN: No. We're worried about one game at a time. We don't worry about
what other people might say our goals are. We're just trying to win today, and
we don't believe in entering a tournament to get to the second round or the
fourth round.  
  
If you're in the tournament, you're trying to win the tournament. That might
be the Tiger Woods in me. I don't believe in Elite Eights and all that stuff.
If we win three more in a row, I won't be celebrating.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MICK CRONIN: No. That's not -- I do things differently than other people.
We've already had a great season. No matter what happens, we've had an
unbelievable season. We're in a tournament right now. There's five games left
to win it. And I think that's always been my mindset, no matter what our seed
has been. As long as I'm honored to be the head coach at Cincinnati, to me,
you enter a tournament to win it.  
  
At the end of the year, that's what banquets are for. So that's what I want my
kids to believe, that we're in the tournament to try to win the tournament.  
  
Better ask them. They've got you guys on the clock.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you talk about your second half and your ability to get
down low and score some buckets?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think I was rushing a bit in the first half, and I think I
just wanted to contribute for my team. I had to just read the defense and see
how they were playing me a little bit. This team is known for strips and
taking the ball away from the post once you turn around and show the ball.  
  
I had to have some composure in the second half and my teammates did a good
job of finding me. Gary did, Jarron did. I wanted to help my team out however
I could.  
  
Q. Gary, this is your fourth NCAA tournament. What have you learned in
the past that's helping you this time in your senior year?  
GARY CLARK: Like Coach said, it's one game and out. In this game, we had to
adjust. In every game, that's how it's going to be. You've got to adjust to
how the team's doing. Our adversity allows us to do that well. Being my fourth
year, tell young guys to just enjoy it, live in the moment and not get too
riled up about the crowd and all that. Just do what we've been doing all year.  
  
Q. For Gary and Kyle, about Simonds' play, Coach said he can play with
anybody in your conference. What did you think about his performance
tonight?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Like we said before, we have to tip our hat to Georgia State.
They're a hard coached program, hard playing program. He played with a chip on
his shoulder, made tough shots. The whole team played extremely hard. We have
to commend them for that. We're just happy to get out of here with a win.  
  
GARY CLARK: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. The way he started off the game,
getting them going early with his knocking down the three and getting to the
rim. The second half, we just had to adjust and try to slow them down a little
bit.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak a little bit about you out rebounding Georgia
State as well as shooting more threes than when they're a 3-point shooting
team?  
MICK CRONIN: You've got to give them credit. We don't want to shoot 30 threes.
They forced us to. They do a good job with their defense. They play a similar
defense to us. Fortunately, we didn't have to play them on one-day prep. But
it still forced us to take more 3s than we wanted to. That's why they're ninth
in the nation, I think, in field goal percentage defense.  
  
As far as out-rebounding them, obviously, our size advantage, but that was a
big part of the game plan. If we don't turn the ball over, we rebound the ball
at a high clip, almost 39 percent of our misses we usually get. We thought we
would get more than that today if we didn't turn it over.  
  
Jarron, now, I didn't see it coming, Jarron Cumberland getting eight offensive
rebounds, but he was awesome today. He was the best player on the floor.  
  
GARY CLARK: I like the bow tie.  
  
Q. Kyle, maybe you can speak to this. We've seen Gary's demeanor
throughout his career, whether things are going well or not going well. Kind
of has that calm presence and leadership on the court. What's the influence
that that brings for the rest of the guys on the team?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think it's just a calming presence and, you know, he has
quiet confidence. He's done damn near everything that you can do in this
program in terms of achievements and benchmarks. So I'm just glad to be his
front court mate, and I'm glad that our two kind of type of energies kind of
play off of each other and help it, you know, have a pretty good, you know,
atmosphere for the team. So I'm just happy for that and we're just going to
keep on doing what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Congratulations. See you
Sunday.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Phil Cofer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35069)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Mfiondu Kabengele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35137)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Florida State - 67, Missouri - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Florida State Seminoles are with us. They have a
date with Xavier on Sunday. Game two of the doubleheader. Time to be
announced. Coach Hamilton is with us, Phil Cofer, Trent Forrest and Mfiondu
Kabengele represent the student body. We'll have Coach Hamilton to have a
statement and we'll go for questions for all four gentlemen.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought the story for the first half was our guys were
connected defensively, and I thought their effort was as a result of respect
we have for Missouri and some of the tapes we've seen, how well they execute.
44 percent of their shots were 3s, and they have such a potent low post game.  
  
I thought our guys did a very good job defending the post and getting out in
transition. We forced ten turnovers with 20 points off the bench and that
really made a big difference and gave us a lot of energy and got everybody
involved.  
  
Second half, I thought they did a tremendous job coming out, denying spots on
the floor. We didn't handle it very well. Created some indecision on our part.
I was proud of our guys. I thought they maintained their composure and settled
down and we were able to extend the lead again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Florida State.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like your offense was able to get really going when
you had Trent on the court and it seemed to struggle a little bit when he was
off the court. What does he bring to the table as far as leadership and court
vision and all that when he's on the court that really makes the offense go?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: There's no question that Trent does a very good job of
distributing the ball and making good decisions. I think in order for him to
be effective, he had to have teammates that really, really follow his lead.  
  
We put four guys in the game there and we left Phil on the court, one of our
most experienced players. And we were able to get some deflections and Trent
was able to get us in and out of our systems.  
  
I thought it was a team effort. Trent does a great job defensively, does a
great job seeing the whole floor. He makes a tremendous difference when he's
on the floor.  
  
Q. For the players, they start out 7 of the first 8 points. What did you
all do at that point to take control of the first half?  
PHIL COFER: One of the things, we came back to the huddle and kept encouraging
guys. Every team is great in the tournament. They're going to make runs no
matter what. The best thing we have to do is keep our composure and just keep
doing us.  
  
TRENT FORREST: I would go off of what Phil said, just keeping our composure.
At this time, you can't get too strung out if people hit shots. At this point
in time, everybody is going to hit shots and make runs. It's able to stay
level head and keep focus the whole time.  
  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: This is the second year in a row. Recognize there's a lot
of basketball left. We knew they would make their run. It's a matter of when
we're going to make our run and minimize their runs. We have to regroup and
execute on both ends.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Thank you very much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the Seminoles? Thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach of the Longhorns is with us, Shaka Smart. He'll
start off with a statement about being in Nashville, about his team. Coach?  
  
SHAKA SMART: Before I do that, I just want to say that -- speak for our whole
program. Our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of Augie Garrido,
particularly Jeannie. Augie was a mentor of mine during my first couple years
at Texas and this is terribly sad news. Thinking about all of his loved ones.  
  
We're really excited to be in Nashville. Great opportunity for our team. Our
team has been through a lot of twists and turns this season. We've had some
great experiences that we've learned a lot from. Our guys have come together.
They've spent a lot of time together trying to figure out how we can be better
as a team.  
  
So hopefully, tomorrow night -- or tomorrow afternoon, against Nevada, we can
be the best version of Texas. Because when we've been that, we've done some
really good things.  
  
Q. Shaka, you look around, obviously, there's a lot of talent around
here. Mo is a guy that looks like a potential lottery pick, maybe has the most
untapped potential. Does he really need to step up and assert himself and sort
of prove something, maybe to everybody else but especially sort of to himself
since he's been out and kind of banged up the last few weeks?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, one of the reasons that he wanted to play college
basketball was so he could play in the NCAA tournament. Now he's here. Mo is a
great team guy. He's here with his teammates. He's enjoying the experience.  
  
But you're right, when that ball goes up in the air, that's what it's really
about. And he's very motivated. One of the things that we've tried to help him
understand this season is some of the guys you're going up against on a night
in, night out basis, they're a lot better than maybe you thought they were
coming in.  
  
And he's had some humbling experiences, going back to November, when guys have
gotten the better of him on certain plays or even over the course of a game.  
  
So I think the first step against Nevada is understanding who they have and
knowing what he has to do to be successful against them, along with his
teammates. But he's motivated. In terms of having something to prove, he
better. I mean, that's what this time of year's all about. If you don't have
something to prove, there's something wrong with you.  
  
In terms of potential, I mean, we knew this when we signed him. Whatever NBA
team drafts him will know this. Mo is years away from being the player that he
will be, but he's pretty darn good right now. He's someone that can dominate a
game on the defensive end. He's someone that can dominate a game, rebounding
the basketball, and he's gotten better and better offensively.  
  
So we just want to help him be the best version of Mo tomorrow, and that will
go a long way into our team playing well.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you just mentioned that Mo has gotten better
offensively as the season has gone on. What, specifically, about his offensive
game do you feel like has improved over the course of the season?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, right up until the day he got hurt, he got hurt in our game
at Oklahoma in mid-February. But he was spending a lot of extra time on his
shooting, on his post moves, free throws. He was doing a lot of extra work and
it was starting to pay off.  
  
It's interesting, because certain people in our local media were giving me a
hard time about him shooting 3s. He actually had a three or four-game stretch
where he shot over 70 percent from the 3-point line, got fouled shooting a 3,
went to the foul line, made his free throws.  
  
So he's gotten a lot better with shooting. His feel around the basket, when
there's traffic, when he has multiple defenders around him, has improved. His
ball handling, his passing.  
  
To be honest with you, the biggest challenge for him is going to be this is
his first full game back since he got hurt, so kind of getting back in the
rhythm of where he was and being as aggressive and assertive as he possibly
can be. Because playing against a veteran team, a team with a lot of toughness
and aggressiveness like Nevada, he has to be that in order to be successful.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, since the Selection Sunday, I didn't know how
much communication you all had with Andrew Jones at all, if you all have
interacted with him since coming to Nashville. What he's meant to the program
before and after his diagnosis.  
SHAKA SMART: Our guys talk to him all the time. I try to stay in touch with
him as much as I can. He's in Houston right now, and he's still undergoing
treatment. Andrew, he's got an unbelievable fight and a spirit that rubbed off
on our guys before this diagnosis and continues to rub off on our guys.  
  
He's someone that sets an example for our team as a guy who loves the game of
basketball. And if you go back to, you know, when all of us first started
playing this game, you played because you loved it and you played because it
was something that brought a smile to your face and a lot of joy.  
  
Andrew's always been that way. The game's been taken away from him
temporarily. We're all hopeful that he can beat this disease so that he can
become the basketball player that he wants to become again.  
  
But right now, our focus is on keeping him at the front of our mind, as a
central part of our team, and trying to represent him in the best way that we
can while we're here.  
  
Q. Shaka, I've seen Darrin Horn, one of your assistants mentioned in
lists of possible candidates elsewhere. First off, what has he given to your
staff? What has he added to your staff? How do you take that when guys on your
staff are looked at as possible head coaching candidates elsewhere?  
SHAKA SMART: I think it's a compliment to your staff. It's a compliment to
those guys. I think we've got a really good staff. Those guys have done a
great job with our guys.  
  
Darrin Horn, specifically, over the three years we've been in Texas, has done
a terrific job with our bigs. Going back to Cam Ridley and Prince Ibeh. Last
year, Jarrett Allen. This year, Mo and Jericho and Dylan and all of our bigs.
He's helped those guys on a daily basis get better.  
  
More importantly, be in the right frame of mind to be their best. That's an
underrated part of coaching.  
  
When guys from our staff, and we haven't had anyone yet at Texas, but we had
four at VCU go on to get coaching jobs, to be honest, that is right up there
next to players going on and reaching their ultimate goal for me as a thing
that I get the most joy and excitement out of.  
  
You got a guy sitting behind you named Jamion Christian that's been to two
NCAA tournaments at Mount St. Mary's and he worked for us at VCU. I follow
their games just as closely as I do anyone else.  
  
If a guy on our current staff was to get a head coaching job, I'd be ecstatic.
I'm one of those guys, when I was an assistant, I worked for different types
of head coaches. I worked with the old school head coaches that don't really
want you to look at anything, and then I worked for some that, you know,
they're behind you every step of the way, promote everything you do.  
  
I always told myself I was going to be in the latter category. So we're
fortunate to have good guys on our staff. If they get opportunities, that's
terrific.  
  
Q. Shaka, how close did you come to getting the Martin twins back in the
day? And number two, what problem do they present to you?  
SHAKA SMART: Those guys are really, really good. I don't think I could count
-- I mean, I think there's -- I could count on one hand the number of guys
that we've played all year long, and you know the schedule we've played,
Cedric, that are more dangerous than those guys.  
  
The challenges that they present, they're extremely versatile. They actually,
they both play -- they play every position for them because of the way they
play. But both of them, their natural position is kind of small forward, big
wing. That's one spot we don't have.  
  
We had a pretty good one last year that has since moved on. So that's the
first thing is just matching up with them.  
  
And then Caleb is a phenomenal scorer. He's always been wired to score. He's
extremely confident. He really gets going. His first step is very, very fast.  
  
Cody is as versatile as there is in college basketball. He literally can do
anything you ask a guy to do on the court, rebound, defend, play point guard,
initiate offense, shoot, drive, post up. Whatever you need.  
  
We didn't come very close to getting them. I wish we would have -- those guys
would have been all-time greats. I mean their jerseys would have been up in
the rafters if they'd have come to VCU. They'd probably be up in the rafters
at Nevada.  
  
I went there to see them and I remember having some great conversations on the
phone with their mom, single mom who is just a great, great lady. And the
boys, they weren't much on the phone. You know, they didn't have much to say.
But he were polite.  
  
But I went to see them, and I was like wow, these guys would be phenomenal.
About a week later, they committed to NC State, so I obviously didn't make
much of an impression.  
  
Then when they were transferring a couple years ago, I actually called them
and I think they expressed, you know, an interest in coming to visit. But at
the time, we only had one scholarship, and there were a package deal, going
together.  
  
Those are the type of situations where you got to find a scholarship. I'm not
saying we would have got them, but those guys are terrific. I'm a big fan of
theirs.  
  
Q. You just mentioned the Martin twins, but Nevada obviously has two
other all conference players in Jordan Caroline and Kendall Stephens. Is there
a player who is the heartbeat of team or the player who makes the team go?  
SHAKA SMART: I think Caroline is as much of that as anyone. I mean, it's hard
to say that Cody or Caleb, you know, isn't the heartbeat. But I think what
Jordan Caroline does for them is he gives them an unbelievable toughness and
swagger and fight to them.  
  
Just watching them on tape and on TV, he seems to be the guy that has the
biggest chip on his shoulder of their players. Obviously, a lot of the times,
he's shorter than the guy he's going up against, but he's almost always more
aggressive. Seems like he wants it more. Tougher, more physical.  
  
So over the last few days, we've been conveying that to our team, because
doesn't really matter if you're three, four, five inches taller if the guy
you're playing against has more heart, more toughness, more fight. So I would
say he's the guy.  
  
Then you mentioned Stephens. He's as good a shooter as I've seen in college
basketball. He's just -- you can't give him space because he's got
unbelievable size if you let him get that shot off. He's so deadly.  
  
Q. Shaka, interested to know how well do you know Augie, and you both
are philosophical coaching types. Did you ever speak to him about the game
inside the games that you coach?  
SHAKA SMART: All the time. I knew Augie really well. He kind of took me under
his wing when I first got to Texas. He came over to practice -- a lot of
people don't know this. Augie is a basketball guy. Augie played basketball.
That was kind of his first love.  
  
Obviously, baseball turned out pretty well for him.  
  
But he came to practice a couple times, and one of my favorite things to do
was just sit and listen to him talk about his philosophy on coaching. There's
so many things that I've taken from him. I'll never forget, we went to
Magnolia Cafe. It was Coach Kuyper, myself, Augie and a guy by the name of Ken
Ravizza who works for the Chicago Cubs.  
  
Coach Kuyper and I said about five words over the course of two hours and
those guys talked the whole time. I have this black book that I make notes in,
and I just filled it up.  
  
The thing that I loved about Augie is his passion and how much he cared about
his guys, and he was unrelenting in expecting and demanding that people care
about and respect the game to the level that he did.  
  
And to be honest, I think that was probably a frustration for him at times in
some of the latter years. As a coach, that can be frustrating when you want
certain things more than -- for a guy more than he wants himself.  
  
But Augie was as good as anyone at getting guys to see the light and I'm going
to miss him a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Kevin Puryear](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32839)

### [Kassius Robertson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34884)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our 3:30 time slot features the University of Missouri Tigers.
They are the No. 8 seed in the West Region. They are out of the Southeastern
Conference. They'll play Florida State, the 9 seed, in Friday's second game.
The men's basketball contact is Patrick Crawford.  
  
We have Kassius Robertson and Kevin Puryear on the dais. We'll go to questions
immediately.  
  
Q. For either one of you, now that you've had time to study Florida
State, obviously you guys (indiscernible) with them on Sunday. But what stands
out to you about them?  
KEVIN PURYEAR: I'd say really just their speed. Being in the SEC, Arkansas is
probably one of the fastest teams in our league. I think kind of the
comparison that I'll draw with them. They have some really good guards. Like
to attack the lane and they've got some guys that can really get in the lane
and those guys that can get in the lane really and complement the shooters as
well as for kicks. Got some big guys on the interior that can block shots as
well. I think they're a pretty well rounded team so it's going to be a good
challenge for us.  
  
KASSIUS ROBERTSON: They've got size, athleticism. They're good at breaking
down guys off the dribble and getting into the paint. Working it inside-out.
So, yeah, I think they're going to be a good challenge.  
  
Q. Just the basic, you know, what the experience has been like as you're
finally here and able to soak it all in.  
KASSIUS ROBERTSON: It's been really cool. The hotel we're staying at is really
cool. Obviously, this will be our first day of practice over here. So it will
be nice to get on the court over there and kind of feel the place out.  
  
But I don't think I've taken it in completely until we start playing, I think.
So I hold off my answer until we actually start playing.  
  
KEVIN PURYEAR: Kind of piggyback off what he says, it's been really fun, just
able to interact with some people since we got here. Extremely humbling
opportunity for us. We worked extremely hard to put ourselves in this point.
To be here is surreal. I'm a junior, this is my first time here. This is
Kassius' first time here as well. Just soaking in every opportunity that we
get and it's been really fun so far.  
  
Q. Kevin, you talked about when you've committed to Missouri, about
bringing the program back to a place like this. How much does this mean to you
after the past three years. For Kassius, obviously, you said it was your
ultimate goal for a while. Similar question.  
KEVIN PURYEAR: I mean, it means a great deal to me, growing up in Missouri and
being a fan of the program, pretty much my whole life.  
  
I always dreamed of getting this team back to this point and being able to
contribute to that. It's a feeling I can't really describe, especially after
winning the total of 18 games my first two years of college.  
  
So like I said, just extremely humbling experience and really glad that --
unfortunately, I mean, they sucked but taking those bumps I took and learning
along the way, I needed all those lessons to get me to this point here. Makes
it even more special to experience it with these guys.  
  
KASSIUS ROBERTSON: Yeah. Oh, sorry.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, I know you guys have tried to work Michael Porter back
into the mix here. Has that been challenging? How have you tried to navigate
through practice and in games recently?  
KASSIUS ROBERTSON: We just let him -- he's a great player so he's not going to
try to be somebody he's not. He's going to come in, play the game. And don't
forget, we did have three, four months of practice with him before the season
started so it's not like he's a stranger to us. We know exactly how he plays,
who he is.  
  
So it's just a matter of getting him game reps, and this has been -- and
practice reps and this has been the last couple weeks. He's been able to get a
good game under his belt and now he's had a week of good practice. So I think
he's fine. I think it's not really any concern of ours to make sure he's back
and back with the kind of flow of the team. I think he's doing fine.  
  
KEVIN PURYEAR: I would say the same. He's a very, very selfless player. So
he's not one, like Kash said, to do anything completely out of character. We
love playing with him. He's working to get back into his game self and he's
been out of the game for quite a while now. But he's coming along really
nicely.  
  
With how we've been practicing leading up to this point, full speed, getting
up and down for a while practice, I think that's helping him even more to get
acclimated so he's been doing a great job thus far.  
  
Q. You're down to eight players now. How much has been emphasized this
week with not getting into foul trouble and trying to play with such short
depth?  
KEVIN PURYEAR: To be honest, I don't think we've talked about that at all. I
don't think we want to get away from playing how we play. Our last game was
pretty bad as far as, you know, us fouling. Probably the worst game we've had
all year as far as guarding without fouling. But that was probably the only
one I can think of in recent memory where we've had a game like that.  
  
I think we really want to stick to our principles, not be tentative, even
though we're low on bodies, still play aggressive and play how we play.
Everything else will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Both of you, you talk about working Michael Porter back in. How much
does it help, even with the numbers you've got right now, you got to the
tournament and now you get to add him back into the mix? Does that provide
maybe an extra dose of confidence as you get ready to take the court?  
KASSIUS ROBERTSON: Yeah. I mean, I think it's obviously a great help to our
team any time you can add that type of talent to your team, nobody would say
no.  
  
He brings so many things to the table, not just scoring as well. So when he is
playing at his best, which I don't think anybody's seen in college basketball
just yet, nobody has got an real good look at it so it's kind of hard to scout
for them too.  
  
And he just, like I said, he brings so many different dynamics to the game,
especially for us. Like, you know, Alec said, we're down on bodies. We're
really low on bodies so it's kind of perfect timing that he came back and kind
of helped us out with that as well. So there's so many tangibles that he's
brought by coming back.  
  
Q. If you were to win Friday, you'd add Jordan Barnett back into the mix
Sunday. Is it an easier integration to bring him back in the fold if you were
to win tomorrow night, than it would be with Mike because he's been out for so
long?  
KEVIN PURYEAR: For sure. Barnett's only been out for -- this will be his only
game all season. So, you know, I don't think he'll really miss a beat,
honestly. He's been a great producer for us all year, rebounding, shooting,
you know, just being that gritty guy that we've needed all season.  
  
So I don't think it will be very hard to get back into the mix of things and,
you know, if we win that first game, I think he'll come back in full swing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow night.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach of the Wolf Pack is Eric Musselman. We're going to
ask him about Nashville and then going to questions.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Our guys are really excited to be here. Had some really good
food last night. Walked in our locker room. Have an awesome NHL Predators
jersey, which is really cool. Wolf Pack on the back. So hospitality's been
great.  
  
Hopefully, tomorrow afternoon, we can entertain everybody here and play the
way that we have for most of the year.  
  
Q. Coach, the guys just talked about one of the problems Texas can
present is that size. Is the game plan to run?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah. I mean, that's kind of been the game plan all year. I
mean, we're not going to turn into a team that walks the ball up the floor. We
like to say we're cosmetically pleasing at times, getting the ball up the
floor as fast as we can and spacing out.  
  
We have incredible respect for Texas and Coach Smart. They're so well coached
and they have great size and they have players that have bright futures, guys
that are going to play at the next level.  
  
Having said that, we've got to be better than them for one game, for 40
minutes. But yeah, they're long and we're not.  
  
Q. Coach, last year, against Iowa, you guys were the unexperienced team.
This year, coming into this game, you're the experienced team. How did that
play in difference in prepping this team for this game?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, I think in that locker room right now, because we just
walked in it, that from an experience standpoint, for last year, it was Jordan
Caroline, myself, Josh Hall, and Coach Ruta. And then it stops.  
  
But we do have guys that have played. Obviously, Cody and Caleb Martin,
Kendall Stephens and Hallice Cook. So we have some guys who have played under
these bright lights, maybe not with our program but with other programs.
Obviously, I think for Jordan and Josh, it's going to help a lot.  
  
But I think once the ball's thrown up -- last year, Iowa State had a ton of
experience, and I do think early in the game, it had a big impact. By the time
we felt comfortable, they had a lead and they were too talented for us to come
back, even though we scratch and clawed and got the thing within striking
distance a couple times. They just had too many veterans for us to overcome.  
  
But this year, Texas plays -- you know, like, when you go to Kansas and play
in the environments they play in and they got incredible amount of experience,
even though, I mean, I know the age of Bamba and Jericho Sims and stuff. But
they played in big time environments. When you're able to do that night after
night, there's no stage too big.  
  
Q. Eric, when Caleb and Cody decided to leave NC State, there were so
many teams interested in their services. Do you remember your reaction when
they said, Okay, we're coming to Nevada.  
Also, what flexibility do they give you, especially in guard match-ups,
because they're so big?  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I'll go the second question first. Caleb and Cody create --
they're totally different players. They look alike, obviously. It's not often
that a program can have their starting power forward move to the starting
point guard position with six or seven games to go.  
  
Obviously, we're still a team evolving with Cody at the 1. But we've been a
team that's done a remarkable job all season long at taking care of the
basketball and not turning the ball over.  
  
One of the best in the country all year at that, and it hasn't changed with
the injury of Lindsey Drew.  
  
Caleb is just a big-time shot maker, can make shots that are defended, can get
his own shot whenever he wants. Those are qualities, when plays break down,
you need players that have ability that X and Os don't get them shots. He
doesn't need X and Os on the chalkboard to get him shots. He's got a special
gift to rise over people.  
  
And then on their recruiting visit, we really recruited Cody hard. We knew
that all the other programs that were recruiting both Cody and Caleb, that
they were going to go after Caleb harder because of his stats at NC State.  
  
So when I got with our staff, we decided to go a different route and really go
after Cody, because I knew that Caleb already had all the love from everybody.
We recruited Cody harder than we recruited Caleb, and I think his mom really
appreciated that.  
  
Obviously, Cody did. Caleb already knew he was going to be comfortable
wherever he went so we took a unique and kind of outside-the-box approach and
it ended up helping us.  
  
Q. What makes Nevada such a good place for transfers to kind of come and
want to be there and flourish a bit?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think that just as Coach Hoiberg did at Iowa State, when you
have -- first of all, we needed our first group to come and believe in the
vision that we sold. And those guys all had really good years. Jordan Caroline
was part of that first class. Marcus Marshall, a First Team All League MVP-
type of player. He had a season last year that was really good.  
  
Now Caleb and Cody, one's MVP, one's Defensive Player of the Year. Jordan
Caroline is First Team All League. And so when you start building that and
guys have success, I think it becomes more desirable.  
  
And certainly, when transfers are on the market now, we have a lot more name
recognition nationally than maybe we did three years ago. And it's kind of
been a destination spot for some guys, and it really hasn't had anything to do
from a geographical standpoint with us.  
  
Probably the neatest thing is when guys come on our campus and see how
beautiful our campus is and how much the community rallies around the team and
people are really surprised at our arena and how we have a practice facility.
And so all those things have helped us tremendously attract players from all
across the country.  
  
Q. Coach, you've coached at both the mid-major and so-called power five
conference level now. There's been a lot of talk about how the composition of
this year's tournament is pretty heavily tilted toward the power five. What
are your thoughts on maybe the respect the mid-majors are getting from the
Selection Committee and just the composition of the tournament the last couple
years?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think for us, we feel like the Selection Committee showed
great respect for us. We read everything we possibly could about the schedule
and trying to schedule road games and trying to schedule TCU on a neutral site
and try to pay Texas Tech in Lubbock.  
  
So we did what we had read was going to hold a lot of weight, spent a lot of
time on our non-conference schedule. Obviously, we didn't win our last game
against San Diego State, but we still had garnered enough respect through our
body of work in non-conference and regular season conference play.  
  
So I can only speak for ourselves from a mid-major. I think that they did us
right. They did what we deserved. I didn't see or feel any disrespect
whatsoever at all. Actually, I think that the committee really respected what
we had done and how we had done it.  
  
Q. Coach, you said on Sunday that you hadn't had much of a chance to
delve into Texas yet in terms of through the year. Anything change your mind
from Sunday to now in terms of their personnel? Anybody surprise you maybe you
didn't know much about?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: If you want to do a quiz on each guy, I know everything about
every guy on their team right now. Obviously, the first thing you see is their
size with Bamba and Jericho Sims and Roach's athleticism. He's improved his
3-point shooting. Coleman does a great job of jumping in passing lanes.
Defensively, he's a tough cover in transition, gets in the lane, has floaters.  
  
Obviously, Dylan at the 4 spot can shoot the ball. Early in the year,
baseline, out of bounds, he did a good job faking handoffs and dribble
driving. He's taken a high volume of 3s. He can pass the ball. He works the
elbow areas really good.  
  
And then, obviously, Young has come off the bench of late and really provided
them a great offensive boost and can shoot the 3.  
  
So we know a little bit about them.  
  
Q. Do you feel like your team has taken a different mindset and
confidence in this year's tournament than last year's?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think last year, we were really happy to be here. There were
celebrations, so to speak, the whole time, from the moment that he had made
the tournament. It had been a while since the Wolf Pack were part of the
tournament.  
  
I think that, you know, all over our community, that it was a time of semi-
celebration. I mean, we're here to try to win a basketball game, and that's
it. We are happy and everything, but I don't see guys tweeting stuff out like
we did last year. I don't see the cameras going all over the place, taking
pictures of everything.  
  
I think that we have a business-like approach, respecting Texas incredibly.
But coming here, with the mindset of, you know, we're trying to win a
basketball game tomorrow.  
  
Q. On Jericho Sims, I know you recruited him very hard and I know your
dad is very familiar with his family, I guess. What did you like so much about
him? What has he given Texas and how badly did it hurt when you weren't able
to get him?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I mean, we tried really hard, but we couldn't -- didn't really
help. Obviously, his father, Charles, played for my dad at Minnesota; and
Charles' brother, Lee, played for my dad at Ashland. Great family.  
  
He's got great length. He's got an unbelievable amount of up side. Can block
shots, can really finish at the rim, great mobility laterally, great ability
vertically to get off the ground quickly. And just, you know, his wing span is
incredible. When you put him and Bamba together, it presents problems.  
  
Obviously, those two guys have played minutes together. When Bamba had his
injury, Jericho got a little bit more minutes and you could see his confidence
growing as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach, best of luck.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Thank you.

### [D'Marcus Simonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35031)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Georgia State university Panthers are first up. They're the
No. 15 seed in the South Region. They're the Sun Belt Conference tournament
champions. They'll play No. 2 Cincinnati in Friday's first game at 1:00. The
men's basketball contact is Mike Holmes. The student-athletes we have here are
Malik Benlevi, Jordan Session, D'Marcus Simonds and Devin Mitchell.  
  
We will take questions.  
  
Q. Jordan, I believe you were on that team three years ago that advanced
in the tournament. If that is correct, just what confidence do you get out of
that experience and what have you kind of told some of your younger teammates
about what to expect?  
JORDAN SESSION: It's an exciting time of the year. I told them that just enjoy
the moment, really. We've got to take it one day at a time. We came here to
win a game, so we're really looking forward to playing.  
  
Q. Jordan, how do you compare D'Marcus with R.J.? Obviously, great
players, great scorers. Maybe they do their thing in a different way, but
could you kind of explain and contrast their games?  
JORDAN SESSION: They're both good players, like you said. They both affect the
game in a lot of ways. I feel like D'Marcus is a high energy guy where R.J. is
a more high volume shooter. They both impact the game in a great way. The both
have the ball in their hand a lot, and they both help everyone else get
involved. They're both really good players. Obviously, I play with D'Marcus
and R.J., but it's hard to compare two different guys. They're both just
really great players.  
  
Q. I saw a tweet, the stool from three years ago made the trip out to
Nashville. What are you all doing with it? Is it in the locker room? Good luck
charm? What are you all doing with that?  
MALIK BENLEVI: To be honest, I don't know about the stool. I seen the tweet.
We're looking for good luck. We're playing Cincinnati. We know they're a good
team. I think we've got a good chance of beating them.  
  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: Yeah, I mean I guess it's just good luck for the school, but
we really just came here to play basketball, you know. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. D'Marcus, can you just talk about what you see when you watch
Cincinnati play, what concerns you, what you think their strengths are?  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: I mean, everybody that's watched Cincinnati knows they play
really good defense. The press is really aggressive. But, you know, at the end
of the day, basketball is basketball. So we're going to come ready to play.
They're going to come ready to play and kind of let the cards fall.  
  
Q. Congratulations to you guys. For Devin, can you talk about the
shooting that you guys bring to the floor? And for all of you guys, how much
fun has this week been so far as you guys get ready to play tomorrow?  
DEVIN MITCHELL: We're a 3-point shooting team. We led the Sun Belt in 3-point
shooting. Jeff Thomas is a good shooter, myself, Malik and the rest of the
guys are really good at stretching floor. It's something we work on a lot.  
  
As far as the weekend, it's just been great. My first experience, a lot of our
guys' first experience, just having these guys to soak it all in and just
really enjoy every moment and every second of it.  
  
MALIK BENLEVI: I think 3-point shooting has been a huge strength for our team,
being able to stretch the floor with a great player like D'Marcus getting to
the cup, finding us. So that's been really the reason we won a lot of games
this year.  
  
This experience is truly a blessing. Most people don't get to live, go to
March Madness, so I'm just appreciating the moment.  
  
Q. You guys seem to play with a lot of freedom on the floor. Talk about
what it's like to play with a coach that gives you that type of freedom and
the enjoyment you seem to have on the floor.  
JORDAN SESSION: Like you said, we kind of play with a lot of freedom. At the
same time, we're playing for a guy that really loves basketball. He gives us a
lot of freedom because he loves the game. We go out there, we have fun.  
  
We mess up, he gets on it. We still bounce back and we play with a lot of
energy. That's what we're here for. We're here to play with a lot of energy.  
  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: If you're watching, it looks real free, but it's a system.
It's a system. We're running our offense through in and out. So, I mean, it's
great playing for Coach Hunter because he really loves the game, he loves his
players. So he's going to put us in the best spot to win.  
  
Yeah, we're just going to keep playing free.  
  
DEVIN MITCHELL: Yeah, kind of the same thing. What those two guys said. We
play free, but I think everybody knows their role and everybody enjoys playing
their role. So I think that's the biggest thing. We know who our best player
is. We allow him to do what he does, and everybody just plays to their
strengths around them and that's the biggest strength of our team.  
  
Q. Devin, you mentioned your ability to stretch the floor. In
particular, against Cincinnati, how do you think that will be effective? Will
that be able to negate some of the things they do defensively?  
DEVIN MITCHELL: I mean, we watched them. They're really an aggressive bunch,
so I'm sure they're not afraid of our 3-point shooters. I'm pretty sure
they're going to try to crowd us a lot, run us off that line.  
  
At the end of the day, you know, we work on things and we'll be able to get
our shot off. We're not worried about that at all.  
  
Q. D'Marcus, I'm wondering what brought you to Georgia? What made you
decide on Georgia State during the recruiting process? Were there other
schools you considered? It's kind of nearby, but what was it about their
program that appealed to you?  
D'MARCUS SIMONDS: I got the best teammates in the country, in my opinion. I
mean, I'm sure the guys from other teams say that, but I've got the best
teammates in the country. I knew them before I even decided to make my trip to
Georgia State.  
  
And I got the best coach in Georgia, you know, Coach Ron Hunter. It's been a
real blessing to play for him. It's been a blessing to play alongside these
guys. So that's why I chose Georgia State.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Cuonzo Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20518)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach Cuonzo Martin is here with us. He'll guide the
Missouri Tigers against Florida State. He'll make an opening statement about
being in Nashville, and then we will go to questions.  
  
CUONZO MARTIN: Very excited to be here. Our guys have done a really good job
throughout the season, doing a lot of different things. Adversity, injuries.
Tremendous effort from those guys to stay the course, stay positive, have
energy.  
  
Now to be here in the NCAA tournament to play a very talented Florida State
team which Coach Hamilton is one of the guys I truly respect in this
profession. So happy to be here and excited to play.  
  
Q. On Sunday, you said you knew some of the tendencies of Coach
Hamilton's team but obviously didn't get to see much of them on film. Now that
you've had time, what stands out to you about them?  
CUONZO MARTIN: They're talented. I can't give you everything. They're a really
good team. Length, seems like coach's teams always have length, athleticism.
They score with the ball. They've done a tremendous job of defending. That's
where Coach hangs his hat at. You talk about scoring 80 points. That's another
level you have to factor in. The way they score, the way they transition. In
most cases they will have four guys on the floor at all times that can handle,
make decisions, get to the rim, make a shot. They put so much pressure on you
with their length on the defensive side of the ball.  
  
The other thing they do is send four, five guys to the glass. That means
you're boxing out. In most cases you might box out three, maybe four. Now
you're blocking out sometimes five. That's not something we've seen a lot this
season.  
  
Q. Cuonzo, now that you've had Michael for a game, has it been any -- I
don't know if easier is the right word, but kind of setting where you see
players playing and performing at their best now that you've got one under the
belt?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I think he'll be -- I didn't think he played bad in the last
game. I thought he played with a level of confidence. Anytime you can shoot 17
shots and I don't think he forced shots, that shows his level of confidence.
That part was great, that he didn't lose that.  
  
I just think really put him in position so he can be successful. Allow it to
come to him, because again the pressure, the stage, the adrenaline, all those
things factor into how he performs and really having fun.  
  
But really fitting him into what the other guys are doing so he can complement
the other guys. It's too late in the game for the guy to say do what we do,
change to it fit him. He has to fit in to what the guys are doing. I think
he'll do a good job with that.  
  
Q. Cuonzo, having guys that lost so much there in the past three years,
how much do you think it means to them to be in the NCAA tournament? Also, for
Kash, because a big reason why he came here was for another shot at the
tournament?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I think it means a lot. I think it means a lot to all the guys.
They put the work in and they saw some situation where I wouldn't say it
started looking bleak, but when you've got guys going down, one of your key
guys who you factored in as being your leading scorer, he's not there. So now
you have some bumps in the road. You lose three in a row, here you come back
and win a game. You lose three in a row, and the next situation, you come back
and win a game.  
  
A lot of different things factored into the guys of not allowing themselves to
give in or give up. I think it speaks volumes about their character, their
makeup to be resilient and continue to fight. I'm just really happy for them
to do that. I've never been around a situation where you win 27 games in three
years. So the mental state, more than anything, before you even get to the
floor, how you develop the confidence level so guys can compete and understand
that they're still good players, you just went through something. So let's
learn from it, let's become better basketball players.  
  
Q. Your numbers are down right now, and Barnett is sitting out tomorrow
night. How much does that maybe help getting Porter back and having a full
week of practice under his belt since he had some game action?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I think it helps a great deal. You can't -- as talented as Mike
is, you can't replace what Barnett brings to the table just from the
standpoint of his presence and his ability to be calm through any type of
situation and the way he shoots the ball from the 3-point line at a high
level.  
  
But I think Mike obviously is a very talented player and we'll put him in a
position to be successful. You're not going to replace a guy of that magnitude
because he's been through it for so long and guys lean on him for production.  
  
And a veteran presence. I've never been around a guy -- he's 22 years old --
with that sense of calmness to him through any situation. So most players look
to that. If it's not there, it's an adjustment within itself.  
  
Q. Couple of your guys said right now, this just seems like another road
game. Is that how you want them to approach this? Is there any worry about,
hey, putting too much on this because it has been a while?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I don't really put nothing on it outside of this is what we do
to be successful, defend, rebound and play as hard as you can play from start
to finish. The emotions, the adrenaline, that's what it is. You can say what
you want to say as a coach. Coach Keady said a lot of things in the locker
room but my feelings were my feelings when I stepped on the floor.  
  
Our job as a coaching staff is to prepare the guys to play the game and to
play with a level of mental toughness morning anything and stay the course.
Whatever happens, up ten, down ten, whatever happens in the game, stay the
course because you'll give yourself a chance to win if you do the things that
we talk about.  
  
Q. Cuonzo, if you win tomorrow, you bring back Barnett Sunday. With him
only missing one game, is it a lot easier to integrate a guy back into a
postseason game because he's played the whole season? Or there's still a
challenge?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I don't think there's a challenge at all because, again, his
approach -- I think what makes him good is his approach to the game, his
approach to practice, and he's so even-keeled. So I think that helps him.  
  
Maybe obviously deal with something mentally how he's going through, how
people might perceive him when he steps on the floor, how he think what people
might think of him. He might deal with that. But I thought he's had a great
presence in dealing with tough situations, even on the floor. I think he'll be
okay.  
  
Q. Wondering if you could elaborate on your relationship with Coach
Hamilton. When did you first meet him and what has he meant to you throughout
your career?  
CUONZO MARTIN: Well, I've known him for a long time, even though we hadn't
met, you know, when I watched him from afar. His presence as a coach, his
reputation.  
  
So I started coaching in 2000 at Purdue with Coach Keady, so I would imagine
somewhere around there. When you're an assistant coach, and even as an
African-American coach who has been through it a long time, you migrate to
guys to get information. How do you do this, how do you maintain, how do you
have success. It's all those things. I think it probably started with one of
his assistant coaches. You're always around each other, wanting to meet Coach
and his demeanor. His calmness as a man, as a leader really stood out to me.  
  
I've been a defensive-minded guy. Coach is built on that. So just developing
that relationship from that. Really oftentimes we talk a lot, it's not even
about the basketball piece. We talk about the development of young men, how
can you help young guys outside of basketball. How can you help coaches when
they come into this profession, like he helped me when I first got into it
with the information he gave me. How can you help other guys getting into it.
We spend a lot of time talking about that more so than the actual game.  
  
Q. The 38 minutes you're missing now from Jordan, are Reed and Bret
playing similar roles as they were last week or do you ask the core six guys
to play more than they would otherwise?  
CUONZO MARTIN: The thing we talk about is being prepared. In Bret Rau's case,
be prepared to play. Same way with Reed. He's in the fold.  
  
We don't go into the game and say we'll try to get this guy 15 minutes. We
play basketball. We try to win the basketball game. We want our key guys to be
on the floor. This time, you don't have time to rest. You can rest in the
summertime. You have April, May, rest then. This is basketball. I think for
most young guys, I would imagine at this stage, I'm not fatigued or exhausted
by anything. I'm trying to win games.  
  
Q. Coach, going back to your relationship with Leonard Hamilton, is
there maybe a particular conversation in mind that sticks out in your mind?
How much has he kind of helped your career?  
CUONZO MARTIN: I think the biggest thing -- and a lot of conversations because
this is years. The biggest thing, I think, what he always talked about is even
though you've been around coaches -- and I was under Coach Keady and obviously
Coach Keady is like a father to me and he taught me a lot of things. He just
said you always want to have your own style, whatever that is. He said, Don't
let it be a struggle to do what you want to do as a basketball coach. If it
doesn't work, then it was what you wanted to do as a coach.  
  
And that was a hard thing for me for years, to understand that, because you
have a blueprint in your mind. You think this is what it's supposed to be. If
you want to tweak something, make a change, should I do this, will it work.
Just being confident in doing what you do.  
  
This is my tenth year as a head coach, just even that conversation years ago,
some things I've changed this year and it helped me become a better coach.  
  
So that's the information I would give a new coach, a young coach. You have to
be able to do what you feel is best and what you feel comfortable with, and
not get caught up in what you see somebody else doing. And just be you.  
  
Q. Cuonzo, with all the changes to your roster all year long, the guys
never really seemed all that rattled by it. How have you liked their approach
to kind of the outside noise when there's a lot of changes happening?  
CUONZO MARTIN: Well, I thank you for that, just in your observation, because
that's what, amongst a lot of things, I take most pride in. Because outside of
whatever happens on the floor, you win some, you lose some, you miss shots,
you turn the ball over, whatever happens.  
  
But you talk about real life. This all translates to real life. Stuff happens
in your families as a father, a husband, you're the leader of your family.
What do you do when adversity hits? Do you break? Do you give up? Do you quit?
Do you deal with it, brush it off and keep moving forward? That's what I tell
our guys. Not that you don't deal with situations. Deal with it, learn from
it. Some lessons are more painful than others, but let's make the necessary
adjustments, deal what you need to deal with and let's move forward. We don't
have time to complain and make excuses.  
  
The truth of the matter, this is what I tell them, this is only a sport. This
is real life. Somebody didn't wake up this morning. Now let's put this in
perspective of what it really is. It's a sport. It's a lot of entertainment at
a high level and everybody wants to win and be successful, but, man, I'm not
losing a lot of sleep over you missing ten shots in a game when somebody lost
their life. That's the big picture.  
  
Q. Coach Martin, you recruited Phil Cofer to Tennessee. When you left
Tennessee, he came to Florida State. Was there a conversation between you or
your staff and Leonard and his staff, or was Phil being recruited by Florida
State at the same time?  
CUONZO MARTIN: No, we -- well, as I recall, when I left -- one thing I left,
when I left Tennessee, with the current guys at Tennessee and even the guys
that we recruited, what I suggested to all those guys, to stay at Tennessee
and be part of it because I thought they had a big core. That was the biggest
thing. I've never been a guy to try to poach a guy, take a guy, all those
things. Be a part of what you're doing.  
  
In Phil's case because I knew his mom and dad real well, it wasn't as if I was
saying, okay, let's get you on the back side to go to Coach Hamilton. Once
guys found out they were -- I was in transition, so it wasn't like I was on
the phone helping other guys. I was trying to find my way, what I was doing.  
  
I think it maybe came down to the point where his mom and dad talked to me,
what's the option, what about this program, what about that program. Maybe I
gave my two cents, but it wasn't a case of Coach Leonard doing something he
shouldn't have been doing or whatever. It was all above board. I think it was
a good fit for them. At the same time, what happened them, they were
recruiting him as well so it worked out for them, yes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck against Florida State.  
  
CUONZO MARTIN: Thank you.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome back. Up here now are the
Xavier University Musketeers. They're the No. 1 seed in the West Region.
They're the Big East regular season champions and will face No. 16 seeded
Texas Southern in Friday's game.  
  
The men's basketball contact is Tom Eiser, and the student-athletes up here
are J.P. Macura, Kerem Kanter, Trevon Bluiett, and Sean O'Mara. And we'll go
right into questions.  
  
Q. Welcome, fellas. I wonder, for the three returning players, is this a
happy, kind of joyful moment to be at this stage of the season, or is it your
fourth trip to the tournament, does this kind of feel like a business-type
trip at this point in your career?  
J.P. MACURA: I would say, yes, it's a business trip. The coaches have talked
to us about it all year, about taking one game at a time and never overlooking
an opponent. I think we need to lock in on Texas Southern and really know what
they run and how their players play.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Pretty much what J.P. said. It's a business trip for us. Like
we said before, seeding doesn't necessarily matter. Anything can happen. So
we've got to take this game, take the tournament one game at a time and just
focus on what's in front of us.  
  
SEAN O'MARA: Pretty much the same thing for me, honestly.  
  
Q. J.P., do you have a black eye right now?  
J.P. MACURA: Yeah. Got elbowed. It really hurt.  
  
Q. When? And by whom?  
J.P. MACURA: Practice. I don't remember who did it, though. I'll get 'em back.  
  
Q. Looking at this tournament, the top four seeds, Xavier seems to be a
popular upset pick. It seems like a lot of people want to choose against you
guys. What do you do when you hear that information and how do you kind of
react to people being against you at this point?  
J.P. MACURA: Nothing. We don't really care about those people at all, to be
honest with you.  
  
We care about our teammates and our coaches, and we're going to prepare for
Texas Southern.  
  
Q. For Sean and Kerem, regarding the game itself. How do you evaluate
the matchups at the center forward position. They're kind of undersized in
their starter, and then they have a seven-footer coming off the bench. How do
you guys view that matchup?  
KEREM KANTER: We watched a little bit of videotape yesterday on what they like
to do and stuff. We just have to play our basketball. We have enough talent to
beat any team in the country, so we have to stick to our game plan.  
  
SEAN O'MARA: They're a team that has a lot of guys that have come from a lot
of different programs, so we can't really see them maybe as what might be on
their jersey, but these guys are high major players. It's a very good team.
They're here for a reason.  
  
Q. Trevon, Coach has said that he thinks your defense, team defense has
grown up a lot in the last three weeks. Would you agree with that assessment?
And what, particularly, do you feel like you guys have done better, compared
to earlier in the season?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah. I think, you know, we have been. Those areas is just
locking in on key details, whether we're supposed to whip screens or chase
screens coming off, ball screen defense. It's just different type of stuff,
just making sure that we're sharp. I wouldn't necessarily say it's the energy.
The effort was there. It was just being focused and locking on to certain
players, and how we play those certain players.  
  
Q. One of the issues maybe the team has had is putting together two
halves that were consistent. What gives you, I guess, the idea or the promise
that you guys can do that heading into this tournament?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Just from what's been going on in practice, I feel like the
last practice we had and, you know, just a lot of energy. And you can just
tell that we're excited and ready to get this postseason going.  
  
So based on the couple of practices, I would say, you know, that's an
indication that I feel like we're ready to put two halves together.  
  
Q. For Tre, if you don't mind again, Demontrae Jefferson, it's an
interesting little guard, kind of fits the prototype of guard that has given
you guys trouble over the course of time.  
Just what do you make of him?  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: I've known him since about middle school. I mean, I played him
probably about five, six times growing up and he's always been that type of
player.  
  
He's a great player. He lacks the size, but he makes up for it with his
scoring and all that. He's an exciting player. We have shown that we have
trouble with small guards in the past, but I feel like we've made adjustments
to that and so, hopefully, we'll be able to contain him.  
  
Q. Last year, you guys were an 11 seed. This year, being a 1, never been
a 1 seed before. Does that add any pressure to you guys, being more the hunted
this year, rather than the huntee?  
J.P. MACURA: Not at all. Like I said earlier, we're just going to play our
basketball and stick to the things that we do. And we're going to take one
game at a time.  
  
KEREM KANTER: I wasn't on the team last year, but like Tre said before,
seeding doesn't matter at this point. Anything can happen in March, so you
just got to be prepared for it.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, no pressure. We know what pressure is, so...  
  
SEAN O'MARA: Same.  
  
Q. I don't want to leave you out, Kerem. In terms of your appreciation
level, just coming from a one-bid league up to this point in your college
career, what does this stage mean to you?  
KEREM KANTER: Everything. This is why I came to Xavier. I wanted to play in
the postseason and play at a high level. And I love the fact that we're a 1
seed. I'm just looking forward to playing in the tournament.  
  
Q. Sean, you guys were able to watch the game, I assume, last night when
you were out to dinner, the Texas Southern game. What were your thoughts on
that outing and your thoughts heading into tomorrow's game about Mike Davis'
team?  
SEAN O'MARA: I think you saw them do a lot of really exciting things. They put
up a good amount of points. So it's just, like I said earlier, they've got a
lot of high major guys that may not be on what may be considered a high major
team, but they're very talented. We've got to make sure we come out ready to
play.  
  
Q. You talked about being No. 1 seed, it doesn't matter. For any of the
four, how aware are you of the fact that a No. 1 has never lost to a 16 seed
in the tournament yet?  
TREVON BLUIETT: I mean, we're well aware. We've been seeing it all over social
media, there's no losses or whatever. We don't pay too much attention to that.
Like Sean said, they're a very talented team despite their seeding. So we
don't look at them as being a 16 seed, like it's going to be a pushover game.
We know they're going to bring their best game. We've got to bring ours. We're
the 1 seed, so every team will give it their best shot so we've got to be
ready to take their punch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The head coach is here, Chris Mack. We're going to ask him to
make a quick statement on being in Nashville, and then we'll go to questions.
Chris?  
  
CHRIS MACK: We're excited to be here. Obviously, it's what you shoot for, to
get to the NCAA tournament. Hopefully, our team will be ready to go tomorrow.
I think we had a good couple practices leading up.  
  
Face a really good team in Texas Southern, coached by Mike Davis. Got a lot of
respect for their talent level and be a good game.  
  
Q. Chris, if I could ask you about the game itself, they have a 5'7 "
guard that could fit the prototype of guards that have given you guys trouble
over the course of the season. What do you make of his play and what did you
see about him last night?  
CHRIS MACK: What I've known about Demontrae for a long time, he's electric
with the ball. He's tiny but gets where he needs to get. A lot of times, when
guys are smaller in stature, they tend not to shoot the ball as well.  
  
He's not that way. Our guys have a lot of respect for him because they've
known him for a long time. He's been a YouTube sensation ever since he's been
in high school. He's given a lot of freedom, very deservedly so. Pushes the
ball from end to end.  
  
He can finish in the lane, even though he's smaller. He hangs in the air. When
the shot isn't there, he finds teammates. So, again, he's the guy that sort of
stirs their drink and makes things happen for them. And our team's very well
aware of how talented he is and how much of a playmaker he is. We've got to do
a good job on him.  
  
Q. Chris, y'all ate at the Jeff Ruby's restaurant last night. How did
that come to happen?  
CHRIS MACK: "Y'all ate..." wow.  
  
Q. Suddenly southern. How did that come to be? I heard a rumor you were
able to meet Kid Rock. Did that happen?  
CHRIS MACK: Both, yes. When we were assigned Nashville, I got a text from Mr.
Ruby. He said we'd love to host you. Obviously, we leave a couple days before
the game. Last thing you want to do is eat a Ruby's steak the night before. We
did that a couple nights before.  
  
Ironically, he texted me and said my favorite entertainer was going to be
there. I was like a kid in the candy store, waiting for him to come in. I was
pretty composed. I was pretty composed. Didn't stutter my words. You can check
with my daughters. It was pretty cool, meeting Kid Rock. Really cool.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CHRIS MACK: He doesn't follow college basketball. He talks about Detroit being
a really pro town. I just quickly diverted the conversation to, you know,
having seen him in concert seven or eight times. Pretty cool. It's good.  
  
Q. Coach, how much of your improvement on the defensive end of the ball,
with man to man defense this year, how much do you think is personnel and size
and depth, and how much is execution?  
CHRIS MACK: Defense is always personnel driven. Got to have guys that have the
DNA to get it done: length, quickness, strength. And the IQ part might take a
little bit of time, especially for younger players.  
  
But I do think our team has gotten a lot better defensively over the last
three or four weeks of the season. And as I told him, you know, our season
will end if we don't make good decisions with the basketball and we don't
defend at a high level.  
  
And nothing exposes you more than the NCAA tournament with all the talented
teams and talented players, well coached teams you're going to play. Our
defense will be up to its first challenge and hopefully won't be our first and
only challenge tomorrow evening against a team that likes to push the ball and
give their players a lot of freedom.  
  
Q. Coach, if you sort of look at, I guess, the early discussion about
the NCAA tournament and Xavier is commonly considered as the weakest No. 1
seed. I was just wondering if you have talked to your guys about that and, if
so, what those conversations have consisted of.  
CHRIS MACK: If I've talked to our team about being the weakest No. 1 seed?  
  
Q. Just the general perception that you guys are the weakest No. 1
seed.  
CHRIS MACK: I don't worry about general perceptions. I've got other things I
have to worry about, starting with Texas Southern's personnel. Whether they
think we're the strongest 1 seed, the worst 9 seed, the last 16 seed, who
really cares.  
  
You throw all these teams in one tournament and the better team on that
particular night wins. They get to advance and the other one gets to pack up
and worry about the next year. I got a lot of other things to worry about
talking to our team about.  
  
Q. Chris, this Kid Rock thing has shaken my understanding of who you are
as a person.  
CHRIS MACK: Hey, no problem, man. No problem.  
  
Q. What's your favorite song?  
CHRIS MACK: I wear it proudly.  
  
Q. I didn't mean it in a disparaging way. What is your favorite song and
did you do all rap metal? Were you like a Limp Bizkit guy too?  
CHRIS MACK: "Devil Without a Cause" would probably be my favorite song. I can
give you a ton of them. "Flying High" with Zac Brown Band, one of his later
albums. He's really changed his approach to music. He's more rhythm and blues
and country now that he's older.  
  
So am I, so maybe we're on the same sort of wave level. I don't know. People
make fun of me for loving Kid Rock and you know how much I care? Zero.  
  
Q. I do know that you care zero. Seriously, I wasn't insulting you.  
CHRIS MACK: Believe me, I didn't take it as an insult.  
  
Q. Serious question.  
CHRIS MACK: That wasn't serious?  
  
Q. More serious regarding tomorrow's game. They have an interesting
setup at forward/center with Marquis and then the 7'2 " player coming off the
bench. What do you make of that matchup, relative to your personnel group at
that position?  
CHRIS MACK: Our players have a healthy respect for Trayvon Reed. He's 7'2" we
played against him at Auburn, the first game he was eligible as a freshman. We
had "Spalding" tattooed on our head three or four times in that game. He has
NBA length, NBA shot blocking ability. We'll do what we can to draw him away
from the basket.  
  
It's been my belief and the way I was raised in coaching, you have to go at a
shot blocker instead of going away from him. If there's air space, he's going
to win. He likes to block shots off the ball, rather than, you know, on the
offensive player that he's actually guarding.  
  
But he changes the game defensively, and our players are going to have to
recognize, when he's committing to the shot versus, you know, when he's
committing to the player that he has underneath for the dump-off. So he's a
big part of what they do on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. With the perception of you as a No. 1 team, have you addressed with
your team the idea that a 1 has never lost to a 16? Do you address that at all
with your team?  
CHRIS MACK: No. I think our players are very well aware of that and they watch
ESPN and FS1 and they have Twitter accounts. So we recognize that no 16's ever
beaten a 1. That's not really my concern. We don't have to play those other
80-something games that were played in the past. We have to play Texas
Southern tomorrow. We have to be better than them. If we don't win, we don't
win. We're going to give it our best shot and play really hard. Being locked
in and having fun and being a group that is playing to win a national
championship tomorrow night is who we're going to be.  
  
Q. Chris, this is the fourth year for three of our core seniors to come
together. How would you characterize the difference of each trip as you take
this fourth one?  
CHRIS MACK: It's hard to sort of compare and to think back, because you're so
in the moment. I look back on their career with a lot of fondness, because
when they came in as freshmen, we sold them on a dream of playing in the NCAA
tournament every year and based on our history, why wouldn't you think that.  
  
But for those guys to be in their senior year, in their fourth NCAA
tournament, having won a Big East regular season championship, earned the two
highest seeds in the history of our program in NCAA tournament play, along
with all the personal accolades, I feel like I sold them a dream that was not
a dream. It became reality and it was through a lot of hard work that they
gave.  
  
I'm going to miss those guys and hopefully have a lot more games to coach.  
  
Q. Coach, after the Georgetown game in which Naji Marshall scored a
career-high 21 points, he hasn't scored that many points combined in the last
four games. Are you happy with his shot selection? What can he do to be more
of the player he was offensively a few games ago?  
CHRIS MACK: Number one, Naji, his best attribute and his best gift for us as a
freshman is to be a terrific on the ball defender. We give him a lot of
different challenges from point guards to power forwards.  
  
I don't necessarily worry about his shot selection. I want his confidence to
be at an all time high. He doesn't take bad shots. Early in the season, his
biggest downfall was turnovers. And I think he's done a pretty good job for
the most part of trying to keep those down.  
  
But, you know, offense will come and go at times. It's the effort that you
have to give on the defensive end that he can really help this team. I think
he recognizes that.  
  
There's nobody on his team that's lost confidence in Naji. Things just sort of
worked out right against Georgetown, and we have other guys that can score the
ball when maybe it's not going in for him as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck, Chris.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Ron Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28684)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
RON HUNTER: We're glad to be back in the NCAA tournament. I know our guys are
really excited. I just was asked a question a few minutes ago that I'm
embarrassed I couldn't answer. I'm going to ask my players in five minutes.
They told me if I could name three country singers, and I couldn't name one.  
  
So I'm going to ask my guys, if they want to play, they've got to give me
three country singers that since we're in Nashville, we're going to have
dinner downtown and they've got to give me the right answer or give me three.
At least give me one. I didn't even have one.  
  
We love Nashville. It's really nice. I was here my first NCAA tournament when
I brought IUPUI in here and we lost to Kentucky. And so it was terrific then.
Hopefully, we'll have a different outcome. We're excited to be here.  
  
Q. I saw a tweet from y'all's basketball program that the stool was
coming along to Nashville with you from a few years ago. Is it just a good
luck charm? Will it be in the locker room? What are y'all planning to do with
it?  
RON HUNTER: That's a surprise. No, it's more of a good luck thing that we
wanted to bring. I didn't want to bring it but everybody else wanted to bring
it. It was good luck for everyone but me. I had a torn Achilles. I was the one
in pain with all that. But we actually kept it in a private place at school
and we decided let's just bring it to Nashville like we did Jacksonville and,
hopefully, we'll get the same success.  
  
Q. Earlier this week, you made a comment about Hyatts and Comfort Inns,
et cetera. Were you being literal with that comment? What message were you
trying to get across?  
RON HUNTER: Honestly, no, I was not being literal. We're not staying in a
Comfort Inn, but, again, I think that sometimes what happens is that you get
to the tournament and coaches get so intense about it.  
  
We're here to have fun. This is a great time of year. Now, I do believe that
they're staying in a better hotel so I wanted to let our guys know that
they're eating better.  
  
I used the Wendy's reference because when we were driving back after Sunday,
when we found out who we were playing, we stopped at Wendy's and had a meal.
While we were at Wendy's, I said, Trust me, Cincinnati is not eating at
Wendy's. They're at Ruth's Chris. For you to eat at Ruth's Chris, we've got to
beat a team like that. That's where the reference came from.  
  
Everybody knows I got a great deal of respect for Cincinnati and what they've
been doing. Mick and I have been friends for a long time. I haven't spoken to
Mick for a while because Mick wanted to recruit my son. My son wanted to go to
Cincinnati. So I had to hate Mick in my household until R.J. actually
committed to me. He actually liked Mick for some reason. He came home one day
and said he was going to play at Cincinnati, and that changed my entire life.  
  
Q. Ron, the best coaches at this time of year are mentioned for other
jobs every year. You've been mentioned for other jobs, the list of candidates,
the last probably three years. Have you changed your strategy of how you
handle that? Because you get the question every year. How do you handle that
when you're asked about other jobs?  
RON HUNTER: Here's what I think about other jobs. Before we left to go to the
conference tournament, my wife said, Hey, when you get back, I got a job for
you. I need you to paint the basement. I wanted to win so bad so I haven't had
to paint the basement. So what I do is I avoid those type of things. I avoid
it with my wife.  
  
What I did is while we came back from the conference tournament with the
championship, I called a friend to see if he would paint my basement. So
that's what I do with jobs. I try to avoid these type of deals.  
  
Listen, I love where I'm at, man. At my age, I've said it before, I'll keep
saying it again. I'm more about being happy. The other stuff, when I was 27,
30, 35, it was great to see, boy, I want to coach X and do this. You know what
I want to do now? I want to be happy. More importantly, you know what I want
to do? I want to win. I love winning. You can have all the money in the world.
Winning, I love winning. I'm at a great place. I'm at a great institution. I
work for great people.  
  
My mother would always say, Don't mess with happiness. You start messing with
happiness, I don't care how much money you make, you start messing with
happiness.  
  
I learned that through Homer Drew. You look at great mid-major coaches who
stayed at places and enjoyed their stay. That's where I'm at. I'm at a great
place. For me up to just leave that, it would have to be something like
really, really special.  
  
Or my wife actually makes me paint, I may have to do something.  
  
Q. Hey, Ron, not many 15 seeds can say, hey, we got a great draw in the
tournament. I'm sure you're not going to say that now. Looking at Cincinnati,
do you think, you know, this is one of those teams we might have a shot
against?  
RON HUNTER: Mark, you know I'm going to say this. I don't care who we play, I
believe we have a shot. I don't believe in seedings. That's coach speak.
People say we don't like our seeding. We're happy to be here. As I said
before, the NCAA tournament is getting to the point where there won't be any
mid-majors. We're just happy to be here. Cincinnati is a great team. For me, I
didn't know -- when we played Baylor, I wasn't worried about the seeding or
who we played.  
  
My kids play with a chip on their shoulder. I coach that way. I feel like
every time I coach, I've got something to prove. Again, as much as I respect
and I love Mick, I feel like I got something to prove because he's coaching at
Cincinnati.  
  
If it was Mike Krczyckewskiski at Duke, I would feel the same way. I make sure
our kids understand that and that's part of the comment about the hotel. When
you're a mid-major, we don't get some of those things. Those kids weren't
recruited by Mick. They weren't recruited by the ACC.  
  
This is a stage you can prove that. This is a stage for Coach Hunter to prove
that he can coach against the best coaches. I told them this morning, if
you're really good I'll see how good you are Friday at 2:00. I said it
differently to R.J. I said, I don't think you can play with these guys. I
think this is a tough level for you. He got so mad at me, he won a game and
said, Dad, I'm going pro, now what? That kind of backfired a little bit on me.  
  
The seeding, we never talk about it. I could care less about the seeding. All
we want to do is play. Man, I can't wait. Even the guys, they walked in, they
had the stuff in the locker room. They were like kids in a candy store. They
were excited. They're glad to be here. That's how I want the kids to play.  
  
We don't lock 'em up in the rooms. We're going to enjoy this. We're going to
find out who country music stars are. We're going to enjoy Nashville. When I
was in the NCAA tournament, we won three times. I don't remember it. Our
coaches locked us in. I couldn't tell the guys what it was like as a player,
because I stayed in the hotel, played the game. That's all I did.  
  
I want my players, when they're my age, they're saying when we were in
Jacksonville, in Nashville, we did this. We're going to be loose, we're going
to be fun. I still don't know any country artists in the world. He gave me
one, the Garth Brooks guy, right? I do know one, Garth Brooks. My first answer
was Luther Vandross. I thought he was country. I was wrong. I want my guys to
have fun. We're going to enjoy.  
  
More importantly, at 2:00, you're going to see a group that's going to play
hard and is going to believe they can win the game.  
  
Q. You have a personality and a perspective unlike any other coach in
college basketball. Give us a little insight of where that comes from.  
RON HUNTER: I'll be honest with you, I don't know. It's just who I am. One of
the things -- when I wake up and enjoy life, it's about the whole job thing.
When I wake up, I don't have a lot of bad days. I don't like losing. I'll be
honest with you at that.  
  
Again, my mom has always raised me that the blessings that you get, enjoy
them. I didn't have to wake up this morning. I didn't have to be in the NCAA
tournament. But not so much for me; I don't make this about me. I want the
people around me to feel the same way. I want my players to feel like that.  
  
So, again, I enjoy it, man. I think this is great. I think that college
basketball has taken a big hit this year in our image in that regard. What
frustrates me about that is we spend a lot of time talking about what happens
in the top five percent. NCAA basketball in Division I is about us, the mid-
majors. There are more mid-majors than high majors. We always talk about the
one and done. We get so much media attention about one and dones, and that's
about 30 kids a year. What about the other 5,000 kids that play, that really
enjoy it?  
  
I was one of those 5,000 that played. I played with a guy named Ron Harper. He
was a great player. Played professional. The rest of us did okay. Ron made a
lot of money and didn't give me one dime, but that's okay.  
  
Still, it's about just enjoying this. That's what I want to make sure it's not
just about me. I want to make sure our kids enjoy it. That the people at
Georgia State, we all enjoy this. It's not just about the coach or one player,
but it's about all of us.  
  
Q. One of the hallmarks of UC is its defense. They come in with high
rankings, blocks, perimeter defense. How do you prepare your team to face a
team with such strong defense?  
RON HUNTER: I'm going to tell you what I told my guys last night. Cincinnati
is good. We don't have a chance. They're good. They're defense. Look at their
numbers. You only shoot 27 percent from the 3-point line. They're physical,
they're well coached. They have no flaws. Honestly, they don't. They're a good
basketball team. If they beat us, they're a team that can advance.  
  
At the end of the day, I don't want to tell my guys how good somebody else is.
We talk about us. We do very little worrying about the other team. If we do
what we're capable of doing and we do it at a high rate and you beat us, so be
it. The thing is we're going to be prepared. I don't spend a lot of time
talking about the other team. I could care less about the other team, to be
honest with you. I respect them, I respect the university, I respect their
coaches.  
  
At the end of the day, I'm more concerned what D'Marcus does, I'm more
concerned that Devin makes shots, that Jeff Thomas make shots. If those guys
make shots and we have a good defense too. If you look at what we're doing, I
know it's unconventional, we got good defense too. They're the second ranked
defense in the country. Let's see how good our defense is.  
  
That's what we're talking about. I don't spend a lot of time worrying about
what other people do. My job is to make sure we're doing what we're supposed
to do and be as best as we can on that particular day.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you made it, but how concerned are you with the number
of mid-major schools making the tournament of late?  
RON HUNTER: Very concerned. I really am. I think the funny thing about the
NCAA tournament, what's made it are the upsets, VCU getting to the Final Four.
What Butler has done.  
  
We kind of forget about that type of thing. I think it's terrible. I think at
the end of the day, when you look at the number at larges that have been given
to mid-majors, there's one thing that -- I'm not an analytical guy. I know
they use analytics and they use the RPI.  
  
One thing we've taken out of the room is common sense. Common sense has been
taken out. Middle Tennessee should have been in this tournament, period. I
think that's the problem. This is a power five tournament. We understand that.
I prepare -- the way I coach now, I coach completely different than I did ten
years ago.  
  
I coach my guys to get ready for three days in March. And it's too bad because
when I was a player, conference championships were something that was really
important. I'll be honest, mid-majors, no, it's not. What's really important
is getting the kids to the NCAA tournament.  
  
We don't even talk about for the most part winning a conference championship.
What you want to win is those three days in March because, again, I've been
17-1 in the conference before and we had three bad minutes all year, and we
couldn't get to the NCAA tournament.  
  
There are power fives that can go 8-10 in their league and still get in. I
think it's completely unfair. It's not apples and apples and oranges, the RPI
and what's fair. For example, how is it fair if Middle Tennessee can't take a
private plane home, and they've got to stay all night because they got to get
back to another game, where that school in the ACC, they can get back home the
next day and get on a plane so now they're well rested.  
  
Things like that, we don't think about and don't talk about. That's a huge
advantage for a power five team that mid-majors can't do. We get in a room and
we're judged by it, just like when it talks about scheduling. At the end of
the day, nobody is calling Georgia State and Middle Tennessee to play at our
places.  
  
I just think that the system is wrong. I've said it before. I'm on a number of
committees, the ADs and presidents have heard me say it. It's wrong. Again,
that's the life we live in. That's what every mid-major coach has to
understand.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on your roster comprised mostly of kids that are
from the Atlanta area and this being the only team from Georgia making it to
the NCAA tournament this year. Talk about the talent pool that is in the state
of Georgia and how you do so well in getting those kids to believe in what you
do downtown Atlanta.  
RON HUNTER: That's one of the things I love. I love the fact that we're in the
tournament. I also love the fact that our kids are from Atlanta and from
Georgia.  
  
When I first took the job, it was interesting that people said that we
couldn't recruit -- Georgia kids or Atlanta kids wouldn't come to Georgia
State. Now, 11 of our 13 guys are from the state of Georgia or Atlanta.  
  
So I think when you're in an urban institution and do not recruit local kids,
it makes no sense. Absolutely no sense at all. We did the same thing in IUPUI.
When I was at Wisconsin-Milwaukee, we did the same thing. If you're in an you
are an institution and can't recruit the kids in that city, that's a problem.  
  
It makes it fun that our guys all played against each other in high school. It
makes it fun for the fans, for the media because they're kids that they know
and I think that's really important.  
  
Now, can I ask you guys a question? Can you get me two more country stars that
I can talk to my guys about? I'm embarrassed to tell my players I only know --
it's Garth Brooks, right? Garth Brooks is one. If somebody can send me two
names, I could appreciate it. You got one? Who?  
  
Q. Keith Urban.  
RON HUNTER: Keith Urban. I got two of them.  
  
Q. Tim McGraw.  
RON HUNTER: I thought he was a pitcher.  
  
THE MODERATOR: His dad was a pitcher.  
  
RON HUNTER: I knew McGraw pitched somewhere. That's three. I'm going to talk
to my guys. I guarantee they won't know those two names. If it's not Tupac,
guarantee my guys don't know.  
  
Carrie Underwood, I thought she was American Idol? I knew that. Appreciate it.
God bless everyone. Enjoy the tournament.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The head coach of the Seminoles is Leonard Hamilton. He's going
to open up with a statement about being here in Nashville. Then we'll go to
questions. Coach?  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: This has been a very interesting year for our basketball
team. Started with, after last year when we lost five players, two seniors and
three kids that are now playing in the NBA and a couple kids playing overseas,
we knew that the upcoming year would be tremendously challenging for us to
continue to keep building on the culture that we were trying to establish over
the last number of years.  
  
And so our players have a clear understanding of what our challenge would be
because the expectations had been raised. We had a bunch of guys who had been
support players who now were going to be instrumental in leading the team. And
so we realized that it was going to be tremendously challenging.  
  
I'm very proud of these guys because I think that what we've done is we've
been a little inconsistent, but I think we've played some very good basketball
at times, and hopefully we have grown some wisdom from the challenges that
this season has given us. Hopefully, this will give us an opportunity to show
the growth and maturity that we've gained and made throughout the course of
the year.  
  
So this, the NCAA, now gives us an opportunity to -- kind of like a new season
that hopefully we'll be able to show that we've grown a little in where we are
and hopefully where we're trying to grow as a team.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the challenges in scouting and preparing for a team
that now added a player who's only played 25 minutes this season for you to
have on film?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I've been asked that question several times about Michael
Porter. I don't understand why people are asking me why that's going to be
difficult, because we've watched him play for a number of years, and he's a
tremendously talented youngster. In fact, he's one of the top four, five
basketball players in college basketball.  
  
So as young people say, we don't have it twisted. We know exactly what we're
facing. We're facing a youngster that is tremendously talented, that's
healthy.  
  
And when we watch the film of the game that he did play in, I was just amazed
at the level of confidence that he played with. He shot the ball from 3-point
line with tremendous amount of confidence. He shot a turnaround jump shot like
he's been doing it all year long. He took the ball the length of the court. He
moved the ball and made the extra pass. He played almost like a veteran, a guy
who his maturity level is beyond his years.  
  
So we have a tremendous amount of respect for their team because I think
they've had a very good year. They've had some challenges that they've had to
overcome. Sometimes when you go through a season as a first year coach and you
overcome the challenges that they've had, you gain a lot of wisdom through
that.  
  
So now, you're adding your very best player coming into the season that gives
you an added boost or added level of confidence. So we're tremendously
impressed with them. We know we have a tremendous challenge. In order for us
to be successful, we're going to have to be at our best.  
  
They kind of represent some of the teams that we play in the ACC night in and
night out that have great players like Porter, both of the Porters. I'm
equally as impressed with the younger brother, because the 6'11" guy that
dribbles and passes and shoots the ball as well as he does is extremely
impressive. A guy who is very adapted going inside, who has shot close to 100
threes during the course of the year, a team that 44 percent of their attempts
are 3-pointers, and then they have a great inside attack.  
  
So I can't only give a lot of -- overly concerned about the Porters, because
they have a lot of other guys who are really, really talented as well. It's
motivating our players hopefully to be at their very best like we have to do
in the ACC night in and night out.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke about the film you've seen of Michael Porter
throughout high school. For your players, Jonathan Isaac, playing with him and
against him in practice, does it give you a similar -- your players a similar
skill set to have Jonathan last season and going up against preparing for
Porter?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: It's very difficult to try to compare players like that.
He's just a tremendous talent. He's long, he's athletic. He has great
basketball awareness. He has a high basketball IQ. He's come from a basketball
family. He has tremendous skill, and he's well coached. More than anything
else, he's extremely hungry to go out and show the world that he is who
they've all -- what they expect him to be.  
  
The interesting thing, you can't -- Missouri is not the kind of team that you
can give all your attention to only one or two players. They're well coached.
They execute their offense very well. Defensively, they're very sound
fundamentally. They're extremely physical. They play awful hard and they're
very well coached.  
  
I've known Coach Martin for a long time. He's been successful everywhere he's
been. We know his team is going to be well prepared and we need to be at our
best in order to be successful.  
  
Q. Cuonzo talked about you being one of the guys that really kind of
helped him when he was early on in this profession. What do you remember about
maybe reaching out to him or getting to know him?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think that says it, that I've been around a long time,
when you look around sometimes. But I've always tried to make myself be
available for anything I can do to help younger coaches, because I had some
great mentors myself. And I always had guys that helped guide me through those
moments, where I had some indecision about some of the decisions that I had to
make.  
  
I've always had a healthy respect for Cuonzo. And, like I said earlier, I've
always tried to be touchable, a guy that people who feel that they have
certain issues or concerns, that they're comfortable talking with me. And
we've had a lot of, I guess you'd call, fireside chats that we've -- off the
record conversations that we've had to have about the challenges of our
business.  
  
But I have a tremendous amount of respect for Cuonzo, because we all know that
he's a tremendous coach from an X and O standpoint. Any time you see a young
guy who has a tremendous passion and love and respect for the game as he does,
and he displays that between how he communicates with his players, how he
holds them accountable, how they respect him and the role model he's set for
them, I admire that.  
  
You know that not only will his teams be well prepared, but he's preparing
young people for life after basketball, as well as preparing them for the
game.  
  
Any time a guy of that caliber reaches out, I feel honored that he would even
reach out and want to talk to me because I admire and respect what he's done,
and what he's done in his coaching career. If I can be of any assistance to a
guy like him, and he and I developed a pretty good relationship. There have
been times I've gotten phone calls early in the morning, late at night and
we've had to have what we call the brother-in-law conversations, what we call
graveyard conversations that we talk about it and leave it there.  
  
That's the nature of any business. I think that sometimes, it's good to have
somebody who have, like myself, who has made a lot of mistakes. You know, I've
learned not because I've been smarter than anyone else. Because I've made
enough mistakes, and sometimes mistakes will teach you how not to make the
same mistake again. Sometimes I'm just available so he won't bump his head
against the wall like bumps I had. I keep from bumping his head as much as I
can.  
  
Q. Coach, with C.J. and Trent, you have two really unselfish guys
leading your offense, leading your team. What have they done to take on
leadership roles and how have they progressed the culture change you're trying
to instill here?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, you're talking about two sophomores who play well,
they lead our team as point guards and they play off each other very well when
we play them together.  
  
C.J.'s more of a scoring point guard. Trent Forrest has been more of a pass-
first type of guy, a guy who gives us tremendous defensive leadership.  
  
The thing that's impressive about Trent is he had an injury earlier in the
year, a bone bruise that kept him out of action, out of practice for almost
seven weeks. And even when he came back, and he was cleared to practice and
play, but psychologically, he was a little uncertain, uneasy about stopping
and starting and changing direction and exploding and landing, those things
that go along with sometimes recovering from an injury.  
  
So it took him a while, almost a month to get back to playing with a level of
confidence. Early on in preseason, Trent could probably have been our best
player. He was displaying so many things that you're just now starting to see
him get back and display who he is and what he's about as a team.  
  
Both of those guys have been, for sophomores, they've been great for our
program and we feel confident about the future of our program if it's in those
guys' hands.  
  
Q. I know you said that it's hard to compare players, so I don't know if
there's a specific guy. But with Jontay Porter, a guy who is his size and
plays as much on the perimeter as he does, how rare is that or is it becoming
more common?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: To be honest with you, I do think that's the way basketball
is moving, guys who are position-less type of players. And he displays that
way. I mean, he'll get a rebound.  
  
It was one play in one game, I think it might have been in the Georgia game,
where I think Michael got the rebound, and he threw an outlet pass to the
6'11" brother running down the right side.  
  
The interesting thing is Michael was sprinting down the court and he kicked
the ball up to his 6'11" brother filling the lane. He caught it with one hand
and flipped it over to his other 6'10" brother going down the middle of the
court. I said, Wow, that was impressive. One 6'10" guy throwing an outlet pass
to his 6'11" brother, and he catches it with one hand and touch passes it to
his brother running down the middle of the court. I had to replay that to make
sure what I was seeing.  
  
It says a lot about where the game's going, his parents, how skilled they are,
the feel that they have for the game. That just says an awful lot, that they
are special and unique players, and they definitely have our full attention.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Thank you so much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jacob Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30829)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The University of Cincinnati Bearcats are the No. 2 seed in the
South Region. They're the American Athletic Conference regular season and
tournament champions. They'll play No. 15 seeded Georgia State. Friday's first
game at 1:00. The contact is Andre Foushee.  
  
Questions for the three gentlemen from Cincinnati.  
  
Q. Gary, you guys are ranked ninth in the country in blocks. How
critical do you think that is to your defense and is it something that's just
innate in you guys, or is it something that you really try to focus on?  
GARY CLARK: I think we really focus on it. Our big guys definitely take pride
in blocking shots. Kyle is always yelling at the guards not to foul low
because it takes away a block. Some of them are easier blocks that we probably
could get if they don't foul. It's one of those things if our guards get beat,
we've got to be help and ready to rotate and block shots.  
  
Q. For Kyle and Gary, Mick mentioned yesterday that you guys thought
about the loss to UCLA last year all summer and all season long. Was he
overstating the case? How much have you thought about that? How much of a
motivation is that now?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: That's definitely a correct assessment. We were very
disappointed about that, but I think with our loss and the defeat that we felt
over the summer, I think it taught us how to win. I thought it taught us how
to prevail. It brought us together. It made us a more cohesive unit. I'm
excited for this year and we're just going to keep on playing together.  
  
GARY CLARK: I agree. Definitely, it takes a while to get rid of that one. To
play so well, the first half and then to run out of gas the second half, I
think like Kyle said, it really taught us how to win as a unit.  
  
A lot of guys that was on that team are still here, so it always plays in the
back of our heads. As we get ready for the tournament to start again, we're
just going to keep pushing.  
  
Q. Jacob, couple years ago, you had a coming out party versus St. Joe's.
What do you look forward to coming to this tournament? For the other two, Kyle
and Gary, this is your last time around. What also do you look forward to in
this last tournament that we're going to be in?  
JACOB EVANS: I just look forward to coming out here, playing with these two,
their last go-round. I want to make it special for them. I know how much it
means to them if we have a nice run in this tournament.  
  
Also, I want to send them out the right way, especially Gary, he's been here
for four years, has had an awesome career. Kyle has changed the vibe around
our program and has us in a positive mood all the time.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Just to have fun, but to win at the same time, I think those
two ideas need to go hand in hand. It's a huge stage, and you want to execute
and make sure you move on to the next round. You should have fun with it too.  
  
Like I said before, who gets a chance to do this every day? We're extremely
blessed. Going off of what Jacob said also, we want to go out the right way.
We put a lot into it and all three of us have put a lot into it. All the guys
in the locker room have put a lot into it. That's what we want to do.  
  
GARY CLARK: Going off what both of them said, you want to go out the right
way. Definitely, each year was a different letdown as far as, you know,
freshman year, how we went down. Just so on each year.  
  
To have this kind of unit going into it this year, really confident, excited.
You've got to have fun with it for sure, and we're definitely blessed to have
this opportunity. Me, for myself, being able to make it every year, I still
see friends at other institutions that have never gone. They've just been able
to fill out a bracket.  
  
To be a part of it, guys texting you and family members texting you, telling
you they're rooting for you, you've got to feel good to be able to get to this
every year. For us, we want to not just get here, but go further.  
  
Q. Gary and Kyle, just a follow-up what you said before about learning
how to win from the UCLA loss, what kind of things did you learn about
winning? What's different? Can you be more specific about what you learned?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I think that UCLA loss taught us something different about
winning. I think a lot of the disappointment that we saw last year -- I mean,
we went 30-6, so people might ask what disappointment.  
  
We wanted to check off some benchmarks that we did do this year in terms of
winning the conference outright during the regular season but then winning the
conference tournament. I thought the loss to SMU in the championship of the
conference tournament taught us something. And then not getting the outright
conference title during the regular season taught us something.  
  
Every different type of failure, this translates to different messages in life
too. When you fail in something in life, you learn from that or it's going to
happen again.  
  
I think not just one thing in the UCLA game, but across that whole year last
year, we learned how to become -- how to win.  
  
GARY CLARK: I agree. You think back to our losses last year, a lot of them
were down to the last play or malfunction somewhere and this year we've been
able to execute down the stretch, not to give up easy buckets and foul or
turnovers.  
  
This year, we've been able to stay on the throttle on teams at times when we
really are pouring it on. I think what Kyle said, every loss last year, we
looked at ourselves and watched film and realized things we have to do to
change to win, come out victorious instead of losing.  
  
Q. The AAC conference tournament and the NCAA tournament, does that put
you on two different sets of routines you'd have to have on a normal basis?
That's the first question.  
Second is probably for you, Jacob. How do you block out social media during
this time, or do you read it and sort of go through it, but when everybody's
asking you to do or score a certain amount of points in order to be
successful, how do you answer that or how do you deal with it?  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: What's your first question again, Terry?  
  
Q. About routines. Do you have to continue the same routines in the
conference tournament?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I don't think you should change up your routine. From
personal experience, this is my fourth tournament. I don't think you should
change up routines. I think that will kind of psych your mind out.  
  
I'm going to go off of the message that I sent earlier about having fun. You
have to have fun with this game, else you're going to get burnt out and you're
going to think of other negative, you know, thoughts.  
  
And that's not what you should do. You should go into the game saying, this is
a better -- this is a bigger game on a bigger stage, but it's basketball at
the end of the day. So I think that's what you should go -- your mindset going
into it.  
  
JACOB EVANS: To answer your question, social media, I'm a young kid so of
course I read it. But I don't let it get to me, like whatever they say. I'm
having a bad game, I try to stay confident in myself. I know my teammates have
my back so I never try to get down on myself no matter what they're saying on
social media.  
  
I know what it takes to win. This is my third year here and I've won a pretty
good number of games here so I think I know what I'm supposed to do on the
court.  
  
Q. Jacob, you and the team as a whole, the last few games, obviously
you're winning, but the offense hasn't been quite in sync. The shooting
percentages are down. You, yourself, not scoring like usual. How do you guys
get that back? Is there anything you specifically or the team have been
working on? How important is that to get that back?  
JACOB EVANS: We're back to the basics, taking our time, shot preps. Just
making sure we're reading the defense the right way. Trying to stay away from
hard, contested shots and just moving the ball. We have enough talent on this
team to when we share the ball, then we can score.  
  
I feel like we've gotten back to that these last couple of days in practice
and we're just going forward. Also remain confident in ourselves.  
  
Q. Gary, so earlier this week, Coach Ron Hunter of Georgia State said
they're eating at Ruth's Chris, we're eating at Wendy's. They're staying at
Hyatt, we're staying at Comfort Inn. Is it strange to see how the perception
around this program has changed over the last four years?  
GARY CLARK: Since I've been here, we've always been blue collar. I've never
had Ruth's Chris. So I'm not sure where that came from. But, you know, we're
the Bearcats. All year, every year I've been here, we've always been the other
end of that perception.  
  
So it's different for me to hear it, but kind of as a unit, we just, we don't
pay attention to that kind of stuff. We focus on our tasks every game and go
out and just dominate, suffocate teams and just try to come out victorious.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Mike Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14123)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The head coach of Texas Southern is with us, Mike Davis. He'll
open up with a statement about last night's victory, the happy flight here to
Nashville, and then we'll go to questions. Mike?  
  
MIKE DAVIS: We're excited to be here. Happy to win the game last night. We
thought we played a really good basketball game. We didn't shoot the ball
well, but we played good enough to win the game, and my boys are really
excited to be here.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, the schedule y'all had, the non-conference, was
that something you had to do because of budget reasons? Why did you line up
the schedule the way you did? How do you think it's kind of prepared you for
what you're dealing with now?  
MIKE DAVIS: We have a deal with our athletic department that if we go out and
raise $350,000 and give it to the school, everything above 350, we keep for
our basketball program.  
  
So I wanted to give my guys a great experience traveling. We go to nice
hotels. They eat in the hotels. We eat and travel like a power five, other
than the charter.  
  
As far as the schedule, all the road games we play, we haven't played a home
game in three years. I like to play on the road. I want to have a schedule
designed to get us better because only one team is going to the NCAA
tournament, and that's the team that wins the tournament.  
  
We just feel like the only way we can get better is to play a really tough
schedule. We don't want to play Division II schools, NAIA schools. I want to
challenge the best schools out there. Once we get into tournament play, we've
seen it all.  
  
Q. Mike, you said last night that you wanted to take a look at film last
night. What have you picked up on Xavier from the film?  
MIKE DAVIS: Like I said last night, they're the No. 1 seed. They earned that
No. 1 seed. They don't give that away. They want to shoot the basketball. They
have good speed. All of them are the same as far as rebounding the basketball.
They all go to the glass, both offense and defense board. It's going to be a
very, very big challenge for us.  
  
Q. Mike, what's the last 18 hours been like? Just some of the guys said
it was hard to sleep last night. They were still kind of amped up.  
MIKE DAVIS: They never sleep. They never sleep.  
  
Q. Has the travel and the quick turnaround and all that been a challenge
to them and you?  
MIKE DAVIS: It was great. It was my third time going to the first four. They
tell you the winning team leaves after the game. We never won, so I've always
wondered how it felt to be able to go play a game, go back to the hotel, eat
and jump on the plane.  
  
It was just like I thought it would be. It was great. The flight was 45
minutes. Everybody was excited. I think I had 150 texts on my phone and all
those guys on their phone the whole time.  
  
But it's another opportunity for us to play against a great opponent like we
did in non-conference, and getting in last night about 1:30, took the guys to
Steak 'n Shake to eat. They got a good meal. It was really exciting for the
boys.  
  
Q. Coming off the high from last night, getting that victory, what do
you think the team's mindset is going into tomorrow's game?  
MIKE DAVIS: I can never tell you what their mindset is. I can tell you what I
tell them to think. I don't know if they think that or not. We have some tough
guys on our team. We have guys -- see, this is the beauty in how I schedule.  
  
In the summertime, in June and July, they know we're playing Kansas and
Syracuse and Ohio State and so in the summertime, they think they can beat
'em. They think they can win.  
  
So August, September, October, November, it's hard to convince them that we're
not a very good basketball team. Once they go and play those guys, they
realize that it only takes four, five minutes in a span of those games and you
can be up two and now you're down 15.  
  
So around December, January, I can really coach them because we are 1-12 or
0-13 and maybe 4-9. So now, I can coach them and prepare them for a conference
season.  
  
Q. Mike, now that you've had a chance to see Xavier on tape, you'll
notice, obviously, they have kind of a three-headed monster at forward,
center. How do you think Trayvon will fare in that matchup? Is there one of
those players you might like to see him go against predominantly?  
MIKE DAVIS: Well, they both are good. All those guys are good. Trayvon is
7'2". What we've talked about with Trayvon the whole season, stay out of foul
trouble, go straight up, contest every shot. Don't swing. Go straight up.  
  
We have a drill we do with him all the time in practice. Over the last three
games, he's figured it out a little bit. He just goes straight up. And 7'2" is
7'2" and that's why we think that we'll have a chance against anyone if he's
dominating the paint and blocking shots, contesting shots. Because there's
always a fear factor with a 7'2" player. If he can block three or four -- like
last night, I think he came in last night, he blocked some shots. They started
shooting outside shots a lot and they really struggled from the outside.  
  
Trayvon is a weapon that we have that hopefully, tomorrow night, they need to
stay out of foul trouble and play with the presence that we want him to have.  
  
Q. You've coached at every level. I'm wondering how your experience at
your previous schools, how has that kind of helped prepare you for the
challenges you face here?  
MIKE DAVIS: Well, I know the mindset at every level, and here is -- we get
players here that wouldn't normally come and play in the SWAC, in our
basketball team. My job here is to train their brains, teach them about the
high level and it's hard to really teach them until they see it.  
  
Once they see it, they begin to understand it. But then we'll go through 18
games of conference play where we hadn't seen it in a long time. And it's
really difficult sometimes to get used to going against something that you had
seen for 18 games.  
  
I thought last night's game, playing in the first four, gave us an opportunity
to get a win. Last year, we played North Carolina. In the Selection Sunday,
when you see your name come across the screen, everybody is like excited and
jumping up and down.  
  
We played North Carolina last year. They were jumping up and down and happy.
I'm like, we have no chance. These guys led the country in offensive rebounds.
We gave up 31 offensive rebounds in our conference. So we have no chance to
beat them.  
  
By playing the first four, it give us a game. And so once it give us the game,
you get a little nervous, you look jittery. So now we can kind of flash back
to our non-conference schedule and get that feeling. And now they know why we
play the non-conference schedule.  
  
I always talk about March 7. March 7 is the most important date on your
schedule. It's not Kansas. It's not Grambling. It's not Southern. It's March
7. So March 7 is when our conference tournament starts and we want to be the
best basketball team we can be on March 7. Because only one team going. We
have to win three games, and we won those three games. Now, last night, we won
last night and now get another chance to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, how has Trae Jefferson been as a player and also as a teammate
since he's been back the second go-round?  
MIKE DAVIS: I said this last night about Trae. I think I suspended Trae three
times, I think, this year. He has made the greatest -- his transformation has
been amazing. And I had to do it. It cost us the conference championship
regular season. But his talent is top in the country. And he's a tough, tough
guy. But I had to get him to understand that his behavior has to fit the
setting that he's in.  
  
In college basketball, you want to behave like the rest of the guys in college
basketball is behaving. And he has been remarkable. Now, I think he has a
chance to be an NBA basketball player, because he's made that change.
Sometimes it takes three, four, five years for guys to make that change. He's
made that change over the last two months because -- when I suspended him the
second time, I think he was fourth in the country in scoring at 23 points a
game.  
  
So he gave that up. He gave the Player of the Year up in our league. He gave
All Conference, because you have to play 75 percent of the games for you to
receive that kind of award and be ranked in scoring. And so his maturity right
now is remarkable.  
  
He's a tough guy. All our guys follow him. I mean, he's 5'7". He'll say he's
150, but I think he's about 125. But he think he weighs like 500 pounds. His
attitude and personality right now is where it should have been four years
ago, three years ago.  
  
But like my sister coaches always say, if he'd have been that person he is
now, he never would have played at Texas Southern.  
  
Q. Mike, you mentioned he has a chance at the NBA and you mentioned his
improved attitude. What about his play that you think can get him over the
top?  
MIKE DAVIS: He just thinks he's the best that's ever played the game. We go
into a game, and the worst that you can do is start talking about another
player. Trae acts like he doesn't know who he is. I asked him did he know
LeBron James.  
  
He says, I don't know LeBron James.  
  
He has the personality and attitude that no one fazes him. Don't talk about
anyone in front of him because he just feels like he's the best.  
  
And he's won every matchup that he played this year. We didn't win the game,
but he won the matchup. He says. And so I have to agree with him, because he's
on my team. And you have to know Trae. If you don't agree with what he's
saying and what he's doing, he kind of wavers a little bit. He wanted to win.  
  
Last night and the last eight games, he's changed. He's a changed person. All
the things people said about him, coming here, was true. But he's changed
that. He's changed that, and I couldn't be as proud of a player than I am of
him just because of the way he's changed his personality.  
  
He's still fiery. He's still going to talk on the court, but he's a leader now
and he needs to be that leader to lead our program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mike, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach of the Bearcats is Mick Cronin. We're going to ask
him to open up with a statement about being in Nashville and then we will take
questions. Mick, please.  
  
MICK CRONIN: It's good to be in Nashville. Just got to be Brad, the former SID
at Austin Peay. Talking about some old Racer-Austin Peay battles.  
  
But our team's excited to be here. Obviously, our focus is on Georgia State
and hopefully we've got our batteries recharged from an emotional last couple
of weeks that our team's had. And got our mind on the NCAA tournament.  
  
So probably good for us to get back out of town as fast as we could, with
everybody so excited, telling our guys, Good job, good job. "Good job" is not
always the best thing to hear when you're trying to keep your team sharp. So
we've got to get back out here and start over. We're ready to get going.  
  
Any questions?  
  
Q. Mick, Ron Hunter talked a little bit about his relationship with you,
and you mentioned it before with the R.J. tie-in. When was the last time you
really had a chance to talk to him? What is your relationship like with Ron?  
MICK CRONIN: We're getting older, both of us. I'm not sure how long it's been,
when we met. But back being close, you know, Cincinnati and IUPUI running into
each other. Obviously, I'm younger. I'm aware he played at Miami of Ohio, but
I don't really remember watching him. Of course, games weren't on TV that much
back then.  
  
Probably more so when I was up there recruiting in Indianapolis, I saw him a
lot. When you was at Pike High School games. It became a running joke to stay
away from R.J.  
  
But it was neat, because what's funny is I was the one guy that I saw in R.J.,
he had a chance to be a great player. You had to ignore that he wasn't the
biggest kid in the gym. But like I told Ron, I'm partial to kids that our dads
are coaches because I was one of them. I just wasn't near as good as R.J.  
  
So anyway, you know, it's been on from there. Ron, we share the same agent, so
we've talked quite a bit over the years about different things.  
  
But we run into -- most of us all in this business, we see each other on the
recruiting trail. One guy's running into a gym at Cheyenne High School in Las
Vegas and another guy's running out to go to the Cashman Center to see a
different tournament.  
  
So he has done -- I'm happy for him because he's found a home at Georgia
State. He's done such a tremendous job there.  
  
Q. Earlier this week, Coach Hunter gave a little comment about Ruth's
Chris and Wendy's and the Hyatt and the Comfort Inn. With regards to that, he
said they eat at Wendy's, you eat at Ruth's Chris.  
MICK CRONIN: I eat at the Montgomery Inn. You ever been to Cincinnati?  
  
Q. I'm from Cincinnati.  
MICK CRONIN: Do you go to Montgomery Inn or the Boathouse?  
  
Q. Montgomery Inn.  
MICK CRONIN: Of course. We need to take Ron there.  
  
Q. Is it strange to see how the perception around your program has
changed? It puts you in a different light how he said he was seeing you.  
MICK CRONIN: Look, all that stuff's good. Ron's good with the mic. I don't
know if it's getting him any endorsements in Atlanta, but I hope so. I don't
really pay much attention to all that stuff.  
  
As far as, you know, our program, Coach Huggins, what did he come back, in
'89? By '91, we were in the Final Four. He let the record reflected our
program back to national prominence. So around that time, it's kind of been
that way ever since, despite the change in conferences that we've had.  
  
It's my job to keep it there.  
  
Q. Coach, how you doing?  
MICK CRONIN: Good to see you as always, my friend.  
  
Q. A lot of hype around Bearcats and Virginia's defense, deservedly so.
This is a pretty good defensive team in Georgia State as well. What kind of
problems do they pose? Not a lot of height.  
MICK CRONIN: The turnovers, they create over 14 a game. That's been something
that's caused us problems. I'm a big believer, as you know, in turnover margin
is the biggest key statistic that's not talked about.  
  
If you hear me talk at a basketball clinic, that's what -- people ask me about
defense, I'll talk to them about turnover margin. Just sheer numbers. You're
going to get more shots than your opponent.  
  
The other problem with turnovers, which Georgia State does a good job
creating, is then points off turnovers, transition baskets that you can't set
your defense. It eliminates your scouting report defensively.  
  
We're much harder, just like they are, much harder to score on teams 5-on-5.
So they do a great job, as good as any college team I've ever seen, and Ron's
obviously teaching it with the Karl Malone.  
  
Remember, Karl Malone would play post defense and he'd wait. As soon as you
turned, he'd strip you. Because of their lack of size at certain positions,
they're excellent at it.  
  
Then our own Kenyon Martin became excellent at it as well as an NBA player.
And they just do a tremendous job stripping the basketball defensively. And
that's something that's a big concern for us, because it can eliminate your
height advantage.  
  
Q. Mick, you're in town, Xavier's in town. You're in separate brackets,
different -- you've got the first game tomorrow, they've got the night
session. What kind of atmosphere are you expecting tomorrow? Do you expect
some fans traveling? Maybe see some Xavier people coming early just to maybe
boo?  
MICK CRONIN: Here's what I'll tell you. I have Xavier friends. And so all it
did was add to my ticket request, because they want to come to both sessions.
I'm dead serious on that. So I have -- it's cost me money, to be honest with
you. A couple of guys that I owe favors to that are big Xavier boosters but
are friends of mine. So it's going to end up costing me four or 500, them
being in the same bracket as us, having to buy extra tickets for them.  
  
But I will get it back this summer somehow.  
  
Q. You know that Georgia State's going to try to spread you out with
their 3-point shooting. You've faced teams that have tried that earlier in the
year. How have you tried to contend with that? What kind of success have you
had?  
MICK CRONIN: I think, like anybody, it causes you problems at times. And it
has for us. Whether it was Cleveland State, whether it was Tulsa, whether it
was Memphis in the first half in the conference tournament.  
  
It's a challenge that when teams play small, they're going to do it because
they're going to play more shooters. The bigger you are, the more it puts
pressure on your defense. You've got to cover out at the 3-point line with
bigger guys.  
  
So we've seen it, but that doesn't mean we're going to be able to deal with
it. So we've had some days here to practice. But we'll have no excuse because
it's not like we haven't had time to practice.  
  
Like you said, we've seen it from multiple teams. You know, even Houston is a
great shooting team. So that being said, I think that they do a great job of
spreading you out, but they also have Simonds, who is a big-time player. Not
just a scorer. He can pass too.  
  
So it all starts with him, because if he gets one-on-one coverage, he scores,
he gets fouled, he gets layups, then you start to leave their shooters and he
finds their shooters. So he's a concern. He's as good as anybody we've played
against probably since Trevon Bluiett.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned at the beginning that you don't want your team
to get complacent with winning the American Athletic Conference, and you
sometimes, like when they hear thank you a lot, that can hurt a team. How do
you balance that with your team being hot at the right time?  
MICK CRONIN: I agree with you on that. You want to be playing well. And you
want to have momentum. I think momentum's a good thing in any sport. And guys
believe in -- I think you've got to go into a tournament believing that you
have a chance to win the tournament.  
  
If you really believe that, then I think your commitment level will be higher
instead of just being in the tournament, being happy to be in the tournament.  
  
So that's one. But, two, I think my job's been to focus our guys on putting
those trophies in the trophy case and getting back to staying alive here. And
to be honest with you, you know, trying to make sure we just worry about
winning Friday.  
  
I think our guys aren't -- we have -- I don't know our seedings, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, stuff like that. We haven't been a 2 seed. So it's a new one. So we've
always been really focused on the first game because we've really kind of been
playing another team from a conference like ours.  
  
So with this situation, it's been a huge concern of mine, making sure my guys
don't look past the first round, that they realize that Ron Hunter's won
tournament games, that the Sun Belt's won two of their last three first round
games.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday about your players thinking about the UCLA
game last year, and I asked a couple of them about that, and they said that
was true. They said they'd learned from that. They'd learned how to win.  
What did they learn from that, do you think, that has helped them win this
year or helped them this season?  
  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we talked a lot about, one, you can't get -- whatever our
game plan may be, you can't get away from it, which we did in the second half
of that game.  
  
Two, we practiced all summer on being in better shape, be in better condition
and trying to be a better transition team.  
  
And the last piece is to be -- you know I've talked about this -- be a deeper
team. So you get into a high-level game, and Georgia State starts making shots
back and forth and it starts to become a back and forth game. You got to be
able to keep pace with another team when they're making those kind of shots
because everybody's capable.  
  
You know, Memphis did it to us. They were awesome in the first half of that
game. We talked about being able to raise the level of our game when the time
comes and we have to play at a high, high level or we're going to lose.
Everybody's not going to come out, be confused by your defense. They're not
going to have a bad night.  
  
In that game, UCLA took it to a level. We didn't go up there with them. When
the game got to a certain level, we, A, got away from our game plan; B, we
didn't stay at the level with them.  
  
I showed them the film on it too. Fatigue was part of it. That's why I wanted
to schedule them this year and then talk about it all summer.  
  
The focus wasn't just on that game. It was what do we need to be able to do to
be a high level team.  
  
Q. How did the loss affect you personally? Did it take a long time to
get over?  
MICK CRONIN: All losses affect me.  
  
Q. That one was no different?  
MICK CRONIN: Not really, no. Look, what you got to say -- in my job, you beat
yourself up for a while, and then you have to say, in that game who on my team
would have started for UCLA last year? And then after about 30 seconds, I
answered that question, I went and played golf.  
  
Q. Mick, your 3-point defense is one of the best in the country. Which
player do you think is really the catalyst of that that needs to be playing
well in that regard for you guys to really lock down from long range?  
MICK CRONIN: I can't give you a single guy in that, because they have multiple
-- teams that shoot the ball well, it's because they do it with multiple
players.  
  
So if they only have one shooter, you just deny him. Everybody deny him. The
way we play defense, we change our coverage a lot. So I think the key for us
all year has been focus on our game plan. We're a big game plan team. We're
game plan specific.  
  
And then what I would finish that answer with is we've shown the ability to
get better defensively as games go on and take -- just like we talked about in
previous answers, if you need to take -- if a team's really hitting hard shots
and a guy gets it going, you have to be able to step it up and play
unbelievable defense with unbelievable effort and not just hope a guy misses
and almost force misses, force turnovers. We've been able to do that a lot
this year. That's why we have the record we have.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mick, thank you very much. Good luck.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Thank you, sir.

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our final team, Florida State University Seminoles. They're the
No. 9 seed in the West Region. They're out of the Atlantic Coast Conference.
They'll play No. 8, Missouri, in Friday's final game. The men's basketball
contact is Chuck Walsh.  
  
The student-athletes representing the Seminoles are Terance Mann, Phil Cofer,
Braian Angola, and Trent Forrest. We'll go right to questions.  
  
Q. This is for anybody. How do you kind of evaluate a guy like Michael
Porter when it's been one game and it was after a long rest. How do you study
for a guy like that?  
TERANCE MANN: We know he's a good player. Everyone has seen what he's done in
high school. Everyone kind of knows he's a good player. We've got to contain
him and follow the scouting report.  
  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: Like Terance says, we know what he's capable of doing. We know
the talent that he has, and our coaches will prepare for him and what he's
capable of doing.  
  
Q. Terance, I won't ask you what the scouting report is, but you said
follow the scouting report. How difficult is it to have one when the guy's
played 25 minutes all season?  
TERANCE MANN: You just got to contain him, keep him in front of you like
anybody else. Keep them in front of you. When he shoots his shots, contest
them.  
  
Q. Going up against guys like Dwayne and Isaac last season, do you guys
think playing against -- playing with those guys, playing against those guys
in practice could help you go up against a talent like Michael Porter?  
PHIL COFER: I think definitely. Just one thing is probably Jonathan Isaac.
He's long, athletic, so it was definitely pretty hard for him on the defensive
side. But I think it was great for us to have him here and it definitely
helped us in practice.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TRENT FORREST: I would say yes, it definitely helps being able to guard
somebody that tall and that athletic. I feel like Jon, he gave us a great
example of that last year and it was just very tough being able to guard
somebody with that skill set.  
  
Q. Phil, the other Porter, I guess, Donte, a lot of guys at 6'11 " will
be guys that play more down low. What have you seen out of him? What
challenges are there in guarding a bigger guy that tends to play a little bit
more outside.  
PHIL COFER: He's definitely versatile. He can pick and pop. He can go down
low. We can pretty much do anything. Our bigs will have to get down and low to
guard around the perimeter. We're going to stick to our game plan, just do
what we do.  
  
Q. For Terance, I know you aren't looking ahead or anything, but the
possibility of facing Xavier in the next round, after what they did to you
last year, how much incentive is that to maybe get that next chance in?  
TERANCE MANN: It's definitely motivation a lot more motivation to get to the
next round to see them as a rematch. But we got this game tomorrow night that
we've got to focus on. So the whole team is basically focused on Missouri.  
  
Q. Phil, what was your relationship like with Cuonzo when he recruited
you to Tennessee? What did you like about him?  
PHIL COFER: It was definitely, I'd probably say, another father figure. He's a
great character guy and I talk with him pretty much all the time. And it's
definitely cool to finally play against him because I haven't seen him since
my Tennessee days. But besides that, it's going to be a good game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, what's this experience like for you this year, whereas
last year it was the first time you guys made the tournament? Is it anything
different this time? Do you think your experience from last season really does
carry over over here?  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: We are really excited to be here. Talking in the locker room,
just glad to be back and we're just trying to play as hard as we can and have
fun and enjoy the moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who else can answer to that? Who was here last year?  
  
TERANCE MANN: Obviously, it's a great opportunity to be back, especially how
we went out last year. It's another opportunity to try to prove people wrong.
So we're going to try and take full advantage of it, definitely.  
  
Q. Terance, what do you think has prepared you guys for this opportunity
throughout the course of this season specifically?  
TERANCE MANN: Are you talking about playing against Missouri specifically?  
  
Q. Just the tournament.  
TERANCE MANN: Basically, just playing in the ACC, in general. Every game's a
big game. It's a big spotlight. Just like, you know, this game tomorrow night.
So I think a lot of us are well prepared for it and we've been in plenty of
situations like this.  
  
Q. Is there an ACC team that you have played this year that's similar to
what you see on film out of Missouri? Is there a team you could compare to
Missouri that we've played already?  
TRENT FORREST: I would probably say North Carolina. They're pretty big,
physical guys. North Carolina kind of similar to that. They were able to shoot
the ball really well. So I would say North Carolina.  
  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: Yeah, probably would say North Carolina and Clemson. They're a
very physical team and they have guys that can shoot the ball from the
perimeter and run the floor very well. So probably say that.  
  
Q. Trent, there's been some mention and some things made of your guys'
struggles defending the 3-point line kind of later in the season, especially
against a team that relies on it so much. What do you need to do in this game
to not let Missouri get open shots?  
TRENT FORREST: I would say just be able to play smart defense, being down to
catch when guys catch the ball. Being able to run them off the line. So I
think just being there on the catch and trusting our defensive principles will
kind of take care of itself.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow night.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Donte Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34966)

### [Trayvon Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34967)

### [Demontrae Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33098)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The 4:15 time slot features the Texas Southern Tigers. They're
the No. 16 seed in the West Region. They are the Southwestern Athletic
Conference tournament champions. They will play No. 1 Xavier in Friday's third
game at 6:20. The men's basketball contact is Demetrius House. And these
gentlemen are already 1-0 in this tournament, coming in from Dayton last
night.  
  
Demontrae Jefferson, Donte Clark and Trayvon Reed represent the student body
for Texas Southern. And we'll go right to questions.  
  
Q. For Demontrae, I think a lot of people saw you maybe for the first
time last night. Just your height, how often has that been used against you?
How much of a chip on your shoulder has that been as you've gone through your
career? How much has that been used as a knock against you?  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: Well, the knock on me has always been my height. Kind of
just the knock a lot of guards because I have a scoring mentality. And being
my height, a lot of coaches kind of feared that I should have a passing
mentality, so I kind of put the height to the side and try to replace my
height and my inches with my heart.  
  
Q. This is for Trayvon Reed. Reed, you played some great minutes against
North Carolina Central. At what point did you feel comfortable in that ball
game?  
TRAYVON REED: I mean, as soon as I stepped in, I felt comfortable. Towards,
like, when we was making our run, I felt really comfortable. After that, you
know, I was just in there trying to do my job, do what I do.  
  
Q. For Demontrae, congratulations on last night.  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: Thank you.  
  
Q. I was asking Trevon Bluiett about you. He said you guys knew each
other. He said he'd known you since middle school. Had you linked up on the
AAU circuit?  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: Which one is that?  
  
Q. Trevon Bluiett. He's from Indy.  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I played against him last night?  
  
Q. No. He plays for Xavier.  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I'd probably have to see his face. I don't really
remember.  
  
Q. Donte Clark, going into tomorrow's game, how do you feel about the
pressure on the 16 seed playing against a 1 seed?  
DONTE CLARK: I think all the pressure is on the 1 seed. I don't think there's
any pressure on us. We've just got to come out and play our game the best we
know how to play. I feel like all the pressure's on them and we just need to
go out there and do what we know how to do.  
  
Q. For all of y'all, what time did y'all arrive in Nashville? And the
early season schedule you had with all the road games stacked up, one on the
other, how can that kind of help prepare you for what I imagine is a hectic
schedule this week?  
TRAYVON REED: We got here last night around 2:00. We have just been up and
running, just staying busy. I think that's been able to, you know -- it's been
helping me just being able to stay busy.  
  
DONTE CLARK: Like he said, we got in around 2:00. It was kind of late, but we
still had -- I feel like we still had energy just because we just got off a
win or whatever. So I don't think we're too tired.  
  
But going off the non-conference games, I feel like we prepared ourselves for
this game playing the teams that we played in non-conference.  
  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: We arrived around 2:00, and I could say my team was wide
awoke. I don't think nobody slept on the plane. We probably all were still
excited with our adrenaline running.  
  
But this isn't nothing we haven't done before, like we had back-to-back games,
flying state to state, all non-conference. So just back to the basics, really.  
  
Q. The confidence level of this basketball team, you have all your
pieces back together. You've got Trayvon Reed back. You've got Donte Clark.
You've got Derrick Bruce helping you out. How confident within the team do you
feel coming into tomorrow's game?  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: Like Donte said, I feel like it's no pressure on us. I
guess the world got comfortable with the 16 seed falling out, but that's not
on our mind. 16 seed not on our mind. We're going to come into this game and
we're going to play Texas Southern basketball.  
  
The non-conference showed us we can play at the level that these teams are
playing at. It's just if we can sustain that for 40 minutes, which was the
problem earlier on in this season. But now, I feel like we can sustain that
close to 40 minutes now than we was during non-conference.  
  
Q. For any player, speak on the history you made last night winning the
first game in school history and what it would mean to win another game and
continue playing in this tournament.  
TRAYVON REED: Last night's win was huge. It was huge for the school. It was
huge for us, the coaching staff. You know, going into the game tomorrow night,
you know, it's going to be, you know, huge, being able to play against Xavier,
them being a No. 1 seed. Just trying to go in there, compete, and then we can
get that win. That would be really huge for the school and that's what we're
focused on, trying to win.  
  
DONTE CLARK: Yeah, piggybacking on what he said, I definitely think it was big
for the school and just for the people in the community, as far as in Houston
and stuff like that, for them to look up to somebody like us as basketball
players, just show them that they can make a dream come true.  
  
Q. Demontrae, the Xavier coach earlier said that a lot of -- he knows
you and a lot of his guys know you based on your YouTube videos. How often do
you get that from opposing teams and players?  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: Yeah, I get that a lot. A lot of people approach me, like
are you really him? You really this little? I can't believe you're doing those
things.  
  
But, yeah, I mean, a lot of people are familiar. But when it's actually in
front of you and you actually see how quick it is and it's a different blur
than on those videos.  
  
TRAYVON REED: For real.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
DONTE CLARK: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
NASHVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+NASHVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jordan Caroline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32865)

### [Cody Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35052)

### [Caleb Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35053)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Nevada Wolf Pack are the No. 7 seed in the South Region.
They are the Mountain West regular season champions. They'll play the No. 10
seed Texas in Friday's second game.  
  
We'll start off with questions for Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, and Jordan
Caroline. They represent the student body of the Wolf Pack.  
  
Q. To both Caleb and Cody, Shaka was up here earlier talking about
trying to recruit you two times kind of, I guess. What was your experience
with him the first go-around when he was trying to get you to VCU and he said
you committed about a week after he talked to you the last time and so he
probably didn't do a very good job.  
CALEB MARTIN: I saw him in the hallway a little bit ago. I talked to him. Good
catching up with him. He tried to recruit us coming out of high school for
VCU, at VCU. One of my old teammates who was there as a point guard, Johnathan
Williams. He's just a good dude. Came and watched us work out a couple times
while we were at our public school.  
  
But yeah, it's not like he didn't do a good job. We seemed to find a better
fit at first coming out of high school and that's a decision that we felt
comfortable with coming out of high school. It was nothing personal.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I mean, again, it was nothing personal. Shaka's a good dude. He
always does a good job. He's great at what he does. We just felt like this is
the best option for me and my brother. He's a good dude. I understand he
doesn't hold grudges or hold it personal.  
  
Q. If I could get all three of you to talk about you've had a chance for
a few days to review Texas's tapes and stuff. What problems do they present
for you?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: They're a really talented team. They have a lot of depth at
spots and they're really long in the front court, so I think that's their
biggest advantage. But we just have been watching, seeing where we're going to
get our advantages at offensively.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I think the biggest issue is probably just the size. That's the
obvious thing going towards our team. But we both like to play fast, so that's
something that we're looking forward to. They're really, really good defensive
team but we're a good offensive time. I think that the biggest thing for us is
just moving the ball, sharing the ball. Like I said, both teams like to play
fast, so I think it will work out in both of our favors.  
  
CALEB MARTIN: Again, just jumping off the size, whenever they've got length
like that, we've got to do a better job of probably bringing them out, trying
to do what we can to get them away from the paint, get them away from the lane
and try to expose those mismatches.  
  
One of the biggest things we've done a great job at this year is playing
undersize and learning how to get the ball away from those big guys like
Brandon McCoy and Juiston at UNLV, guys like that. I think we've done a great
job of trying to get the ball out of their hands. I don't think we'll be too
shy about it.  
  
Q. Obviously, everybody knows about Bamba. He's not hard to miss out
there. But who on y'all's scouting report is a guy that none of us might talk
about that y'all are like, we've got to stop this guy.  
CALEB MARTIN: I mean, there's honestly a couple of them. Roach is a guy, a
really high volume guy for them. We know Young, he's been playing his best
basketball lately, been shooting the ball very, very well.  
  
They've just got a lot of people, Osetkowski, he's very good. We've read a lot
of articles, watched a lot of game film on him. He's one of the players who
can change the entire momentum of their game. We've got to make sure there's a
couple guys we have to wrap our hand around and make sure we do a great job to
not let them get going.  
  
Q. You have a lot of transfers on your team and you're an older team.
How much does that sort of help you guys that there are players in the locker
room who have been in other places, who have experienced other things, when
y'all put it all in the pot, makes your current team chemistry?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Well, everybody on the team has been to the tournament, so
that brings a lot of experience because nobody's afraid of the big lights. I
think that helps a lot.  
  
Also, coming from other programs, everybody's came here and we bought into we
want to win. We put winning before anything else.  
  
CODY MARTIN: For sure, I think a big thing for us now is having a lot of
experience. And I know my freshman year, we made a run in the tournament, that
was a big factor to being in the tournament, having that kind of experience
and understanding that you don't have to start out slow. There's no getting
nerves out.  
  
Something our coach emphasizes is always playing hard. Go for loose balls,
playing defense or things like that can encourage you to get the nerves oust.
I think that having that kind of experience on our team is going to benefit
us.  
  
Q. For any of y'all, you had a great season, but go into the tournament
having lost two of our last three. Was there a common thread in the last two
losses that you need to kind of get squared away heading into this?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I would say just being ready to play right out the gate. I
feel when we played in the tournament we got smacked in the mouth. That's
really ultimately what led to that loss. The same thing when we played at San
Diego State, we had lapses that came back to bite us at the end.  
  
Q. Caleb, it's a make-or-miss business. You guys make a lot of 3s, 40
percent as a team, which is way up there. There are going to be times when
they don't fall. What keeps you guys going, because you shoot a lot of them,
and it's make-or-miss-type thing. So what keeps you going, especially knowing
that Texas is so big inside.  
CALEB MARTIN: I mean, the main thing we've got to realize, whenever shots are
falling down, we've got to do a great job of defending people. At the end of
the day, keeping guys in front of us and learning how to rebound with the
bigger guys, whether we have to double down and box out, take two guys to box
out, we're going to need all five guys to come in and do what we can on the
boards.  
  
Like you said, at the end of the day, we live by the 3 a lot of times. When
they don't fall, we have to rely back on our defense and rely back on our
rebounding for sure.  
  
Q. Jordan and Caleb, the direction of this program has been a step
forward every season. Do you feel like the next step in this program's
ascension is getting to the tournament and winning a game after what you were
able to do last season?  
CALEB MARTIN: For sure. I think every program has to take steps in the right
direction of bettering each season.  
  
Last year, they got to the tournament and then it seems to kind of be like a
replay of last year. But like you said, our goal is always -- our intentions
are always to win the game, and we came to Nashville to win and win a couple
games, actually. So we're going to come here with the mindset, we're ready to
play, just like any other game we're going to approach. Exactly, just better
every season. Better every season, every year.  
  
JORDAN CAROLINE: To piggyback on that, you don't want to just keep getting
there and losing. You don't want to plateau. Each year, we try to get better.
Like he said, we came here to win a couple games, not just one. We have big
goals ahead of us.  
  
Q. For both the Martins, how has this NCAA tournament experience
different than the one you went through in your freshman season at North
Carolina State?  
CODY MARTIN: Obviously for me, my freshman year, we didn't get to play. You're
going there and get to experience everything but it's a lot different when
you're on the court. I finally get to experience it and get to have a big
impact on the game.  
  
I get to have -- I have different teammates with me. These are a great group
of guys that I wouldn't want to be over anybody else. What's different is
obviously, we're in a good position. We're in a higher seed. We're looking
forward to winning. We know we have a tough opponent so I know that I've got
some good guys beside me to go to war with.  
  
CALEB MARTIN: Same thing. Basically just the same thing. Just being some big-
time contributors along with Jordan and Kendall and Hallice and everybody. I
think the team's different. A lot of our scoring, a lot of what everyone's
impacts across the board for our team, everybody does our own things, you
know. At a bigger school, you had a couple guys that did the main things and
everybody else did the dirty work.  
  
We're a team that it doesn't matter. Could be anybody's night. We've had
nights where Josh has had 20, Jordan's had past 20. Kendall's had past 30. You
know what I'm saying. You just never know. I think with like the way our team
is, it could be anybody's night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

### [Mohamed Bamba](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35040)

### [Matt Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34898)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Texas Longhorns are the 10th seed in the South
Region. They're out of the Big 12 Conference. They'll play No. 7, Nevada, in
the Friday night's second game. The men's basketball contact is Scott
McConnell. The student-athletes representing Texas are Matt Coleman and
Mohamed Bamba.  
  
Q. Mo, you said you're 100% healthy. How nice has it been to have a week
off before the game?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: It's been very nice. This week, we've taken care of my body,
gotten better as far as, you know, putting in good deposits on the court as
far as practice. And it's just, again, a good week to just decompress and
start over.  
  
Q. Mo or Matt, both, your coach talked earlier this week about some of
the challenges Nevada presents in terms of having kind of a position-less
offense and a position-less defense. Is there any team in the Big 12 you face
or any other team that kind of gives you guys that same look offensively?  
MATT COLEMAN: Not really. It is going to be a new challenge for us. Looking at
the roster, five across the line, 6'7", standing 6'7", it would be a challenge
to see how we can look for different ways to score and defend.  
  
MOHAMED BAMBA: I'm not taking any questions from Nevada natives, sorry.  
  
No. I think one team that we faced in the Big 12 that was kind of like
position-less both offensively and defensively is probably Texas Tech. They
played a lot of small ball and it was a pretty good matchup for us.  
  
But I think Nevada will pose a different challenge, because a lot of those
guys can really go offensively and we've just got to do our job and guard.  
  
Q. Mo, for you personally, what is the importance of playing in the NCAA
tournament for Texas and what would be the importance of winning a game in the
NCAA tournament for Texas and potentially more than one game?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: Oh, this is what we sign up for. This is what -- at the end of
the day, this is what we imagine when we first sign our names and our initials
on the Letter of Intent.  
  
It will mean the world to us. We've got to do our job. Small victories lead to
big victories, and hopefully we'll be cutting down nets.  
  
Q. For Mo, I want to confirm, do you feel at 100 percent now? And just
the way your toe, I mean, when did you start feeling a little bit better? I
know you played late in the Big 12 tournament. When did it start feeling like
you could play again?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: Probably like a couple days prior to playing Texas Tech, it was
close to 100 percent. I feel great in practice, feel good in practice. So just
happy to be out there.  
  
Q. Mo, can you describe what life is like when your name is on mock
drafts all the time and, you know, just the whole -- do you look at them? Do
you not look at them? Do you care? Do you not care? All of that.  
MOHAMED BAMBA: It's like almost impossible to not know where you are in the
mock draft because people always say Mo, they have you projected at so and so.  
  
I'm like, Cool.  
  
I try and not pay much attention to it because I'm just, you know, I'm here in
the moment. I'm not quite there yet. I'm living the moment. I'm living in the
NCAA tournament. And I think that's honestly the key to success, because when
you start thinking about things long-term and down the road, that's when your
mind gets clouded with just things that don't help the team. So I try to live
in the moment as much as possible.  
  
Q. Mo, if you had to identify one area of your game that you feel like
you've developed the most since, I guess, during your time at Texas, or
perhaps it's more than one area, what would those be?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: Well, are you talking about intangibles or just like a game
skill-wise?  
  
Q. I would say both.  
MOHAMED BAMBA: Okay. So I think I've improved, like, as far as the intangibles
with just like leadership and just, you know, putting -- it seemed pretty
comical at first when coach kind of told me in the summer, but putting that
look on your face and showing that you care. Because when you have that look
on your face, your affect on your teammates just rubs off. And the next thing
you know, guys are flying around playing. Playing very hard.  
  
Skill-wise, I think my game is night and day from June 1st. I'm just playing
out there. I'm shooting with confidence. I'm getting into post moves, using my
body more. It's just fun being out there imposing my will.  
  
Q. Matt, you went to Oak Hill, same as the Martins. Did you fish out
some information from your coach about him?  
MATT COLEMAN: I don't know much about him, my two years at Oak Hill, they were
long gone. They were at NC State. So I think I played pickup with them once or
twice. That's all I know much on them.  
  
Q. Mo, oftentimes college basketball players' careers are defined by
what they do in the NCAA tournament. Is that something you have thought about
or are thinking about as you head into this weekend?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: Absolutely, you look at some of the Texas greats like K.D. and
T.J. Ford and the legacy they left on the program is mainly based on what they
did in March. The opportunity and the platform is there for me now. It's just
my time to seize it.  
  
Q. Texas hadn't been to a Final Four since 2003. What would that mean
for you guys to take Texas back for the first time in, like, 15 years?  
MATT COLEMAN: It would be an unbelievable feeling just to be a part of the
team to actually -- to say, like, we made it to the Final Four and to do it --
it's bigger than just us. It's for Texas basketball, for the city of Austin.
It would just bring a different dynamic to Texas in general.  
  
Personally, I would love to have that feeling of being a freshman, going all
the way to the Final Four. That's what you dream of. You dream of playing in
March and having an opportunity to actually be here is why not make the best
of it?  
  
MOHAMED BAMBA: Well, that's all very nice, but I think you've got to take it
one game at a time and not overlook any opponents. I didn't even -- normally,
I make a bracket. I didn't make a bracket this year just because I didn't want
to overlook anybody and I want to focus in on our task at hand. But it will be
a great feeling, one of the best feelings in the world, I'm sure.  
  
Q. Matt, they have some big guards, but overall up front, you guys are a
lot bigger than them with Mo and Dylan and Jericho. How important will it be
to establish the big guys early and often to try to take advantage of that
size advantage?  
MATT COLEMAN: As a point guard, I always want to find ways to get my big
fellas involved here. So I'm going to do everything I can to always make sure
their presence is felt offensively and defensively. If it's giving them the
ball, making them run the floor, just getting them involved.  
  
I've seen that we have very, very, very good bigs, and why not use them?  
  
Q. Mo, are you ready to play 35 minutes? How's the toe?  
MOHAMED BAMBA: I'm ready to play 40. I'm doing well. My wind is back from
being out three or four games. I'm doing well, getting back into the flow of
things. Real excited. Real excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.
