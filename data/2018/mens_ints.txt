# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2018

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [Devin Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26075)

### [Galen Robinson Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34956)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 56, Houston - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: I would like to have seen that last play decided by the
players on the floor. Questions?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. It was a real rock fight out there, both teams really got after it
defensively in the second half.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah, both teams have that identity. Can't say enough about
our kids' grit, toughness, three games in three days, people just looking for
a pretty offensive game. If we didn't play for two weeks, that might not be a
pretty offensive game.  
  
Both teams battled. That's why it's so disappointing on that last call, just
disappointing.  
  
Q. Kelvin, from your vantage point there interpretation-wise, what did
you see on that call?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: I have no other comment on that play. You can ask me about the
game. That's over with.  
  
Q. How much do you think a game like this helps you prepare for the next
week?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: I think so. I think so. Eventually I'm going to calm down, I'm
sure, but you got a three-point lead with under a minute to go. We're a stop
away from coming down with a three-point lead and don't turn it over, make
your free throws, we're out there celebrating. That's how close we were. Their
kid falls down, maintains his dribble, was not walking. I'm always honest
about that stuff, he maintained his dribble, but he threw it out, their five
man makes a contested three, that's how close we were.  
  
But our kids deserve better at the end though.  
  
Q. The offensive rebounding margin or the second-chance points margin,
17-4 --  
KELVIN SAMPSON: That's pretty good. It was 17-3 at halftime. So we were great
in the second half.  
  
Q. The shooting overall, 6-for-30, in the second half. To lose a game by
one point by shooting 20 percent, have you ever seen a game like that?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: No, but don't judge this on a level playing field. Make sure
you say both these kids, both these teams' kids were exhausted. They played
three games in three days. Their main guys probably played 100 minutes. So
you're going to have games like that on three games in three days. If you want
pretty, look at our game against Central Florida.  
  
But Cincinnati, Houston, third game, three days, our game Friday night got
over about 11:30, I think. Then we came back and played at 3:30 yesterday. I
think it was 3:30 yesterday. And 3:30 today. I'm not shocked at shooting
percentage. What did they shoot the second half? Anybody know?  
  
Q. Not much better.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah, well, it was hard to get a shot against a good defensive
team and kids didn't have much legs, that's why the way it ended was so
disappointing. Just disappointing, disappointing.  
  
Q. Along those lines with the fatigue and second half I think you guys
were 0-for-10 on threes, you don't see that normally from your team. Was that
also the factor?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: I would say so. I would say it had a lot to do with it. What
were they from the three?  
  
Q. Obviously this is a tough loss, but can you just speak to the way
this team came together this season and obviously getting back into the
Tournament, NCAA Tournament.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: No, I'm proud of our team. Proud of the way they fought today.
That's why it's so disappointing the way we lost. I don't care about the
stats. I mean, you know, writing about stats is not the story of this game.
You have two teams that, I mean it's a bloodletting. Two teams out there just
-- sometimes a rock fight you throw at each other and you hit nothing. We're
hitting each other in the face with rocks, and kids were battling each other.
Give Washington credit, he made a great shot.  
  
As I said earlier, I just was disappointed the way the last point was scored.
I would like to have seen the two teams continue to decide it themselves. But
I was proud of our team. What was our record?  
  
Q. 26-7.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: 26 wins, I'm not going to sit here and find something wrong
with them right now. They fought their hearts out. Just came up a little bit
short. But they're still champions in my eyes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Houston, thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2018

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 56, Houston - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we knew it was going to be a war. We're all looking forward
to playing other teams. You play these teams three times, it's every
conference tournament is this way, we knew Sunday was going to be a war. So we
tried to rest all week, to be honest with you. Gambled a little bit with no
live practice all week. Two days off and two walkthroughs before we came here,
to try to save these guys for March. We had just enough energy and fight in us
today to get the job done.  
  
But Houston's got a great team, they have had a great season, and they have
really, really had a big impact on the development of our league. We need them
to be good and Coach Sampson has done a great job with them. We were just one
more point better than them today, but a lot of resolve from our players. I
think when I watch the film it's going to be amazing how we won, considering
our lack of shooting open shots and our lack of free throws, making free
throws.  
  
I'm really happy for Kyle. Obviously Gary's getting a lot of accolades but
these guys, they play so well together that it's what's made us win 60 games
in the last two years. At the end of the day, Kyle making the three-point shot
to tie the game is really fitting, because he puts so much time in, in the
gym. I was really -- I would have been shocked if he would have missed it.
He's got the type of attitude you need to have to take that shot, and he's got
to continue to have that type of confidence and we made the right pass on that
play as well, so it was obviously a great win for our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach and the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. The last half, do you think three games, three days is does take its
toll on teams?  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. I mean especially at shooters. I see it a lot.  
MICK CRONIN: Jake was hurt, Jake jammed his finger, Kyle's got a little small
pinkie finger injury. But I agree, yeah, I would say more so the games, like
the teams know each other so well that the game in the second half just kind
of screeches to a grinding halt. And I kept telling my team that the game was
going to be won when what happens when the ball's in the air, obviously
meaning a rebound, or when the ball's on the floor. This game's not going to
-- nobody's going to make a whole bunch of shots here. Devin Davis I think
made a jumper late, Kyle made a huge three late, other than that it was layups
and free throws. And I think a lot of that has to do with the physicality of
the game, the familiarity of the teams, and then both teams are just beat up
from beating each other up.  
  
But our guys responded late because, I will say this, because you know me a
long time and you've all been around, Houston remind me so much of Villanova
from my Big East days, and people say what's it like to play in the Big East.
There's so many great teams but I always thought that nobody, if I could get
my team to play when I was building the program, as hard as Villanova played,
I used to always think that, then we would be okay. We finally got to that
point. And like I watched Houston play and that's who they remind me of. They
play with so much heart that it's tough to knock them out. I wish them well
next week.  
  
Q. Gary, you missed those two free throws a couple minutes earlier, you
missed the first one.  
MICK CRONIN: Setting up the drama.  
  
Q. How did you gather yourself to make that last free throw?  
GARY CLARK: This is going to eat me alive for a while, but just focus. I
always look over at Coach and he's like telling me to calm down and right
behind him is his dad.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Free-throw coach.  
  
GARY CLARK: That's the free-throw coach, since I got here as a freshman he's
always coaching us on free throws. And I look past my mom and she had this
look on her face like, you better calm down. So I was able to chill and just
do my routine and just try and forget about the other ones I had already
missed before then and just have a short memory.  
  
Q. Kyle, the three-pointer that you made, a lot of fans, media even,
didn't know you probably when you went up to shoot that shot and thought,
what's he doing shooting that? But what's your mentality in that situation
when you know you can make that shot, right? You made them all year.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I just was trying to be confident. Just trying to stay
confident at always times.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Gym time. Tell him.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: And the reps that I try to get up. I take these games very
seriously, I don't take it for granted, like I said yesterday. And being on a
team like this, having a coach like this, you just want to show that you care
about just as much as he does or you care about it just as much as Gary does.
So I try to show it by the work that I put in and the enthusiasm that I have.  
  
But in terms of stepping up and shooting that shot, just confidence and just
believing in myself at all times. That's what you have to do, everyone has to
do that.  
  
Q. For the players, what does it mean, this is the first conference
tournament title, first conference tournament title for UC in 14 years. You've
won the league regular season title, you're going to the NCAA Tournament, but
what does it mean to finally for this program to persevere and win this
tournament?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I'll take it. Gary's giving me the eye. It means a lot
because Gary and I have had a lot of conversations just the two of us talking
about how we have all the pieces, how we have the coach to help us, to guide
us to this pinnacle, to this benchmark, and we want to definitely keep on
going. We're appreciative of this but we want it keep on going. I think it's
just a representation of how close we are together, because we created a great
atmosphere of people always caring, people always being accountable, starting
with us. So I was just happy that this team was able to experience that,
because we do care and we and a lot of people say that in D-I basketball but
not everybody shows it through action. So I'm happy that we were able to
experience this.  
  
GARY CLARK: Same thing.  
  
Q. You had two straight games where first half you your opponent shot
the ball really well, second half 18 percent yesterday, 20 percent today and
18 points. How do you do that? What goes into that?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, you can have a lot of game plans as a coach, there's a lot
of really good coaches out there and sometimes they -- and I refer to high
school coaches because they're underrated because they coach whoever enrolls.
The same guy doesn't win the state championship every year. And there's some
guys in my business that are in the Hall of Fame and are in the NIT some
years. It's players. You can talk about -- I can sit here and tell you about
the culture and try to sell you on everything that we build at Cincinnati, and
you got to have players. You can do all the talking you want, your kids got to
want to win and they have got to be willing to do the things that go into
winning that do not show up in a stat sheet, that people don't text message
them about, that is not going to get them on SportsCenter, and it's called
defensive communication, toughness, guarding the ball, helping each other, and
we all practice the same stuff pretty much. And I've been doing this my 15th
year as a head coach, I've been around enough to know that you're going to win
when you, have you to have talent, but you've also got to have guys that are
willing to do the uncomfortable things that go into winning.  
  
So in the second half I told the guys at halftime, I mean, I could ask Houston
to stop making shots or maybe we could stop letting Corey Davis shoot. Same
thing as the day before. And it's very, very hard to stop good teams. The
better team you play, the harder it is to be an elite defensive team against
them. But I think it's a good trait to get better defensively as games go on.
I would much rather play great second half defense than first half.  
  
Now obviously sure we made some adjustments, but I think what would I tell you
is, more so our kids, I'm giving them the credit because as a team, as the
game goes on, our guys try to start to lock in on what a team is doing against
us, okay? And teams do different things because of the way we play defense and
our guys, as our guys start to lock into that, they play better. We have less
breakdowns and we're more -- and we're more maybe committed to getting the job
done. But I would think it's cerebral. Because we do play defense a certain
way that everybody else doesn't play it. But these guys have adjusted as the
game goes on. You saw it the last -- but they have done it most of the year.  
  
Q. Seems like you were really trying to keep Gray out of the lane.  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, you could say that, but what I would really tell you is, we
believe scorers need layups and free throws, okay. Shooters just need clean
looks. So as the game went on we eliminated their shooters; they didn't make a
three in the second half. But when they drove the ball, our guys showed great
discipline to stay on their feet and not go for shot fake after shot fake
after shot fake. Because they got good players. They're second in our league
in offense. They average a lot of points. What did they get on Wichita State
yesterday? 70-something. 80-something their first game here. Today they get
55.  
  
Q. We don't know who you're playing yet or where, you've gone out West I
think three of the last four years, do you think --  
MICK CRONIN: I just want a won a hundred bucks. I knew you were going to ask
me that.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. The fact that you're probably going to be a No. 2 seed.  
MICK CRONIN: I'm glad you know that. Let's hope you're right.  
  
Q. Does that earn you a closer place to home or what do you think about
that?  
MICK CRONIN: You're asking the wrong guy. You're asking the wrong guy. I'm
not, I'm not on the Selection Committee and I'm not nearly as smart as Jay
bill list, Jay Williams and Seth Greenberg. So those guys get paid for all
that, Joe Lunardi, what a job that guy's done, the career he's made for
himself. I got a lot -- I came from a working class family, dad had four jobs,
mom worked, I respect people that work their way up. So that's for Joe, Jay
and all the boys. I have no idea. Jerry Palm's great. You're asking the wrong
guy.  
  
Right now I'm worried about my team, I'm hungry, try to make sure everybody's
healthy and let's get home. I don't really have any comments on what I think's
going to happen, what I want to happen and when it comes out I'm just going to
worry about our opponent.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, congratulations.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Thanks, guys.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Jamal Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26844)

### [Kyvon Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34876)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 70, Memphis - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, it was a tale of two halves. We really played great the
first half and really because of Cincinnati's intensity in the second half, we
just didn't seem to match it when they started the second half. But really
proud of this group, proud of how they competed all year long, especially in
the last couple weeks. So, questions?  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach and the student-athletes,
please.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the a little bit more about the first half and you
shot 50 percent and seemed to get whatever, seemed to get or make whatever
shots you needed to make at whatever time.  
TUBBY SMITH: Yeah, when you make shots, things go a lot smoother and look a
lot easier and Jamal really got us off to a great start, and that was huge.
Again, I thought the -- we did the things we needed to do - we rebounded with
them, we did some things that period of time. In the first half we were really
moving the ball, really doing a good job of penetrating, and finding people
open. I thought we kind of got them back on their heels some because we
became, because we were making shots and attacking the basket. And that was
the difference.  
  
Again, even though we got to the free-throw line and made our free throws in
the first half, something we struggled a little bit in the second half with.  
  
Q. Jamal, what was that feeling like going into halftime and just
throughout the first half when you're kind of taking it to a really good team,
and then I guess what do you think went wrong especially early in the second
half when they went on a 21-2 run?  
JAMAL JOHNSON: It was a great feeling, going into the half strong. We had a
lot of momentum going into halftime, but Coach always tells us, like, the
halftime score is the most insignificant score. And we came out in the second
half just flat, we weren't focused, and we just didn't have the same amount of
energy they came out with and that's why they came back, stormed back with the
vengeance.  
  
Q. Jamal's performance in the first half, how happy are you to see a
performance like that at the end of the year kind of showing, it seemed like
he had a confidence and just a way about him that maybe he didn't have at the
beginning of the year. What did that tell you about him, that first half
performance?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, he's been starting quite a few games for us and Jamal, he's
had a bad shoulder most of the season and I know that affected his shot a lot.
In this game when you're a freshman, it takes a while to build up your
stamina, the endurance, the toughness you need to have. By this time last year
they were maybe two weeks ago he was probably done playing basketball in high
school.  
  
So maybe it added a couple games to him and the physicality of the game, I
thought that can wear you down. So I thought he went through a period during
the season there where that took a toll. But then everybody gets rejuvenated
when there's a new season, second half of the season, and post-season play.
And he's been working hard on his shot. Looking at his line, 5-for-5, 4-for-4.
Just an outstanding performance and certainly and that got us off to the great
start.  
  
Again, the second half was, as he said, we were a little flat coming out but a
lot of it had to do with just their intensity level and their, they just
raised their level of play.  
  
Q. What are some of the challenges preparing for a player like Gary
Clark?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, his versatility and his toughness. He can score around the
basket, and then he can put it on the floor. He's a nightmare as far as a
matchup is concerned. I thought that for the first half we were okay, but you
look down he was still 4-for-7, leading scorer and leading rebounder for the
half, and he was the guy that you know as long as he's not in foul trouble,
he's going to be -- it's just his physicality; he's relentlessly always going
after the ball. You got to box him out, you got to make sure that you get a
good -- almost have to hold him to get him to stop from going to the basket.
That's what makes him -- just his tenacity, just he's a hard worker and you
can tell he's a tough kid.  
  
Q. Obviously you've read and heard what's been said and this week about
your job security. Do you think you've coached your last game at Memphis?  
TUBBY SMITH: Who knows?  
  
Q. A follow-up, do you think you've done enough to earn an invitation to
the NIT this year?  
TUBBY SMITH: You know, we have had a tough -- we have lost some tough games
this year, some games that really hurt us. The East Carolina loss there, South
Florida loss late, but we have done some good things at the end of the season.
We really didn't beat anyone of significance, I guess you could say. But this
group has really come on to kind of overachieve to some degree. When you
picked to finish ninth in the league and we finish fifth, and we were one of
the final four teams in the tournament, so it might help.  
  
But I know there's a lot of good teams out there and certainly we would love
to be in it, but again, that's not our -- we have a lot to do with it. If we
had done what we were supposed to do, we would be in the big dance but we
didn't. So now it's just a matter of, I think we could, because we're playing
so well I think we would play well in it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Memphis, thank you.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [Rob Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34928)

### [Galen Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34945)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Houston - 77, Wichita State - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah, hard-fought game. Two good teams. They run a lot of good
stuff, we run a lot of good stuff. To tell you how hard it was, it was hard to
execute and get something easy. It came down to having players that could make
plays on their own. Rob Gray for us and Shamet. Shamet made some tough, tough
threes where their offense broke down and he could play outside the offense.
At 6'6" he could raise up over us and make some of those shots. But no, when
we were able to dictate him in the pick-and-roll and keep him on his left hand
we were a lot more successful.  
  
But everybody on our team has a role. They know their role. We challenge them
to be all-conference in their role. And they do a good job of that. Galen
Robinson had six assists, no turnovers today. And in a game like that, second
game in two days, that's pretty good.  
  
Rob Gray, I didn't like the way he started the game so I took him out but
Rob's one of those kids that always responds because he's a winner. Winners
sometimes they just need reminding, but I know what have there. You build a
culture and you get good kids that will fight and play hard, don't give in,
that's most important in a situation like this. And just proud of our guys'
effort. It's kind of a mundane thing to say, but I was, I was really, really
proud of how they fought today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. All season you've talked about the toughness and the kind of the
grittiness of this team. To see them reach down deep in those closing minutes,
what can you say just about them pulling it out?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: It wasn't just this game, any game for me. We're down 57-50
against SMU at home, I saw it then. We were down against Connecticut the other
day. We had a lot of blowouts this year, but if you play 30-plus games, you're
going to have about three or four on either side. Three or four where you're
probably not nearly as good as you play and you're probably going to have
three or four where you're probably not as bad as you play. That's just the
way it is, unless you got a team full of All-Americans and NBA guys, but we
don't have that.  
  
What we do have is a culture. Sometimes that's an overused, misunderstood
word. Our kids understand it. And that's what's important. Touching every line
in a suicide drill, line drill, being on time, going to class, treating people
with respect. Culture has a lot to do with everything in their lives, not just
basketball. I think karma comes into play there, too.  
  
So there was a calmness, a lot of poise, a lot of composure in our huddles
tonight. We knew exactly what we wanted to do. Rob and Galen made the biggest
play, or Rob made it and Galen finished it. They tried to get the ball
inbounds on the baseline and we took it way, so they wind up having to throw
it deep. And when you throw it that high, Rob Gray became Ronnie Lott. Do you
guys know who he is? Or Deion Sanders? Kind of a corner back/safety, just go
get it.  
  
Q. On a national stage like this and against an opponent like Wichita,
what does a win like this mean to your program?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, it's the second time we beat them, you know?  
  
Q. I know.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Okay, just wanted to make sure. You make a great point, that
this stage is different. I just think it's perception more than anything else.
People perceive you differently maybe. Because in our conference you hear a
lot about Cincinnati and Wichita State, Wichita State and Cincinnati. Well, we
tied with Wichita State this year; we both went 14-4.  
  
But we have a lot of respect for Gregg and his program and Mick and his
program. They're both outstanding coaches who have really, really good teams,
but we have got a good team too.  
  
Q. For the players, what does it mean to you guys to make it to the
championship game here?  
ROB GRAY: We just wanted to come here, take it one game at a time but it means
a lot because that's what we expected of ourselves and we had high
expectations. Once we lost at Memphis, we knew we fell out of contention to
win the regular season title or a share of it, so the only way to get that
back would have been to come down here and go on a three-game winning streak
and cut down the nets in the conference tournament.  
  
GALEN ROBINSON: To follow up what he said, what was the question?  
  
ROB GRAY: Can you repeat the question for my man. It's his first time.  
  
Q. To make it to the championship game?  
GALEN ROBINSON: Oh yeah, Coach preaches the culture and we let our culture
take over. Very excited to be playing tomorrow, very fortunate and just
looking forward to the game.  
  
Q. Galen, your dad played at Houston and you're a part of the
renaissance of the program. Talk about the pride you must feel being from
Houston and playing for the school that your father went to.  
GALEN ROBINSON: Definitely very prideful. I don't know if anybody loves
Houston more than I do, but I remember when Coach Sampson was recruiting me,
he sold me on the vision, and I bought into it and it's all coming to light,
so I'm just following the plan right now.  
  
ROB GRAY: To add on, I think for the city slogan that Galen created, that ties
in a lot. He really does love Houston and he created for the city, we play for
the city and we do it all for the city. So we're in the championship game for
the city. Shoutout to Galen for making that slogan.  
  
Q. Galen, can you take us through that last play on the inbounds that
they did exactly what you saw, what happened, and after that your part of the
pass that was intercepted at midcourt, and then I think you also helped alter
that last shot that they took at the buzzer.  
GALEN ROBINSON: Yeah, I blocked it (laughter). But as far as the pass to get
in, Coach told us to switch it one through four and he also tells us always
that our instincts take over. So that's what I did, I read his eyes, I read
his vision and in that kind of scenario he's not going to make a no-look pass.
So I saw where he was throwing it and I intercepted it.  
  
And as far as the one that Rob intercepted, I just knew I had to finish the
layup. And then for the shot I blocked, I knew that he had to, he had to shoot
it, he couldn't pump fake because there wasn't enough time. So I just jumped
as high as I could and tried not to foul him.  
  
Q. Rob, it seemed like in the second half all of a sudden things just
clicked for you. And it almost looked like it kind of became a more of a
streetball type of performance. You guys were taking over the game. What kind
of maybe ignited that for you when you started playing that way?  
ROB GRAY: Well, yesterday I went 0-for-5 from the three and then the first
half I went 0-for-3 from the three. So when the first one fell, it relieved me
of a lot of pressure, and I think that, I don't know the first three I hit I
think it put us up maybe one or two. So I kind of got my swag back from beyond
the arc. And like you said just kind of streetball, just instincts taking over
and just trying to play my game and be as effective and efficient as possible
to help us win.  
  
Q. For the players, coming in you guys were safe in terms of NCAA
Tournament, but how much would it mean not only if you win and complete this
tomorrow, you get a championship, but it almost takes everything off the
table, you don't have to rely on, are you an at-large or stuff like that, you
are an automatic bid.  
ROB GRAY: Like Coach said, in this conference you hear a lot about Cincinnati
and about Wichita State and we like to think that we have a good program as
well. And we know I think right now they're ranked 8th and 11th and we're
sitting at 21. But as far as seeding goes, it's a big deal to come down here
and make it to the championship and even win, because it just shows again it
changes the perception that maybe the Committee may have about our program and
the country.  
  
So it's a big deal and we're really looking forward to competing with
Cincinnati tomorrow.  
  
GALEN ROBINSON: He hit everything on the head.  
  
Q. Some quick thoughts on the matchup tomorrow against Cincinnati.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah, Gary Clark and Washington pose problems for us, like
Morris did today. We really had a hard time guarding them the second half. We
were leaking oil there. They were beating us on some things that were just a
little bit slow in our rotations, our bigs were maybe not in the right spot a
couple times. But Cincinnati's going to do the same thing. Clark and
Washington and then the other two bigs, Scott and Brooks off the bench, they
pose a problem. Evans is really playing well. And then the Broome kid, who
really wasn't a factor the first two games has really stepped up his game.
He's a good player.  
  
But it comes down to being able to rebound. For us to be a good rebounding
team, Davis has got to play better. Devin can play better. He was so good last
night, it was almost like he shot a 62 last night and followed it up with a 75
today, hopefully he can get back down in the mid-60s tomorrow. But it's going
to be a fight. It's another team we have played twice, either team can win
this thing. Both teams are going to be -- it's not going to be the toughest
team wins because both teams are tough. It's going to be the teams that your
best players have to step up and play well in a game like this tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Houston, thank you.

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Landry Shamet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32645)

### [Shaquille Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30385)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, that's a tough one to lose. I thought we played really
well in the second half up until the very end and we lost to a very good team.
That's all we were going to face in this tournament, we knew that, but we have
got to execute better down the stretch, that's on me, and need to make a
couple of free throws, and I think we could walk out of here with a win. But
we have got to execute better and make sure we call our timeouts, if we don't
have the option we're looking for on the out of bounds.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach and the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how tough Rob Gray was tonight.  
LANDRY SHAMET: Yeah, he's a good player, multidimensional. Especially when
he's shooting it well like he was tonight. But part of that is just on us not
really pressuring the ball enough. Not taking anything away from him, he's a
hell of a player, First Team All-Conference for a reason and we just didn't
defend him well enough and he made some big plays down the stretch, and we
knew that's what he does and credit to him.  
  
Q. For anyone, really, what was it that about the Houston defense that
made it tough to score in the first half?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, they're very aggressive. They were getting up in our
guards, it was very physical, they started calling the game a little
differently in the second half. It was much more, okay, let's clean it up. I
don't know why they decided at halftime they wanted to clean it up. So we
played one half kind of rough and tumble and the second half was more of,
let's clean it up.  
  
They're just a good defensive team. They're gritty, they're tough, they're
well schooled and they were knocking us off our cuts, they took the ball from
us a couple times. So their physicality certainly bothered us.  
  
Q. I know you just lost, but I know the last few years you've had some
issues with your seeding in the NCAA Tournament. Is that something you thought
about or expecting now that you're in a better conference now?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I really don't. I have no idea what to expect. We know we're
in. I would like to be positively surprised one year, but I don't anticipate
anything favorable, I just hope that we get a good draw and a good place to go
and we go play well and see how far that can carry us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Wichita State, thank you.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Thank you, guys.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 70, Memphis - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: First of all, I would like to congratulate Memphis on their
season. 21 wins with your best player breaking his foot midseason, and one guy
-- basically playing with two guys Rivers and Jeremiah Martin and everybody
else brand new. So I was there 10, 11 years ago, which I told Coach Smith this
summer we were talking about it.  
  
The only thing you can do in that situation is improve throughout the year and
that's what they had done, winning seven of their last eight and outplaying us
for a big portion of the game. So congratulations to Coach Smith and his
players. I thought that they got better all year and it's not easy to win;
they won 21 games. And they gave us a great fight today, they made us a better
team because of how hard they played and how physical they played and they're
very, very competitive.  
  
So it was a good win for us and hopefully we learned a lesson, that the other
team, no matter what their record and no matter what the situation may be,
especially -- tomorrow's going to be life and death against one of two great
teams, but next week in our first-round game I told our team, you have to
realize that team's coming to win. They're not going to care what your seed
is. Memphis had to win two more to get to the NCAA Tournament. Whoever we play
in the Tournament next week is going to have to win or they're going home. So
we have to understand that that's the type of intensity that we're going to
face.  
  
Now obviously tomorrow will be playing for a championship against a Top-20
team, so we understand that what's coming tomorrow. At least we better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes only at this
time.  
  
Q. Gary, can you talk about the first half shooting by Johnson and the
impact that that had on you guys as you went to the locker room at halftime?  
GARY CLARK: Well, coming into the game we knew that they had one guy that can
get hot, and we didn't follow the scouting report. Even if you're there, it's
not good enough. I think he hit four, maybe three or four in the first half.  
  
MICK CRONIN: He was 4-for-4.  
  
GARY CLARK: And when you let a guy like that just get comfortable, the rim
gets bigger and he lit it up. So second half we just tried to adjust, not let
him get comfortable looks and play together, know when you have him, don't
back away from him at all; make it a harder shot, make him take a harder shot.  
  
Q. Off of what Coach said, do you feel like you guys can take something
from the way you played in the first half moving forward?  
GARY CLARK: Yes, definitely. Like Coach said, no matter who it is, they're
going to come out with fire. They're not going to care the seeding or who is
on our team, doesn't matter, they're going to come out and try to get a W. A
lot of guys careers are ending slowly. So you got to expect a team that
they're not going to want to go home.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Yeah, I think you could learn a lot about this game, and life
in general honestly, because we have to show that we're grateful for this
situation and grateful to play this game because both of us, this is it for
us. So I think we have to show our gratefulness by hustling every possession
and making sure we know our assignments, getting it done on defense,
rebounding and it starts with both of us, it starts with me, it starts with
Gary.  
  
Q. For both of you guys: The 21-2 run when you guys got it going there
and the second half defense where they struggled to shoot 20 percent, that's
more of Cincinnati basketball. But the 21-2 run, what kind of impression did
that make on you guys?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: We have been in that situation before, to tell you the truth,
but we can't put ourselves in that situation. We have to come out from the
gate with the sense of urgency and just knowing our assignments, like I said
before. But we just have to come out with that sense of urgency like we're
down 10.  
  
Q. When you're down like that at halftime, how important is it to get
off to a fast start like that in the second half?  
GARY CLARK: It's very important. One thing we try to preach is the first five
minutes, if we're up or we're down. In the first five minutes usually it
determines how that game's going to go. We came out with fire. Coach said,
"Eye of the tiger." So we came out defensively and everybody was locked in and
knowing where the shooters were, rebounding the ball, keeping them from
getting second-chance opportunities.  
  
Q. Kyle congratulations on the win today. From a player's perspective,
what would you and your teammates, what would you like to do a little bit
better tomorrow than you did today?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Starting right from the beginning, not waiting to get in a
deficit, not waiting to dig ourselves a hole. Coming out, reminding each other
that this is what we're playing for and being on a mission honestly.  
  
Like I said, it starts with both of us. It starts with Coach, we have to do
what we have to do from the start.  
  
Q. Kyle, you're always a guy that plays with a lot of emotion but today
it seemed like you brought an even greater impact in that regard. Would you
say this is one of the most exciting games of basketball you've played?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Maybe.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Getting old, hard to remember.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I know, right. No, we have been in a lot of crazy atmospheres
through my career. It's been crazy but maybe. I'm just glad that we won and
I'm glad you asked that, because some people misinterpret that for cockiness,
and not just for me but a lot of players. I think that's just people being
grateful for the situation that you're in. Who gets to do this every day? We
are extremely blessed. So you have to put that in perspective.  
  
But that's just me being grateful for the game and grateful that I'm doing my
job and grateful that my team's doing their job. So that's all it is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes to the locker room and take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the first half what was going wrong, I guess at both ends and what
did you adjust at halftime?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, like I said this yesterday, guys, first of all, it's hard
to beat a team three times. They have won seven of their last eight. We're not
making shots. So we miss 18 shots and only get two offensive rebounds. The
stats will say three but Memphis knocked one out of bounds. Gary had two,
nobody else had one. But Memphis played really well. They have won seven of
their last eight. They made some really hard shots in the first half.  
  
Coach Smith has done a tremendous job weathering the storm. I mean, whose best
player breaks their foot and then you win seven of eight games? And then take
the No. 1 seed and a team 29-4 and put them on the ropes, with a bunch of guys
that weren't on your team last year. So you got to give them credit. Their
coaches, their players. They played great basketball in the first half. They
kept us off the backboard. It's not like we didn't try to rebound, they kept
us off the backboard.  
  
Sure, we don't want to ever come out, and the scouting report says Jamal
Johnson's a great shooter and he's 4-for-4 and it's a little late when you let
a guy get going like and you dig yourself holes it's hard to dig out of.
Fortunately, you can see by the answers of the two guys up here, you see why
we're 29-4. Just by listening to the things that they say and the kind of
people they are. It's hard for me to mess it up when you have two seniors that
are that intelligent and that good on the basketball floor, because they know
how to win games. So as the game goes on they change it.  
  
But the first half, sure I'm upset about things but Memphis played great and I
think it's wrong to say anything else.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
MICK CRONIN: Well, obviously I said we might not want to let Jamal Johnson
keep teeing it up, and thinking he's going to miss. I mean Jacob was all over
him to start the second half and his miss went halfway down and out. We were
talking, I mean he was starting to get the Reggie Miller rule of you got to
step into him and you can't even let him raise it up. When a guy's on fire
like that, you can make the adjustment, not let him shoot or you can let him
shoot you out of the tournament and you go home tonight.  
  
The other thing is, we had ten offensive rebounds or nine offensive rebounds
in the second half. We needed all nine of them to shoot 41 percent. So we
haven't shot the ball well down here. But that comes and goes. Three-point
shooting is like your high school girlfriend, it comes and goes.  
  
Q. How important is it to you to win this tournament? Do you care enough
about the final tomorrow?  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, I'm glad you asked that, do you know the two guys that just
left here? That's what this is about. I've been lucky and fortunate to coach
basketball at this level for a long time now. I think my 15th year as a head
coach, but it's Gary Clark and Kyle Washington's last chance to win a
conference tournament. They could have two games left in their college career.
So to think that we're not trying to win the game tomorrow -- the tournament,
winning the tournament, there's a game and they keep score for a reason. That
being said, Gary Clark and Kyle Washington have never cut down nets after a
game in their high school career or their college career, and we won the
regular season on the road. We didn't come home and do it because I want them
to be hungry to do it here. So if you're going to play, you play to win.  
  
Now if you're going to ask me what it matters to a tournament committee,
you're asking the wrong guy. I have no clue. It really shouldn't matter. This
one, we want to win the championship, for our school, for our program, but
mostly for our seniors.  
  
Q. Having said that, what is the message going into the game knowing how
badly these guys want to win it, just in terms of not putting so much pressure
on themselves?  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, I don't think that -- I'm going to be honest with you, and
because I give SMU and Memphis a lot of credit, I told them two things: One,
tomorrow will be World War III to get the win, because we know how good
Houston and Wichita State are.  
  
Two, we learned a lesson about our first-round NCAA Tournament game in the
last two games. The other team is going to try to win. Just because we beat
them handily both times in the regular season, I think we were in shock that
the other team actually came out with some confidence and wasn't afraid of us.
And neither team was afraid of us. And that's going to be the same next
Wednesday or next Thursday or Friday.  
  
Now tomorrow's a whole different story. Because I know that Wichita State and
Houston are far from afraid of us. Houston beat us last time and Wichita State
probably can't wait to play us. If I know anything about their players and
their coach, I'm sure that they can't wait to get ahold of us.  
  
So college sports is like life, if you put in great effort and you have a
great attitude and you're willing to work hard, you have a chance to win. If
the other guy outworks you, you got no chance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
MICK CRONIN: You got it. Thank you, guys.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Kareem Brewton Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34875)

### [Mike Parks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34907)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 67, Tulsa - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes and coach.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: It was certainly a clutch shot that Kareem Brewton made there at
the end. I thought our guys showed a lot of, again, courage and a lot of heart
and a lot of toughness. Good balanced scoring, good team effort all the way
around. Do a better job taking care of the ball. We have been okay, but
certainly I was impressed with Tulsa. We were pretty much controlling the game
there for a while, then they gained some momentum at halftime.  
  
But it was an impressive win for us and we're excited about advancing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. Kareem, can you just take us through that shot. Was that the plan,
was it just instinct? How did it all develop?  
KAREEM BREWTON: Yes, that was pretty much the plan. To have Kyvon and Jamal go
ahead and cross to distract those two going down, and then pretty much get the
ball on the curl and just go all the way to the basket. But Mike's man stepped
up, so I was like man it's like 0.5, so let's go ahead and just shoot it, so I
just shot it.  
  
Q. You said after that Temple game when you hit the buzzer beater there
that you practice that type of shot. Do you practice floaters from the three-
point line and all?  
KAREEM BREWTON: Pretty much I just looked to get any way to pretty much get
the ball in the hoop. That's all I do.  
  
Q. And then Mike, it was just a release as soon as that ball went
through. What was the celebration like?  
MIKE PARKS: Oh, it was definitely a good feeling. He already hit one of them,
so we trusted him to have the ball in his hand at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Kareem, did you have a sense when it was going in? Did you watch the
whole way? What was your feeling?  
KAREEM BREWTON: I watched it the whole way. I followed through on it, too, and
then I just followed it under the goal, and when it went in, I just seen
everybody just start screaming and running towards me, so.  
  
Q. Kareem, when you let go of the ball, how certain were you that is it
was going to go in?  
KAREEM BREWTON: I came off, it was just basketball instinct that you have when
the ball come off good, you feel like it's going to go in and that's what
happened. It went straight through the net.  
  
Q. Does something like this feel like -- I mean people are really
excited afterwards not only because it was a buzzer beater but was there more
to it than just one shot there, that release that your whole team had?  
MIKE PARKS: Yeah, it felt good, because obviously we won and we know we can do
it. So like we just have faith in each other. And it brings more confidence to
the team as we keep going on. So it was a very exciting feeling.  
  
Q. Kareem, the whole last stretch it was five junior-college players who
were on the court together and does it say something about what y'all are
capable of? Sometimes you take heat for being from junior college, does it say
something that you were out there winning that game?  
KAREEM BREWTON: I feel like as we're on the court, pretty much most of us went
through two years of junior college, and pretty much when you get to this
level, pretty much all you got is heart. You're trying to show everybody that
just because you go juco don't mean you could play at that level.  
  
Q. Coach, for you, I saw you after the game, how good does this feel?
Obviously you guys, you played well for much of the game, to advance to the
semi-finals, what sort of accomplishment is this for this group?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, we have been playing well for a while. Seven out of eight
games, six out of seven something we won, so other than the hiccup we had at
home, I thought we were playing about as well as we had all year long, and
this is the time of year that -- we knew with so many new players it was going
to take a lot of time to, more time than we expected, but once the guys
continued to believe and trust in the system, trust in what we're trying to do
and the process. We have a lot of talent, as I said before, we got a very
talented group. We did have one of the top recruiting classes in the league
and it just takes a while for people to adapt.  
  
We're happy and we're pleased with the performance. There's a lot of things
that we have to improve on between now and tomorrow. So we're always concerned
about the next best thing, next best action, that's part of coaching and
that's what we do.  
  
Q. Cincinnati gave a lot of teams fits this year, obviously they gave
you guys fits, just looking ahead to that game, what do you guys think you
guys need to do to be able to pull off an upset there?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, you're right, we got to take care of the ball. Obviously
they're one of the top teams in the country defensively. I think they are one
or two as far as field-goal percentage defense, forcing turnovers. They remind
me a lot of West Virginia and the way they attack you physically and that's
what we have to be concerned about, being physical, just taking care of the
basketball, fighting the pressure, because they're going to, and Mick Cronin
they play a system, that switching defense that's very -- makes you go to your
second, third, fourth options. So you have to be very patient and really work
the ball around to get the best shot.  
  
That takes a lot of experience, but I like that our guys have got a lot of
experience. These guys have now -- when we recruited them they had about 60,
70 games under their belt. Now they got another, what, 33 now under their
belt. So they have had a lot of games under their belt. So I expect them to
perform well and compete hard against the Bearcats.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to what you just mentioned about this team growing
together and playing well now, going into this tournament did you sense that
they would be able to make a run here and make some noise?  
TUBBY SMITH: Oh, yeah. Yeah, we, I felt we were, we won four in a row and I
knew we had something going on and guys were starting to really, they have
been believing all year long. It's just that I think guys now accept it that,
hey, this is my role and I'm making the right decisions and I'm making the
right sacrifices. And that's hard to do when you've been a star at your
previous school. Now Coach is asking me to give up this and give up that, it's
hard.  
  
I don't know, that's why I got the most respect for this group of young men
and how they've responded, with a lot of distractions.  
  
Q. Tied basketball game, you were up by one at halftime, what did you
talk to the players about at halftime?  
TUBBY SMITH: What did I talk about? We talked about taking care of the
basketball because I think we had like, we had quite a few turnovers at
halftime. We had 13 turnovers. That was the No. 1, that was the No. 1 thing we
talked about.  
  
The other thing is, because I thought we were rebounding the ball well and
they ended up outrebounding us. Things we know we had to do and continue to
do. I mean, we were defending our butts off, as we were holding them to just
only, what, 37 percent, well, actually they were 0-for- 9. So we wanted to
take away the three and we wanted to continue to do that, and I thought we did
a good job of that in the second half.  
  
And they did some good things to get back in the game, to get themselves with
their 1-2-2, three-quarter press. Made us take time and but I was really
impressed with our guards and Malik, Kareem, Jamal, made shots. We've made
some good decisions in the second half and we cut back even though we had 18
turnovers, we only had five in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Memphis, thank you.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: All right, thank you.

THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: You never know how these tournament games are always going to
go. I applaud our guys for their focus, being ready to play. We had our senior
game Sunday against Connecticut. We took Monday off, and then we kind of
flushed the regular season down the toilet and we said, hey, 24-6 is nice, but
if you come up here and lose your first game, nobody's going to remember some
of that stuff. So we got to make sure we go in with the right attitude.  
  
One thing I've enjoyed about this group is our senior leadership, spearheaded
by these two guys sitting to my left. And their ability to focus on
preparation. We try to be as prepared as we can, mainly because this is such a
well-coached league. Hats off to Coach Dawkins at UCF. I've never seen his son
play but I heard so many great things about him, I know how good Tacko could
is, losing B.J. Taylor, for him to have the kind of year they had losing those
guys, hats off to Coach Dawkins. They had a great year considering all the
adversity they had to face.  
  
But just happy with my team. You get this time of year, you got to win to
advance, and good win. Now we'll get ready for tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Midway through the first half you guys kind of got into a rhythm and
pushed things and kind of spread things out a little built. Can you talk about
that stretch there?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Because we played, we're familiar with the teams, there's
certain matchups that we like, that we try to go at certain matchups. We
talked about getting certain players in foul trouble before the game. I think
that was the last thing we talked about before we went on the floor. But the
key to that was getting Devin in a groove early. We specifically went to him
early. He's got a sweet spot on that baseline. We tried to get him as many of
those shots as we could early just to get him some confidence going.  
  
But UCF came out and hit some tough shoots, too. I think their first three
makes were threes. Two of them were tough shots. One of them was a defensive
breakdown. But they made two tough shots. When Galen is locked into playing
with pace and we have good spacing with Armoni and Corey and Rob's attacking
off middle pick-and-rolls with pace, our unselfishness really helps us. We
move the ball pretty good. We have had games this year where we have had 31
assists. So we have an unselfish team and when we move the ball and don't care
who scores, that's when we're at our best.  
  
Q. Obviously B.J. Taylor and Davis are the head of the offensive attack
for them; they combined went 9-for-23. Talk about what you guys did to slow
them down.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah, the big thing with A.J. just watching them last night, I
came over last night and watched East Carolina, with him it's just loading to
the ball, making him see bodies. He's got the ball, it's not the guy in front
of him, it's everybody else. We want to have four guys inside the paint so he
has nowhere to drive.  
  
And the thing the key for guarding Taylor is getting our bigs up to the line
of scrimmage. That's our terminology for pick-and-roll defense. Our bigs have
to get up and stay in a stance and string him out. And then our guard has to
get back in front. Actually B.J. didn't hurt us tonight in the pick-and-roll,
he hurt us from the three-point line. He made the one at the end of the first
half, and made a couple more.  
  
But the other thing was keeping him off the free-throw line. He's really,
really good at getting to the free-throw line. So a big part of our game plan
was containing him in pick-and-roll and keeping him off the free-throw line. I
thought our guys were outstanding in that, in both of those game plan points
tonight.  
  
Q. For both of you: Last two years you guys came here it was one and
out. Any talk this week or was there anything said in terms of maybe getting
over that hump and making a run this weekend?  
DEVIN DAVIS: Yeah, that started with the preparation. Us talking in practice,
remembering how we came last year and lost to UConn. So we just really wanted
to prepare, have intense practices and make sure everybody was locked in for
40 minutes.  
  
ROB GRAY: Yeah, just all about preparation. We went 0-2 in this game the last
two years, and we just wanted to make sure that we would not lose the first
round game in the AAC Tournament. And we just came out and wanted to hit them
in the mouth first, and not let up for 40 minutes. And that's what we tried to
do and now we're on to the next round. So super proud of my guys for coming
and winning the first game.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Wes said the first year doesn't count? Yeah. We won the first
game the first year. That doesn't count? My fault. My fault. We lost is the
story, right? My fault. I mean that one counts, right?  
  
Q. It counts.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: But not as much as the other ones. So we're 2-2 in the first
round here. Come on now. But I'll leave it on this, this was the first game
all year I felt pressure. It has nothing to do with losing the last two years,
it's because at the game of the century ceremony celebration Jim Nantz walked
up to me and said, put his arm around me and said, "Kelvin, I've never ever
had the honor of broadcasting my alma mater's game, basketball." He said, "CBS
is doing the semi-finals this year, so I'm going to respectfully ask you to
make sure that you guys win your first game and get to Saturday." It's all
good now. Pressures off.  
  
Q. To both of you, obviously you guys still have a lot you want to
accomplish this season but given that it is your senior year, how rewarding
has it been to have the kind of season that you're having?  
ROB GRAY: Extremely rewarding. It's some of the foundations that Coach Sampson
recruited us on, and to see them all coming true and to see a shift in this
program, the direction that it's going all due to our senior class, it's just
an amazing feeling. And I'm just looking forward to where the program is going
in the next few years and the recruits to come.  
  
DEVIN DAVIS: Yeah, going off of what Rob said, it's like we're just building
the ground for the next team and the next team after that coming in. So it's
fun, especially with this team and having Coach Sampson, it's just a lot of
fun and we're not done yet.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Houston, thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Rashard Kelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32698)

### [Landry Shamet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32645)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Wichita State - 89, Temple - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach and then
take questions for the student-athletes and coach.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Great game, two great teams. Three times we've played them,
they're all like that. At least it didn't go into overtime or come down to a
buzzer beater. But tremendous respect for Coach Fran Dunphy and his kids and
how hard they play. They're hard to guard. Thank goodness we made enough shots
and plays to win the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions, please.  
  
Q. Landry, can you just tell me how you were feeling it tonight,
especially as you hit those first few shots in the first half?  
LANDRY SHAMET: I was just taking what was coming to me. I got a couple good
looks early on and that's my mindset every night, just take what comes to me,
don't force anything and guys were getting me open looks, and I was just
trying to step into them and knock them down. That's what I did.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it do you think that -- I'm sure you've watched some
film of Temple games where they're just not nearly the team that they were in
the three times that you guys have played. What is it about this matchup that
seemed to bring out the best in Temple?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I think you have to ask them that question. We certainly do
bring out the best in them and I watch every game film that is put on my
computer, which is quite a lot, and I think, okay, man, sometimes they play
like that and sometimes they don't. But that's a lot of teams. You can't play
at peak efficiency all the time. Our team doesn't; no team does. You watch
Villanova or Virginia.  
  
The bottom line is they make shots against us and we have got to do a better
job of pressing up and getting into their shooters because tonight they go 46
percent but in the first half they're 58 percent. And in our place last time
they made 11 threes in the first half, and their high for the season prior to
that was 12. And they make 16 for the game.  
  
So again, just a lot of respect for their shooters, the way they can drive it,
and create, as well as shoot it from deep. Brown makes shots against us, but
Shizz Alston and Rose and the other guys, I mean last game it was Perry. He
has 14 threes on the year but he makes six at our place, so of his 14.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about how this tournament, your first time in
the AAC Tournament has been different than previous tournaments for you
guys?  
GREGG MARSHALL: You want me to do that? Different? In what way?  
  
Q. Just the atmosphere, the teams, the program.  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, it's mostly Shocker fans, we're used to that. We would
have five to seven thousand, depending upon the year, travel to St. Louis.
Obviously St. Louis is a little bit closer, seven hours from Wichita. I don't
know how many people are out there now but it's got to be about 75 percent
Shocker fans at least. So we're used to that. We probably don't have that many
because of the flight and it's a long drive, a couple days.  
  
But we have great support and our guys, we have come close to winning two
championships. Cincinnati got us Sunday, and they won the regular season; they
certainly deserved it. And then we were one possession away from winning a
championship in Maui and kind of gave that one away. So we need to finish to
win a championship, and we haven't done that yet this year. So our guys to my
left and some of those guys in the locker room did what they needed to do
tonight to beat a very good team, a team that's beaten tremendous teams
throughout the course of the year.  
  
Q. When you made a run there late in the game you had quite a few
reserves on the floor contributing, Reaves and I can't remember the other guy.
But talk about contributions off your bench tonight and what a difference that
made.  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought Austin was good. In his 19 minutes, he has 13 points
but 8-of-10 from the foul line. Darral Willis was really good offensively in
the first half. And then Markis McDuffie is one of our core players, but Zach
Brown starts and they share the minutes.  
  
So we usually get great contributions from our bench. Tonight it was 27-17 in
the points, and I think we're 10 or 11 deep. That's a good thing. It gives us
a little flexibility. C.J. Keyser was the other guy that was going in there to
give Landry a blow on the defensive end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Wichita State, thank you.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Thank you, guys.

### [Tim Jankovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20496)

### [Ben Emelogu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25951)

### [Akoy Agau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34866)

### [Jahmal McMurray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30581)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 61, SMU - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach, and then take
questions for the student-athletes and Coach.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: Okay, opening statement: It's just, it's the opposite of
yesterday, for our seniors. I always just feel like losses in tournaments and
all are first and foremost about the seniors. I remember clearly how it felt
when things come to an end or dreams are not realized. So that's where it
always starts with me, and just I appreciate these two guys so much and then
times 100,000 I appreciate them because of what they went through. Neither one
of them had even remotely what you would call a normal career. They had more
adversity than any 600 people. And I won't get into it. It would take hours to
tell the story, but so amazing, really. And my heart goes out to them.  
  
And of course Jahmal up here, the rest of our team, very proud of them, not in
the sense of we want moral victories. I never feel great with when we lose,
never, but given the odds, given that we start -- it's like we start the
season with three injured players because we're on probation, like who starts
with three injured players? We have less and then I think we had what six or
seven guys injured during the season miss games. I think we probably missed a
hundred games, if you add up all the guys, what they missed, I think we're
almost at a hundred, if you can believe that. And to still -- at the end, I
mean I just think it shows great character, and that's why I'm so appreciative
that I get to coach young men with outstanding character. Believe me, there's
a lot of coaches not that lucky in the country and I happen to be one of them.  
  
So I wish things would have turned out much better, I wish we could have had
the team, our team, or the team that we started the school year with. I wish
that team was here to play. I wish that for these guys. I wish that for all
the guys. With you but you know what, life doesn't always go as planned.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions, please.  
  
Q. When it became obvious that Akoy was hurt, it looked like on the
first possession he was already struggling, did you do anything differently
and say, okay, we got to try something else?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Yeah, I got a little more religious at that point. I tried to,
that doesn't always help, but that was the first thought. But you know, you
tweaked it right away, right? Tweaked it, he had been up since the crack of
dawn trying to make sure he could play today and he got to a point, he was
still obviously not full speed and then he tweaks it on the first play, and
then my gosh, I mean -- but it's very, it had to happen because this is our
season right here. You're looking at our season.  
  
Last time we played Cincinnati Ethan sprained his ankle in shootaround. No
joke, shooting, okay? So now he's sprained it here and we're already three
down on probation, and we're already three guys out for the season, and we
already got two guys playing hurt and it's like why not? Let's just have
another one. Let's just have a guy get hurt on the first play of the game who
played his tail off.  
  
And I want to say this again, this is important to me, I basically said it
yesterday but I want to say it again, because I know the frustration, I do,
and if you've never been injured, then it's hard to really grasp this, but he
-- let's start down here since you asked about him, he's a great talent. I
mean, no one's had more injuries in major college history than he has. Had he
been a healthy guy, no one knows what might have happened. Look how well he
played yesterday. He looked like a million bucks and he's playing with about
three days of practice in the last six months, he's playing on one leg, he's
got -- I mean, but he's getting healthier. But just how frustrating it would
be to know your real game is here and you're playing here (Indicating).  
  
Agau obviously starts the year, he's incredible, I think he's leading the
nation in three-point shooting, if I'm not mistaken. We never brought it up;
we didn't want to jinx you, you know? But we noticed, okay. So playing his
tail off and then he gets a wrist injury and now he can't shoot a ball from
the three-point line for weeks and weeks and weeks. So basically we're playing
with Agau playing left-handed and how frustrating is that?  
  
So it was well documented that the guys that aren't playing, Shake, Jarrey,
Everett, they're not able to play, they're done, but what wasn't documented
because we don't want to give the other team a scouting report, is these guys
can barely practice and when they are in the game, they're not who they really
are and that is, it just kills me because I know, I know what that feels like
and that's, that is sheer misery. That's sheer misery. And they didn't deserve
it. I can tell that you for sure.  
  
Q. You guys feel like you kind of left one out there tonight? A lot of
maybe self-inflicted miscues, like the shot-clock violations, missed dunk,
various things. Do you feel like it got away from you a little bit?  
BEN EMELOGU: I thought we played hard. They do what great teams do, grind it
out, find a way to win. I think it was nothing that -- mistakes happen in a
game and it happened, but I think we played our hearts out. I think we played
hard and I think we left it all out there. They just did what great teams do
and they find a way to win.  
  
Q. What happened on that technical foul at the end?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I was pointing out, as kindly as I possibly could, I was
looking at the scoreboard saying that our opponent had two fouls for the
entire half and were pressing and playing pressure defense, and we had far
more than that and we were playing in a zone. And normally just in basketball
theory if you zone, one of the reasons you do that is because it really cuts
down on the fouls and one of the reasons that you like press and pressure and
play physical is you're willing to live with the fouls. And all I was trying
to do was just point out that it was 19-2 in the free-throw shooting. And I
just, I didn't mean it in a mean way, I just thought it was extremely ironic
because normally the zone team will foul far less.  
  
So really I was just pointing out some irony and not criticism at all and
maybe they took it as criticism, but I was, I just saw the irony in the
moment, that's all. And so I just was pointing out the numbers and the free
throws, that we shot two for the entire game and they shot 19. And in no way
does that mean that it wasn't just, who am I to say that? I was just saying,
isn't this ironic? And so it was very ironic to me.  
  
Q. How do you try to neutralize a team with the same size that
Cincinnati on the offensive boards?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Well, the first thing that you would do if your first goal is
to try to negate a great offensive rebounding team is to play man-to-man.
Because at least you have, have you a matchup block-out, and you're
accountable for your guy. That's the first step. And anybody that's been
following us, we have played about how many possessions of man in the last
five or six weeks? We have not had the ability to do that. We don't have the
numbers. We have got seven people, some playing hurt, some that are not as
mobile, so we had to make that choice that we had to become a zone team, and
when you do that, rebounding is far more difficult.  
  
But then if you look around the country and you look at zone teams, let's say
Syracuse is the famous zone team, right so what's the difference between
Syracuse's zone and our zone, and I would say four and a half inches at every
position probably. They recruit to that zone. They play 6'5", 6'6", 6'8",
6'9". So they play a gigantic zone which allows them to negate rebounding.
We're playing our starting lineup is 5'11, 6', 6'2" \-- are you five or six? I
want to give you every inch. Five or six?  
  
BEN EMELOGU: Five.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: 6'5", so we go 5'11, 6', 6'2", and 6'2", 180 pounds by the way,
and 6'5" and then Akoy in the middle and that's not, that is not a team that
you want to go zone for 40 minutes. But when you don't have a choice, then you
got to pick your poison and say, well, if we foul, if we foul out. If we have
got some matchup issues that we can't overcome, then we made that choice to
try to get better and better from zone defense and without question, I mean,
we knew, we talked, it was probably the No. 1 thing we talked about is, we
just have to keep trying to rebound better out of the zone. But it's not an
easy thing, trust me, when guys are flying in from everywhere and you're
trying to run some people off the line as well, because you can't let people
shoot H-O-R-S-E shots against a zone or you're just going to get torched. So
you extend and you leave a small little group in here with guys crashing the
boards. It's not easy. It's really not easy.  
  
So but we had to pick our poison. We had to pick our poison. That was the
poison we picked as opposed to fouling out and having some matchup issues that
we would not have been able to cover up. So given our situation, we felt like
that was the best we could do.  
  
And I don't like playing zone by the way but it was out of necessity.  
  
Q. Ben and Akoy, you guys had to go up against Kyle Washington and Gary
Clark tonight, from a game-plan perspective and just a difficulty challenge,
how do you face up against those guys?  
BEN EMELOGU: Well, Kyle you don't want to get to his right shoulder. Seems
like every shot he throws up with his left hand it goes in. So that's one
thing we tried to do. And Gary Clark is just a dog, he's a junkyard dog. Does
whatever his team needs to do to win the game, and you just got to try to
contain that as much as possible. I think we did that. I think we frustrated
him a little bit throughout the game.  
  
And it was just hard to keep them off the boards and late in the game they
just got in the paint and they started hitting shots and they grinded out a
win.  
  
Q. Coach, if you're offered a NIT Tournament bid would you accept?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Sure. Of course. Absolutely. A hundred percent. Yes. And who
knows, the health of our team by then, you know, so but regardless,
absolutely. Certainly before all the health issues we were, if you believed
the projections, which I really try to ignore, but people don't allow me to
ignore. All my friends are constantly texting me what they find out and I
can't tell them I don't want to know, but before the injuries we were a four
or five seed. We had three top-15 wins. We were right where these guys would
hope to be. We were ahead of where maybe we could expect to be with only three
returning players, and then the bottom dropped out with the injuries and of
course we would accept a hundred percent, yes.  
  
Q. Big theme at the beginning of the season was the youth of this
roster. When you look back, how did all the freshmen on the team progress?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I thought they did a great job. It's sad given the injuries.
Everett being a freshman he missed out on a lot of time he would have gotten
as well. That would have really helped his progression, and he was really
continuing to improve and get better and better and earn some more time, and
obviously a really good rebounder that would have helped with one of the
questions here.  
  
Being a freshman, it is funny, a lot of high school guys, they think it's
going to be completely different than it is, their perception is a lot
different -- now every now and then, don't get me wrong, there's some freshmen
that can just, they just kind of have it, they just have got a lot of things
that are ready or college ready, but it's certainly not everybody. So it was
great from that standpoint.  
  
They're going to have a complete, much better understanding of what they have
to do spring, summer, fall, to be a high-level Division-I player and not just
a guy. So I think it was really valuable, but would I have hoped for all these
injuries? No, no, I wouldn't, we would not. We had a nice progression going,
bringing people along, and to speed that up was really not in the plans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: SMU, thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

### [Corey Henderson Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34906)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 67, Tulsa - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions.  
  
FRANK HAITH: First of all, I want to congratulate Memphis. They played hard. I
thought our guys, we just didn't shoot the ball well, and we really have been
a good free-throw shooting team all year, and I think the game was lost on the
line, we missed 13 free throws.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Could you kind of talk about, I know you talked about the struggles
from the free-throw line, but could you kind of talk about the struggles from
behind the arc too, today?  
FRANK HAITH: Yeah, well, you know, I'm not going to make excuses for anything,
but we get in 7:00 this morning for about 20 minutes in the gym. So when you
get a bye, you don't get opportunities to get in. But we didn't shoot the ball
well, we had some really good looks, we just didn't knock any of them down.
And so it's unfortunate but we had some really, really good looks, we just
didn't knock any down.  
  
Q. Could you just kind of talk about how you saw the last play
unfolding?  
FRANK HAITH: Well, we probably should have came up, I think the wing on that
side, and we told our guys to come up and we backed up and he made a tough
shot. He made a really good shot. Give him credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Would you assess where you are at this point of the season.
Obviously the Tournament run ends here, but certainly more to play for
potentially.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Well, I hope so. I'm hoping that we will get support to play in
post-season and this team has won -- we finished fourth in the league, like
The American, I would hope that our run here at the end of the year would be
beneficial in terms of us getting into the NIT. And that's the hope.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Corey, same question, given maybe expectations what they might
have been externally, how you took that internally and turned that into what
looks like a pretty successful season.  
  
COREY HENDERSON JR.: I thought that these last I think we were 8-10? 8-10? I
think that we were pretty good, but I mean we lost this one and this one's all
the marbles, and so we're just going to hopefully get that bid into the NIT,
and hopefully the Committee they select us in and hopefully we get to
participate.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tulsa, thank you.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Shizz Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34921)

### [Quinton Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34922)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Wichita State - 89, Temple - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we had three real good games against Wichita State. I
thought we played well in each of them. I think they are a really good
basketball team. They're a really good basketball program. A lot of veteran
guys out there. They made some veteran plays at the right time.  
  
I thought our guys did a really good job. I'm proud of them, proud of how hard
they played, proud of the fact that there was no give-up in them and we had
our chances. We needed to make another shot. We needed to get a better
rebound. We needed to get that loose ball that was out on the court for
whatever reason and but I'm proud of our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned there at the end you needed one more shot, one
more rebound. Every time you got up to them, you couldn't make the play, is it
just one play that is the momentum that puts you over the top in that second
half?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think there are a number of plays in today's game. Sometimes
games change on a play, the momentum totally changes. But we had an
opportunity at the rim late, we had a three opportunity late. Some of those
things would have maybe given us a better chance to win the game. But we
needed stops at the other end as well, and they made the requisite number of
shots that they needed. And we probably put them on the foul line a little bit
too much as well. I thought we were a little bit too risky on some of our
plays in the body of the game, not necessarily at the end. I think we put them
on the line too many times.  
  
Q. Quinton, you've been in a little bit of a shooting slump for the last
couple weeks, and then you broke out of it tonight. Anything that worked,
started working?  
QUINTON ROSE: I think it was just better shot selection.  
  
Q. Shizz, every time you did get close it seemed like either Shamet on
outside had the answer or you had to deal with Shaq inside. How was the
difficulty in just those two guys, what they did from the outside and inside
and then setting the other guys up?  
SHIZZ ALSTON: They're hard to guard. They're good players and Shamet got hot
early and Shaq was a beast down low, but we should have denied Shamet early so
he couldn't get that hot start. But they're good players, so it was tough to
match up against them.  
  
Q. Quinton, for long stretches in that second half you were carrying the
team. A, did you start feeling it? And B, did you feel that you would have to
do that to get this team back in the game?  
QUINTON ROSE: No, I just saw the opening, like getting to the basket, getting
out in transition, and I saw it was helping the team, so I kept doing it.  
  
Q. Shizz, I know you guys had only one thought of NCAA, but any thought
on thinking you should be in the NIT right now?  
SHIZZ ALSTON: No, I haven't even thought about NIT, but we lost some tough
games, but I feel like when they look at our body of work and see us play our
best basketball, we're still one of the top teams out here. So hopefully they
can look at our good games and try to forget about our bad ones.  
  
Q. Coach, that run by Quinton in the second half, when he had 12 or 14
in a row, something like that, is there anything that you could have done to
prolong that? Did they do something to turn it off that quickly?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, obviously they're going to set their defense to try to
knock him out of that rhythm that he was in, but he did a great job in that
stretch and got us to where we needed to be. Again, we needed probably a
little better effort on the defensive end, just a little smarter, a little
more understanding of where to be position-wise.  
  
But he's a really good player and he's going to be an even better player as
the years go on.  
  
Q. Shizz and Q, can you guys just talk about how the amount of Wichita
State fans impacted the game, if it had an impact on you guys.  
QUINTON ROSE: Early it had an impact - it felt like we were back at Wichita
for a second, but as the game went on I just tuned them out, and I think the
team did a good job of tuning them out.  
  
SHIZZ ALSTON: Yeah, I agree with that.  
  
Q. How tough is it for your guys to keep pace and keep pace but just
can't get over the hump there it seemed like the whole game?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, we're used to that, playing these guys. I thought we were
-- when the first game that we played at our place and we got over the hump
late, that was terrific and we played -- we had the hump on our side most of
the game at Wichita State, we just didn't finish it.  
  
Today we obviously got behind a little bit early and but I loved our fight, I
loved how we were hanging each and every moment, and got it back to three I
think late and just needed another basket. We needed another stop. We just
want to play another game, that's all. We just want to not stop playing, and I
want that for these guys especially for not these two, I want it for them,
too, but more for our seniors who have had great careers and done great work
for Temple, and if we can keep on playing that will be great.  
  
Q. I was curious about sort of the adjustments defensively. It seemed
late you did start doubling maybe Shamet up higher but it took a while for you
to make that?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, we did blast him a little bit more in the second half, but
even the last shot of the first half was just a killer shot that we didn't
think about that at that time, but that would have been obviously something we
might have been able to do as well. But he got some great shots, and we lost
him and sometimes we lost him, and it was our poor defensive play. We lost
sight of him and the way he started, you can't lose sight of him.  
  
But we did make a few changes in the second half. But like a kid like Kelly
comes in and does some great, great work for them. He drove the one ball right
to the rim and dunked it, and he made the foul shots when he needed to as
well. So they have a good team and I thought their team played well.  
  
Q. How important would the NIT be for Quinton and the other sophomores
and the freshmen?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think it's of great importance and we would love to be in it.
We would love to be in it. So I think any time you can keep on playing, it's a
wonderful thing. These guys' careers go so quick, you want to see them play as
many games as possible.  
  
Q. There was a period when you took this program to the sixth straight
Tournaments, you were knocking off Top-10 teams, unfortunately you missed the
Tournament four of the last five years. What would you say has changed in the
last five years, and how do you sort of currently evaluate the program and
maybe your role moving forward?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, I appreciate that, and the last two years we haven't made
the Tournament. I didn't think we were the healthiest team last year, I
thought we had a couple of injuries to include Josh Brown, to include Trey
Lowe, which would have gotten us over the hump a little bit.  
  
But I love our freshmen, every one of the four of them is going to be terrific
college basketball players. I love where we are that way. So the one year that
we went to the NIT and we thought we had done enough in our body of work to
get into the NCAA as well.  
  
But I think our program is very, very good. We got into a new conference as
well. And that's probably as difficult a situation as we find ourselves in,
but it's a terrific, terrific conference and we need to play better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Temple, thank you.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Thanks.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [A.J. Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25114)

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Houston - 84, UCF - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, Houston's a very good basketball team and I thought they
got off to a fast start. That's difficult in the first day, but they have so
many guys that are capable of making shots and they did. You have to tip your
hat to what they were able to do, getting off to a good start.  
  
I thought our guys, as always, competed, gave a winning effort. I just thought
that it was hard to sustain that for 40 minutes at the level they were and at
the pace they were playing. So I thought we got a little bit tired in the
second half, trying to keep playing catchup, and but that's a credit to them
for keep their foot on the gas. Their guys were running hard, cutting hard,
and they played really good basketball tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. I know it's a little fresh, but with all the injuries and everything
that happened this season what's kind of your overall assessment of the year
you guys had?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I haven't had the opportunity to really look at it yet.
Our season is just coming to an end at the moment. But I said it all season
long, as we faced the adversity I'm just really proud of our guys. I loved
coaching this team because every night they gave us a winning effort, and
that's what you want to see from your players. Result may not have always been
what we wanted, but the effort was always there and the intent was always the
right intent, and that was to represent our university at the highest level on
the court and I think they did that.  
  
Q. B.J., in that second half with A.J. in foul trouble, how much did you
feel that you needed to take that game over?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I just wanted to lay it all on the line for my team. In that
second half it was the last 20 minutes to try to make the NCAA Tournament, so
that's the only thing that was going through my mind was just leave it all out
there on the floor for my team and my brothers.  
  
Q. B.J., A.J., can you guys talk about the gut check of like runs that
they were responding with. You guys came out at halftime, you hit a three, and
then you guys knocked down another basket, and then they come back with a
flurry. What was the feeling kind of with the team after those runs were
happening?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I think that like Coach said, you got to give them credit, every
time we made a run they did, they were mature and they responded. We had some
defensive lapses that we wish we could have had back, but you got to give them
credit for making the plays that they made and that's why they're a top-25
basketball team.  
  
Q. You said your season over for now, do you think this team has played
its way into a post-season tournament of some kind?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I think we have, but that's not for me to decide. But I
think our guys have had a really good season, and I think they're deserving of
continuing to play. But like I said, that's not my decision. That's going to
be decided elsewhere, and that's why we're just waiting to find out what's
going to happen with our basketball season.  
  
Q. A.J., what were the emotions stepping off the court after the game
when you checked out for the final time?  
A.J. DAVIS: A little bit of everything. One heck of a year and proud of our
team, proud of our guys, proud to be a part of this organization and this
community, this university, and just sad that it ended like that, but just
proud of everything that we accomplished over this year.  
  
Q. A.J., as you checked out saw you consoling Dayon. Could you take us a
little bit into what you tried to do, tried to tell him?  
A.J. DAVIS: Yeah, just that there was more basketball to be played, whether
for him and for me there is more, more basketball, more life, it's not the end
of the world. I didn't want him to feel like he let me down as a senior
because I feel like all our whole team gave it everything they got and they
always put everything on the line for me and our team. Guys like B.J., Dayon,
our whole team, I could go down the line gave it everything they got through
anything that we went through this season, ups and downs.  
  
So I just told him to keep his head up, just keep his head up and continue to
grow as a person, a man, a basketball player, and there was more to life than
just this game; that it's not the end of the world.  
  
Q. A.J., as a senior, and might be your last game here in Orlando, would
you like to see a little bit of a better crowd tonight of Knights fans here?  
A.J. DAVIS: Yeah, I think our crowd does a great job. If it was up to me, I
would like to see the whole thing packed with UCF fans, the whole entire
arena. But our fans are loyal and have supported me and this team as long as
I've been here. So we have great fans, and I think they always do a great job
of supporting us and showing us love.  
  
Q. As a senior, how much are you actually hoping that you do get a
chance to play in a post-season tournament?  
A.J. DAVIS: I would love that. I would love to just be able to keep on playing
for Coach as long as possible and play with my brothers as many games as I
could. If I could, I would play with them forever. I would keep this thing
going forever, but that would be great.  
  
And I think any post-season is an honor, like Coach is telling us. Just
because we didn't make the NCAA Tournament, I think just to be able to compete
and still be able to play the game of basketball with this team and this
university would be an honor, and I would be proud just to compete for this
university and put this jersey back on.  
  
Q. What has A.J.'s leadership meant to this team this year, especially
in light of all the adversity that you guys fought through?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, A.J.'s been amazing for us this year and last year as
well, but more so this season because of, like you said, everything we have
faced. He was the one rock that we had, he was the one constant that was there
through all the ups and downs that we faced and he really steadied us a lot on
the floor, but also off the court with a lot of our younger players. Having
gone through the experience he's had at UCF over the years, I thought he
brought a lot of insight for our younger players, and I think that helped them
develop as they moved forward through the season.  
  
So he's made us better and I told him that. I said, you know, you want to
leave a place better than the way you found it. You want to leave your legacy,
and those are all things that A.J. was able to do for us over the last two
seasons. He's helped build a culture that we want to have here at UCF, and I'm
just very proud of him for that.  
  
Q. Coach Sampson commended you for the season, 19 wins with the
adversity, with the injuries. Having said that, you have a NIT résumé; you
touched on it earlier. Do you expect that phone call?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Again, like I said, I've been in this a long time. I mean, you
just never know. You just have to wait and see. Like I said, if it was up to
mean, I think that we would be in, but that's not my decision. That's going to
be decided elsewhere. But I think our résumé is good enough to continue to
play, and I'm hopeful that that will happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: UCF, thank you.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: All right, guys, take care.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 61, SMU - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes and Coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: My opening statement is please ask questions of the players
first, so they can go back and get some rest. Other than that, congratulations
to SMU for showing the character that they have shown for the last two months
of playing with half their team injured. And five weeks of Ben Emelogu playing
with his shooting hand injured and couldn't take a shot, but he was still out
there. So we have great respect for their program.  
  
So it was, for me, it was good to see them come down here and play as well as
they have played down here, because they have had some unbelievably bad luck.  
  
That being said, the guys played hard enough to get a win in the second half.
We picked it up on the defensive end, picked it up on the back board, and in
honor of my Coach Huggins outfit today, we won without making shots, which he
taught me 20 years ago.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions, please.  
  
Q. Cane and Gary and Kyle, nothing from the perimeter almost at all, all
day today. Were they that good defensively or were you struggling that much
offensively?  
CANE BROOME: They definitely played hard and we just didn't hit shots today,
but granted them, they played hard defense, they rotated very well.  
  
GARY CLARK: Yeah, what Cane was saying. When teams are scrambling hard and
playing hard, shots aren't always going to fall, so that's why you got to play
defense like we did the second half.  
  
KYLE WASHINGTON: I just think it showed our versatility for us to be able to
go inside. Gary got it going in the second half a little bit, and then you
can't forget about Naz (Nysier) and Tre, they did a good job on our
progressions on the zone offense, so I was happy about that. We just prevailed
and we stayed persistent, so I was happy about that for our team.  
  
Q. For anybody, start with Gary, a team like SMU, heavy underdog to you
guys, they're ahead four, five, six points, you're locked into the NCAA
Tournament but is there any concern by you guys that, hey, if we lose this
game, maybe we drop a seed, something like that? How concerned were you guys
as that game got deeper and deeper?  
GARY CLARK: That's always a worry, but we're playing for more and we have to
lock in and get defensive stops. You always want to try to get momentum, take
each game, get momentum going on further.  
  
Q. At one point you guys were 0-for-10 from three-point range. How
frustrating is it when you keep missing them like that, some of them were open
looks they just weren't going down. Cane, I'll ask you because you finally
made one that got you over the hump.  
CANE BROOME: It's definitely frustrating but Coach tells us all the time,
you're not going to make always make shots. You're not going to win with
offense all the time. Our main focus in the second half was defense, not
really the shooting. We didn't actually even talk about shooting.  
  
Q. Gary, you get two points combined from Jarron and Jacob and you win
anyway by 10. What does that say to you about your team or just how you
responded to that?  
GARY CLARK: Just our depth. Guys come in, step in, you got Keith and Trevor
come in, rebound the ball and being able to get stops defensively. Jarron, he
led us in almost every category today when it comes to defense, rebounding,
stuff like that.  
  
So it's not always going to be a good night, but as long as you contribute on
the defensive end and help your team get the W, that's all you care about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, gentlemen. We'll excuse you to the locker
room. And we'll open it up to questions for Coach.  
  
Q. We have talked and you've talked for weeks about your bench is going
to be key in post-season.  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, no doubt.  
  
Q. Just specifically when you're kind of I don't know if "trouble" is
the description, but Tre and Naz both hit a couple baskets there. I guess is
that kind of indicative of what you want to see?  
MICK CRONIN: They're really improving, they're still young players but for us
player development is the key to what we do at Cincinnati and the way we do
things. So making sure that these guys put in the time and believe that it's
going to pay off, but it's not going to pay off if you don't put in the time.
You don't just become better because you become a junior or senior. You become
better because you work really, really hard at getting better and you care
about it.  
  
So Tre and Naz have really improved. I think that we might have been down six
when they went on a run of bringing us back, defensively and offensively,
which is huge, huge for us. They maybe have helped us on the defensive end,
but today they helped us on the offensive end. They got three field goals
each, and I'm going to say at least maybe four of the six field goals they had
were probably in the second half.  
  
So that being said, I'm going to make this point that, in my opinion, I tell
guys this all the time, Jarron Cumberland, he was the player of the game. He
had eight deflections, he had eight assists, he had two unbelievable offensive
-- he had an offensive rebound off Nysier missed free throw and he just gives
us a toughness that we need. He's just a real, real competitor. He's a real
competitor.  
  
He's a guy, and he's a guy that scored 2,000-something points in high school,
but he's becoming a winner and he helped us -- if it wasn't for him, we don't
win this game. I think that of Tre and Naz as well.  
  
So you can play great without scoring, contrary to 99 percent of what the
popular belief is in little league basketball.  
  
Q. What has Cane given you lately? And he's the guy that's been around,
but this is kind of his first significant post-season. What do you expect from
him as you go forward?  
MICK CRONIN: I just think he's finally comfortable. I think he's finally made
the adjustment of his intensity level. I judge it by whether he turns the ball
over, and I judge it by his defense. Because as you know, you saw him, he took
18 shots a game, which I kid him, you know, I got recruited at that level
before I got hurt. I could have got up 18 shots a game, I would have got me
some buckets. So I was messing with him. But it's just so different at the
level he's at now, the energy you have to expend just to take care of the ball
against the bigger physical players he's playing against at our level. That
was adjustment number one. Number two is to defend against a different caliber
of player at the level we're at.  
  
So I just think he's had to work harder, practice harder, have better life
habits, have better practice habits and takes time. Sometimes until you fail,
you don't really commit to doing what you need to do to get better. So I give
him the credit, because here in the last two or three weeks I don't know, you
guys might have the numbers, but I mean his consistencies been tremendous here
over the last few weeks which has made us a much better team. It just gives us
another way to beat you, because of the firepower he can give you on offense
but it's irrelevant if he's turning it over. See, today he did it without; he
has 13 points, two assists, no turnovers.  
  
Q. How much of the struggle today offensively was the tentativeness you
expect in a first game of a tournament?  
MICK CRONIN: I think you always -- I've always said this, I don't like when
coaches come in and say stuff like that. I think the other team is the reason,
the actual game itself and the team. We're not tentative. Yeah, I just don't
believe in stuff like that.  
  
So I think if we didn't make shots, SMU played really active in their zone.
They didn't make it easy on us, they put game pressure on us. So I give them
the credit for that. I just I think that should always be the case. I think
it's arrogant as a coach to think, oh, we would have won by 30, we just missed
every open shot. Well, they missed them too.  
  
So I think you got to give the other team credit. You got to look -- Akoy Agau
is in his fifth year. McMurray has been around. He's an all-league player at
South Florida. He's an all-league player now for the last three weeks the way
he's been playing. Emelogu is in his sixth year. Jimmy Whitt's in his third
year of college. I mean, those guys are good players. They just don't have the
depth. But like the four guys I mentioned are veteran, talented, top-hundred
players out of high school. They're good players. Tim is as good a coach as
I've ever coached against.  
  
So I think you got to realize, Emelogu, he's been playing with a bad
hand/wrist because he had to. He couldn't even shoot the ball for four weeks.
You watch their film, you could see he couldn't even shoot. At one point he
was the best three-point shooter in the country earlier in the year. Leading
the nation. So I just think you got to give SMU credit for why the game was
competitive today. I think it's unfair not to do that.  
  
Q. What's behind the Bob Huggins tribute thing?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, the Coach of the Year Award I was fortunate enough to win,
so I obviously sent some messages for guys that I worked for. Obviously I
wouldn't have, I could have still been banging around at Woodard High School
if he didn't hire me. And he knows the story and we have little story when he
met me, and I didn't have -- one time I went to pull out some money, he didn't
have any money. We were trying to get out of a parking garage. I was a high
school coach. I had this terrible looking wallet, a broken rubber band and
stuff, and he's like, "Can you not even afford a wallet?" So we always kid, a
long ways from the days where I couldn't have a wallet. So he knew me when I
couldn't even afford a wallet or a rubber band that didn't break.  
  
So a little tribute to him. Thank you for helping me.  
  
Q. What was that a windbreaker you had on?  
MICK CRONIN: I don't know. Too many useless details. I'm worried about lunch
right now. Let's go.  
  
Q. Me too.  
MICK CRONIN: No, I know you are, trust me.  
  
Q. I'll go with you.  
MICK CRONIN: Okay, you're buying.  
  
Q. Maybe you forgot to bring a suit?  
MICK CRONIN: I got three of them. I just tricked everybody. It's something I
thought about. So tomorrow I'll wear a real expensive suit like Rick Pitino.  
  
Q. After that big run that SMU embarked on, there was a little stoppage
and then y'all came out and went on a 10-0 run yourself and really limited
SMU's shooting ability. What did you tell your team and what kind of judgments
did you make?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, I always whisper very kind things in timeouts and dead
balls to my players and try to sweeten them up, get them to respond that way.
But look, they did what they had to do because with their numbers, they're
trying to spread you out, and shoot the three and go five-out as much as
possible, create mismatches and hopefully you help off somebody and let it
fly. That's really, they only have one guy, the big Akoy down in the post is
really their own post guy. Chargois is more of a shooter for a big guy.  
  
So we just did a better job -- as the game went on we adjusted more to what
they were doing to us on offense we did a better job. I think early in the
game we had a "woe is me". "Oh, we actually got to spread out and move our
feet and guard these guys?" I mean they're not just going to take bad shots .
Well, no, they're well coached and they have veteran players and they played
really well yesterday, and for the seven guys they got like I said they're
finally healthy.  
  
So I think it just took us time to adjust to the stuff they were running. But
would I like to give credit to Tre Scott and Nysier Brooks. That run you're
alluding to, they were in the game. They did great on the defensive end and
they also scored inside against SMU's zone. So whenever you can have two guys
come off the bench that back up all-league players and really turn the game
around for you, it's a luxury as a coach. It's big, big, really big for us. So
hopefully it's a big confidence booster for those two kids.  
  
Q. You talked about Tre and Nysier's development as players and how big
they were today. How much of the seniors, Kyle and Gary, helped them out along
the way?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, our team I'm a very lucky coach that my seniors are a
great, great people and they're constantly trying to help the younger players.
At all times. They're always talking to them, whether it's trying to keep
their spirits up because I was maybe hard on them in practice, if you can
imagine that, or just but basketball stuff really. Little things with
basketball, and if they were in here they would tell you that. Tre and Nysier
would tell you. There's no two better seniors in the country than Gary and
Kyle as far as leadership, character, people, caring about others, they're
awesome.  
  
So they have been a big part of those guys' development, and I can't say
enough about that. I mean, that's not coach talk and anybody that's
interviewed them or knows them, knows that, how good of people they are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Thank you guys.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 79, South Florida - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, certainly we were really happy to get the win. But I've
been impressed with South Florida the last few weeks. They certainly came to
Memphis and beat us pretty handily, and we had to hold on to get the win
today. So Brian Gregory and his staff have been doing fantastic job.  
  
But I'm really proud of how our guys hung in here today, finished the game.
Even though we lost the lead there, we still did the things to get the win.
And this post-season play, anything can happen. You got to really be focused
and I thought we were focused and did a good job to finish it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please?  
  
Q. Kyvon, how motivated were you guys, given the loss to them last week
and kind of everything that's been going on around the program the past few
days?  
KYVON DAVENPORT: It was a tough loss, but we knew we couldn't hang our heads
over it. So we just got after it, after practice and pushed each other and
made each other better. And we knew we had to come out here with intensity
from the beginning because we play well once we get going from the beginning,
get going early. And what really helped us out was our defense; more
deflections we got and the stops we got really helped us out on offense.  
  
Q. Tubby, there have been some reports about your future about your
agent came out today and said you continue to have the support of the
administration. Do you feel like you have that support moving forward?  
TUBBY SMITH: Yeah. I feel pretty comfortable, pretty confident about what we
have done this year, and how we have and how we are growing the program and
the type of young men that we're recruiting.  
  
Q. Tubby, how tough have the past couple days been for you and your
family? There's news that came out before the game about G.G. as well. How
have you guys, how have you been dealing with everything that's been going
on?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, it is part of our business. It's the profession we chose.
And unfortunately there you are, hired to be fired usually unless you're in
some program that's just unbelievable and you're getting all the -- you're
doing everything right. But he did a good job there, the best he could, so I'm
proud of him.  
  
Certainly -- yeah, it's always tough when that happens, whether it is your
family or friends or anybody in the business, no one ever wants to see that
happen, but it's part of the culture now. It's like that's something that's
celebrated at the end of the season, by a lot of people.  
  
Q. David, what do you think, it seemed like, was it home cooking, how
would you describe what got into you there in the first half and why you were
able to kind of break out like did you?  
DAVID NICKELBERRY: Definitely my teammates and my coaches, they really pushed
me to play strong, compete, get after it, and even in practice they just do
the same thing, push me, so I can get stronger, play harder. So that's what I
do.  
  
Q. Kareem, you obviously know about the reports and rumors about your
coach. How did y'all put it out of your mind?  
KAREEM BREWTON JR.: We really didn't think too much of it. That's not our
business. We are here to play basketball, so that's all. That's the only thing
I got to say.  
  
Q. Kareem, what happened late, you hit the big shot that kind of stemmed
the tide a little bit, but what do you think you guys can take from what
happened late in this one to the game tomorrow? What do you think you learned
from what happened here?  
KAREEM BREWTON JR.: I feel like we should execute a little bit more, get back
to us running our plays, because I feel like we got out of that a little bit
at the end. So pretty much just, we just got to keep ourselves confident and
just keep running what was working through the whole game.  
  
Q. Kyvon, do you feel like this team is capable of making a run through
this tournament? You've now won six of seven. Do you feel like you guys are
clicking enough?  
KYVON DAVENPORT: Yes, I think so. We're playing comfortable and we're playing
smart. We just really got to stay focused and execute and keep working
together and moving the ball and everything will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the win today.  
TUBBY SMITH: Thank you.  
  
Q. What would you like to see your team do a little bit better tomorrow
than they did not do today?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, we were, I thought our defensive intensity was right, we
got off to a good start, we made shots, I thought our taking care of the
basketball like Kareem said, just executing in crunch, in clutch situations
and taking -- I thought we had a couple of questionable shots there, but then
went back to just execution, especially in the late game. Make our free throws
in the end, all those things, make our layups -- just finish. We just have to
finish around the basket. I thought we had a couple chances to finish around
the basket and we didn't. So that's where we have to get better at.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could speak to David Collins for them number
11. He had 30 today. Just what kind of problems he posed for you.  
TUBBY SMITH: Hey, he's created a lot of problems. He's a talented freshman. He
really is. He's going to be a star in this league. He's so physical and he's
very deceptive, as far as he can fake like he's going off the screen and he's
a good ball handler, and you've got to honor his outside shooting. So he
really gave us all kinds of problems trying to keep us in front of him.  
  
But I'm impressed with that young man. They have done a good job of developing
him and it helps, he's getting to play, getting playing time, in a program
where you've got an outstanding coach and coaching staff that's going to work,
Brian Gregory's going to make sure he does the things he's supposed to do to
be a good player, because he's developed a lot of outstanding players over the
years.  
  
Q. What do you recall about the two Tulsa games and what do you think of
Tulsa and the matchup that you have today?  
TUBBY SMITH: Those games, when you think back, I'll have to go back and watch
film, but I know at our place we really played well, shot the ball well, and
but there they made the run in the second half. We kept -- we would get it
close but I was very impressed with how they controlled the tempo and then
their matchup zone gave us problems, especially late game. And Frank Haith,
with that matchup zone they do, they create a lot of problems for us. We did
some things the first time we played against them that was new, but they made
the adjustments in the second game, and that's one of the reasons they were
able to beat us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Memphis, thank you.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Michael Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32932)

### [B.J. Tyson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28539)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UCF - 66, East Carolina - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach, and then take
questions for Coach and B.J.  
  
MICHAEL PERRY: Well, I thought our guys competed and played hard, played their
hearts out and that's all you can ask for as a coach. I think all year we have
been undermanned and I think certainly late in games it catches up with us
when we're undermanned, and fatigue becomes a major factor and turnovers begin
to mount, and that certainly was the case tonight. We made a valiant effort at
getting back in the game, and then probably in the last seven minutes of the
game turnovers, that I can attribute to fatigue, begin to mount for us and you
can't give them more opportunities to score than you have. And typically
that's what happens, when you look down the bench and you don't have a lot of
options available to you and you just continue to fight and try to manage the
game as best you can.  
  
But I was really proud of the effort from our guys and it was a valiant effort
on their part.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for Coach and B.J., please.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the turnovers, how much of the 20 turnovers
were a part of just what UCF was doing defensively?  
MICHAEL PERRY: Well, obviously you've got to give credit to them defensively.
They were in the gaps, they were really helping out, but again I think that
the physicality at times when that happens I think being able to fight through
that, I think fatigue can play a factor in that. And that's not taking
anything away from UCF, but we have seen it again late in games, it typically
catches up with us, and it's just been a problem throughout the year for us.  
  
I would have liked to have had a couple of more options to be able to use in
terms of our rotation, but we were not able to be a part of things this year.
But I commend these kids on the effort that they gave.  
  
Q. What was the turning point in the second half early on when you guys
were really able to cut UCF's lead down 46-45, what contributed to that?  
MICHAEL PERRY: Well, I thought we were able to get the ball moving and ball
reversal and kept the ball moving, the ball didn't stick and we didn't over-
dribble during that period of time. We tried to really keep the ball moving.
We often refer to it as keeping moving as if it's a hot potato, and I thought
the guys did a really good job of getting ball reversals. We talked about it
going into the game, and they're really good defensively. If you try to score
on them on the first side, we wanted to try get to the second side, the third
side, we wanted more ball reversals. We wanted to keep the ball moving as much
as possible, and get them in closeout situations, where we could attack them
off the bounce, or make them have to have two guys try to guard one, and we
can make the extra pass. That was part of the game plan going in.  
  
Q. What was your impression of their defense? I know that's something
that UCF build its identity on with Johnny Dawkins, is their strong defense.  
MICHAEL PERRY: They do a good job defensively. They get back in transition.
Teams typically do not get easy baskets against them, and then they make you
play half-court basketball, which obviously to be a good defensive team,
that's what you want to do, make teams play half-court basketball.  
  
Again, they're really good when teams over-dribble and when teams try to score
on the first side. To be effective against them you have to be patient
offensively, and you're going to have to have some mental toughness in terms
of being able to maybe pass up a pretty decent one to get eventually a really
good one.  
  
Q. In the first half UCF was 7-of-11 from three. What would you credit
to that? Was it just some shots were falling? Was it a defensive lapse?  
MICHAEL PERRY: I thought they shot the ball well in the first half. I thought
that we didn't engage them as much, we gave them a little bit too much space,
and we didn't engage them as much as we should have. In the second half we did
a better job of trying to engage them and make them floor it and bounce it
more. We were concerned about their ability to be able to drive the
basketball. They have several guys that can drive it, and a couple of
shooters, I think Mumin got open one time in transition, Griffin got one or
two because of penetration, and they kicked it out to him. But we did a better
job of trying to stay home and try to guard as we say "guard our yard", so we
didn't have other guys trying to help where you can give up extra
opportunities in terms of the perimeter shots that they were getting.  
  
Q. What can you guys take away from this season?  
B.J. TYSON: We never gave up. I commend the guys, I commend my brothers for
not giving up. They fought to the end. One thing that you can take from this
is they're young. ECU is going to be experienced next year, they're young,
they got what, the Rookie of the Year coming back next year, but you can build
around those guys with Fleming coming back. So you got a lot of key players
that are coming back next year, and I feel like you can take a lot from it but
one thing that ECU should probably focus on is limiting the turnovers.  
  
MICHAEL PERRY: For me on a personal note it was a tremendous experience and it
was a privilege and also a pleasure to be able to coach this group.
Interesting, and I've coached teams before, but this was an interesting group
because obviously this wasn't the hand that they actually started out with. As
I told these guys in the locker room after the game, this is a great
experience in life for you, because things aren't going to always turn out as
planned. And obviously there was some transition with me taking over, and the
guys trusted me and respected me, and it's a very difficult situation to be in
when you really don't have real leverage. You have real leverage when you have
a contract. When you don't have a contract, you don't have real leverage. But
we were able to hold it together without that because of the respect and
trust. And I was really proud of that. And we were able to keep it together.  
  
I always remind people Colorado State's coach stepped aside, assistant took
over and they boycotted practice and wouldn't practice, and we got through the
first one or two and I thought okay, we got a chance here. But it was a great
experience and one of the things that I take away from with this group also is
how relentless they were in terms of their work ethic. Even after a tough
loss, they would come in with a big smile on their face and they worked hard
in practice. They were very attentive in film, and that's a very difficult
thing to do, particularly when have you a year in which you're struggling. In
a lot of cases they understand they're undermanned, and they know that they're
being asked to do a lot with less than maybe some of the other teams in the
league have. But that's what we're about. We know that we can, we're people,
we're young men and it's a great experience for them that they learn how to do
more with less.  
  
Q. A lot of teams go through the moment of when their season ends. As a
coach how do you describe that moment?  
MICHAEL PERRY: Well, it always takes you back as a coach when you actually
have that moment as a player. You really relate well to the kids in that
moment. For us we wanted to celebrate. Very similar to a funeral in that you
want to celebrate a person's life when they're passing, very similar in this
situation here, they're passing on, they're moving on to another stage in
their life. But rather than mourn them, we want to celebrate them, and that's
what we did, we celebrated them and congratulated them and commended them for
all the things that they brought to this program.  
  
B.J. particularly. He really embodied what a student-athlete should be. He did
things the right way. Both on and off the floor. He graduated early, and he's
in grad school now. He's a good citizen, he's one of the most popular players
-- I've been there 11 years, probably the most popular student-athlete that
I've come in contact with. Most people would probably agree with that, and not
just amongst his athletic peers but also throughout the community. And that's
what it should be about. He's a tremendous ambassador for our university and
that's what you want to have as a student-athlete, tremendous ambassadors for
your university.  
  
So being able to celebrate a young man like him as well as some of our other
guys, and our young guys being able to see them and see the work ethic that
those guys have, see young men that are about the right stuff. He's been able
to take, put guys and put underclassmen under his wing and his leadership is
going to have an influence on those kids going forward in life and that's
going to be tremendous experience. He's got a legacy. He's put an imprint on
this program, as well as the other seniors.  
  
THE MODERATOR: ECU, thank you.  
  
MICHAEL PERRY: Thank you.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Christian Vital](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32996)

### [Antwoine Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34868)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
SMU - 80, UConn - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: First, I just want to thank our seniors for their commitment to
our university, and this is a lifetime for them, for us and us being a family
so I really appreciate them for giving their heart and soul this season.  
  
This game started off kind of like our whole season a little bit, getting down
and then playing from behind. So just got to clean that up with defense and
rebounding and we have to be connected with that from the beginning, and SMU
took advantage. Once again, our guys didn't give in, didn't stop fighting, we
got back in the game, but when you get down by 20 or you get down by 15,
everything's got to be perfect and unfortunately today is wasn't perfect and
we couldn't get over the hump.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. Obviously it's been a tough season, tough last couple of seasons, as
you sit here right now do you expect to be back coaching this team again next
year?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yes.  
  
Q. Was there something, is Jalen's wrist bothering him? Because he
wasn't as aggressive offensively today as he has been in the past and just
wonder if that was any impact.  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, I know he hurt his wrist, hurt his thumb in the Houston
game. So it was a tough situation for him, but he's a warrior. He's fought for
us the whole year, he's led the conference in minutes played two years in a
row, so I know he's a warrior.  
  
But at the end of the day he was making the right plays. He was making passes,
he was getting, trying to get everybody involved, and I just appreciate him
playing the right way and he's done that the whole year. With the scoring,
with leading us in assists. So he's been a player that had to make a lot of
plays for us, and he's done that through the course of the season.  
  
But at the end of the day we have to be more consistent on the defensive end,
and that's where I'm going to be really pressing upon them to get better
defensively, and that leads to us getting in the fast break, us getting stops
and us building the momentum.  
  
Q. Christian and Antwoine, perimeter defense has been kind of tough a
lot of the year, how did they get free and how demoralizing is that when they
hit six or seven in the first half there?  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: No, give credit to them, they made tough shots. They also got
some easy shots, which was on us as the players. We didn't execute the defense
to our best ability and it comes down to us. It comes down to the players who
are on the court. All of this extra stuff about everything else, I just think
it comes down to us and we didn't execute. And I'll give credit to SMU, they
played a good day of basketball, and they gave themselves a chance to move on
in this tournament.  
  
ANTWOINE ANDERSON: The biggest thing was just our energy in the first half. We
didn't play with no energy and we came out slow, and it's just like Coach
Kevin says, it's just hard to come back from 20 points and that's just pretty
much it.  
  
Q. Christian, we talked many times after games like this about coming
out slow, falling behind and then playing catch-up in the end. Have you ever
put your finger on why you guys were never really able to figure that part of
it out this year?  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: Well, if I could have figured it out I think I would have
tried to tell my teammates and I think the outcomes would have been different.
But it's just we weren't unable as a team from the starters to the people who
came into the game. I'll keep saying it, it was just on us as players. We just
couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. When y'all started to go on those runs in the second half, what was
working for you and what kind of adjustments did y'all make?  
ANTWOINE ANDERSON: Defense, that was the biggest thing. Energy. We decided to
come out and play 90 feet, defense, and just try to get them rattled and get
them to turn the ball over a little bit, and that's what kind of got us our
run, that started our offense.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: And then we completed defensive plays by rebounding. I think in
the first 10 minutes we didn't get one rebound, a clean rebound. In the second
half we played with a little bit more energy, we got clean rebounds and we
were able to push the pace. And those guys, as Antwoine said and CV, they took
the challenge from the start. But then you have to have a back line playing
that solid defense, also. And you let Agau get 21 points in 24 minutes, you
can't do that. Not saying that he's a bad player, but he's got 21 points in 24
minutes. It's tough to play when they got McMurray going and they got him
going. So they got the inside and outside going, and we have to do a better
job defensively.  
  
But when we went on runs, we're a pretty good team. When we share the
basketball, when we get defensive stops, we rebound, we get amazing shots, and
that's what -- an example is we shot 54, 55 percent in the second half, but
that has to be a sense of urgency from the first half.  
  
Q. Is there anything about the season that you would have done
differently if you had to do it over again?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, you know, just everything. When you get back this is a
tough question now, but I'm going to assess everything that I've done as a
coach and see how I can get better. Of course CV says it's about the players
but it's about the coaching staff too, how can I get these guys to play better
and play together?  
  
So I can't name down the list but we don't want to be here. We don't want to
be 14-18. And that's unacceptable and we have to get better in every category,
and I'm in the top to evaluate myself, how I can get these guys to play
better, how can I get my coaching staff to execute better and we're all in
this together.  
  
So it's going to be a long evaluation for myself, my coaching staff, my team.
We got to get players, and we got to find out who is staying. And we got our
seniors, they got to get replaced. Those are meetings that we're going to have
over the next two weeks, and we want to make sure our guys finish strong,
their academics, too. So we can't drop the ball on that, also.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, to open the second half you opened up on that
really good run and then there was the media timeout, and then SMU came back
with another 11-0 run, you guys cut it to 10 and then they put it back up to
21. I'm wondering what exactly happened during that run? What from the timeout
happened there?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, we went on a great run, and if you watched the game, we had
probably about five turnovers right in front of every about five possessions
in a row we had a turnover. So you give up live turnovers, they've got great
players on that end, so they're going to make you pay. So we can't turn the
ball over. I believe we had a media timeout, McMurray came in and banked a
shot. I think CV played wonderful defense. Antwoine, he banked a shot in, and
we came down and had five turnovers.  
  
So I mean, if you know the game, you seen the game. I mean, it's hard to win
when you don't get a shot up on the rim. And those turnovers was right in
front of their zone. And those kind of lead out to fast breaks. It wasn't like
we're going to the basket, they're blocking a shot. We were right in their 2-3
zone, and they're getting a steal there and that leads out to fast-break
points, and it's hard to get back on the defense.  
  
But credit them, when we made a run, they stopped our run and they stopped our
momentum by executing on the defensive end and getting stops.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Tim Jankovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20496)

### [Ben Emelogu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25951)

### [Akoy Agau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34866)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
SMU - 80, UCONN - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: Thank you. Just really happy for our guys, especially these
guys, seniors. I swore I would challenge anyone ever to find me a couple guys
that have been through more amazingly difficult adversity in their careers
than these two guys right here, let alone our last six weeks of what has taken
place. But I'm talking about a whole career. So for me the best part is today
for them and they get to feel this feeling.  
  
I also thought I am really proud of our team. Had to fight off two great runs.
We came out of the half about as poorly as we could ever hope to and give
Connecticut a lot of credit, they fought their way right back into the game
and then we extended I think back up to 20 or 22 and they made another run. So
I got to give them a lot of credit. They were fighting until the bitter end.
But I also have to feel great about our guys that fought off two big runs and
the game -- when a team's behind they're going to start pressing and making
the game crazy and turning into a different game, and our guys handled that
very well and hit free throws down the stretch, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Akoy, today's a pretty good day to have a career high in scoring.
What was your mindset coming into the game?  
AKOY AGAU: Just obviously the season didn't go as we wanted, and kind of when
you get into the post-season, everyone's starting 0-0. And this is kind of our
last opportunity to try to make a push and do as well as we can and still try
to make a push for March Madness.  
  
Today just go out there and just try and play as hard as I can. Put a headband
on, took the knee brace off, tried to shave about 10 years off. Just kind of a
running joke with my teammates. But just kind of went out there and just kind
of played hard and things happened as they did.  
  
Q. Before the game you and your teammates were kind of smiling and
laughing during shootaround, even into the right before tip-off. Was there
kind of a looser attitude today before the game?  
BEN EMELOGU: Coach told to us relax, "Go out there and have fun, be confident
and act like you're at home." And that's what we did from the jump. As soon as
we walked into the gym, we was comfortable having fun in warmups. We were
focused but we were relaxed, and it transferred over to the game. We started
off good and we had bad moments but I think just by being relaxed we didn't
get too shook. Some teams they break but we just bent and we snapped back.
That's what you have to do in March.  
  
Q. Akoy, how's your ankle feeling and do you think you'll be able to
play tomorrow?  
AKOY AGAU: You can't have two questions, so I won't answer that (Laughter.)  
  
I'm just kidding. Obviously I went after that blocked shot and I fell on
Vital's foot and it's just a little tweak, it's fine. Just icing it up, but
I'll be ready to play tomorrow, so nothing crazy.  
  
Q. Coach, when things were going well for you, what was it that you
thought you did really well today?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Just make sure, what did I think we were doing very well today?
A couple things stand out: No. 1, in the first half I thought our purpose and
our ball movement and our concentration offensively was really outstanding.
I'll just say obviously it helps when you shoot the ball in the basket.
Sometimes you play really well and the ball doesn't go in and it looks like
you're not playing well, so we were rewarded with the ball going in. But I
really liked, I liked our ball movement, I liked our concentration.  
  
I also really liked our activity defensively. I thought we were fast to balls,
got our hands on a lot of balls, were really alert, and I thought that
combination gave us a great, great first half. Probably was the difference in
the game to build that lead, and then make them play from behind the entire
second half.  
  
Q. Ben, how much did your performance tonight come out of just trying to
extend your career a couple more games?  
BEN EMELOGU: Most definitely, I don't want it to end at all. I was thinking
about that the whole time we were headed here, and I just look back on my
career at SMU and all the things that I was able to accomplish with my
teammates and my coaches, and I just wanted to have that feeling again, and
it's a great opportunity to do it, get a conference tournament championship
and go to March Madness. I never got to an NCAA tournament in my career, and
that's what I want to do before I finish playing.  
  
So I want to play as hard as I can. Get my teammates motivated to play as hard
as we can just to achieve that goal.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts about playing Cincinnati again and if the
players would answer that, too.  
TIM JANKOVICH: Yes, before I do that and I will, but I want to say this,
haven't really had a chance to say this because sometimes you kind of hide,
you can't tell the other team all your issues. I mean obviously our issues,
the obvious ones are we got three guys out for the year. Those are obvious,
but you don't want to tell them about the guys that are playing and what's
wrong with them.  
  
And so these guys, I can't tell you how many practices they could not
practice, I can't tell you how -- tonight was the Ben Emelogu, the real one,
because he's finally, I hope I'm not talking out of turn, he's finally, if you
paid close attention, he could shoot the ball again, he's had a wrist injury
and it's been about five weeks' worth. And poor guy's playing out here without
one of the best things that, if not the best thing he does. He's been playing
for five weeks without his strength. It's like I'm having my next-door
neighbor play, not Ben Emelogu. It's a guy that looks like Ben, but it's not
Ben. So finally, finally here he gets to actually look like the player that he
is.  
  
Akoy, same situation. I don't know how many practices -- there's so many days
he can't practice, he's trying to push through so many things that I won't get
into, but he gets to show today the player that he got cheated out of being
four years and this is what -- I've been holding this back, but now it looks
like, heck, what the heck, but that's why this is special to me because I know
what these guys -- you can't imagine what their careers or even this year,
what they have gone through to just get to the floor. And then not look like
themselves of who they really are and how frustrating if you're really a good
player and you can't look like the play that you are. And that's what these
guys have been living. I've been living it through them, and I've been
watching them and it's the most frustrating, helpless feeling in the world.  
  
So that's why today is special. At least they get to at least we get to see
again how good they are when they feel pretty darn good.  
  
I forgot the question. Cincinnati. Yeah, I was trying to -- actually it was my
way of avoiding it, and you were supposed to forget and then we were going to
get on to something else.  
  
Cincinnati's a great, great team. I have tons of respect for them, as did we
last year. And it's the same guys basically, they didn't lose very much and so
we know them very well, which just because know them well doesn't make it any
easier to play them.  
  
They're great. They're great, they're deep and they're old and they're
talented and they're big and I mean, come on, they're great. I hope they make
a humongous run in the NCAA tournament, regardless of outcome in this
tournament.  
  
So my respect is very, very high. We'll have to play incredible game, but
we're going to tighten them up and lace them up and give it our best shot.  
  
BEN EMELOGU: Like Coach said, they're a great team. Just got to go out there
and play confident and play hard. Let the outcome be what it is. If we do our
job and play as good as we can, I think we have great chance of winning the
game. They're going to come out and play hard, we just got to play harder.  
  
AKOY AGAU: I definitely agree with what they both said. They're a really good
team, they're really good defensively. I think if we do what we did today,
obviously take away a few lapses that we had, I think we'll have a really good
chance and it's hard to beat a team three times, so.  
  
Q. Ben, what were your nerves like at the free-throw line with your
season on the line?  
BEN EMELOGU: I was relaxed. I've been practicing free throws all year before I
got an injured hand. So I went out there and relaxed. Coach helped me by
having the teammates at the line, just making it as normal as possible, and
just being able to breathe, I was focusing. I wanted to win so bad, and I just
focused on making the shot and that's what happened.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One final question?  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: We're just thorough. We were just very thorough. So thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: SMU, thank you.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

### [David Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34880)

### [Stephan Jiggetts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30629)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 79, South Florida - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions.  
  
BRIAN GREGORY: Great game. Give Memphis a lot of credit. I thought they played
with great energy today. They shot the ball really well. At the same time give
our guys credit for continuing to fight with the effort and energy, I just
thought it was just a very well-played game. They got some big baskets from
some guys that have made big plays for them all year long in Davenport and
Brewton. They had been playing so well, I think that they had six out of the
last seven or seven out of the last eight, with us being the only team beating
them.  
  
But at the same time I think our guys deserve a lot of credit for the way they
finished out the year, the toughness that they played with. We did a good job
on the glass, which was something that we needed to do. We did a good job in
terms of the attacking their pressure defense. It's just tough, it's a bitter
pill to swallow when you're playing pretty good basketball and you want to
continue to play and then it ends. But as I talked about in our last game, we
have a lot to build on from some of the stuff that we did this year and it's
going to be a hard road, but I think we got the right guys to go there, and I
think the guys like Jiggetts and the other seniors that are leaving did a
great job of setting a really solid foundation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak to David's effort today.  
BRIAN GREGORY: Yeah, obviously great game, great aggressiveness, good decision
making. As I said, could have easily been a Freshman of the Year in our
league, showed it tonight. He made me look pretty smart when I said that last
week. And at the same time I think having those seniors around him has helped
his development. But he's got a chance to be a great player in this league.
His best attributes is that he's coachable and he works hard. When you add
that to the baseline of talent that he has it's a pretty good combination.  
  
There will be parts of his game that as he looks back to today and wishes he
could do over a couple things, which is what you're supposed to do if you want
to be a great player. But he made good play after good play. Obviously one of
the biggest one was on the transition where he found Jiggs in the corner,
perfectly executed, and it helps when you got guys around you that can make
you look good when you make those plays.  
  
So yeah, take a couple weeks off and get back to work.  
  
Q. This is the third time you played Memphis this season, second time in
a week. Today they made perimeter shots, which really isn't their forte. Did
they do anything different on offense, run any different actions or anything
on defense differently today?  
BRIAN GREGORY: We weren't as good defensively today. They were better
offensively because they made some shots. They made some shots early, and we
got a little bit out of our defensive system and got stretched some, which
then opened up the driving game. And they attacked the paint off the dribble.
Nickelberry did a good job in the first half of that. Brewton always does a
good job of that.  
  
And then when we went zone, we got too stretched in the zone. One of the
reasons is because they shot the ball so well. I thought that three by Brewton
was a big, big basket. Obviously he's not percentage-wise a great three-point
shooter but he was 3-for-4 today.  
  
So they played better offensively and we didn't play as well defensively. It
wasn't anything new or anything different, they ran the same actions, we just
didn't defend it as well and they made plays. You know what I mean? Their
playmakers made play, Davenport goes 4-for-7. Brewton goes 3-for-4 from three;
that's 7-for-11. That's pretty good. But as I said, you look at all the talk,
you look at that team that we just played, they got everybody back. That's a
25, 26-win team next year because a lot of those guys, the junior college
guys, they're going to be better that second year. You can see their
development during the year. They're playing as well as anybody in the league
and they got their leading scorer not playing right now.  
  
So for overall for our league, it's just another team that's on the cusp of
doing some great things.  
  
Q. What do you want the younger guys who will be returning next season
to take away from this experience and this season going into next year?  
STEPHAN JIGGETTS: I would say just embrace everything they're being taught,
especially from Coach BG, because he'll transform your game just like he did
mine. I'm nowhere near the player I was last year. So just taking in all the
knowledge and embracing everything he taught them will help a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you sum up this first season?  
BRIAN GREGORY: It hurts. Anytime you lose 22 games, you're not going to be
happy. But you got to be able to take a step back and kind of see where we
were as a program 11 months\ago when I got the job or a little close to 12
months now, and I think we made progress.  
  
As I said after the last home game, you can't thank the seniors enough for
what they did, the sacrifices that they made and the challenge that they knew
they were under. But I'm also excited about getting back to work with our
young guys, our incoming guys, a couple guys that we'll sign in the spring. I
think we got a really good foundation to build on. The biggest thing is you
got to believe that you can win at South Florida, which we do and we know we
can. But then you got to go to work.  
  
And we got some work to do, there's no question about that. But I think we got
the guys that are willing to put in the work. And as Jiggs said, you learn
from a guy like him who is in the gym all the time. That's why he's grown as a
player this year. Again, you look at the game that he has today, he has the
ball in his hands a ton, and just made good decision after good decision. A
couple tough shots didn't go in. But again those can't define where he's at as
a player or a win or loss where we're at as a program because we're definitely
making the right steps.  
  
It's never as fast as the head coach wants, I can guarantee you that, but
they're positive steps for the program.  
  
Q. The last possession looked like it was well executed, did you feel
lake you had a good look?  
STEPHAN JIGGETTS: Yeah, I actually thought it was going down. It was a line
drive, so I thought I was going to hit that, really.  
  
BRIAN GREGORY: It looked good, it was just a little long. It was right on the
money, really good execution by all five guys and good pass by David. Good
read by David, and then we had some back-side rebounding. Those guys are also
spotted up on the three in case they take Jiggs away, and then as soon as the
shot went up, those guys got to the weak-side glass, which gave us another
chance. I thought maybe JB might be able to get that shot up on the rim and
maybe able to get an and-one on that, but they clubbed him pretty good. But
really good execution.  
  
I told Jiggs after the game, you know, we don't get that shot if he doesn't do
the things he did prior to that play. And there was no one that was going to
take that shot other than him at that point. He had just made one from almost
the identical spot, he's made big shots for us all year long, so felt really
comfortable with that.  
  
Q. David, can you talk about your game today, career high. Obviously in
the loss it doesn't feel as good as it would have, but how did you feel
today?  
DAVID COLLINS: I felt we got -- I mean, the other guys got me involved, I mean
I was getting open a lot and I was just knocking down shots from other people
making the right passes, playing very unselfish.  
  
THE MODERATOR: USF, thank you.  
  
BRIAN GREGORY: All right, guys. Thanks.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Obi Enechionyia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28852)

### [Josh Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30618)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Temple - 82, Tulane - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes and coach.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we're excited to be moving on. I thought Tulane gave us a
great effort. I thought maybe the difference in the game was the amount of
times we got to the foul line. I thought we drove it, drove it well. We
pressed the issue a little bit. We talked about it, but obviously it opened up
for us a little bit tonight. So big shots were made, Obi made some big shots,
J.P. Moorman made a big shot. Shizz Alston made some big shots, a couple big
foul shots down the stretch.  
  
And then the last piece would be just turning it over six times, which I think
is something we take a lot of pride in, but doesn't always happen that way.
But we're thrilled to be moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. Fran, first of all, can you tell us anything about J.P. Moorman?  
FRAN DUNPHY: They're looking at him now. We're hoping that it's not anything
that's real serious, obviously. But we'll find out when we get back in the
locker room, but the preliminary diagnosis would be -- look, I didn't see it
but they both said it looked like he just kind of straightened his leg out
when he came down. I didn't see it. Maybe you guys had a better look than I
did.  
  
Q. Obi, you looked to be more aggressive, you didn't hesitate on your
shot tonight. You had talked the other day about trying to be more aggressive.
Did that just go into your thinking coming into tonight?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Yeah, I tried to be as aggressive as possible. My guys did a
great job of finding me, and I was able to hit the open shots. So just trying
to be a little bit more aggressive, attacking the basket as well as with my
shooting.  
  
Q. Josh, 24-0 the other day, so I guess 10-1 was not that big a deal in
a sense at the start of this game?  
JOSH BROWN: Yeah, we tried to -- we talked about getting off to a good start,
but unfortunately we wasn't able to, but we didn't put our heads down like we
did the last game, we just kind of came together and we fought back and I
think we ended the half up two, I think.  
  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Up four by the way.  
  
JOSH BROWN: Oh, up four, sorry.  
  
Q. Fran, basketball's obviously a game of makes and misses, you guys
have had your up and downs this year, what did you see particularly at the end
of the first half, beginning of the second half, as those shots started to
fall? What was different about your offense at that point?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, I have great faith and trust in these two guys, and
obviously Shizz and Q are outstanding offensive players as well. I thought our
offense became more in good rhythm at the end of the first half. I think we
figured out what was going to work for us, and then again stepping up and
making shots is so critical and I think that all these guys did a really good
job at that.  
  
But even the other day when we were down 24-0, to get it back to where we got
it, down seven with six or so minutes left in the game, that's a long battle
to come back from, but I think these guys understand that there's no quit in
them. And I thought they did a terrific job of running their stuff toward that
latter part of the first half, early part of the second half.  
  
Q. You played two games against Wichita this year, they have been very
good games. What can you take from those experiences into tomorrow?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, knowing how good they are, but we're going to have to play
our best basketball, no question about it, but we're excited to have that
opportunity tomorrow. Good basketball team, really good.  
  
Q. How much was depth a factor?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, we're playing three young guys coming off the bench, I
thought Damion Moore did a good job in the first half subbing for Earn there,
but the three freshmen did a really good job. As I said, J.P. Moorman made a
huge three that took us I think from four back to seven again. And then just
as I mentioned in the locker room to the guys, those two freshmen stepped up
and while it may not have felt great that they only made one out of two, those
were two big foul shots that they made.  
  
They're good players, they're going to get better and better as the years go
on as well.  
  
Q. Obi, what does this do to the team's confidence? I mean you guys had
a tough end of the regular season, what does a win like this do for you
guys?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: It's just a good win. It's good to get a win in the first
game, especially against a team like that. So confidence-wise I think it's
going to help us going into tomorrow. Obviously facing a great team, but it's
one that we have beat before, so I don't think confidence will be an issue.  
  
Q. Josh and Obi, every game you guys are playing from here on out could
potentially be your last game. Are there any words that you have with the
younger guys to kind of get them to want to play just as hard as you guys are
going out there and playing?  
JOSH BROWN: Not necessarily. The stakes are high for them, too. They want to
play as well as we want to play, so we just trying to just hold ourselves
accountable each of us, and go out there and just try to get the victory.  
  
Q. You guys have played your fair share of close games this year. How
does that help out when you get the things get a little bit tight like it did
down the stretch tonight?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Just having that experience, we go over late-game situations
in practice all the time, but it's different when it's in a game and that's
where you really get the experience. So just having those, that experience in
those late-game situations and knowing exactly what to do, how to keep ahead
and things like that definitely helps.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Temple, thank you.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Thanks.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Mike Dunleavy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16245)

### [Cameron Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30599)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Temple - 82, Tulane - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes and Coach.  
  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: Well, obviously I'm disappointed that we lost. I thought that
we started off the game the way we wanted to start it out, we executed pretty
well. Then we settled for some shots from the outside when we were in the
bonus, and Temple was able to catch up and take a lead. Then obviously they
came out in that second half and they caught, they got a couple of rhythm
threes that they made right away, scored eight points on us and put us in a
hole.  
  
I was proud of the way our guys fought back. It's kind of been a trait that we
have had all year long, that we have been able to come from behind and win
ball games. Probably had seven or eight games where we were down by double
digits in the second half of games and won. A couple shots here or there and
maybe a little bit of a difference. But tip my cap to Temple, they're a really
well-coached team, really solid team. They spaced the floor, they passed the
ball well and obviously they have got a number of quality wins under their
belt, so hopefully they can take the next step.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. How do you feel in general you defended the three-point line
tonight?  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: Well, we didn't do a great job. Clearly we know the guys
Enechionyia and Alston and Rose like to shoot the three. They're catch-and-
shoot guys. We were hopeful that we could get to them, close out right away
and there were a number of times we did a good job on it, but going backwards,
Enechionyia ended up with a wide open three in the last couple minutes of the
game. But I would have to go back and look at the film, but I have no idea how
he got so open. We were scrambling around, somebody miscommunicated a matchup
probably where we maybe had two guys on one, because I mean he was just wide
open. Those type of things are big plays. We had a couple of miscommunications
defensively at the end of the game that hurt.  
  
There were a lot of plays along the way, but they get a little more magnified
down the stretch. We had a pick-and-roll high where I went with a small
lineup, so that we would switch all the pick-and-rolls, and they turned the
corner and got a layup on one. Again, kind of a miscommunication, I guess with
our guys. One guy thought it wasn't close enough for it to be a pick to
switch, that we should have just stayed. Again, if we talk it out, stay or
switch, then you don't run into those problems.  
  
But I thought that they got too many clean looks, particularly in that second
half, even though they were deep, they were deep looks, but they have that
ability. Just like Cameron Reynolds, our guy, he's got that ability. I'm sure
Coach was saying on the other side that, hey, when Reynolds is there, get up
underneath him, get under his chin, you don't want to give him space. And the
last couple shots that he made, I think that he was back probably further than
where they wanted him to be.  
  
But the big difference for us I think in the three-pointers and in the big
part of the game was Moorman, No. 4, the threes that he hit. There were a
couple of kind of daggers in the sense that you know he's got some of the
ability, but that's not necessarily his game, and they weren't particularly
wide open shots. One I think was with the clock running down, but he pulled
the trigger and he came up big for them.  
  
I'm hopeful that his knee is not a bad injury. Hopefully he is able to recover
and play in the tournament here. But he came in the game and gave them some
value minutes but talk about the threes, the threes he hit were big threes.  
  
Q. Cam, how would you describe the progress of this team from year one
last year to this season? Even your losses down the stretch, a lot of them
were close games. Just how would you describe the progress from this time last
year to now?  
CAMERON REYNOLDS: Yeah, the progress is great. Like you said, we only won six
games last year. We won 14 this year and the games that we lost, five out of
six we lost by a total of 22 points. So everything is right there. We just
have to be a disciplined team at the end of the shot clock.  
  
Q. How far back would you say those last couple of threes you hit
were?  
CAMERON REYNOLDS: I'm not sure, but they went down, so that's the only thing
that really matters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Tulane. Thank you.  
  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: Thank you.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

### [A.J. Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25114)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UCF - 66, East Carolina - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions for Coach and the student-athletes.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I thought it was a great game. Kind of what we
anticipated. When both teams are playing in a do-or-die situation, I think it
brings out the best of the opponent. It brought out the best in us.  
  
Give them a lot of credit, I thought they made a great run in the second half,
cut it to one and that just showed their commitment to trying to compete and
wanting to continue to play. But our guys felt the same way. I thought our
guys were hungry, they still want to play a lot more basketball, and I was
really proud of the way they responded to their run and was able to kind of
build on our lead and establish another run and was able to win a good
basketball game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please, for Coach and the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defense, Terrell Allen had five steals but
overall forcing 20 turnovers. Just talk about your defensive effort.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought it was a great defensive effort. We knew coming into
this game we were going to have to defend well. We hadn't played them since
the beginning of the year, but I had seen them on tape enough to know they
were scoring the basketball well, they were playing with confidence. So we
knew the only way that we have been able to be successful is by hanging our
hat on the defensive end, and I thought our guys gave us a really good effort
tonight.  
  
Q. For A.J. and B.J., you guys have played ECU in March since 2015 and
it hasn't been successful. What was different this time, and did it feel good
to get that March win over them?  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, it definitely felt good. As Coach said, it was a great team
victory. They're a team and a school with a lot of pride, and like Coach said,
we knew they were going to come out and compete the entire game. So we're just
happy to get the win tonight and get ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. From a pride standpoint the last time you guys were here, you guys
lost in the first round. Was that at all in your mind as far as like how you
wanted to come out and kind of get this win?  
A.J. DAVIS: Yeah, I think that was definitely very important to us. Especially
being in Orlando, us being right down the street, I think it was big to be in
front of our fans and in our hometown to come out and get the win. And coming
into this time of year, I think every game is that important.  
  
I know I definitely had that last game on my mind. Last time I was sitting
right here, I was talking about a loss and my season was over, and I didn't
want to be in that same situation. So coming into my senior year I'm glad that
we were able to come in and get this win.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about a little bit Terrell Allen. Is he one of
those guys that you're kind of hoping steps up in this tournament?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, absolutely. I have a lot of confidence in Terrell. He's
done an amazing job for us this season. In B.J.'s absence I thought he really
stepped up and gave us some valuable minutes and he did again tonight. His
role has changed, but he understands that and he's done a really good job of
giving us a nice spark off the bench in a number of games, and he did it again
this evening, and I'm really proud of him.  
  
Q. When ECU went on that run to cut it to one, what was your message to
the team then?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, we needed to get back to the basics. Usually we fuel
what we do defensively and actually A.J. said in the huddle at that timeout
and it was great because echoing the things that we know we talk about, and he
was telling our guys, we feed off our defense and let's not let offense get in
the way of what we do on the defensive end. And that was a mature way of
saying basically, let's continue to defend get out in passing lanes, see if we
can't turn them over, try and get something in transition and get something
easy. And that kind of sparked us, and I thought it was a really good message
to the team and they responded.  
  
Q. How important was the crowd getting behind the guys tonight. It's a
pretty solid crowd tonight, so what were your thoughts on the crowd tonight?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I loved it. Like I said, it's going to be a community effort
for us, and our crowd has always given us great support. That's one thing I
know, when they come out they're going to cheer, they're going to be loud and
that gives us a huge advantage. So I was really happy to see them out there
tonight. I definitely felt their energy, when they got into it with a teammate
or when ECU made a run, I could see the crowd getting into it, they were
responding, and I know that helped our guys down the stretch as well.  
  
Q. Last time you played Houston, sluggish start for the game, you
narrowed it. Talk about Houston as an opponent tomorrow.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: They're a talented team. They're one of the best teams in our
league and they play fast, they have shooting, they have an inside presence,
they're a well-rounded group. So we're going to have to prepare. I hadn't seen
them since that last time we played them. So our preparation starts now. Once
we leave here, we have to watch them a little more, start developing a game
plan for them.  
  
But they have had a really good year and they're playing some good basketball.
They have one of the best players in the country in Rob Gray, and a great
coach in Kelvin Sampson.  
  
Q. You've done the nine o'clock start thing, you've done back-to-back
but you haven't done both. I don't know how you meter out the minutes tonight
to kind of keep yourself fresh for tomorrow or is that a factor or since we're
at tournament time it's not a factor?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I don't think it can be a factor. Whenever you're
playing a situation where it's one-and-done, I don't think you can afford to
be worried about who is playing and who is not playing. You need to make sure
that your guys are out there and giving us what they have.  
  
These players, they train all summer long, they play hard all season. I think
they're capable of playing multiple games in a row at a high level. You're
watching college basketball at this time of year, you see it happening all
over the country, and our guys are no different in that regard. I think our
guys are capable of going out there and maxing out every time they play in a
one-and-done situation like this.  
  
Q. How do you structure out the days when they have these late starts
and what is a day like leading into it?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, we want to break the day up as best we can. Whenever we
have a long day, fortunately we've played some late games this year, so we
kind of have a formula for how we want to prepare our guys. But we like to get
them out of the hotel at least one time to make sure we're not in there all
day, and then pretty much everything else works around our normal routine that
we have set up all season long.  
  
Q. A.J. just said sitting here last year he was talking about a loss.
How important was it for to get this one, get one under your belt and get them
into something as you move on?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, it's definitely important for us. We want to gain some
momentum, you want to come here and you want to win. Everybody's fighting for
a championship. We are as well. This is the opportunity for an AAC
championship. So every one of these games are hugely important. It's a one-
and-done situation.  
  
So I was really proud of our guys. I think our players really responded well
to that, and we have been preparing for this all season. So we're happy that
we're in this situation we're happy that we're still competing.  
  
Q. How do you guys get better? You guys are playing back to back to back
to back, so how do you guys get better from today to tomorrow night when you
guys have to play?  
A.J. DAVIS: As far as getting better, I think we just got to kind of move on.
Learn from our mistakes from the game before and move on to the next game.
Every game is one and done, so we're just taking it one game at a time and
just focusing on the next game plan, and learning what we -- taking what we
did bad from this game and bringing it into the next game.  
  
So I don't think we -- we'll watch this game and see what we did bad, but we
got to move on and just take it one game at a time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: UCF, thank you.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Thanks, guys.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2018

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Kellan Grady](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34946)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Rusty Reigel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34955)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 58, University of Rhode Island 57  
  
BOB McKILLOP: The game is clearly a statement about how strong this conference
is. Rhode Island is going to give people a lot of problems in the NCAA
Tournament. They are as tenacious and tough a defensive team as I've seen in a
long time, other than Virginia. They are just superb.  
  
I thought our guys showed great toughness to be able to build a lead and then
have it evaporate and then be able to come back and take the game. I was
particularly pleased with our defensive effort. That's as good a defense as
we've played all year long.  
  
Q. You went something like 12 minutes without making a field goal. How
were you able to come back from that and still pull out a win?  
BOB McKILLOP: Foul shots win games. We were a very good foul-shooting team,
and I thought we did that very well today. It wasn't as if we didn't get good
shots. I thought we got great shots, but they played even better defense on
those shots.  
  
John had a layup; Kellan had a layup; John had a layup; Kellan had a layup,
and they blocked them. I think they only wound up with four blocks, but boy,
they changed a lot of our shots at the rim and we don't rebound the ball very
well on the offensive glass, so we're getting one look at it.  
  
And then of course, we had some turnovers that just was part their defense and
part us making poor decisions.  
  
Q. Yesterday you took more threes than twos, and today you took 50 field
goal attempts, and only 18 were 3-pointers. Do you feel like Rhode Island had
you a little bit out of your game plan on the offensive side?  
BOB McKILLOP: They have done that to use three games this year, three games
last year, two games the year before. They historically have run off off the
three-point line and they do a marvelous job.  
  
Those guys they are very good basketball players. They would be incredible
defensive backs. Their break on the ball is super, just outstanding break on
the ball. They get us off the line. What happened was they got us off the line
and it opened up the driving lines. Kellan has a drive to the basket. John has
a drive to the basket and they break on the ball and recovering, you saw what
happened.  
  
Q. Seemed like towards the end of the first half their plan was
basically don't let you touch the ball and smother you if you got it. Was
there an adjustment you made in the second half to try to get yourself some
better looks?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: Know, we just wanted to stick to our offense. They were
playing aggressive on me and I was just looking to help people as much as I
could, setting screens, ball screens away, and my teammates also did a good
job of setting screens for me to be able to get open and get those catches.  
  
Q. What was the impact of your team's transition defense? They were not
able to get easy baskets.  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah that was definitely a pivotal part of our scouting report
was making sure we kept them out of transition. Like Coach McKillop said,
their break on the ball is like no other, so we tried to eliminate live ball
turnovers and if we did have any, we were -- you know, we made a big emphasis
to get back on defense, load up, find shooters in transition and try to stop
the ball. I think we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. So your name is going to be called tonight on the selection show. Has
that sunk in yet, that you're going to the NCAA Tournament?  
RUSTY REIGEL: I'd say right now, we're still kind of celebrating the win we
just got, but I think it's definitely in the back of our minds and going to be
in the front very soon. Knowing the coach and the staff we have, we're going
to be preparing for whoever we're going to be matched up with tomorrow, and
that's going to be fun.  
  
Peyton and I made it our freshman year, and getting that experience again is
best thing we could possibly have. I'm so happy for all the young guys, too,
that they get to do it and we're all looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys winning probably steals a bid from somebody else
on the bubble. Is that something you're aware of and does that make it any
sweeter knowing that you guys are in and somebody else may be isn't?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: We really weren't thinking about that. We were just thinking
of focus on this game, and we knew if we won we were getting in. We were just
really focusing on that. We just wanted to go out there and have fun playing
with each other, and that's what we did today and we were able to come away
with the win.  
  
Q. Seems like your eyes light up when you get an isolation look, ball in
your hands. How good does it feel for your team to trust you in those
situations because they clearly look for you to put the ball in the bucket?  
KELLAN GRADY: It's an unbelievable feeling and I am just fortunate to be an a
team where my teammates believe in me, our coaches believe in me and our
assistants believe in me.  
  
We went to a play we've run frequently and we've had a lot of success with
this year and having everyone on your back supporting you, believing in you,
it gives you a lot more confidence and I believe that I think if I had an
empty baseline I could convert or make a play for somebody else and
fortunately, we came up successful on that possession.  
  
Q. Having played in the league all year, did you feel like this was a
league that maybe deserved more than one or more than two NCAA teams?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: Yeah, definitely competing every night, we know it's a tough
league. Anybody can win on any given night, and really beat up on each other.
I mean, there's a lot of talent in this league and hopefully we'll get
multiple teams into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. There's a couple McKillops on the staff and a Reigel. A lot of teams
preach they are one big family, but what is it like to have family on the
staff?  
RUSTY REIGEL: It's funny, sometimes my brother and I will get into it a little
bit more than I would with another assistant coach. He'll whisper something in
my ear during practice, and I'm not sure I like it, but I move on pretty
quickly.  
  
Actually, it's been awesome. It's been amazing being able to communicate with
him and kind of work through different things that you may not have in the
same relationship with another assistant coach. It's a different experience
for sure but I think everybody would say that all the coaches, the assistant
coaches are kind of like big brothers to every one of us and it's pretty cool.  
  
Q. Your team went about 12 minutes-ish without making a field goal and
then you hit the game -- wound up being the game-winner, to then break that
field goal drought. Take me through that final play.  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah, I mean, going through a 12- or 13-minute drought without a
field goal was obviously a bit frustrating, but we kept saying in the time-
outs and the media time-outs, that we were going to stick to our secondary,
our flow, our motion offense because we've had success with it and we got to
the championship game because of it and we trust in each other and trusted in
what we've done all year.  
  
And fortunately with a minute left we were able to score and break that
drought. They had tremendous momentum those last three minutes. I think they
went on a 7-0 or 9-0 run, so to be able to get over that hump, and then credit
to our defense, we got three straight pivotal stops and we were victorious.  
  
Q. Looked like you really stumped E.C. Matthews on that last play for
Rhode Island, getting the ball out of his hands. How did you defend him
there?  
KELLAN GRADY: The goal was to try to keep him from getting to his left hand.
He's a tremendous player; when he's on his left hand, he's about as good as it
gets in this league. He wanted to send it to his right hand and hope that
that's where our help defense was go going to be, and fortunately that's
exactly what happened. We made him give it up. Jeff Dowtin's fadeaway three
was a very difficult shot that we were confident that we could get the
rebound.  
  
Q. That 2-3 matchup first half was effective and put them on their
heels. Is that something that's a common thread in your defensive scheme? How
effective do you think it is?  
BOB McKILLOP: We started using it thanks to one of our assistants Kevin Kuwik
who did the scout for this game. Kevin is sensational and we put it in when we
are in Hawai'i in December, used it against Akron. And I'm the kind of coach
that when a team makes a three, get out of the zone, and we go out, we play
Akron, they made like five threes in the first four or five minutes but we
stayed in the zone. He convinced me; that's how powerful he was in his
conviction.  
  
We stayed in it and it became better and better as the season progressed. It
keeps you out of foul trouble, it gives a different look, it breaks rhythm,
and yes you have to be able to live with threes. I thought it was a pivotal
part of our plan tonight.  
  
Q. I believe Kishawn came into this game 0-of-8 from behind the arc in
the month of March, so how on earth was he able to be so successful, and for a
guy who recruits internationally was the 20-minute drive to Mooresville the
easiest drive of your career?  
BOB McKILLOP: If you ever saw him shoot in practice, we have these shooting
drills. He is spot-on. He doesn't miss. He's got the prettiest-looking
jumpshot, but when he missed a lot of his jumpshots, it was because of a lack
of balance. He has a tendency sometimes to stand up right and not be balanced.  
  
So we showed some clips this morning to him privately about shots he made, and
it was only about ten clips and one of our assistant coaches, Ryan Mee, put it
together, and we showed it to Kishawn and sure enough he goes outs and misses
I think the first one and then he misses a layup, and the layup was the kind
you have nightmares about.  
  
I don't know if you guys have might nightmares. I have nightmares about the
end of semester and I haven't been to class yet -- you have that one?
(Laughter) I also have a run-out layup and I miss it. Well, Kishawn had that
run-out layup, and he missed it. I was just shocked that we'd had success --
and of course he makes the three and he got a little bit hungry when he took
the third one and finally made the third in the second half.  
  
I think it's a tribute to him and his willingness to fight through the
struggles of going 0-8.  
  
What was the second part of the question?  
  
Q. And the drive 20 minutes away?  
BOB McKILLOP: Yeah, he was an easy recruit. I said yes for him. I'm serious.
(Laughter) So you said Yes, Kishawn? You said yes? That was the conversations
on the phone (chuckling).  
  
Q. You guys got off to a slow start to the year, started 5-7, was there
one game that you can point out in your schedule where you feel like you
turned the corner --  
BOB McKILLOP: Yeah, Saint Louis, first game of the new year, we had just
gotten slapped around by Richmond. They played a great game. They just
completely slapped us around. We had come out of Hawai'i, lost two-out-of-
three in Hawai'i. We played some pretty darned good teams, Nevada, Virginia,
North Carolina, that's not chopped liver.  
  
And I Pomeroy, is that one of the ratings? I think had credited the fact we go
to Hawai'i, come back across the country; go to Nevada, come back across the
country; play a neutral site, Carolina, at Virginia. So we played a pretty
tough schedule.  
  
But in the Saint Louis game, at halftime, we were down and we just had
nothing, and we just turned it around in the second half, and it was at that
point, that was a defining moment for our team and then we went on the road to
play at VCU about three weeks ago and beat them and had kind of a convincing
victory, and again, a defining moment.  
  
So we've had some defining moments. I would say those are the two pivotal
ones.  
  
Q. How hard is it -- your guys share the game well, but you also give
them a lot of offensive freedom to score when they get a good look. How hard
is it to mesh those concepts, particularly with young players?  
BOB McKILLOP: The greatest strategy we use offensively is make the other team
defend you. We have got our guys convinced that if they make their cuts, they
make their reads, they pass the ball, they hit the open man, they are going to
-- the defender is going to stand up, turn his head, stop talking, lose sight,
and unfortunately the three D's: Decisions, discipline and details sometimes
escape.  
  
So we made a concerted effort to tell our players: No shortcuts. Because in a
tournament like this shortcuts can develop because fatigued, because of the
pressure of the moment, because the pressure of the defense, and I thought our
guys were great tonight with not taking shortcuts.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2018

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [EC Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34953)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 58, University of Rhode Island 57  
  
DAN HURLEY: Obviously hard-fought, disappointing, disappointing result there.
You know, getting that four-point lead, kind of walk them down and wore them
out with our defense in that second half, obviously it was an intense game,
low-scoring game. Both teams I thought guarded real well. I'm not sure how
many field goals they had in the last ten minutes, 12 minutes, eight minutes,
but having that four-point lead makes it just hurt.  
  
Obviously they were struggling to score a field goal, and the two -- just
those two fouls at the three, after E.C.'s 3, to put us up four, just kind of
not having the discipline -- you know, not having the discipline, or, I guess,
the foul on Jarvis on Gudmundsson on the wild skip pass, and then the off-the-
ball foul I guess on Jeff there, when they were struggling to score a field
goal, were just critical plays in the game.  
  
You know, so putting them in the free throw line at those spots, those spots
hurt. You know, last four minutes in a championship game is usually about who
is going to make the last basket and Kellan Grady delivered the tournament-
winning shot, big-time player.  
  
Credit Davidson. They are a classy program. Great coach. Love those players.
Couldn't have more respect for the way they play, the way they carry
themselves. You know, so if you are going to lose to anyone in this league,
you know, I guess Davidson, or Bonny's; we've been the three best teams in the
league, but a tough loss.  
  
Q. You feel behind and sort of came all the way back. How were you
feeling at that point once you took the lead?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Coach told us it's a long game and we were getting tired and we
were hitting shots. I just think they trusted themselves a little bit.
Davidson trusted themselves a little bit more than we did and we made silly
fouls, and you know, they won.  
  
Q. What was the play call isolation right-to-left, I think they took
away your left and wanted to force you right. What was the play call and
secondary play call on that sequence?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: I don't remember. Coach going to help me out.  
  
DAN HURLEY: It was a screen to screener action for him to try to catch it. Am
I allowed to answer?  
  
You know, we had a lot of guys struggling offensively out there. E.C. was the
one guy, obviously, that had it going for us. You know, so we tried to run
some screen to screener, and they did a good job of taking it away. You know,
threw it to Jeff, and Jeff probably should have gone downhill and tried to get
something at the paint.  
  
Q. What's the approach going to be for you guys moving forward and
trying to move on from this?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: It's kind of hard to think about that right now but I'm proud
of my guys. Coach is proud of us. We've still got games to play and that's the
good part. We are going to take this one on the chin. Davidson, you know,
shout-out to them. They played harder than us, and we're going to move forward
but very proud of my guys and the coaches and our school.  
  
Q. These three games in particular, how difficult was it -- how hard did
it feel being the top seed in having these teams come at you the way they
did?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: I mean, that's what we wanted. We work hard for this. It's very
hard to repeat; we knew that. We accepted the challenges. We just came up
short.  
  
But like I said, we don't have regrets about this whole season or the games we
played and lost. You know, like I said, I'm very proud of my teams, Coach
Hurley, the whole school, everybody.  
  
Q. I know your college career isn't over quite yet. As a senior, wonder
if you can look back and give me any of your legacy -- before you guys got
here, I think you went well over a decade without making the tourney and now
you've made back-to-back I think. Any thoughts on the legacy or senior
class?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: This guy right here, man, he found me. He came down to the
Peach down in Atlanta and he found me. I'm like, "What, Rhode Island? Coach
Hurley?" I didn't really know so much. He talked about this a long time ago
before anybody even thought about it. So like I said, I love this guy. I love
our school, and like I said, we got more games to play and hopefully we can
make a run in the Dance.  
  
Q. They were able to get back in transition, defend the rim, also made a
lot of shots. You couldn't get out on the break. Talk about the lack of
transition points and how that impacted the game?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, I mean, they literally sent nobody to the offensive glass.
They had six offensive rebounds. It's just hard to run on them. Plus, it's
tiring to guard them, you know, because you have to chase them. You have to
chase them around the court for two hours, you know, and it's just they do a
great job of getting back. Because the only offensive rebounds that they
really get are the long ones off of threes.  
  
You know, again, we just didn't have enough guys I think have good offensive
games, and then, you know, the free throw line came back to haunt us. In a
game that you lose by one -- and then again, putting them on a foul line in a
championship game it's about scoring buckets at the end to win a championship.
On the foul line in a championship game in the last four minutes, you know,
it's about scoring buckets at the end. To win a championship, off-the-ball
fouls, you can't commit those, or they just can't happen, not in a
championship game.  
  
Q. Obviously you wanted to win this game but for the A-10 to get three
teams into the NCAA Tournament, likely, what does that mean for the league?  
DAN HURLEY: Well, I guess it's what the league -- I didn't -- that wasn't what
I wanted when I woke up. I guess the league is probably happy, and I'm happy
for Davidson. Listen, their non-conference, they had a very difficult non-
conference schedule. You know, it took Kellan Grady a little while to start
playing like a first-team all conference level player, so he took kind of the
whole non-conference slate, which was a very, very difficult schedule that
they had, and so obviously their non-conference put them in -- it gave them no
chance to get an at-large, but they have played like an NCAA Tournament team
the entire conference play, and you know, they have got a chance, whoever is
going to draw them, is not going to want to see their name next to them, you
know, at 6 o'clock today.  
  
Q. What did it mean to you to look up and see so many URI fans over the
weekend? Seemed like you had the best support of any team here.  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, the growth, the fans deserved the -- listen, we didn't
deserve it any more than Davidson did in terms of the teams. Davidson
obviously earned it and beat us but just our fans, the way they showed up, the
way they showed up the whole year in the Orion Center and the records that
we've broken in attendance and just the way that the fan base has grown is
just something you're so proud of.  
  
Even as brutal as that was to take, just walking off the court, it's hard not
to just be so proud of the players and the program and the fans and how it's
grown and you know, now they will follow us to, you know, wherever we get sent
at 6 o'clock.  
  
Q. I would imagine incoming into this game, if I had told it you was
going to be played in the 50s and sort of be a fistfight the way it was, you
would have liked your chances.  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, we've shown the versatility this year, like yesterday, to
win a high-scoring one. If you would have said to me that we were going to
keep them to six made threes, and that three of them were going to come from
Pritchett, you know, and then Aldridge would score 13 and not make a three, I
would have felt pretty good about our chances.  
  
Again it was just they are a better defensive team -- they are a better
defensive team than they are given credit for. They are a tougher team than I
think they have been in the past. They made some 50/50 plays on balls today
and some really hard-nosed plays and -- but yeah, up four, I felt like we were
going to walk them down in the second half. We did, we just couldn't make that
extra basket.  
  
Again, when they were struggling to make a field goal, I don't know how many
field goals they scored in the last ten minutes of the game -- one? One field
goal in the last ten minutes of the game, it's hard to accept, I guess, those
four free throws in the last three-plus minutes, so that's one that's going to
sting because we guarded the heck out of them and our guys fought their hearts
out.  
  
Q. You guys won the first 13 games in conference play, but now you've
dropped three of the last five and four of the last eight. Are you at all
concerned about your team's recent performance heading into the Tournament?  
DAN HURLEY: No. We've played -- we've had an amazing season. We had a meltdown
in our last game. We wrapped up our conference in game 16, and you know, we
obviously -- Davidson is a good team. Bonny's on the road, Davidson there,
Davidson here today; had late leads and just didn't close the games out.  
  
But they are an NCAA-calibre team. St. Bonny's is an NCAA-calibre team. You
have to be able to finish games. If anything my concern would be just
finishing and just a little bit of the free throw lack of confidence at the
line, is not who we have been and it showed up a little late in the season.
That's a little concerning.  
  
Q. Just curious if you were aware of the impact this result might have
on your brother, Bobby's team. If so, your thoughts on that.  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, well, I think you're aware, you're aware of bracketology in
the summer. You're aware -- you're aware of everything.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Matt Mobley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32870)

### [Jaylen Adamss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34944)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 82, St. Bonaventure 70  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: All the credit goes to Davidson. I thought every time we broke
down, they hit a three, it seemed like. They missed 13 of them but seemed like
they only missed about three of them. But they shot the ball really well. They
are really hard to guard, with Aldridge inside and you try to double him, and
they surround with four shooters. When the big guys start shooting the ball
the way they shot it tonight, they are really difficult to guard.  
  
You know, I thought the effort was there for us. The execution wasn't great. I
thought they got us twice on out-of-bounds plays. I think the game was a two-
point game when they got us back-to-back, and five points in two out-of-
bounds, which were two big plays of the game.  
  
But I thought we fought. We struggled at times but I thought Amadi did a
really good job in the second half of getting them some stuff inside. You
know, these two guys beside me, we wouldn't have been in the game without
them.  
  
Like I said, you know, it was a great effort. Davidson just out played us.
Shot the ball really well, and they deserved the win.  
  
Q. Obviously not the outcome you would have wanted, but can either of
you just describe maybe the range of emotions you're feeling right now,
knowing that you didn't win today, and won't be playing for the Championship,
but there might be something tomorrow that's pretty special.  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, obviously the loss hurts. We would love to play for the
Championship tomorrow, but we're going to get back to campus tonight or
tomorrow, watch Selection Sunday and just hope our name is called.  
  
JAYLEN ADAMS: More of the same. Obviously we want to be playing in the
championship tomorrow. Didn't go in our favor. So we're just going to hope for
the best tomorrow.  
  
Q. Yesterday in this spot, you cited the 2016 tournament snub. Looking
at the body of work you've accumulated this season, how do you feel about your
chances tomorrow? Are you more confident?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, I think we have a little better chance than we did a couple
years ago, but like you said, nothing's guaranteed. I think we put ourselves
in a good spot, though. We'll see what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. A couple years ago, you talked to Mark about trying to beef up the
non-conference schedule, and obviously you guys did that this year. How
important do you think that was when you look back on it now, today, at the
body of work you've been able to build here?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I think we have a special non-conference, one of the best non-
conference I've had since I've been here. We beat some good teams. Hopefully
it helps us tomorrow. It's not something we really know for sure. Like I say,
we got some quality wins and hopefully it's enough tomorrow.  
  
Q. Their first 14 shots were threes and they hit seven of them. When I
asked Bob about it, he said basically your defense forced them to do that
because you had the middle clock and you're playing your defense inside.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, like I said, they are a tough team to guard, and not only
can they shot threes, but they can talk you off the bounce and then they throw
the ball to Aldridge, and you can't play him one-on-one.  
  
Usually teams have two or three shooters, so when they wing the ball, there's
always one or two guys that can't shoot. But with Davidson, they have got --
you know when they throw the ball into the post, they have four guys
surrounding him who can shoot, so your rotations are that much harder. And
when they shoot the ball, like the way they shot it tonight, they are hard to
beat. I'm not sure how many teams in the country can beat them when they shoot
it like that.  
  
Q. So kind of similar, but you guys lost Stockard yesterday, and you
lost Ayeni at halftime, and it looked like you went small for a few
possessions in the second half. Can you just walk us through the thought
process of trying to defend a team like Davidson that has so many shooters on
the floor?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I don't know if we went small. We had Tshiefu in there because
that's the last guy we had. When Courtney went done down, we were shorthanded
and when Josh got hurt at halftime, just brings another guy into the mix. You
know that, guy is 6-6, he's not 6-8.  
  
But you just try to do the best job you can with Davidson. You try to keep
them out of transition and try to get to the shooters. At times, we did, and
they hit some big shots, and sometimes we didn't and they hit those shots.
When they are shooting the ball like they did from threes, as I said earlier,
they are a difficult team to guard and difficult team to beat.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your resumé going into this thing?  
MARK SCHMIDT: We can't have a better -- I don't know if we could have done any
better. You know, going in, I think we had a 21 RPI. We won 13 straight games.
We've had some huge non-conference wins. We've had some big wins in our
league.  
  
I don't think there was a hotter team going into the postseason than us. You
know, so the resumé, everybody talks about two years ago. Our resumé is better
than it was two years ago, and in my opinion, we should have been in two years
ago.  
  
So I think we're going to have a good day tomorrow. Those guys deserve it. You
know, so let's pray that we do.  
  
Q. Looking back, I believe you made the NCAA as a tournament and a coach
in the past. What memories do you have of Selection Sunday from the past?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I tell the kids all the time, as a kid growing up, your dream is
to play Division I basketball and ultimately to be a pro. Your dream, when
you're a Division I player, is to play in the Big Dance. I tell the players,
if your name is selected, it's one of the best days of your life, and probably
your best day of your life in terms of a basketball player, as a college
basketball player.  
  
Those guys, I think what they have done this year, I think they deserve to
have those goosebumps and to have that moment. I've been lucky and believe me,
I wasn't a great player but I was on really good teams, and we went to three
of them. Every one of them was special, and hopefully our guys get that chance
tomorrow.  
  
Q. When they are just hitting threes at the clip that they did tonight,
how much more pressure does that maybe put on you guys from just an execution
standpoint?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Execution from what? From offensively?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Doesn't matter if they are hitting threes. When a team scores,
and continues to score, you know, you've got to do a better -- you've got to
execute down at your end. If not, the lead grows. So any time a team is
playing well offensively, you better match it. If not, then you'd better get
some stops. We couldn't get stops, and you know, we had our chances.  
  
It was, I think till the last probably four minutes of the game, we were right
there. We just couldn't get that one or two stop -- one or two stops, and we
didn't execute the out-of-bounds plays; that's a big part of what we do is
executing on out-of-bounds plays, and we got some offensively. But they got us
a couple times and that was disappointing.  
  
Q. We've talked about what the Tournament, getting there with a resumé,
but what would it mean to you, and maybe the guys on the podium, more so, what
it would mean to them?  
MARK SCHMIDT: It would mean everything to them. Matt was on that team but he
was a red-shirt, and if you sat in that room that day two years ago, it was
heartbreaking because those guys put everything into it and they thought they
were in. So it would mean the world to them.  
  
You know, as a coach, I've been there. This is not about me and me
experiencing it. It's about our players experiencing it, and putting all that
hard work that they have done, for Jay and Idris, it's been four years of hard
work, and it's been difficult at times.  
  
You know, for them to be able to realize a dream, that's what we do as
coaches, to help them realize it and hopefully they will have that chance
tomorrow.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Kellan Grady](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34946)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 82, St. Bonaventure 70  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Congratulations to St. Bonaventure on a tremendous year, an
absolutely sensational year. Courtney Stockard, a vital part of their success
this year, did not have the joy of playing in this game, and I'm saddened
about that for him, and for St. Bonaventure. They certainly are, in my
judgment, deserving of an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament and I hope the
committee feels that that's something that they have earned through their body
of work this year.  
  
Q. After a couple of near misses, you're going to the title game for the
first time. What is that like?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: It's a great feeling. I mean, the last three years, we've got
to the semifinals and was unable to pull it out.  
  
This year, a lot of upper leadership who has been through that position with a
lot of seniors, and we knew we had to just find a way to finish it and find a
way to win there to give us a chance to get back to the championship, and it's
a good feeling.  
  
Q. After losing the game of the year to St. Bonaventure a couple weeks
ago, what does it mean to come out here on such a big stage and take care of
business?  
KELLAN GRADY: It's definitely a really gratifying feeling; to battle for three
over times and give it our all and just come up short was obviously very
disappointing, but we didn't hang our heads after the game and we still
believed that we were capable of beating them and continuing to play well.  
  
So it was just a great feeling to be able to do it in the conference
tournament and to get a chance to play in the Championship.  
  
Q. 24 points and seven rebounds. Can you tell us what goes into a
performance like this?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: Just trying to stay active out there on the floor. Teammates
did a great job of finding me for some open looks and I was just trying to
continue to crash the glass. I mean, they got -- I don't know how many how
many offensive rebounds they got about, but I know Coach probably wasn't happy
about the number of that but we were just trying to battle and keep fighting
in there, so every opportunity I was trying to sink it and grab a rebound; and
on the offensive end, I was just trying to stay aggressive.  
  
Q. There was a point where you guys were up by one and St. Bonaventure
was coming back and the crowd was coming into it and there were two in-bounds
play under the basket. Did you take it upon yourself to just take over at that
point in the game?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: Well, I mean, they made a run. They came back, cut it down to
one point and the crowd was loud. We just knew we wanted to get a basket to
just kind of silence the crowd. We ran the play for the corner three and I got
that, which just kind of a little momentum-booster back for us.  
  
Then they overplayed the next one, so I had the back cut for the dunk and that
just kind of gave us a little more momentum to boost the lead right there for
us.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at all in the first half about how many open looks
you guys were able to get? Looked like you had a little more time and space
than you had in the previous game, and when you guys were open, you know, you
guys were incredible in the first half from long range.  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: Yeah, we had great ball movement in the first half and got a
lot of open looks and we put them in kind of scrambling situations where we
were able to throw the next one and get some open looks and people were able
to knock them down. Rusty Reigel stepped up and had two big threes in the
first half for us.  
  
Q. For either of you, you made 16 threes in the triple overtime game,
and another 16 threes tonight. Is it something that you just matched up well
with this team? Is it a specific kind of defense or size or anything that
gives you guys such amazing stats against them?  
KELLAN GRADY: Not sure it's exactly how we matchup against them. I think it's
just us sticking to our game plan and sticking to what we do best, which is
move the ball, attack appropriately, find the open man, throw to the next one.
I think we just both, in the last two games, we have done a very good job at
attacking when we are supposed to and throwing the next one, and we have been
fortunate to get good looks and luckily we've been able to make most of them.  
  
Q. I forget the exact number, but something like 14 of your first field
goal attempts were all three-pointers. Was that part of the game plan or
taking what the defense gave you?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: It was definitely taking what the defense gave us. We wanted
to try to get inside-outlooks and even though a lot of threes were taken, I
thought we were getting some good ensued outlooks early on. But we definitely
wanted to try to stick to getting to the basket and later in the second half
it's kind of stretched out a little bit and we were able to get some the
basket with some curls and stuff like that.  
  
Q. You mentioned that the Bonny's crowd had pretty loud atmosphere. How
do you combat that atmosphere and how do you handle the pressure?  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: That's really just from playing all throughout the year. I
mean, four years of experience and Kellan just playing all year in atmospheres
like that, it's just how you grow over the year.  
  
You noticed that when the crowd is into it, you've just got to relax and stick
to the game plan and just stick to attacking them. That's what we did tonight.  
  
Q. You knocked down a lot of shots but John and Rusty with eight assists
and no turnovers. How did that help provide those looks and make those
opportunities possible?  
KELLAN GRADY: John did a tremendous job of attacking appropriately and really
making the defense collapse. I mean, in the last four minutes, John attacked
left and the defense collapsed and Peyton got a wide-open three on the right
wing which was a big momentum-booster for us; and Rusty was doing the same
things when his guys are over playing and he would take a hard dribble or two
and the defense would collapse and we would get good looks. They were a
pivotal part of our game today and they did a great job.  
  
Q. You probably have more tournament championship experience than
anybody. You've been in so many. When you're entering a title game, what kind
of message do you approach or how do you motivate the guys to try to come out
successful?  
BOB McKILLOP: I've not even thought about that at this point. I will certainly
spend the next two or three hours putting my thoughts together. We have a 7:00
dinner; I think after the dinner, we'll review that.  
  
At this point, I'm a jumbled mess in terms of my mind.  
  
Q. You rode on Rusty Reigel a lot in the second half. What did you see
out of him?  
BOB McKILLOP: He wears Davidson on his heart and he played like it. You know,
I coached his dad. I coached his brother. His brother's an assistant. He's
wanted to go to Davidson since he's a little kid. You have a kid like that in
your program, he's going to fight, and he fought.  
  
Q. Your first 14 shots for threes, you made seven of them. Was that a
game plan?  
BOB McKILLOP: It was great defense by St. Bonaventure. In the overtime game,
Kellan Grady really attacked the rim, and you saw he attacked the rim early on
and got the charge.  
  
They swarmed the basket very, very well. He made one layup in that sequence, I
think best side, baseline drive, and he tear-dropped and he made it, but there
were two guys waiting for him right there and it could have almost -- one more
step and it could have been a second foul on him; so credit St. Bonaventure's
defense.  
  
Q. You said in your opening remarks that you think that in your mine,
they are a tournament team. Is that an easy conclusion that you draw? Is it a
no-brainer? Does it take any thought? Is it obvious to you?  
BOB McKILLOP: As I've watched a 13-game winning streak, and as I've watched
who they have beaten this year, it's not that it's a no-brainer, but I think
it's something that when you look at bubble teams, they clearly are a team
that should be off the bubble and in the Tournament.  
  
The footnote to the question about Peyton getting that three-pointer and the
dunk; I have a tremendous assistant coaching staff, and those two calls were
made by Matt McKillop, who was the St. Bonaventure scout, and that happens a
lot on our bench. I allow our assistant coaches to have tremendous input
because my job is to give them an opportunity to be a head coach sometime in
their life.  
  
So I think Matt deserves credit. He's the one that made those two calls and I
just communicated it, and sure enough, they both worked out for five points in
a row.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [Nick Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34939)

### [Shavar Newkirk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34911)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
University of Rhode Island 90, Saint Joseph's 87  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: A couple of weeks ago, we lost to George Mason at home on a
last-second shot, and some would take it harshly but I told my team, that day,
we got exactly what we deserved. We had trailed by 20, worked our way back.
But we had not really made an emotional commitment that night to the game. Now
it turns out two guys were sick; they didn't want to say anything, because
James Demery was out.  
  
And tonight, the opposite is true. We didn't get exactly what we deserved.
That was a championship effort. Six guys in double figures, ten turnovers --
really, nine, nine turnovers. The last one, that's just silly. That's just
silly that a guy would take away the kid's chance to fire up a half-court
shot. That's just silly.  
  
But it was the offensive rebounds. Great credit to Rhode Island. Maximum
effort. Fabulous fan support, which is great for the league, and a game that I
think was worthy to be seen by the whole country.  
  
So we congratulate them, wish them well tomorrow, and then next week as they
play more basketball.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned the offensive rebounds. There was one sequence later
in the second half where they got two, got a pass out to the wing and it led
to a big shot, going up by seven. Can you describe that play and what that
felt like? Did that feel like a back-breaker at all?  
NICK ROBINSON: It was really just how the whole game was going. We lacked
physicality today, and that is -- that's why the outcome was what it was. If
we came and we controlled the boards, it wouldn't have been a problem.  
  
Q. Obviously today wasn't the outcome you wanted, but can you take
anything from the way you all finished this season, came back from a really
bad place, to get yourselves into this position; and even in the game today,
you have the lead, to go up -- they take the lead, they go up by seven, and
you guys still keep fighting. Can you take anything from that about you guys
as players?  
SHAVAR NEWKIRK: That just let me know that Saint Joseph is a championship
team. Next year I believe that we'll win the Championship next year.  
  
NICK ROBINSON: I would just feel like we just have a never-quit attitude as a
group, and we're all brothers and we just continue to fight for each other,
and it showed towards the end of the season. We never gave up, even though our
record wasn't what it should have been, because we didn't finish games well,
but it never quit, and it showed during the end of the season during that last
month of basketball.  
  
Q. Shavar, looked like you played for a few minutes after you first
tweaked your angle, did you re-injure it at any point or did it get worse?  
SHAVAR NEWKIRK: Yeah, it just got worse. I thought I could play through it.
And it just was a nagging pain, so I didn't want to jeopardize the team on
myself, so I sat out.  
  
Q. Shavar went out with a little bit under two minutes left for the
game. How did that change your ends-of-game strategy, if at all?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, he's not going to rebound, but I think the ball was
broken loose a couple times, and he hobbled -- we wouldn't be able to use his
straight-ahead speed. We had a couple of different wrinkles. We made some deep
threes there. Cesco made a three; Nick made a three. We were trying to get
Taylor Funk to trail and flip a flip-back three.  
  
But look, he gave everything that he had, and he got clearance to go back in.
I would never jeopardize anybody going back in. You know, I know more than I
ever have wanted to know about medical stuff, so you know, I listen to the
doctors and our trainers. We have the best guys. They told me he couldn't go
and we just went to -- I'm not a next-man-up. I think that's a myth. That
might be true in pro sports, when the next guy is, you know, a millionaire,
too.  
  
But here, we don't have anybody like Shavar. We're going to, but we don't have
anybody like him on our bench, or they would be playing, and that's been the
same all year. Like we don't have anybody like Charlie Brown or Fresh Kimble
or James in the games he missed or Nick had missed a game. So it's not really
next man up; it's can this guy do enough to keep our puzzle together.  
  
Q. There was a point during the bad stretch where you kind of said this
team didn't have an Alpha dog. I don't know if there's an Alpha dog in there,
but can you talk about the way this team came together as an effort and
finished this season the way they did?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Shocked me to be honest with you. I am just shocked. I've said
it all year. I've said it to them and I'll say it again. It's not a real
mature, manly group, and it took a long time.  
  
We went to Davidson and we didn't compete. We were -- it was just -- there was
a drastic difference between the two teams. We had a day off and we just came
back and just said, we're going back to this idea. Today is the only day.
Let's be a championship team today.  
  
And they practiced better. Shavar got a little bit more vocal. Shavar played
better, too. He wasn't injured. For four-fifths of the year, he was an injured
kid playing.  
  
I think that they just put their head down, and they never overreacted. Like
if you went back, which I did last night; if you go back and watch the Rhode
Island game, there's no stupidity. There's no like pointing to a crowd.
There's no sshhing a crowd. They just made the next play and the next play and
the next play, and we did the exact same thing here for about 34 minutes, and
then the pounding, the physical pounding got to be too much, 19 offensive
rebounds.  
  
Here was the number: We had 16 turnovers in the last game. If that number was
half, eight, we gave up 16 offensive rebounds last game; if that number was
eight, I knew we were playing tomorrow. They had 19 offensive rebounds and we
had nine and one bogus turnover.  
  
Q. You had said yesterday, you were looking for low 70s to give yourself
a chance to win. When did you know that that was not this type of game and
what did you do to make those kinds of adjustments for this game?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, obviously at halftime, it's 47-40, and you're thinking,
what is the number that we're going to have to get to.  
  
I still thought it would be high 70s, because I thought both teams would bring
it down. But I give the crowd on both sides a lot of credit. They gave energy
to kids who were playing their second day in a row, and you know, at some
point you look up and say -- you know, there's going to be a point in time --
I'll be honest with you. There's going to be a point in time when I'm
daydreaming this summer and I'll say, you know what, that's pretty good. It
took 90 to beat us. It took 90 to beat us. Anything short of 90, we would have
won that game.  
  
So a couple years ago, we won the Atlantic 10 Championship and people said to
me, was that fabulous. I said, no, we lost the game at Davidson, 94-91. I
can't ever imagine one of my teams scoring 91 points and losing. We lost a
game at Bonaventure, 99-96 or something like that, 96-93. I was like, man,
that's pretty good hoop. I mean, seriously.  
  
We're walking out of here having shot 56 percent against that defense. It
hurts. It hurts because we're collecting our uniforms, but we're not walking
out of here chumps. We can walk out as champs.  
  
Thank you very much.

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Andre Berry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34940)

### [Jeff Dowtin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33200)

### [Fatts Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34941)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
University of Rhode Island 90, Saint Joseph's 87  
  
DAN HURLEY: Obviously a pretty exciting -- pretty exciting semifinal Saturday
game. You know, two teams that were desperate to win, No. 1. For me, again,
thoughts and prayers to the great Campanella family of Rhode Island.
Inspirational to us the whole year, the way he fought till the end.  
  
Credit to Saint Joe's. Coach Martelli, they are going to be a big problem next
year with that group of young guys. They are losing two tremendous seniors and
the job that Coach Martelli did with the injuries that he dealt with the whole
year, he was my vote for Coach of the Year this year in the conference. I
thought he did an amazing job.  
  
They were a little bit, their style I think was a little bit of our
kryptonite. But we had a great season. We have championship culture,
championship DNA, and we showed it today in a game that we had to fight our
tail off to win.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the sequence with about 30 seconds left and
you were isolated and hit the three pointer, just take us through what you
saw, what you thought?  
JEFF DOWTIN: Yeah, Coach drawed up an amazing play. I came off the ball
screen; Dre, Ro, I think both of them, went to Dre when he roll (ph) and I
just stepped back behind the three point line and open and took the shot and I
was able to make it.  
  
Q. Did you know going into this game that you were going to be a big
part of the game plan against the zone?  
ANDRE BERRY: I just go into the game just like every game, find my spots. My
guards do a great job of finding me in open places. Set screens to get me in
and the guard open and they just find me around the rim.  
  
Q. There were a few possessions where it was pretty clear to everyone
that you were going to be shooting a 3-pointer. When you get in the zone, is
it just give me the ball and get out of the way, that kind of mentality?  
FATTS RUSSELL: Honestly when Jeff comes off a screen, he always finds me. So I
always find an open spot when he comes off the screen because he causes so
much attention, and my job is easy, just shoot.  
  
Q. You obviously shot the ball a lot better in the second half. Do you
think it was a change in game plan or do you think you -- were they doing
something different or was it just you guys made shots that you weren't making
the first half?  
JEFF DOWTIN: I guess it just took us awhile for us to settle in, into the
moment. I guess for the first half we were rushing our shots a little bit but
we were taking good shots knowing that we could make them and down the
stretch, Fatts hit big threes and Dre hit a crucial layups, Stan, J.T.,
everybody. Jarvis hit two back-to-back threes and that was helpful. We've been
in the gym a lot lately, being able to hit open shots, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Fatts, this is the most threes you guys have made in a game this
season. Obviously the last time you played them, it was very difficult from
behind the arc. When were you able to convince yourselves that this game would
be different, if you saw them again in the A-10 Tournament?  
FATTS RUSSELL: Honestly, they kind of hurt us, beating us on senior night. Our
seniors mean a lot to us, so I mean, we took that kind of personal and we were
in the gym heavy ever since then.  
  
Q. Dan, can you take us through Jeff's evolution as a player over the
course of the season?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, we saw it last year. I'm not sure what his record is as a
starter, but you know, since he's been in the lineup, it's been a game changer
for us. He's just -- he's a winner, high IQ. Makes big shots. Keeps everyone
around him calm. Great leader. You know, and he's got these physical
attributes, too, his length. He's becoming a better shooter.  
  
Obviously that three he hit, that's how you win. That's how you get to
championship games. That's how you advance in tournaments. You recruit and
nurture talent like that, and you know, he was a shockingly under-recruited
player, and we were fortunate to get him.  
  
Q. The same question that I asked Fatts: How were you guys able to
discard the regular season result, whether it be the loss, the manner of the
loss, and convince the guys that today was going to be different?  
DAN HURLEY: Well, you know what was strange was that we weren't as bad
defensively in this one -- or in the first one. I think the first game at the
17:00 mark, they had 28 points. When we went back and watched the film, it was
almost unwatchable, the amount of open shots we missed, the amount of layups
we missed. The zone is something that Coach really just started playing
recently. It's not a staple of Saint Joe's basketball.  
  
A big part of what we wanted to do, which we didn't do the first time, was to
get that ball to the high post, put some shooters in the corners, and then
really try to find Andre against their smaller wings, because when the ball
goes to the high post, their center would take the free throw line.  
  
We were getting clean looks from three and we were getting Dre in the paint.
We played great offense today. Overall, 43 percent. We didn't finish
everything around the basket but 22 assists, five turnovers, made 14 threes,
you know, we were much -- we almost doubled the amount of points we scored at
the Orion Center.  
  
Q. They have got great downhill drivers and they have got a lot of paint
touches in the first half. What was the message at halftime, and then your
thoughts on how the guys responded.  
DAN HURLEY: Well, it's an issue to play those guys. Again, they are a little
bit of our kryptonite with the play that they play offense, because they
invert you with the forwards that can shoot the three. All three of those guys
can put it on the floor and hit the three, and then all their guards can get
downhill and get to the front of the rim.  
  
We're at our best when we're playing, you know, against more of a system-type
of offensive team where we can kind of speed them up. Speeding Newkirk up and
speeding Demery up is probably the opposite of the way you want to play those
guys.  
  
So I think we were nervous about this game coming in because we just -- the
style wasn't great for how we guard. We did a better job in the second half,
even though it was a shootout of at least making things harder, at least from
the three-point line, minus a couple of those bombs they hit late, crazy.  
  
Q. This is your second Atlantic 10 Championship Final. How does this run
in terms of the team, in terms of feel and emotion around it, compare to last
year's run?  
DAN HURLEY: Well, you know what, last year we were much more back-against-the-
wall. We were fighting for our lives on the bubble coming in, but we were on a
run. We were playing so well.  
  
And this year, we were kind of feeling safely in, and we lost our last two
games, even though I thought we played, you know, pretty well at Davidson,
minus that last 40 seconds.  
  
But what we talked about is what it felt like on Sunday last year, you know,
landing in t f green and having hundreds of fans. We want to experience that
again, and we want to try to force Commissioner McGlade to hand us a third
straight trophy. I mean, that's an exciting feeling, so that's what we've
talked about.  
  
Q. With Jared Terrell having a poor shooting night, what do you think it
says about the team that guys like Jarvis and Fatts accepted up and filled
that role for him?  
DAN HURLEY: We needed that. I know that there's some Tweets at times that we
have the deepest backcourt in the country and it hasn't felt that way, maybe
recently, but it sure felt that way today. I mean, that was not Jared's best
performance, and he's carried us a lot this year.  
  
What Fatts Russell did in his 18 minutes, and I think Jarvis came into this
game having a rough, rough stretch. And David Cox, had a great sitdown with
him last night and this morning; I think he did a great job of getting his
head right.  
  
We kind of got back today to who we have been the whole year, and you know,
we've got eight starters, and if a couple of them don't show up, we can beat
you with several other guys.  
  
Q. Andre probably gave you the best game of his career today. Really
kept you guys in the first half when it seemed like he was the only one that
could get anything to fall. Did you see that coming or was that something you
know he had in him?  
DAN HURLEY: Well, we had 40 points at halftime. Our issue, I don't think in
the first half, wasn't necessarily our offense. Although you're 100 percent
correct; Andre was a huge presence.  
  
Just because of the way that they were playing that zone defense, you know,
there were going to be high-low opportunities for him. You know, he's another
guy that he played more minutes than he's played in his entire career, and he
hit a little bit of a wall, late.  
  
So I think that that week off between Davidson and this game today was really
good for him, and the players followed the game plan and looked for him and
did their part.  
  
Just one thing, too. It's a great feeling to -- it's a great feeling to
participate in the Championship Game this weekend with another great Rhode
Island program, PC. Good luck to Providence tonight.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Matt Mobley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32870)

### [LaDarien Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34917)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Bonaventure - 83, Richmond - 77  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: I thought we struggled early. I think both teams probably had
nerves, especially us being the first game. But I thought -- and I always tell
our guys, the first five minutes of the second half, the first 10 possessions
of the second half are critical, and I thought Matt did a heck of a job to get
us going, built that, whatever, 14-, 15-, 18-point lead, and then we just held
on. We didn't play great offensively. I thought we did a good job defensively
for the most part. We didn't make our foul shots. You know, in tournament
play, defend, rebound, take care of the basketball and you've got to make your
foul shots, and every time you go to the foul line and you miss it, it's like
a turnover.  
  
I thought we did a good job offensively. We shoot 58 percent, 52 percent from
beyond the arc, but we miss 11 foul shots, and that's an area that we need to
improve on. But it was a good win for us. Courtney got hurt in the last 10
minutes, and I thought LaDarien did a really good job coming in and playing
the 4 position, which he hasn't played a ton of. But we persevered. We found a
way. We dealt with some adversity, and we made enough plays to win the game
and win our 13th straight.  
  
Q. Matt, Jaylen Adams only scoring five points, can you talk about your
game that first half and coming out in the second half to pick up the load for
your co-A-10 Player having arguably his worst game of the season?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, we told each other last year that no matter what, both of
us can't have an off game at the same time, so you know, he was struggling a
little bit, wasn't really getting open looks. They did a great job defending
him. So I had a lot of open looks. Teammates did a great job of finding me,
and I was knocking down the shots. I just wanted to keep giving us a little
confidence and push the lead out the second half.  
  
Q. Matt, you set an A-10 tournament record for threes in a game tonight
with nine. We've seen you have these kinds of games a lot during the season.
Was it just another one of those kinds of games, or was it something, the way
they were playing you guys defensively that allowed you to kind of go off
again?  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, like I said earlier, I just think my teammates did a
great job of finding me when they were rotating and they weren't -- Richmond
wasn't finding me, so teammates did a great job passing me the ball, and I had
the easy job, I was just making the shots. It's just another game, and I'm
just happy we were able to get the win.  
  
Q. Matt, can you explain your mindset, at one point you threw your palms
up like Jordan. Some of them were deep threes. You get into a zone like that,
what's that like?  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, it feels good. Every shot feels like it's going in. Every
shot I took today felt like it was good. You know, when shooters get in that
rhythm, it's hard to get them out of it, and I'm just thankful I was able to
get in a great rhythm today.  
  
Q. LaDarien, your matchup with Golden today, he had a good first half
coming out, seven points, seven boards, finished the game with just nine of
each. Can you talk about any adjustments you made going into the second half
how to guard him?  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: I just tried to get him away from the basket, make him catch
the ball far out. My teammates had my back with over-the-top passes and doing
a good job of just helping behind me, and then we just started swarming and
just making shots difficult, and then went to just get the board and beat up.  
  
Q. Matt, we talked on Tuesday before you guys left about how you want to
win the whole thing while you're here, but do you feel like with tonight's win
you guys maybe secured your place in the NCAA Tournament or come close to
that?  
MATT MOBLEY: I think the only way we can secure our spot is winning the whole
thing, honestly. You know, the snub in 2016, everybody remembers that, and we
don't want to go through that again, so the only way to avoid that is to try
to win this whole thing, so we're going to come back tomorrow, either Saint
Louis or Davidson, and try to get a win.  
  
Q. It seemed like the crowd was really on your side; did it feel like a
home game?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, we knew our fans were going to come out and support. We've
got the best fans in the country. They're going to be everywhere, every
bucket. Definitely felt like a home game a little bit. I'm thankful for all
the fans that come out and support, and we're going to need them all back
tomorrow.  
  
Q. LaDarien, you personally just kind of finished strong tonight because
the last field goal you guys had was at 6:30 and then the rest of the way you
got some big free throws, some big rebounds for you personally. How nice was
it to finish as strong as you did?  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: I missed like seven free throws, I expected it. I wanted
each time I stepped up there to go there confidently. I be in the gym all the
time working on free throws. I was just shooting bad, but then my teammates
and the coaches were just giving me confidence every time to step up there and
knock them down and just keep attacking the glass.  
  
Q. Mark, can you give us an update on Stockard and the severity of his
injury?  
MARK SCHMIDT: No, I can't. I don't know.  
  
Q. Is it a knee?  
MARK SCHMIDT: No, it's a hamstring. No knee.  
  
Q. Two things: One, you stressed starting the second half fast, came out
10 for 10, really seemed to get the game in control, but that it wasn't.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we started -- as I said earlier, in my opening remarks,
the first five minutes, the first 10 possessions of the second half are
critical. I thought, as Matt talked about, he had some big shots, and we came
out red hot, and we needed to do that. We got off to a rocky start, but Matt
was -- and Jay didn't play the game Jay typically plays, so we needed somebody
to step up, and Matt did a really good job in getting us going in the second
half.  
  
Q. Mark, what did you see from Richmond as they were making that
comeback? What did they exploit and what did they do well?  
MARK SCHMIDT: They just kept on attacking. They did a good job shooting
threes. You know, our game plan going in was try to limit Golden as much as we
could. I thought in the last five to six games they really went into him. He's
taking the most shots on their team. So they were really going inside out, so
we tried to do a good job of fronting him, backside help, and we did a decent
job on him, but those guys started attacking, driving and kicking, and they
got much more aggressive when we got them down by I think it was 17. They got
much more aggressive, and we became tentative.  
  
So as their aggression got us on our heels, they just -- once you play on your
heels, you're in trouble. They got us on our heels, and our offense wasn't too
effective. We were missing foul shots. We turned the ball over a couple times,
and they made their run. But somehow, some way, we found a way.  
  
Q. Mark, now eight of your games in this win streak have been by single
digits. What does that say about your team's ability to close, especially down
the stretch in this one?  
MARK SCHMIDT: It talks about how tough they are mentally and physically. You
know, there was a lot of adversity in this 13-game win streak. There's been a
lot of adversity, and our guys have made the plays when they needed to make
the plays. We work on stuff in practice, try to put pressure on them, but
there's nothing like a game, and they've done a really good job of making the
plays, not just offensively but defensively, and that's why we've had the
success that we've had.  
  
Q. Good sign when Jay doesn't score a lot and you guys somehow --  
MARK SCHMIDT: You're exactly right. When your best player doesn't play his A
game and you can still pull out a victory, it talks about how we're a team.
It's not just one guy or two guys. LaDarien stepped up, Courtney did a good
job before he got injured. I've said it from the very beginning: We're not a
two-man team. It takes all these guys to play and fill their roles, and then
when one guy is not playing up to his capabilities, a good team, another guy
steps up, and we've had that.  
  
Q. We've talked all season about how guys have stepped up when maybe
Matt or Jay aren't playing well, but to see that happen tonight on this kind
of a stage at this point in the season, how big is that to see, and what does
that mean?  
MARK SCHMIDT: You always want your better players to play well, but yeah, it's
-- it doesn't matter if it happens at the beginning of the year or halfway
through, in the Playoffs. It really doesn't matter. It's going to happen.
Those guys -- you can't play your A game all the time. When that doesn't
happen, someone else has to step up, and we've had, over this 13-game winning
streak, we've had guys step up and take on scoring roles. They have confidence
in doing that. This is not the first time that Jay didn't play well or the
first time that Matt didn't play well in those -- even in this 13-game winning
streak, those guys haven't played their A game every game. We've had other
guys step up, and that's what a team does, a good team does.  
  
Q. Do you know what happened last time that Jay had five points?  
MARK SCHMIDT: We lost probably.  
  
Q. Nope, you won, Mobley had 35. The next two games Jay had 40
(indiscernible).  
MARK SCHMIDT: Hopefully that's good.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Mike Rhoades](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34346)

### [Justin Tillman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30597)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rhode Island - 76, VCU - 67  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Tough loss today. Really proud of our guys. Fought like crazy.
We just had a stretch there where we just couldn't get a score, and even
though we cut it, I think, to four there late, we just didn't have enough
offensive execution or just enough offensive strength down the stretch there.
They made some tough shots. They really shot the ball well from three and
thought that hurt us. But credit to Rhode Island; they've had a fantastic
year, and they made plays and we didn't, and that's how it goes. Really proud
of our guys.  
  
Q. Guys, how would you evaluate how you played defensively? You used
zone a little bit; how would you evaluate that and how they adjusted to
that?  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: We just wanted to mix it up and see if we could catch them off
guard, but down the stretch they ended up hitting big shots.  
  
Q. Justin, you had the VCU fans chanting your name as you went out; how
did that feel?  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: It felt pretty good. The fans have been backing me and Johnny
up since the whole time we've been here, since our freshman year. Going to
always be thankful for that through good times or bad. They were always there
for us.  
  
Q. You had some trouble offensively. I know you had some looks but maybe
some shots weren't falling. What were they doing to cause some trouble
offensively?  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: What was giving us troubles? We just had to make shots and
then be aggressive, but some shots wasn't falling for us, that's all.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of motivated the decision to use a zone today --  
MIKE RHOADES: Trying to catch them off guard. It's not very good zone because
when they did execute some stuff, we got stuck in between. We're not great at
rotation awareness. But it did get them chucking a couple shots in the first
half, gave us a chance to stay connected in the game and all that stuff and
switching it back and forth.  
  
I thought our man-to-man in the second half was pretty good, and then we threw
that in a little bit. They hit a couple bad rotations in zone, gave up a
couple threes and a quick high-low, but it caught them off guard a little bit.
It got them standing around. The one thing they are very good at is they are
very good off the dribble one-on-one and big-boying you, and Terrell does that
very well, and I thought maybe mixing it up just to get them flatfooted,
standing around, and keep Dowtin away from the basket. He was moving the ball
against their zone 25, 28 feet away from the rim instead of him going downhill
or being close to the three, because he hurt us as well, too. So just mixing
it up.  
  
We're not a great defensive team. We got better as the year went on. We've had
some great stretches here late of guarding people but not for a full 40 two
days in a row. Johnny played a ton of minutes yesterday, tried to keep him out
there today, let's give it a shot. I thought it was pretty good in the first
half; it sort of hurt us in the second half.  
  
Q. After Tillman gets his fourth foul and goes out, you actually took
the lead and stayed competitive there. What does that tell you about some of
your younger guys and going forward?  
MIKE RHOADES: Yeah, you know, they're capable. Look, the biggest thing this
year is we're not tough enough. We're not strong enough. We've got a big off-
season ahead of us. Our workload has to increase. We've got to get bigger and
stronger and we've got to get better, but these young guys are capable of
doing some really good things, and you saw that in that stretch against the
best team in the league. But we have a ways to go, but I love that challenge,
and our guys will love that challenge. But you know, it shows what you're
capable of, but it's got to become who you are and it's got to become a
consistent pattern of how you play and how you approach things. It was very
up-and-down this year, and we played a lot of young guys, a lot of new faces,
and they're going to get better because number one they're great kids and they
really care about getting better, they want to be good. But just because you
have VCU on your jersey doesn't mean it's a win. You've got to show up and
you've got to produce, and this off-season is unbelievably important to our
returning players of increasing their workload and getting stronger, getting
tougher, getting better, and that's a good thing.  
  
Q. Would you have any interest in one of the non-NIT tournaments if that
opportunity came --  
MIKE RHOADES: I'll assess that. We haven't talked about that at all. This was
all about this weekend. It was all about this weekend. We'll see. We'll
evaluate that in the next few days.  
  
Q. When you came in in 2009 from making with Shaka, it was a pretty
young team, as well. You had a few talented older guys but a limited number.
I'm wondering what similarities you see between this group and that group, and
how are they different?  
MIKE RHOADES: Toughness. We've got to get tougher. And I'm not knocking our
guys. Part of it comes with maturity, just competitive toughness. We've just
got to continue every day to get in the weight room, if it's on the track,
it's on the court, wherever it is. It's about getting tougher, competitively
tougher all the time. If you do that, your skills get better, your body gets
stronger, you learn the game, you mature. I think that's the biggest thing.  
  
I thought that group in 2009 had a lot of upperclassmen and a lot of people
around the program that can show them the way. There wasn't as much of that
this year, but that was our job. These guys got thrown in the fire. A lot of
guys in the last few years didn't get thrown in the fire as much as these guys
did, especially these new faces. But hey, that's how it goes. It's great
opportunities for them to grow. But I think the biggest thing is competitive
fire, competitive toughness without a doubt.  
  
Q. What was going on with Marcus? I know he only played two minutes, had
the wrap on his wrist?  
MIKE RHOADES: He hurt his left wrist yesterday at the end of the game, and it
was just really bothering him. We thought we could keep it loose until today,
and it was really bothering him. He couldn't even really flex it both ways. It
stinks, but it's that time of the year when stuff like this happens. We could
have definitely used him. We've got to keep him healthy.  
  
Q. I know you're a competitive guy and this is not obviously how early
you wanted to go out, but I'm wondering what your realistic expectations were
with this group coming into the season and how you would grade sort of how
things ended?  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, you know me, I think you can win every game you play. It
doesn't matter who you play against, and that will never change. I knew we
were going to have ups and downs. I knew that from the start. The one thing
that I thought hurt us all year long was our basketball awareness, our
basketball feel, and at times you pull out your hair, why are they doing that,
why are they doing this. There was times this year we had to keep it simple to
get better and we couldn't be complex because that's the last thing you want
to do with young players or a team is -- you give them more, it makes it
tougher, and it takes away their aggressiveness.  
  
That was one thing with this group, and we had to keep it simple and try to
really improve. We improved, but we were never as consistent as we wanted it
to be, and that hurt us throughout the year, and that hurt us late in league
play. That's something that we've got to get better in every aspect of the
program. Basketball awareness is very high on there when it comes to
competitive toughness, as well.  
  
You know, I'm not ducking your question. I just -- everywhere I've ever
coached, everywhere I've ever been, I think we can win every game. I always
tell the guys, you're not playing a best-of-seven series against the Warriors,
you're playing one game for 40 minutes; let's find a way. I'm always
disappointed when we don't win. And I'm mad, and my competitiveness comes out,
like I want our guys' competitiveness to come out.  
  
This is the fact. This is where we're at right now, and I'm not shying away
from it. We're 18-15 on the year. I wish we had some of those games back, but
we don't, and it's got to fuel us, and it's got to light a fire on us,
underneath us, to get us better every single day. If we improve in competitive
toughness and we improve in our game and fundamentals, we won't be 18-15 next
year. We'll be better and better, but you've got to work for it, man, and
that's what we're going to do.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Goanar Mar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34908)

### [Otis Livingston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34909)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Joseph's - 68, George Mason - 49  
  
DAVE PAULSEN: First thing I'd say is, you know, tip our hat to Saint Joe.
Congratulations on the victory and wish them the very, very best.  
  
I think the only thing we didn't do well tonight is we just couldn't shoot the
ball. I thought our guys competed really, really hard. I thought for the most
part we defended very well. Really that first half after they got out to a
jump, we really defended well. I thought we had good looks from guys who made
them all year, and the ball just didn't go in the basket. If you're going to
have a game like that, you don't want it to be in the conference tournament.
Unfortunately that happened.  
  
But I think the big message to our guys in the locker room was this team has
improved more than any team I've coached in 24 years for the course of the
season, collectively and individually, and all those guys are coming back. We
want them to reflect on the growth. I want them to feel good about the growth
and the improvement and the progress they made for two weeks, and then I want
them to remember the sting and get back to work and be consumed with getting
better.  
  
Q. Otis, take us through the shooting by you guys; it was slow in the
first half but Saint Joe's struggled, as well. What's going through your mind
as this game is unfolding and shots just aren't falling?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON: Yeah, Coach told us to just keep shooting those shots. If
we're open, shoot them. If we're not open, drive it and try to create for
yourself inside or create for a teammate. But Coach is all about making the
right play, and if the right play is to shoot it, then you shoot it. You don't
want to think about it too much if you're missing or anything, just shoot the
open shot.  
  
Q. Just looking back at this year, I wanted to know some of your
thoughts about your first year here at Mason and just kind of reflecting --  
GOANAR MAR: I think it was a good year. We had a lot of -- me and the other
freshmen got a lot of experience. We were put in a lot of different
situations, so leading into next year, it's good to know that everyone will be
back, and we've been in so many different situations that we'll have that much
more experience, so in the long-term I think it was a really good thing.  
  
Q. Coming into tonight, you had won seven out of ten. Was the team
finally playing the way you hope they would all season long?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, I think, again, as I said before, I think this team has
improved as much if not more than any team I've coached in 24 years, and
that's a real tribute to them. Their work ethic in practice every day has been
great. Even in the -- we had some rough patches early in the season, I had fun
going to practice every day, and they have practiced with energy. They're a
close-knit group. They allow me to coach them hard. They bounce back. They
want to work on their game. They represent George Mason really in a really,
really good way, on the court and off the court, in the community, in the
classroom.  
  
But we weren't necessarily seeing the results, and then if you do the right
things and you embrace the process, hopefully eventually you're going to see
the results, and so second half of conference play, we really did. It was a
Catch 22. You know, eight scholarship guys, no seniors. To push them to get
better and also worried about running out of gas. Again, you don't want to
take anything away from Saint Joe. They played a great game. But I think a lot
of that was we ran out of gas. There's nothing like just having experience.  
  
You know, I'm down, I'm disappointed, I'm sad, but I'm more sad that I won't
get to coach them again this season because it really was a fun group to be
around.  
  
Q. You guys missed a lot of pretty good looks today; just curious, as a
coach when you see that going on on the floor, what, if anything, can you do
about it?  
DAVE PAULSEN: You know, there's not a lot. There's not a lot you can do. You
maybe try to move guys to different spots, which we did. We tried to get Otis
down on the baseline, tried to get him to drive, and we missed not only a lot
of open threes, we missed a lot of little bunnies around the basket. Sometimes
good play is contagious in a positive way, and sometimes bad play is
contagious in a negative way. There's not a lot you can do, you just implore
them to play hard. I thought we played hard all the way until the end and even
cut it to nine at one point, and gosh, we just couldn't get the ball to go
down. There's not a lot you can do.  
  
Q. Is it easy or exciting now, even so soon after this game, to look
ahead knowing that you have this group back plus a transfer, freshmen coming
in and all?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, I mean, I'm really excited and optimistic about the future
of the program. We can't take anything for granted. Everyone will say, oh, you
guys have everyone back, you're going to be back. No, we've got to work, but
if we work like we did, and every indication we've got a group of high-
character guys who want to work, who want to be coached, and there's no
substitute for experience. You know, truthfully you're like, gosh, can we
survive this year, and I think we survived it and actually in a pretty good
fashion and gave ourselves some momentum, and we'll go from being young, small
and lacking depth to next year we'll be older, we'll have two seniors, we'll
have a fourth-year senior transfer, we'll have more depth, we'll have more
size, we'll have more competition at practice. So nothing is guaranteed, but I
feel comfortable next year that we'll have the roster where I want to have the
roster in terms of guys who really buy into our culture and who have
experience and the size and athleticism and skill level to really compete, I
think, at a high level in the Atlantic 10.  
  
Q. After a game like today, what were you going to say to your team in
the locker room right after the game?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Well, it took a minute to kind of compose myself, but one, I
thanked them, because they let me coach them hard. They gave everything they
had, and they're a fun group to coach. And I praised them for the growth that
they had as a team individually. We took some time to thank the support
people. One of the things that we did early January, we doubled down on player
development, like we just said, X's and O's aren't going to win games in
February unless guys get better. So my staff, Duane Simpkins, Dane Fischer,
Aaron Kelly, just did a great job working one-on-one with guys, and just you
could really see -- I at least could really see the progress, not only
offensively but defensively. Our manager staff, our support staff, and then
really two people that I think just deserve an unbelievable amount of credit,
we had eight scholarship guys who we're like, gosh, if we can just get to the
finish line without anyone getting hurt, so our strength and conditioning
coach, Handy Handerahan, has got to be the best in the country, and our
athletic trainer, Bekah Schmidt, is nothing short of a miracle worker. I mean,
we had a lot of lingering issues and guys were out on the court, and so a real
tribute to them. So it's a whole group enterprise, and we want to make sure
our guys took time to acknowledge and thank all the people who put so much
time in.  
  
Q. Yesterday you spoke about A.J. and Calixte being the star of the
game, and today I don't know if they got in past the 16-minute mark to go in
the game. I'm just wondering what you saw that kind of pulled them out of the
game.  
DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, I mean, one, they were both in foul trouble, add to --
they were just not as effective today, and we were back -- like we had to try
to make a comeback.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Khwan Fore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32961)

### [Jacob Gilyard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34887)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Bonaventure - 83, Richmond - 77  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, congratulations to St. Bonaventure. They've obviously had
a great year and played well tonight. I'm very proud, couldn't be more proud
of our team and how we fought. They had a 17-point lead twice that we -- we
got it to a two-point game, and I think the script was going to be that Mobley
just made all those shots, and we couldn't have doing anything about it, and
we changed that, and we came back and really made it a game. I thought Khwan
played a great game, as good of a game as any guard we've had here, and I just
thought our fight was tremendous. So I'm extremely proud and wish we had more
basketball to play.  
  
Q. Could you just discuss the comeback and what it was made out of?
Looked like attacking and hitting threes and playing a lot of defense.  
KHWAN FORE: Yeah, after the run with Mobley, we kept huddling up, sticking
with each other and just stayed locked in and just made sure that we could
make our run and try to take over the game from there.  
  
Q. When Mobley is that hot, how tough is it to mentally weather that and
know that you may have a chance to come back in the game?  
KHWAN FORE: It's really tough, but you've just got to keep guarding him, keep
making him make tough shots and just hoping that he misses.  
  
Q. Jacob, I know that Missouri is a big state, and I know that he's a
couple years older. I was just wondering, growing up did you ever know
Courtney or play against him or with him or anything?  
JACOB GILYARD: No, sir, not at all.  
  
Q. Can you talk about trying to deal with Mobley during that time? It
looked like they were 23, 24 feet, weren't running on the line or anything
like that?  
JACOB GILYARD: He's a tough cover. I think everybody in here knows that. He
got going, and we just tried to make adjustments. We were switched up to man a
little bit and he still was going, to kind of just trying to take it personal
and make it tough on him.  
  
Q. You suggested that the Spiders are done. Did you do that
officially?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Correct.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Mobley and just his -- especially those first
threes --  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, they were very, very deep, and obviously we talked about
it. But they were deeper than even expected. You know, to a certain extent, it
surprises you because of the depth of the shots, but also a few of them were
there and contesting and they're deep, and they still go in. Just incredible
shooting performance. But I'm really pleased that the story of the game didn't
end there, and I think it was more about us being down two with the ball and
with a chance to tie it or take the lead.  
  
Q. I don't know if this game is a microcosm of your season, but can you
talk about the progress you've had with a team that had no seniors?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, I think -- I mean, I'm really proud and really excited. I
mean, I'm more disappointed that we don't get to have shoot-around tomorrow or
a game and those things and be with these guys, but I'm really excited. I
think we have really good young players. They're tough. They're tough-minded.
They're proud. They want to be good. And I feel like we're going to have a
very, very bright future.  
  
You know, we had a very tough start to our season. I think we really did a lot
of very, very good things, and excited for the future.  
  
Q. Do you think back to November and just identify a thing or two that
really got you moving in the right direction?  
CHRIS MOONEY: You know, I would say more the consistency. I think -- I was
talking -- the other day when Kevin Anderson was a freshman we had a late play
in the game where he turned the ball over and the other team went down and
scored right at the buzzer. It was a tie game. And I can't give that
experience to Jacob or to Grant. They just have to experience it for
themselves. I think that was the biggest thing.  
  
Our coaches stayed positive but honest, and each day they came to work, and we
got a little bit better and found some success. I don't know if it was one
thing, I just think that our guys maturing, learning about college basketball,
having new roles for the guys who were back, and just consistently approaching
every day.  
  
Q. You've played against a couple tourney teams this year like
Cincinnati and Bucknell. I was wondering how the Bonnies compare, and do you
think this is one of the 68 best teams in America?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, well, they're definitely an NCAA team. I think they
compare very favorably to everybody. Cincinnati's depth is incredible, but
when you have guards like Adams and Mobley, I mean, those guys are just so
tough to stop. I like their front court players, and Stockard had a great game
today. But when you have guards like that, just every situation is improved if
you have tremendous guards, which they do. I think they'll be -- I think with
a great coach like Mark, I think they'll do very well.  
  
Q. You held Adams to his worst game of the year, and even with all that,
they come out and hit their first 10 shots. You go down by 17 twice and you
still have a possession to take the lead. That's got to be pretty
encouraging.  
CHRIS MOONEY: Very encouraging. I'm telling you, I feel like -- I mean, I feel
great about our team. You know, I feel great about our team. You're right. I
mean, and the way that those shots were falling and the effect that it has
just on your psyche, we -- the guys rallied and stayed together. We were calm
and composed. We pressured when we had to, and we were able to make it a game.
So I'm thrilled with our team.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 78, Saint Louis 60  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Absolutely thrilled with our performance to it into. I thought
we executed remarkably well. You look at our shooting percentage and it's an
indication of that. I think our turnover ratio indicates that, as well. Making
shots clearly helps, and Travis Ford does a really great job of switching his
defenses and mixing his defenses and we don't make shots, we're in a lot of
trouble today. So making shots really saved the game for us.  
  
Q. The double-bye can affect teams at times. What did you maybe make an
emphasis on?  
BOB McKILLOP: Believe me, I understand that dynamic very well; coming from a
southern conference where we consistently did receive a bye, and it's kind of
a new experience for us to get a double-bye here in the A-10.  
  
We just focused on getting better, and Saint Louis had our attention. They had
our attention because they played us such a tight game January 2 or 3 or
whenever we played them, it was a three-point game and they hit a shot at the
buzzer that could have tied it. So they had our attention because how good
they are.  
  
Q. What did you emphasize from that last meeting, that your maybe
learned from them?  
BOB McKILLOP: Patience and poise with the basketball. The last time we gave
them 15, 20 points on turnovers, and tonight, points off turnover was 22-4 in
our favor.

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [James Demery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34910)

### [Shavar Newkirk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34911)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Joseph's - 68, George Mason - 49  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: I thought the -- you work so hard to get the bye, and I want to
be real clear about this: This team earned the bye. I read a lot of places
where we backed into the bye because of what other teams did, but we had to be
in position where we had 10 league wins. The bye was important.  
  
But I knew the first game when you play a team that's played, you can be a
little -- we were really choppy in the first half. We were just all over the
place. Six turnovers in the first half is not strong basketball. They had nine
baskets in the first half. Seven of them were drives. And we were
concentrating on trying to keep the ball -- the floor as crowded as possible.
The zone, again, the coaches deserve the credit, Jeff Arnold's scouting
report. But those guys stay on me about -- I like to establish a man-to-man
presence and then play zone on makes and misses. The second half we went
exclusively zone, and they didn't make any shots. We can play better. We'll
play a lot better tomorrow.  
  
Now, I get it, it's a level up. It's a national team. And anybody that wants
to say, what do you think they're going to think about you beating -- it's
another day. All we want to do is play Sunday now. We're playing on Saturday,
and we're playing on Saturday a lot because of these seniors.  
  
Q. Shavar, you guys turned that into a Big 5 game. To play that kind of
defense, it's mentally and physically grinding; did you guys know you could
have that because you wanted to keep the score down, and did you know your
teammates had it in them?  
SHAVAR NEWKIRK: Well, of course. Every day we battle in practice. There's
plenty of times we almost fight each other, and Coach just told us to
translate that onto the actual court when we go against our opponents. I
always knew we had that grind-it-out tough mentality.  
  
Q. Is the mindset this time of year to get another game, get another
game, and for this team, how important is that to the program now?  
JAMES DEMERY: It's really important. We just take it one game at a time and
stand confident to the things we know we're good at.  
  
SHAVAR NEWKIRK: Coach does a great job carrying out a game plan, and we just
follow it. We trust him to lead us, and he trusts me to lead them on the
court.  
  
Q. Shavar or James, obviously when a team has beaten you twice on a
buzzer beater during the regular season, is that something psychological just
going into this game that you overcome, or were you all just able to not even
worry about that and know if you controlled the pace you wanted, you could get
it done?  
JAMES DEMERY: Like I said before, we was just worrying about this game. We
don't really get into the vengeance like Coach Martelli talked about in the
locker room, we just try to play one game at a time.  
  
Q. What did you see from Mason in the first half that made you choose to
go exclusively zone in the second?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Nothing in the first half. I mean, it was just part of our --
it's part of this run that we're on. You know, we've won seven of eight, and
the zone has been good to us. We've spent a lot of time now, and this might be
the first time in my career we really detail the zone offense of the other
team. So when we're doing scouting report, we're doing zone, their zone
offense. So we had a good feel for what they -- and in the first half we did
not do a very good job of guarding it. They were 6 for 12 against the zone in
the first half, five drives and a three-pointer. In the second half, we were
much better, and that's unusual for this team because when they're away from
us, they're like your own children, they don't listen to you.  
  
So when they're away from us, they made a lot of -- players made a lot of
subtle adjustments on their own. And then when the ball doesn't go in -- the
same thing happened at Rhode Island two weeks ago. When that first one doesn't
go in, then the next kid is a little bit tighter, and there was a period there
where they drove the ball, drove the ball, drove the ball against the zone,
and then the next time they had to take a big jumper, the ball is a little bit
heavy. So nothing against them, it was just the nature of college basketball.  
  
Q. Phil, you had said that you guys couldn't win a game in the 70s or
the mid 70s. They had scored 40 points on you in three of the four quarters.
They didn't get 40 until there was about six minutes in the game today.  
PHIL MARTELLI: Both teams were a little tight. I think to be honest with you,
I think the energy and the fierceness of the first game, there was a little
bit of air out of the building. But when I saw -- when I was following the
score in my head, I showed our team this morning the first 10 minutes at Hagan
Arena. The first 10 minutes at Hagan Arena, they had about 21 points, so
that's an 84-point game. We're not winning that kind of game.  
  
I'm still not convinced that that's the right score for us. I think the number
for us is -- we have to be in the low 70s to give ourselves a chance to win
tomorrow, and I felt we would need low 70s. We got really -- we got nuts
against their zone, like it was the first time we had ever seen zone. I think
maybe we would have been on track to get to 70, 72, which is the number for
our team.  
  
Q. You guys really started to heat up from three in the second half. You
had that stretch where Robinson, Funk and Demery all got those threes to kind
of break it open. Do you chalk that up to be a little rusty out of the break
with the bye and everything like you mentioned earlier?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Hmm, how do I answer that? Two of the three guys that made
those threes are not classic shooters, right? One is. One has to shoot
quicker, not faster, he has to shoot quicker. But I thought Nick Robinson was
terrific all day. He shot that ball with confidence, and I like my guys.  
  
James shoots like he thinks it's going in, but he's the only one in our
program that thinks that ball is going in when he shoots a three. You get it?
You know what I'm saying? He was really skitter -- I don't think he had a very
good game, James, but that was a big three.  
  
Q. What was the reasoning behind not starting James today?  
PHIL MARTELLI: James hasn't started for about five or six games. We won all
the games that he hasn't started. He was hurt the last time against Mason, and
we went on a run after that, so he played -- did he play starter's minutes? He
played 29 minutes. And maybe earlier in the year to be honest with you when he
was starting he was playing too many minutes. The plan in the beginning of the
year was to start Shavar fresh and Charlie. Now, I would have to arm wrestle
James to convince him, but I want him to be the best sixth man in the league
in the country, not in the league but in the country. So fewer minutes, I
think he can be more effective.  
  
Q. How much of a premium did you place on defending the three and not
letting them get hot from there?  
PHIL MARTELLI: More, to be honest with you, their drives. They had 22 baskets
when we played them at Mason, 22 for 41 on lay-ups, drives to the basket. In
the first half, seven of their nine baskets were on the drive. You know, it's
taken me a long time, but if I have to fall on my sword, I'd rather fall on my
sword against a jumper than a lay-up. That's why we stayed zone so much in the
second half.  
  
Q. You mentioned Nick Robinson; he's been having a great last several
games down the stretch, 14 tonight. What have you seen from him late in the
season that's impressed you?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, it's been with Nick since he came. He has a very high
level of confidence, and he's also very vocal, on a team that is not so vocal.
I'm not sure that's a thing anymore with kids. They don't like to talk about
the game. Nick likes to talk about the game, talk about himself, talk about
the game, and because of his confidence level, he's playing better. He just
plays better basketball. He gives us a little bit of everything on a team that
needs a little bit more personality, to be honest with you. They're getting
there. They're getting there, and I'd like to play through the weekend with
them gaining in personality, not just game, not just their game.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Jeff Dowtin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33200)

### [Jared Terrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30558)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rhode Island - 76, VCU - 67  
  
DAN HURLEY: Number one, my thoughts and prayers to a great family in Rhode
Island, the Campanella family, who at the beginning of this week, their son
Nicholas Campanella lost his battle with leukemia, so I want to send my
thoughts and prayers to Nicholas and the Campanella family. They're a great
family in Rhode Island.  
  
It's always a great challenge to play VCU. You know, it's a pleasure to
compete against them. They've been the model, I guess, mid-major, transcending
mid-major program in college basketball for a long time. You know, it's a
pleasure to compete against their players, their coaches, and then to play in
front of their fans, who are some of the best fans in college basketball.  
  
Hard-fought game. We knew it was going to be a tough game, quarterfinal game.
You're not really expecting to see VCU in a quarterfinal game in the A10
tournament, but that was your typical postseason conference game, whether it's
an NCAA Tournament or a conference tournament. Both teams are playing for
their lives. Both teams obviously were very desperate out there, and we did
what we didn't do the other day: Got a lead late like we did against Davidson
on the road, almost in the same exact situation, up six with around 40 seconds
or so, and then showed who we've been the whole year and came through in the
clutch.  
  
So we're excited to move on to the semifinals and play the winner.  
  
Q. Jeff, talk about your migration from 2 guard to point guard. Talk
about how you've embraced it.  
JEFF DOWTIN: Yeah, coming from a 2 guard to a point guard, I had to really
change my game a lot, so I've just been practicing getting to the paint,
getting my teammates open shots and just being a leader on and off the court.
I think it's really helped me out a lot.  
  
Q. Jeff, how much did coming to the A10 tournament last year and playing
deep into March help you in this game?  
JEFF DOWTIN: It really helped me a lot. It gave me a lot of confidence knowing
that March is when all the big players really step up, make their game just
grow even more. Like last year was kind of a coming-out party for me, and I
just love March. All the best players come out and do what they have to do to
win, so I feel like I did that today.  
  
Q. Jeff, seemed like VCU was kind of continuously making comebacks as
you guys were building leads. How were you able to stay calm as they were able
to get momentum and get the crowd behind them?  
JEFF DOWTIN: Confidence, patience. My teammates were able to hit open shots,
big shots. I know Jerry hit a big tough three, Stan hit a three in the corner,
Fatts hit a three, also, and then we hit two free throws. E.C. came down, hit
two clutch free throws. Jerry also hit free throws. So we were just making
plays. We did what we didn't do last game, and that was close it out.  
  
Q. VCU the first half used a 2-3 zone there. What adjustments did you
talk about at halftime coming into the second half and how did you kind of
adjust to that?  
JARED TERRELL: We just wanted to attack it the first half. We just kept
rotating around the perimeter, not really trying to get in gaps, not trying to
hit the high post, and second half we set screens, got them to the paint where
we shared the ball, and that's where we were able to make shots.  
  
Q. Jared, the stretch there at the end of the first half, the time-out,
the big defensive stand and then Fatts's three, how important was that to keep
the positivity and keep the energy going in the huddle at the end of that
half?  
JARED TERRELL: We pride ourselves on defense. That's what we work on every day
in practice, and it showed today. We got stops, we rebounded the ball, and we
made shots at the end of the game, and we closed out with free throws.  
  
Q. Coach, at one point in the second half you guys were 3 of 11 from the
foul line and then down the stretch you did hit I think it was at least three
or four to close the game out. What are your thoughts on free-throw shooting
as you head into March?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, I mean, that's just something -- it's about routine. It's
about confidence. It's about being comfortable. You know, it's kind of a --
it's so different than any part of the game, and it's been a little bit of a
mental block for us at the end of the season, and it hadn't been throughout
the year. But we obviously struggled with it. Maybe that was a little bit of
the residue from the Davidson loss on the road, up six, 40 seconds to go,
missing three front ends, having the game won and kind of giving it away. So I
wasn't feeling pretty good about shooting free throws into that last minute,
but these guys have had an amazing season, and they showed their character. I
think that we'll be a different free-throw shooting team tomorrow because of
the success that we had late.  
  
Q. Coach, to piggy back on the zone question, I think they threw it out
6:45 in the first, it was narrow up front, kind of choked you off. You spread
it in the second half. Talk about the importance of creating those passing and
driving lanes by physically spreading it.  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, listen, we watched like six VCU games, and I've probably
watched 15 VCU games this year, with the first game, cross scouts, and then
playing them again today. I haven't seen them play zone like one possession.
So yesterday obviously if we would have played Dayton, it would have been a
lot bigger part of our preparation. It's rare that you see a team that presses
and plays pretty aggressive man and then gets into a zone defense. I thought
we handled it obviously a lot better in the second half. We were a little bit
surprised to see it. On a short prep, it's kind of -- it was tough, but these
players made tremendous adjustments in the second half.  
  
Q. What kind of impact did Tillman picking up his fourth foul with 10
minutes to go have?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, it definitely had an impact. It definitely had an impact on
the game. He was living at the free-throw line, just living there. And wasn't
always converting, but he put us in a ton of foul trouble by drawing contact
and then shooting and then getting the call. He's a heck of a player. We made
some mistakes defensively. We didn't guard him anywhere near as well as we
guarded him the first time. We got stuck behind a lot, and again, we just
didn't think -- we wanted to make him work for his twos. We felt like the only
way that we could lose this game would be if we gave up a high number of
threes to them.  
  
Q. How much more value maybe does a win like this where you get a push
and you're challenged and you lose the lead, how much more value does a win
like this have in March as opposed to maybe November or December?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, we haven't had that much adversity this year. Like our --
we had the injury issues for a while with E.C. and Cyril Langevine, who missed
a significant part of critical games for us. But we haven't really had like
adversity in terms of like losing two in a row and having to respond, and then
losing two in a row and having to respond against VCU in D.C. with a ton of
pressure on you to bounce back and show who you are, I just think it was
exactly the type of game that we needed, and we needed it to be tight and we
needed to get back to that free-throw line today and show some guts and some
nerves and close it out.  
  
Q. Fatts hit a few timely threes today including the one at the end of
the first half. How big has he been off the bench for you all season long?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, had Fatts Russell played on just about any other team in our
league, he would have been vying for Rookie of the Year. That guy is special.
You know, you just -- in coaching, you recruit guys when you watch them during
the process, and then once they get on campus you look at them day in and day
out and you just see that they have special things about them, and he is one
of those guys. Again, if he was on a different team that wasn't so loaded at
guard and wasn't such a deep team, if he averaged 30 minutes a game, 35
minutes a game like some of the other top freshmen in this league, his numbers
would have been identical, and he would have been vying for that award, but he
sacrificed the whole year. And I don't know if there's a rookie in the league
this year that had more clutch performances in big games. You know, his game
versus Providence, his game versus Seton Hall at Barclay's, those were clutch
performances to get us in this at-large position. Without those performances
from him in high-leverage games, not meaningless games in January or February
where you're playing for 10th or 11th place or fifth place, this guy was a
monster for us when E.C. went out and in large part saved our season.  
  
Q. VCU has found themselves in a bit of a rebuild for the first time in
a while, which is clearly something you went through in taking over Rhode
Island. I wonder what are some things with this VCU team that you've seen as
someone who has rebuilt a program that makes you think they'll be back playing
you not in a quarterfinals but eventually in a final or something like that?  
DAN HURLEY: They've got really good young players. I know that Mike is going
to recruit well. Obviously it all comes down to recruiting and recruiting the
right people. Obviously they're losing two amazing seniors, Justin Tillman is
one of the best players I've coached against since I've been in this league. I
couldn't have more respect for a player in terms of his competitiveness and
winning attitude than Jonathan Williams. So losing those two guys is going to
hurt.  
  
But they've got some really outstanding young players in Vann and Jenkins,
Mobley, Simms, Crowfield. They've got some young guys that are going to
develop, and then obviously it all comes down to recruiting the same level of
guys that they've had in this program. Shaka and Will and Mike will continue
to do it.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
TRAVIS FORD: First of all, I just, a couple things. I'd just like to say how
proud I am of the Billikins Basketball Team and how proud I am of those guys
in the locker room and how hard they fought, how hard they've played. And as I
told them, they probably don't even realize at this point kind of what all
they have accomplished this year. You know, really proud of those guys.  
  
Tonight just wasn't our night. As I told them, it was Davidson's night. I can
sit up here ask talk about it, it was all about them. They played tremendous.
Very well prepared. Their stars played great, off the chart. It just wasn't
our night. It was Davidson's night, plain and simple.  
  
I just, you know, I'm proud of this league. We've got two, for sure, locked
teams in the NCAA Tournament and two more trying to get there. You just wish
all the four teams that are left the best, and again, really proud are our
basketball team. Tonight just wasn't our night.  
  
Q. Obviously I think you probably wanted to slow the game down, muck it
up a little bit, since they have so much offensive firepower. Right away, they
just --  
TRAVIS FORD: We couldn't get them to miss. I mean, face and all that was
thrown out the door. I mean, we couldn't -- they were -- Aldridge was making
tough shots, difficult shots. And you know, obviously Grady got involved. You
know, two players of the year in the league, both guys are players of the
year. One a freshman Player of the Year and the other, conference Player of
the Year. And they played like it.  
  
And it really wasn't anything we were doing. Some of the breakdowns we had
late, we were trying to change stuff, but first 15, 20 minutes, they earned
it. They earned them. He earned every -- both of them earned it and they
deserved it. Again, you know, big-time player, played big-time tonight.  
  
Q. This was a turbulent season. At the end you had a short-handed team
and they kind of fought to the end. What does that say about those guys in the
locker room?  
TRAVIS FORD: It says a lot about them. We did. I mean, it wasn't looking good
and we still competed the second half and got it within striking range several
times.  
  
I was telling our guys in time-outs, we just couldn't -- we never, ever went
on a run, necessarily could get them to miss enough shots to get it with -- as
close as we wanted to get it.  
  
But yeah, you know, this team, I'm really proud of them. This team, you know,
enjoyed coming to practice every day and they gave me everything they had.
That's one thing; they left it on the court.  
  
And I've been doing this a long time, 21 years as a college head coach, and
sometimes the last loss is tough because maybe you didn't play your best or
maybe guys didn't leave it on the court. We left it all on the court. I've got
no problem with it.  
  
Davidson outplayed to us night, outplayed us. They deserved it. They were a
really, really, really good team who played great, who played off the chart,
played trick. They are playing well right now. They ever playing well. So give
them all the credit. I've got no issue with how our team played and the effort
they gave. It was terrific.  
  
Q. What were the emotions for you when Davell checked out and what he's
meant to this Billikins team?  
TRAVIS FORD: Well, he's meant a lot to the university. He's meant a lot to our
basketball team. He's meant a lot to our athletic department, because here is
a young man who came from Memphis, Tennessee to Saint Louis University and
gave Saint Louis University a chance and Saint Louis University gave him a
chance and Davell Roby took advantage of that. I've said it many times in the
last couple weeks, talking about him as a senior: He's a trued student
athlete. He's the definition. His picture should be right there by student
athlete. He has taken full advantage of an incredible education that you get
at Saint Louis University. Incredible. It's not an easy place academically;
it's challenging.  
  
In the two years that I've known him, I've never had to call him into my
office because he missed a class or because he missed a tutor or didn't do
well in a class or whatever it is. He rises to the occasion. He's learned at
Saint Louis University how to be a very accountable, responsible young man.
He's prepared for the next step, whatever that is for him, because he's put a
lot in to Saint Louis University, a lot, time and effort and great attitude, a
lot. He's put a lot into it, and Saint Louis University has given a lot back
to him. For two years, like I said, he has a smile on his face every single
day; and as I told him, man, he's always going to have me in his corner for
what he's represented.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys found a lot of success finishing sixth in the
league, and it was a big jump from last year. Do you think getting --  
TRAVIS FORD: Sixth seed. We finished fifth, but yeah, sixth seed. We like to
get the details, just minor details. Minor details (laughing).  
  
Q. Getting some of these young guys that experience and having them see
some success, do you think that's kind of the building block for this program,
getting back and potentially competing for a league title?  
TRAVIS FORD: Well, I hope so, and that's funny you asked that, because that's
kind of what I talked to them about, some of the things, in the locker room,
is I thought last year's team really kind of set a tone a little bit. Set a
tone. This year's team I thought really laid a foundation of some standards of
succeeding; of succeeding, winning a lot of games, finishing higher than we
were picked, and succeeding and winning some games -- and talked to our team.  
  
So yeah, I think some of these younger guys experienced some success and they
fought some adversity on the court, off the court, and were able to stay
focused. So they learned a lot of life lessons through this, off the court --
on court and off the court.  
  
So hopefully we do use that. Hopefully we use this season to continue to
improve and get better. That's the goal.  
  
Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Mike Rhoades](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34346)

### [Jonathan Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33087)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
VCU 77, Dayton 72  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, it was a great game. Just really proud of our guys. It was
a team win without a doubt. So many guys had so many different ways they
contributed on both ends of the floor. I was really proud.  
  
I thought the spirit of our team the last few minutes of the game, even though
we were down, sort of told the story to me. The guys, they believe they are
going to win. I told them in the one time-out at the end, get three stops and
we'll win the game, and it was maybe the three best stops of the season and
two of our shot clock violations, our defense won it for us down the stretch.
Really proud of our guys. Great effort led by our seniors, Justin and Johnny,
and I thought Johnny had a great floor game that really helped us.  
  
Q. How much do you think the crowd impacted the last few minutes for you
guys? Looked like half the house was VCU.  
MIKE RHOADES: Yeah, might even have been more. You see all that black and
gold, our guys even talked about it before the game when they came in the
locker room for the last time about, hey, everybody is still here and
everybody's got our backs. Really appreciative is the word I will always use
around here, that Ram nation, no matter what, has these guys' back. They cheer
for these guys all the time. They care about how we do things, and it was
pretty awesome. Down the stretch, they got nice and loud. That was huge.
That's a great advantage to have.  
  
Q. Johnny, that final play there, what's going through your mind as
you're spinning through the lane and coach, what's going through your mind,
it's a tough shot, but it goes in.  
JONATHAN WILLIAMS: We just basically wanted to get a ball screen at the top so
we can get a switch, and basically just wanted to be one-on-one with Justin in
the post. When I was looking for him to pass it to him, they did a good job of
fronting it, so I couldn't give them the ball. So I had a 4-man on me, so I
knew I could get by him and get to the rim, so that's why I did it.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: He does a great job getting downhill, as we call it and when he
keeps his balance, he finds a way to score, he can really finish the ball with
his left hand and that's what you saw. He's been doing that for quite some
time. I've been watching him since junior high and he always finishes that
way.  
  
Q. Johnny, it looked like early in the second half, I thought maybe
coach was bringing in Malik, and it looked like maybe you called that off, and
you said you were staying in. I don't know if that's true but it just seems
like you really wanted this one. Can you just talk about how important it is
to just kind of play for your life?  
JONATHAN WILLIAMS: I know what you're talking about, but that was kind of
like, I think Issac got like two fouls in a row, and I was like, I'm tired,
but I know I can fight through it. So just having Malik get IV because we're
going to need him down the stretch to guard Darrell Davis. He's a really good
defender. He's long, active when he's on defense. So I just was basically have
Malik go in and Malik could defend, as well, and he could knock down a long
ball.  
  
Q. What happened on that play where you and Landers cracked heads
together and then how did you feel after?  
JONATHAN WILLIAMS: He was just trying to get the ball. He didn't mean to head-
but me or nothing like that.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: For him as a big man as a freshman, as he plays behind one of
the best players in the league who can play a lot of minutes and then when
teams try to go small against us, that sort of limits his minutes a little bit
more, but when he has an unbelievable attitude, and he wants to -- you see him
on the bench, he's moving, he's jumping up-and-down. He's locked in.  
  
So you know if you throw him in there, you know what you're going to get and
he's only going to get better and better and he has a bright future for us. He
gave us great minutes in the first half and even the second half, and throws
his body after the ball.  
  
Q. In that first half, kind of got physical, how do you guide the kids
to stay aggressive but not go over that line, especially when there's a couple
times it seems like the officials were kind of looking to get control.  
MIKE RHOADES: It's a fine line. You don't want them to lose their swag or
their aggressiveness, but no matter what, you can't do something that hurts
your team. You know, they got offset in technicals and that could put you on
the bench if you're in foul trouble.  
  
So play the game, is what I tell the guys. Just play the game, and
unfortunately, you see a little bit more of that, we talk about it all the
time. It's about your team, every action you have out there has got to be to
be about your team and we sort of cut it, when we brought our guys over
together, no more of that stuff. You've got to get through the talk. You've
got to play the game and I thought our guys did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Coach talked about stops at the end of the game. 72-70, Dayton runs a
double screen, Mike'l Simms comes out and knocks away an entry pass. How big
was that play?  
MIKE RHOADES: Huge. Huge. We blew the play up which was great but now you have
a little guy and a big guy. Ke'l is pretty strong and he's a tough kid. So he
was going to just -- he fought like crazy. We had a little bit of -- we had
some good back side help, but that is a mismatch. You have to scrap that out
this time of the year and we did that. That was big. That was big for Ke'l.
Ke'l is a tough kid, so he wasn't going to quit on the play, that's for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Javon Greene](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34879)

### [Otis Livingston II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32898)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Mason 80, UMASS 75  
  
DAVE PAULSEN: That was a great win for our guys. I'm really, really proud of
them. You know, really gritty, gutty performance. I thought UMASS played
really, really well, and they made shots and I think with the exception of the
first couple minutes, I think they were pretty well contested shots. They
really competed and did a great job.  
  
But I like the way our guys buckled down. We were down 16 maybe at the under
12-minute media time-out and said, we can't panic. We had a little too much
panic our eyes but at the same time we have to have a greater sense of urgency
on the defensive end, and I think we did that.  
  
These two guys obviously did a great job but I think really the story of the
day was the play of Greg Calixte and AJ Wilson, tandem, I think they combined
for 12 offensive rebounds. We had 20 offensive rebounds and 26 second-chance
points and that kept us alive. Then we knocked down free throws and obviously
oh piss, 14-for-14 is not bad there.  
  
I thought Javon, in addition to making some really good plays offensively,
really, and you look, Pipkins is at 31, but I thought Javon's defense down the
stretch on Pipkins was really, really good.  
  
Q. Javon, down the stretch, you know Pipkins wants to take the shot, tie
the game. Take us through what your defensive mentality is against him, given
the night he was having.  
JAVON GREENE: Yeah, Pipkins is a great player and Coach just told us, he's
switching every screen, so I trusted my teammates and they communicated with
me well. I played to my best ability and he's hitting shots, and you know, we
just played -- we just ended the game well.  
  
Q. Did you know that you might guard Pipkins down the stretch coming
into the game, and if so, how do you prepare to guard a guy like that?  
JAVON GREENE: Well, gin, but you know, I was just prepared for every
situation, and my time has come and I just had to guard him and play, you
know, not let him score easy buckets and make all his buckets tough, and
that's what I did.  
  
Q. Otis, what did you see in the defense that allowed you to attack the
inner paint a little wit and get to the line so many times there in the second
half?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Yeah, I just didn't want to settle for shots. I just
wanted to be aggressive. I knew that they were in the bonus. So any foul call
was semi to the line, so I was trying to be aggressive, just attack the rim.  
  
Q. What were you thinking when you picked up your third foul there?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Yeah, I don't know, I was disappointed in the call, you
know. I think it was I foul. But I just have to keep my cool, keep my
patience. I think Coach took me out and just stay cool, you know, trust in my
teammates on the floor. You know, and they did a good job.  
  
Then I knew that when I came back, I couldn't pick up another foul.  
  
Q. In this tournament, obviously because of the way it is, you win and
you almost immediately have to think of what's next. You guys have played
Saint Joe's on two buzzer-beaters this year. What are your thoughts going into
tomorrow?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Yeah, they are a good team with great players. It's going
to be a tough game. We just have to rest up, you know, and see our trainer,
you know, make sure that we're fresh for tomorrow and pay attention to the
scouting report that the coaches are going to put together for us.  
  
Q. You guys have been involved in a lot of very close games of late. How
are those situations helping you now in the tournament in another obviously
close game today?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Yeah, it's just something that we're comfortable with,
having close games in the regular season, so when it's time for this type of
format, you know, we are really comfortable in those close, tight games down
the stretch.  
  
Q. You've battled back from a lot of big did he have fits this season.
Do you think that helped you early on tonight?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Oh, yeah, for sure. We didn't panic. We just trusted in
the process, trusted in our coaches and what they were telling us to do, and
it paid off for us.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same thing. Obviously Saint Joseph's is tomorrow.
How do you prepare for a team that you've gone down to the last second shot
with twice in the regular season? Is that a confidence builder or does it make
you wary because you have to go a full 40?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Well, I think with this league, always, historically, but
certainly this year, you know, every single game is a grind-it-out game. Now
obviously ours with Saint Joe's were buzzer beaters but they are all coming
down to the wire and they are all going to come down to one or two possessions
but what we try to tell our guy s is in a 140-, 150- possession game, every
possession has meaning and has significance.  
  
So we've just got to really be locked in in terms of what we did well that had
success against Saint Joe, but also, you know, what we have to improve upon,
and that's been our theme with our guys. Let's make a one percent improvement
every day, and if we can do that, then we can keep trying to make a run one
game at a time.  
  
Q. What was your plan to guard Pipkins? Was it to start with Justin on
him?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, Justin got the assignment. Justin picked up two quick
falls. Javon came if there. I got a little upset, shall we say, early on, when
two consecutive times Justin gave Pipkins space and Javon gave him space, and
I think from that point on, pretty much everything that he got was earned.
He's a heck of a player.  
  
But I thought we made him become a driver, you know, and early on, probably
had three or four threes in the first eight minutes, and we made him become a
driver, and certainly he's good at that but I thought our help defense was
pretty good. We forced him into some turnovers at some pretty key junctures.  
  
Q. How would you describe the growth and maturity some of these young
guys that we saw, really make a difference tonight in the tournament? A lot of
freshmen and sophomores.  
DAVE PAULSEN: I think, really, Javon, you know, was in double figures. He
guarded Pipkins. Goanar, you know, just does so many good, intelligent smart
things. And then really, the real bonus was the play of AJ Wilson and Greg
Calixte. So I thought all four of those guys just did a great job and they
have improved.  
  
You know, early on, Goanar was pretty savvy and was ready for the bright
lights, and the other three guys, quite frankly, weren't, and that's to be
expected. But they have really embraced working hard and all they care about
is their teammates. It's fun to watch their maturation.  
  
Q. Obviously you get to Sunday, you might worry about tired legs, but in
these early games, is it a benefit time to maybe get one game in, as opposed
to sitting on a bye or even a double-bye?  
DAVE PAULSEN: I'll tell you tomorrow about 4:30. You know, I don't know. The
one thing I've learned is when you coach 18-, 19-, 20-year-old males, you
can't draw any conclusions or parallels because you never know what the heck
they are going to do.  
  
But I do think to win a game like this, to get some confidence, to get used to
the tournament atmosphere, I think it's a positive.  
  
Q. What did you say to your young team early to settle them down when
they were down by 14?  
DAVE PAULSEN: You know, I said, everyone, including me, okay, because I got so
upset at a couple of our defensive lapses and our lack of like running good
offense; so everyone here, including me, guys, we cannot panic, okay. But
every guy has got to commit to have a greater sense of urgency. You know, the
two are not contradictory.  
  
I thought we didn't have the urgency on the defensive end and that led to
panic and rushed shots on the offensive end. When we got that balance correct,
you know, I thought we didn't turn the ball over, but running better offense,
we got closer to the basket. We got offensive rebounds. We got to the foul
line. Early on, we were just living and dying with jumpshots.

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Jacob Gilyard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34887)

### [Nick Sherod](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32992)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Richmond 81, Duquesne 68  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, I thought we played really well. Our last two regular-
season games, we played very well offensively. Moved the ball well and made
more shots, and that continued tonight. So I'm really pleased with how we
played.  
  
Really more importantly, how we played defensively. You know, to win the
rebounding battle with a team that's a very good rebounding team, was probably
the key, and so pleased and proud of ur guys and really looking forward to
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Nick, what do you think sparked the early run that allowed you to get
momentum and get points quickly and kind of put them on their heels?  
NICK SHEROD: I just feel like everybody was really excited to play today. Any
time you come into a tournament situation, the juices start flowing and
everybody is really excited. I'm just happy that we didn't have as many
jitters as I thought we was going to have. Everybody came out and was really
focused and locked in on what the coaches had told us, and I just think
everybody is really excited to play. I feel like we have a chance to make a
run here. We want to start it off can get off on a good foot today. We're just
excited about how we played.  
  
Q. How do you think your team has developed over the team in terms of
ball sharing, run the offense? Your coach gives you freedom to break off, but
today you guys ran the offense, you broke off a little bit, but scored and
shared the ball?  
JACOB GILYARD: I think we've developed and came a long way, especially we joke
about our first game a lot, just how far we've come. But we definitely have
more to go. But today, I think we just came out and executed what we needed to
do.  
  
Q. You went to St. Bonaventure and played a good game; they played a
really good game that day. What do you remember about that and the challenge
that awaits you tomorrow?  
NICK SHEROD: I just remember how tough the game was. It was a really good
atmosphere there. It was their homecoming game I believe. It was a really
awesome atmosphere. We played real little hard and we obviously want to defend
better. They are two really good guards and probably two of the best guards
we're going to play all year.  
  
So we are excited to get the opportunity again and we feel like we left some
points on the table and obviously having De'Monte back in the lineup is going
to make a big difference. We're just excited to go play.  
  
Q. Last time you guys played these guys, you took them to over time and
were able to edge them and this is obviously a really different story. What is
the game plan coming in and what do you feel like you were able to execute
well?  
JACOB GILYARD: We just tried to execute what Coach had been preaching all
week. We just had to come out hard and focused throughout the game. I thought
we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. As a freshman, obviously you had an amazing game in your first-ever
postseason tournament. What were you expecting it to be like and how were you
able to play so well?  
JACOB GILYARD: I think my teammates definitely got me going early. I give all
my success to them. Honestly they found me for most of my shots. So I'd like
to thank them for that. I just like to be tough, obviously today we did really
good, but tomorrow is a different day. So we've got to come out ready to play.  
  
Q. You had 24 offensive rebounds at Pittsburgh and six today. Why such a
big difference?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, you know, I mean, we definitely emphasized it. Not that we
didn't emphasize it in the first game but we definitely emphasized it and we
knew how important it would be. Duquesne has some guys that are willing to
take hard shots and can make hard shots, and then they really do clean up the
offensive glass very nicely.  
  
So for us, I thought setting a tone early, I think we got some rebounds in
there early. I think we had a lead early in the game, maybe 11-3, something
like that, and we were getting defensive rebounds. I think when you set that
kind of a tone, then it discourages them from just attacking the glass like we
see sometimes. So we did a much better job obviously and it was a very big
reason for the win.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead to Bonaventure, the game at the Riley center was
closer, really, than the score indicated if I recall correctly. What problems
do they pose for you going in tomorrow?  
CHRIS MOONEY: The shooting is tremendous. You know, Adams, all-around, his
shooting, decision-making, delivering the ball to his teammates at the perfect
time, and then Mobley shooting, those things are really difficult to guard.
It's hard when you play -- at this level, you see it sometimes, when you play
good defense and they can still score, and that's what those guys can do.  
  
So the game was close. We didn't stop them very often but we were able to
score. So we feel like if we can clean up a little bit; Adams is going to get
and create points for guys, but if we can clean up our defense a little bit,
that we'll have a chance here.  
  
Q. That's three big wins in a row now, big in terms of scoring margins
and whatnot, following kind of a rough stretch. How good does it feel to see
things starting to finally click for this team, especially given how young
they are and how excited are you for what's to come?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, I appreciate that. Yes, we're a young team. Not quite as
young now as we were in November. Our experience has paid off. You know, the
experience that we do have has paid off. We just look more like a cohesive
team, a team that plays together, shares the ball. So I'm really proud of them
and hope we can continue to play well tomorrow night.  
  
This has been a good stretch here and you know, sometimes we played well
during the course of the season and you don't get the result that you want to
get. But this has been a good stretch and we've played well and been able to
shoot the ball a little bit better. I think as a result, our passing's been
better and our movement's been better, so hopefully that can continue.  
  
Q. To piggyback, on your development, your offense, you have to run it
to get getter at it. You give your guys a lot of freedom. It's really rolling
compared to where it was against Georgetown. Talk about that process, that
development.  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, so I feel like -- yeah, I think we really try to have all
five guys playing together, and that's a really difficult thing to do because
of timing, because of defense, because of physicality of the game. And so you
have to do it over and over and over again, and you know, we do have freedom
within our offense, and I think the floor is so spread that we can take
advantage of times, but we can recognize those better now than we did in the
beginning of the year.  
  
And so even if we knew what the play was, so to speak, we couldn't necessarily
take advantage of what showed up for us by the defense's shortcoming. Now
we're doing a much better job of that, and we can attack and be a little bit
more aggressive.  
  
Q. The significance of Julius's play today, he was a huge key to you
last season down the stretch in your win streak, and has been struggling of
late, but had a big game today. How big is that going through four days
here?  
CHRIS MOONEY: That's incredible for us. Julius played really well. He had
points. He got all of his rebounds. Every rebound we get is a big rebound and
his defensive rebounds were very, very critical. He played well. He was
confident.  
  
You know, he is an older guy with experience. He does have a really good sense
of what's going on out there, so the better he can play it, it really helps us
in many ways. It's not just his performance, but it's another guy who knows
what he's doing and another guy who can help us stay calm and recognize what's
going on on defense. So his contribution was critical.  
  
Q. 15 months ago, Grant was collapsing on the court and needing heart
surgery. Tonight he's leading your team in rebounding and zero turnovers. Is
it a nice story are or are you in disbelief watching what he can do?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, a little bit of disbelief, just taking from that moment
and those few days that followed, a little bit of disbelief.  
  
You know, I can tell you this: His faith or his energy never waned. I mean, he
was strong and consistent throughout in terms of his desire to give back and
to be a great player. So the awards he's gotten and will continue to get are
extremely well earned.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Matt McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30687)

### [Luwane Pipkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32811)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Mason 80, UMASS 75  
  
MATT McCALL: I told our team after the game, that the the first piece to
winning in March is caring. Our guys in in a locker room, they care. They are
hurting, that this chapter has come to an end. But the encouraging piece as a
coach is you can see care.  
  
I see a group that's been through an enormous amount from a year ago to now.
It's grown up and the adversity will make these guys stronger, and even a guy
like C.J. that's moving on, prepared for what's ever next.  
  
As far as the basketball piece of it, I thought offensively, we had some great
movement. I thought our pick-and-roll continuity was really, really good. We
were moving the floor. Shot an extremely high percentage. When you look down
at the stats sheet, you saw we shot 53 percent and 56 percent from the three
point line. You would think they were in good shape. But completely the
difference in the game, was the offensive rebounding. They shot 64 field goals
to our 47 and that's just the glass. They had 26 second-chance points, and 20
offensive rebounds.  
  
So it's hard to win when you're giving up that many. You know, late in the
game there, we just couldn't get the stop that we needed to, and even if we
had a good defensive possession, we still didn't come down with the rebound.  
  
So from a basketball piece, that's what you're looking at there, but you know,
for this group and this program and where we've been, and where we're headed,
that first piece of care, I can see it in their eyes. You know, it's
unfortunate.  
  
Q. Did this season feel like the start of something?  
LUWANE PIPKINS: Call it what you want to call it. Even though we had our
struggles this year, players going down, we still was a sneak team to beat.
But next year we've got to regroup, stay healthy and just come back.  
  
Q. How frustrating was that, the last play tonight, to not get a shot
off?  
LUWANE PIPKINS: It is what it is. It wasn't frustrating at all. The ref made
the call. The game's over.  
  
Q. What did you guys say C.J. as you walked off?  
LUWANE PIPKINS: He's going to be fine. Even though his season's over here
UMASS, he's still going to go somewhere and play ball and make some money and
still be successful.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the fact that you didn't get the same kind of foul
trouble you did yesterday allowed you to establish yourself a little bit more
going to the basket tonight?  
LUWANE PIPKINS: I'm going to be aggressive regardless, foul trouble or no foul
trouble but it definitely helped me be a lot more aggressive because I wasn't
in foul trouble, so yeah.  
  
Q. Did you feel coming in, you had 31 points. Did you feel coming in if
this team was going to have a chance, you were going to have to have a
performance like that?  
LUWANE PIPKINS: I didn't have 31 points yesterday and we still had a chance.
Regardless of if I'm scoring or not, I think my team got a chance against
anybody.  
  
Q. The year that Luwane had, if this program becomes what you want it to
be, how much do you feel like sort of the example that he set and the way he
played was a factor in building that foundation?  
MATT McCALL: We've talked about this a lot since the season began and since
I've been here. The change and the growth that he's experienced this last
year, is astronomical. It's never been about as competitiveness and it's never
been about his love for the game, but you've seen him really grow up with how
he works, how he approaches practice, how he approaches the classroom, how he
approaches his teammates. I couldn't be prouder of him, you know.  
  
For him to be doing what he's doing, and every night, opponents honing in on
scouting report and trying to take him out and trying to be physical with him,
and in two years, he's scored over a thousand points; I think the other guy,
there's two players in school history that have done that and one of them's
name is Julius Erving. Only one of four points in the history of the program
to average 20 points in a season. Another guy in that group is Marcus Camby;
so putting himself in that category.  
  
But the numbers, the points, he wants to win, more than anything. I think if
we came into this game, you know, he scored zero points and he won, he would
be one of the guys in the locker room celebrating more than anybody, and
that's growth and that's care.  
  
I'm really, really excited about this program and obviously him and going
forward.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Maurice Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20779)

### [Jair Bolden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34847)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 70, George Washington 63  
  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I want to give a lot of credit to Saint Louis for weathering
the storm there. I thought we played a great first half and they stormed back,
made a bunch of shots and did a tremendous job.  
  
But more so than that, I want to thank my seniors, who are playing their last
game from Jack Granger, my manager, who has been tremendous his whole career,
a complete team and program guy; Bo Zeigler for coming here and kind of
building some of the culture that I envisioned for this program moving forward
in the near future, in his one year, he made me a better coach; Pat Steeves,
extremely, extremely proud of him and the way he's been able to kind of take
his career back into his own hands after it being stripped away from him with
injury after injury after injury, and not giving in to all that and still
having a great two years here at GW. I can't thank him enough for what he's
been able to do here.  
  
And Yuta, I don't think anybody's, in my time here, certainly no one's given
more to the program than Yuta Watanabe does, especially when the lights are
off and after hours when no one's watching. I don't think there's anybody
that's giving more to the university and to the program, so I want to thank my
guys there.  
  
Proud of our team and the way we battled back in the second half of the year.
We had a young team. We had a very tough schedule to start. We did okay in the
non-conference, took some lumps. We had a rough month of January, and a low-
character team would have folded and packed it in, but they certainly did not
do that.  
  
I'm extremely proud of our guys for how they responded to such adversity,
being so young. Now I'm extremely excited to get into the off-season and build
off of this momentum and really take things to the next level in our
development, in our program.  
  
Really proud of this guy here. No one -- I'm probably the hardest on him out
of any of my guys but he takes it like a soldier every single day. Him and I
have a good relationship. We talk about that. But he's made of steel, man,
he's made of steel. In these last two games, what he's capable of, and he's
unselfish. He's a team guy, so I'm proud of Jair, as well, but credit to Saint
Louis for playing a really, really good game, especially the second half, and
making subpoena really big shots.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about Yuta right now? Given his career but
also the way things ended tonight with his injury?  
JAIR BOLDEN: I mean, I just told Yuta in the locker room that he's been a guy
that has given us underclassmen something to strive toward. Like Coach said,
he's extremely hard working, and a lot of guys that are 6-9 and as talented as
he is don't always work as hard as he does. So he's a benchmark for all of us
to reach.  
  
You know, we thank him for that. He's been our leader for two years, for the
two years I've been here. He's been the best defender on the team, the best
scorer on the team, and I have never played with a guy in my years of life
that has done so much in a game and off the court and in the locker room.  
  
Obviously he went down and guys, you know, guys like me are supposed to step
up when your best player goes down. But wasn't able to get it done for Yuta
tonight, and that's, you know, that's tough.  
  
Q. You held them to five made baskets the first half, 21 points. What
was working for you guys then and what changed second half?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: We were rebounding better in the first half than we were in
the second half. They didn't have as many second-chance points as they did in
the second half. And I don't know, in the first half -- I don't know, I'm not
really sure exactly what changed as far as X's and O's. We had the same game
plan moving forward. We had same game plan the second half as the first half.
I guess it was just an effort thing.  
  
Q. Their pressure in the second half got ten points off turnovers. What
did they do defensively to really put you guys back on your heels?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Nothing that we didn't expect. We know they play their 1-3-1
and they switch back to man when you get the ball below the free throw line or
into the corners. What we weren't able to do is handle that -- I wouldn't even
call it pressure, their three-quarter court or halfcourt 1-3-1, extended
1-3-1. We weren't able to get them back into their man and attack off it. We
let it make us stagnant a little bit, which is what they want. They want to
take the air out of the ball.  
  
We didn't do a good enough job of once we got them to reshape and matchup in
their man to running offense and getting the shots that we wanted to get. They
forced us into some tough shots and we also had some really shaky turnovers,
some whacky plays; the pass to the wing on Terry that goes through his hands.  
  
We just didn't execute the way we did in the first half, and we let their zone
make us stagnant, you know what I mean. That was a shame because I thought we
played really, really well in the first half, and we also dealt with some foul
trouble. Pat Steeves and Bo having a lot of foul trouble in the second half
hurt us some, too, especially on the glass, since they are so good on the
offensive glass and we needed those guys to rebound for us.  
  
Foul trouble hurt us, as well, and that was tough. When we went to zone to
kind of play some of those guys who did have fouls to kind of hide them and
save them a little bit; then they started hitting threes, in addition to
getting offensive rebounds because it's tougher to rebound their zones. It was
kind of just a collage of unfortunate events for us that occurred.  
  
So credit them, though. Credit them. They did a tremendous job of making us
stagnant in their 1-3-1. We didn't do a good enough job of executing.  
  
Q. How it you see Yuta's injury, and at that point, what did you tell
your team? I assume knowing that Yuta probably wasn't going to return to the
game?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, I mean, I saw in front of me, he was driving, guy was
running with him. I thought it was a foul to be honest with you. He stuck his
foot out there and he rolled his foot, rolled his ankle. You know, I was
hoping it wasn't as bad as it was, obviously, and I'm still not sure exactly
what happens. I'm glad the X-rays were negative and we're hoping he's fine.  
  
But what I told our guys, what we always tell our guys with injuries, hey,
next man up. We have a lot of basketball up and we've got to go grinding and
rebounding and defending and do all the things we need it do to win. It wasn't
a lot of time spent on, hey, Yuta is out, we have to go -- it's just, all
right, let's keep playing. Let's do what we need to do.  
  
I thought for the most part, we stayed the course, man. Like we missed the
front end of a one-and-one, we missed a wide open three, we had a couple
opportunities that, you know, we just didn't take advantage of. In a game like
this, that type, against a team who takes the air out of the ball and plays
junk defenses and all that kind of stuff, you've got to be able to make shots
and capitalize on those opportunities, and we simply didn't when we needed to.  
  
Q. First half, you controlled the paint offensively. Once French got
going in there and they are getting fouled, how difficult was that to handle
both them scoring inside with both Johnson and Bess hitting the threes?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: It was tough. French is such an aggressive player, that he
always gets people into foul trouble. He went to the line seven times but they
went to the line as a team, you know, 36 times and this is unacceptable.  
  
We pride ourselves on not fouling. We've been one of the best teams in the
country at not fouling all year, you know, and then we have 22 fouls a night
and that us because the guys that were fouling were the guys we needed to
rebound: Bo, Pat. We needed those guys in there, and that hurt us.  
  
But then when they went to their 1-3-1 and we went to our four-guard lineup to
kind of have more shooters and ball handers out there with their pressure, you
know, we weathered the storm there. We weren't fouling as much. But at that
point, you know, we're in our 2-3 zone and then they started hitting those
shots like you mentioned.  
  
I credit them. They are not a great three-point shooting team by any means.
Typically Jalen Johnson is a guy who hits the bulk of their threes and he hit
four of them today for them. They only hit seven of them, but they were huge
ones and timely ones.  
  
We had a miscommunication in our 2-3 zone, they got a big one. Jalen Johnson
was about 25 feet away and we're in our 2-3 zone and he just lined it up from
really deep and he knocked it in. They hit shots. They hit shots and sometimes
on the other ends, we were just stagnant. We were stagnant, couldn't get the
shots we wanted to get. Again, credit them.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Anthony Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19553)

### [Josh Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28360)

### [Trey Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34867)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
VCU 77 and Dayton 72  
  
ANTHONY GRANT: Really proud of our guys. I thought our guys battled. Give VCU
credit. They made enough plays at the end of the game to be able to close it
out, but really proud of the effort that we got today, all year long. Just
appreciative of the sacrifices that our guys made over the course of the year,
and this is an opportunity for us to learn and grow from this experience.  
  
Q. 70-65, you got the lead and you're feeling good. What did you think
went wrong? Looked like the offense got tentative in the last couple
minutes?  
TREY LANDERS: I think we had two shot clock violations, they were flying
around on defense and ended up getting stops which kind of ended up hurt being
us because we couldn't convert on the end of the floor.  
  
JOSH CUNNINGHAM: Like Trey said, we got late on the shot clock and that's what
affected us.  
  
Q. Do you think your offense ran better inside-out, you got better
looks, and at times, did you get away from that?  
TREY LANDERS: I feel like we got a lot of clean looks, especially in the first
half, we just didn't hit the shots. Second half, was pretty much more of the
same thing, we're an inside-out team, especially when you have a guy as
dominant as Josh; him being able to pass the ball, moving around him. I feel
like we got a little stagnant the second half but at the end of the day, I
feel like we had a lot of clean looks.  
  
JOSH CUNNINGHAM: I think we were 50/50. We just weren't making shots.  
  
Q. What happened on that play where you got your bell running and how
did you feel there for a second?  
TREY LANDERS: I was coming over the foul and Williams ended up coming over and
he kind of head-butted me, but it wasn't nothing crazy. I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Coach, you gave your guys offensive freedom, including the guards.
How hard is it to teach guys to actually go inside-out on a consistent basis,
when they know they can shoot; you give them the green light?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I thought, you know, like Trey said, I thought we got some
looks today that didn't go for us and that's the game of basketball.  
  
So my thing with our guys is just make sure that we're being as efficient as
we can in terms of generating the type of shots we want. We missed some inside
today. We missed some outside today. We left a little bit on the table at the
end.  
  
At the end of the day, you know, with the five-point lead, VCU was able to get
a corner three. They were able to get a drive against a contested drive to
finish and then a tough shot overextended hands by Williams at the end of the
game.  
  
You know, so that's the game of basketball, and the thing that you ask every
day, you can't control whether or not shots fall every night. You know,
obviously we would like to have a couple possessions back that either resulted
in turnovers or opportunities that we felt like we didn't take advantage of.
That's the game of basketball. You know, so I don't know if that answers your
question, but that's just part of it, man.  
  
Q. How are you going to remember your first season here?  
ANTHONY GRANT: You know, I'm going to sit back like I always do and reflect,
but like I said, at this point, what I feel is I'm proud of that group that we
had. There was a lot that this team went through over the course of the
season. But that group in that locker room, there was tears being shed because
they wanted the season to continue. They wanted to continue to play with each
other.  
  
So right now, that's what's on my mind is I'm grateful for the effort that
those guys gave us, the buy-in that they had in terms of what myself and our
staff asked of them, the sacrifices that they made for us over the course of
the year.  
  
Joey Gruden as a walk-on leaving, you know, we've got a group of guys in there
that need to learn from this year's experience and you know, experience
sometimes can be the best teacher. So we need to grow from this and look
forward to getting ready for the NCAA.  
  
Q. You mentioned the young guys at one point. You had four freshmen in
in the final minutes. Do you feel like as a group, they got better as the
season went on?  
ANTHONY GRANT: No question. No question. I noticed the same thing from where
we started, to where those guys finished being able to be out, and basically
another freshman in Trey because he didn't really play last year, out there as
a crucial time and hold their own, I was proud of that.  
  
I think obviously at the end of the game, we'll look at things that we could
have done better, plays that we could have made, rotations or whatever it is,
but this team grew. You know, they grew and you know, they understood. They
learned what it would take and now we've got to take that next step as a team
to be able to win games like these.  
  
Q. You guys were down throughout most of the second half and you finally
get that lead, up five a few times. What happened there? Did they just get a
little tentative with some of the shot clock violations?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I have to go back and look at it. One of the shot clock
violations, we were disjointed offensively. Ended up with a fadeaway shot on
the baseline that just was a bad offensive possession.  
  
The other one, VCU did a good job defensively, a couple deflections that
didn't go out-of-bounds; that the possession continued, got deflected out-of-
bounds and we ended up with a late clock situation with no time-outs. We just
couldn't -- it was good defense on their part. That's basketball, man.  
  
And we were in a zone possession, they got a swing around the perimeter, found
the guy open in the corner and we didn't make the rotation that we needed to
make and he got a clean look and he made it. You know, I thought the zone
bothered him for a while -- his ability to get the other shot that they made,
that gave them the lead, were both contested, tough twos, you know, that those
guys did a great job of finishing. I thought 'Stas did a good job of being
vertical and contesting the one, and then at the end of the game, Williams'
shot over Matej.  
  
Q. Offensively?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Yeah, probably once I look at the film, probably a lot of
things I'd like to change. You can always go back and look at it and say, oh,
you know, let's do it over, but in the heat of the moment, you know, you've
got to to live with that.  
  
Q. How do you think you did defensively against Tillman throughout the
game?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I thought second half, you know, he was able to get it a little
bit more going than he did in the first. I thought our guys as a team did a
really good job. Give them credit. They had other guys that stepped up today
for them.  
  
You look across the board, they had five guys, almost six guys in double
figures today. They got good play off of their bench with some of the plays
some of the guys were able to come in and make for them. Yeah, I give their
team credit.  
  
Thanks, guys.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

### [Hasahn French](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34896)

### [Jalen Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32907)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 70, George Washington 63  
  
TRAVIS FORD: Really proud of our team's efforts and focus, especially in the
second half. I thought in the first half, we were playing hard but we were
playing with a mentality of not to lose.  
  
Second half I thought we played with a mentality to go out and play to win. At
halftime, we kind of threw caution to the wind and our halftime talk, as far
as we changed a lot of things at halftime. We wanted to send four guys to the
offensive glass. We wanted to attack more on offense and fastbreak and usually
we are kind of just the opposite. We're trying to control the pace of the
game.  
  
And at halftime I told them, "Hey, we've got to go. I've got to let you out of
the gate and we've got to go: We started switching everything, which we
weren't doing in the first half, and I thought our 1-3-1 made a big difference
in the second half. But it was the mentality change. I told our guys: We were
playing hard the first half. We just weren't being productive. We weren't
being very productive at all in the first half. Playing hard. Intent was
right. We just weren't getting anything done.  
  
So really proud of these guys coming out the second half with their back
against the wall, because I thought GW was really in a rhythm and really
playing well. So really proud of these guys.  
  
Q. You hit a couple big threes in the first half to keep you guys in it.
What was behind that? Did you feel like you needed those shots in order to
just keep you guys within striking distance?  
JALEN JOHNSON: I mean, most of the shots probably came from this man right
here. So the credit goes to him. He's the one down there getting double-teamed
and taking all the bruises and stuff for me to get the open shots.  
  
Yeah, they were big shots, and they are big shots; and I know I'm supposed to
shoot the ball for my team because that's what they want me to do. They want
me to knock down shots, and I love them for that because that's what I've been
doing my whole life.  
  
Q. In the second half, you were able to get the ball inside and be able
to score in the paint. What was the difference in the second half for you?  
HASAHN FRENCH: Just playing more aggressive. I knew my team really needed me
to play aggressive on defense and I knew that would spark my offense. So
that's what I tried to do and then just doing anything and whatever it takes
to win, just helped me the second half.  
  
Q. Coach said that you guys kind of threw everything against the wall at
half. Was it a calm locker room? Was Coach upset? Or did you guys know that it
didn't go well in the first half and you could play better in the second
half?  
JALEN JOHNSON: I would say, Coach is so great at being calm but being
motivated. He's able to motivate us at our lowest. Like when he came in the
locker room he's like, "Guys, don't worry, we got this. We going to make our
run and we are going to do this, we are going going to do this, and here is
our game plan.  
  
He's so good at that, and when he does get mad we feel it. Yes, we feel it,
but today, he's motivating us. He's like, "Guys, we're here. This is the
Atlantic 10 Tournament. We belong here. This is our stage. This is what we
need to do."  
  
TRAVIS FORD: What he said is I'm a lot nicer tonight than I usually a.m.
(Laughter) And I was.  
  
Q. Second half, I think you shot 67 percent. You've said before, you
guys aren't the greatest offensive --  
TRAVIS FORD: We were the Warriors in the second half.  
  
Q. Was there anything that you could put your finger on that would make
such a difference from 25 percent to 67 percent?  
TRAVIS FORD: I think you made a good point earlier. Jalen Johnson was our only
offense first half, he was it. I told our coaches, "We have to get some other
people involved. We have to start manufacturing shots."  
  
We're a team if you've seen us play, we're a team that runs offense. We move
the ball. And I told our team at halftime, we're going to have to -- first of
all, we're going to send everybody to the offensive glass. That's one way
we're going to get more shots and plus, psychologically, I was trying to just
get them to be aggressive. I was hoping, all right, they field it, all right,
I'm letting them loose, I'm letting them play so everybody go to the offensive
glass. Keep it alive because we're getting killed on the offensive glass.
We've got to return the favor a little bit.  
  
Second, I told them, we need to pick up the pace. We get a rebound, we need to
put pressure on them. You saw Davell Roby really doing a good job. You saw
Javon Bess doing a good job and we were attacking the rim. And I thought that
was a difference, and just, you know, I told them, we just need to move the
ball a little bit quicker than we moved it. We need to play inside to out with
drives, not just post feeds but with some drives, as well.  
  
Shots went down. You know, one of the coaches, one of the assistants said, we
actually got pretty good shots the first half. We just didn't make any of
them.  
  
Then the other thing I would add, our defense really created some offense for
us. Our defense, they shot a very high percentage, I thought, for us, against
us, we're one of the better defensive field goal percentage teams in the
league in the first half and I told them we have to get off that mark. Every
number at halftime on the stats sheet, as I told our team, is going against
us. Every number goes against who we are: Points in the paint, second chance
points, everything that we dominate, we're getting dominated. We're absolutely
getting dominate in it. It was just a change of mentality. It was a change of
mentality.  
  
Q. You guys are shorthanded obviously and you had foul trouble. Just the
balance of just keeping everybody in and --  
TRAVIS FORD: It might have been the worst foul trouble eve been in all year
long. We were in -- we had four guys I think with two fouls in the first half
and I normally don't play guys with two fouls but I had Javon Bess had two
fouls, D.J. had two fouls. Davell had two fouls. And that might have been it.
But we were in serious foul trouble.  
  
So we had to go zone, we played about four to five minutes of zone, but what
helped us in the second half stay out of foul trouble is we were scoring more
and we were scoring more and it allowed us to set up our 1-3-1 which we don't
foul as much out of that, and we were probably in our 1-3-1, probably for 20
seconds of the shot clock, which allowed us to sustain two things. Sustain
foul trouble and fatigue a little bit.  
  
Q. Finally, you just won this game, but looking ahead to Davidson, what
challenges do they bring to you guys?  
TRAVIS FORD: A lot. I mean obviously what they have done in our league says
enough. They have got some incredible stats. We played them so long ago, it
was the second game of the conference season. So it was a long time ago.  
  
We're going to have to, you though, familiarize ourselves a little bit. Our
players, you know, go back to what they do, our guys know their players. They
have a lot of respect. They have some of the best players in our league. They
really had a great, great conference season, and you just look at all their
stats, really, really impressive basketball team.  
  
We're going to have to get some rest and play extremely well. We understand
the challenge. It's going to be a tough tough challenge because we have a lot
of respect for Davidson and what they have accomplished.  
  
Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Keith Drambot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34890)

### [Rene Castro-Caneddy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34891)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Richmond 81, Duquesne 68  
  
KEITH DRAMBOT: I think, you know, kind of disappointed with just how we played
over the last month, really. Our guys gave us everything they had.  
  
But I think the biggest thing is, this is -- I'm not an architect, but that's
pretty much what I am right now. I have to build this program for the future,
and we made some baby steps this year. We laid a little bit of the foundation,
and then we kind of died on the vine. But we went from three wins in the
league to seven; we went from ten wins overall to 16.  
  
But you know, just disappointed. I'm not used to sitting in this chair and
being knocked out in the first round. So we didn't play one of our better
games. They played well. Our deficiencies really showed tonight, which, you
know, is disappointing.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be part of this process that Coach was just
talking about, where building things up and laying a foundation as a guy
that's not going be to be here going forward; do you feel like you're leaving
Duquesne in a better place than you found?  
RENE CASTRO-CANEDDY: Yeah, through my beginning years, I struggled. I think I
was very blessed to get this coaching staff. I think we laid a foundation. We
had an improvement from three to seven wins, but I definitely think for the
future, definitely going to be top in the league.  
  
So I think I tried to lay a foundation. I'm just blessed to meet this coaching
staff because they really helped me have a good senior year.  
  
Q. This is a team that was defense first, maybe the last month, as Coach
alluded to, maybe not as much success on that end. Why do you think that is
and how can this team moving forward continue to make defense their
identity?  
RENE CASTRO-CANEDDY: I just think we didn't focus on our habits. I think at
the end of the day, we always play like in spurts, and I think our habits
really got us. Whether we built it in practice or stuff, it was just some of
our habits. Like our whole team just not really focusing on details, on
scouting reports. I think we kind of just did that the last month and it kind
of bit us.  
  
Q. What is it about Richmond's style of play that just seemed like you
couldn't get comfortable today and find a rhythm?  
RENE CASTRO-CANEDDY: I think they run Princeton offense, so it was a little
bit difficult. Most of the guys can pass, shoot and difficult, so I think it
was just difficult for us to guard. It was just a unique style of offense
that's really hard to guard, and they have great players in it.  
  
Q. Like you said, you guys improved a lot this year. Do you think the
team exceeded your expectations of what you thought you were going to be able
to do coming into the season?  
RENE CASTRO-CANEDDY: I guess so. We were picked 14th and we came in tenth, and
once again, we had a couple of heartbreaking losses to URI at the buzzer; St.
Bonny's at home at the buzzer, and so those are the top two teams in the
league. For sure we exceeded a little bit, but still much more improvement for
the years to come for them.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask two questions. One, how does this tournament
prepare to your previous conference tournaments in other conferences? And
Richmond put up 18 points without a single senior scoring. Is this just a nice
young team or do you see them taking steps for the years to come??  
KEITH DRAMBOT: Can you repeat that? I was laughing to myself when you asked
the first question.  
  
Q. It's a nice young team in Richmond, they made 81 points without a
single senior going. Obviously you guys are building, as well, but do you see
this as the start of something really nice for Richmond?  
KEITH DRAMBOT: So the answer to the first question is: This tournament stinks
because I'm used to playing in the Championship game. So I'm not used to
getting knocked out this early. That's facetious; please don't print that.  
  
I mean, it's a good tournament. The one advantage that MAC has is they play in
one spot every year, Cleveland, so everybody knows it. Good venue like this,
professional arena. I think that's an advantage. That's just my take on it.
But I guess when you live in Akron and Cleveland is a half hour, you really
like that venue. It's a well-run tournament. It's a very good league.  
  
The second part of the question, obviously they have a good base to be
championship level. At some point, they are going to have to get better depth,
just like us. But he's a really good coach. He's really good at what they do.
Like that's hard. You know, we had as much problem guarding him, but we
couldn't -- the matchup zone is an issue, too, because you have to attack that
thing inside and if you can't score inside, it becomes an issue, which gave us
problems.  
  
So everything was on the perimeter. It had to be finesseful, which I really
don't like, but you know, that system allows to you play with better people
and it also allows to you play with worse people.  
  
So they can play fast but sometimes they play slow. And obviously they have
got a good post player which really helps them -- helps the rest of them,
because you have to protect the inside first, but they are -- you can tell,
you know, he's a true Princeton guy, you know. Like it's no -- it's not fake.
He's from Princeton, so he knows the ins and outs better than the people that
run that stuff that didn't go to Princeton or played for Pete or those guys.  
  
Q. With 32 games in this season, may or may not be in the books, what
are you looking at from a learning experience that you maybe had as a learning
lesson that you can apply to this season moving forward?  
KEITH DRAMBOT: Well, first and foremost, just so we're clear on this: I'm
competitive, so I'm not very happy. I really didn't -- I didn't really like
the way we played at all. I hated the last month. But I also signed up for it.  
  
We're going to have a brand new team next year, obviously, with ten new guys.
So we're going to have some -- a few more blocks, hopefully, to build our
building, figuratively, and literally.  
  
So the good part is, I learned the league a little bit. You know, in the MAC
when you've been there as long as I have, three different times, I pretty much
knew what coach was going to do what, when and how they were going to play
every single play we ran. Whereas this year, I really didn't know anything. I
sat at the wrong bench at Rhode Island. I was on the wrong side of the floor.
So like this is all new for me. Even at 60 years old, you feel like you're a
first-timer at times.  
  
So look, we learned a lot more about the league. I have a really good feel for
what the league is now. The interesting thing about the league is it's
diverse. So different people play different ways, but most of it is on the
perimeter. So that's one thing I know for sure.  
  
Q. It looked like Eric was really struggling tonight. Why do you think
that was, and what does it do to the rest of the team when he struggles,
particularly with rebounding?  
KEITH DRAMBOT: When Eric Williams has struggled this year, we haven't been
very good, and so, you know, again, this is all new for him, too. That's his
first conference tournament, and his first four minutes wasn't very good,
right, and it affected hip.  
  
Again, the game of basketball involves handling adversity and handling
prosperity, and that's an area that he's going to have to improve on is
handling adversity. When things have gone well for him, he's been really good,
but when things have started slowly for him, he's had some rough nights at
times.  
  
So most of his is just building better practice habits and just maturing and
being able to handle those things, and that's coaching, as well.  
  
Q. Talk about Kellon Taylor, what he brings to the table and what are
your expectations for him going forward?  
KEITH DRAMBOT: That's a really good question. The thing I like best about
Kellon is he's competitive. I think maybe the most competitive of anybody on
our team, and the other thing I really like about him is he's emotionally
engaged and the Pittsburgh people know I've said that before. He has a mouth
and he opens it, and he thinks he's good, right.  
  
And so you know, he's a football player playing basketball, but he's a good
basketball player. You know, we laughed in the locker room, we said, well, why
does Kellon play good defense? And the answer is, because he has to, because
he really isn't very good on offense, right. He gets a lot done but he's just
a tough kid. Obviously comes from a winning program, and generally guys that
have come from winning programs know how to compete.

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Jeff Neubauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26822)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Washington 78, Fordham 72  
  
Q. What made Zeigler so difficult to deal with on the offensive
boards?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, so first of all, I mean, he's big and strong. He's an
experienced player. So when you get a guy like that that's an older player
with the length and athleticism that he has, he's really tough. He also made
some really good driving moves where he drove hard right and spun back to his
left. Those are difficult it guard.  
  
Q. You seemed to do a pretty good job on Yuta tonight. What was your
game plan to contain him?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Well, last Wednesday night, he had his career high against us,
and most of those points that he got last Wednesday, were in transition. So we
really made a point of emphasis to try to just not let him get opportunities
in transition, and we did a much better job.  
  
Q. And finally, any reflections or words on the season as a whole?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, our guys kept battling until the end. So there at the
end, we literally had four guys left and our guys were fighting the whole way
and that's what we asked him to do. So we certainly are proud of our effort.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Matt McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30687)

### [C.J. Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18420)

### [Carl Pierre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34836)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
UMASS 69, La Salle 67  
  
MATT McCALL: Extremely proud of our team. I thought it was a game where there
was just an enormous amount of adversity, foul trouble, and our guys really,
really battled through it. And even late in the game there, having an
opportunity up one with the ball twice underneath an out-of-bounds and was
trying to use Unique a little bit there as a decoy on a lob play. But give La
Salle credit; they defended well both times and still found a way to get a
stop.  
  
Malik really anchors our defense a lot at the 5-spot, and you know, him being
out the at the game there late, you like him out on the floor, so we went with
five guards and Ray Miller did an unbelievable job loading up on Pookie Powell
there and made them take a really, really challenge, difficult shot.  
  
But proud of our team. Proud of this group. I said to the locker room, it was
pretty evident after the game, you know, during the game, that C.J. Anderson
didn't want his clothe career to end, and he played with a vengeance today.
Just really proud of everyone.  
  
Luwane was on the bench there for a large portion of the second half, and we
found a way to score and get points. You know, I thought we were getting
pretty stagnant will offensively in the first half. I thought we were settling
too much.  
  
And C.J. did an unbelievable job in the second half getting down in the lane
and creating plays and creating offense for us.  
  
Q. Carl, you had the sequence where you had the block and then had a
couple of baskets shortly after that, right after Luwane picked up his fourth
foul. Was this one of those situations where a guy gets into a foul situation
and everybody raises their game because of it?  
CARL PIERRE: For sure. I think we just like to -- we preach just having the
next man up, everyone's got to be ready. Before every game we tell every
person to be ready and I think today was a game where that really was
emphasized. Had a few guys with foul trouble, and I think everyone just
stepped up their game and played with an intensity that we really needed to
pull it out.  
  
Q. Coach just mentioned, you trying to get the most out of every last
moment of your career. You've been down the stretch more aggressive. Does it
feel like you're trying to not leave anything on the table?  
C.J. ANDERSON: That's exactly what's going on. It's been a long, long journey
so far, but I mean, we have so much left in our team to keep winning, keep
playing, keep battling. So I mean, I just preach to God, man, we're ready. We
just celebrate it. We just won a good game. That's one. It's time to get back
to the boards and get ready for the next one.  
  
Q. Carl, as a freshman, what do you think of your first experience of
the postseason in college?  
CARL PIERRE: I've been very excited to play in the postseason. It's been a
really fun experience, high-level basketball. This is definitely what I signed
up for and I'm really excited to play as much as I have been, and I've just
been trying to get out there and play with an edge, every play, every
possession.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, given some of the close games that you guys
have been in down the stretch, did that kind of help you to be sort of in the
right mindset for postseason play?  
C. J. ANDERSON: Most definitely. I feel like the changing point for us in the
game was we got into it when we were trying to decide if we were going to go
man or zone, and you know, we were sort of going back at each other, you know,
arguing a little bit.  
  
Then we came into the time-out, we talked about it and as soon as we got out
of the huddle, a Carl came up to me, like, "Yo, C, I got you: And I got you
too, my bad. I feel like that was I changing point because you know when it
comes to pest season play, it's all about facing adversity and it's all about
overcoming it, and I feel like that was big for us.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel like this first win is getting over that first hump
for you to make a deep run here in the tournament?  
CARL PIERRE: I wouldn't consider it getting over a hump or anything, because I
was confident with my team from jump. We know what we're capable of. We can
play with just about anyone as long as we're locked in and we play with
intensity, and I feel like this first game is just a testament to that.  
  
Q. You have struggled to score sometimes with Pippen. What CHANGED?  
MATT McCALL: We kept the ball in C.J.'s hands in an enormous amount there, and
he was attacking and kept getting down in the lane.  
  
I thought Malik was aggressive. We got him some post touches in there and
Malik has really, really improved. He's day guy that's gotten better each and
every day. We feel comfortable as a team rolling it into them and letting him
work and going in there and scoring.  
  
I thought it was a huge play. We ran a little action there and we put Carl in
a pick-and-roll with the ball in his hands, and he made a great play got right
to the elbow for a pull-up jumper late in the game. I thought that was a huge
play for us, as well.  
  
As long as we're playing the game unselfish, as long as the ball is moving,
you know, we didn't have a high number of assists. I thought we had way too
many turnovers tonight but as long as we're playing the game unselfishly, you
know, we're going to get open looks.  
  
Q. Did the George Mason game help prepare you guys for that stretch
without Pip? Looked like you didn't flinch and were comfortable with different
guys taking the aggression.  
MATT McCALL: Yeah, you know, I think the whole season's prepared you for this.
I mean, there's been times where he's been out on the floor. There's been
times where he hasn't been out on the floor, and again, I said it on the radio
before the game, I'll say it again, I said it after the Duquesne game, you
know, C.J. Anderson is playing his best basketball of his UMASS career. I
wasn't here for the first three years of it, but I guarantee you, that's the
case and really, started there kind of late in the season and was terrific at
George Mason, as well.  
  
So you know, I think even when Pip came back in the game, he deferred a little
bit. He kept giving the ball back to C.J. and we kind of played him off the
ball and listen, Pip wants to win, as well. He's not concerned or consumed
right now with shooting and scoring. He wants us to advance in this
tournament.  
  
Q. You played Mason twice this year and went to over time twice and lost
twice. Now I have 18 hours to prepare to play them in a building about two
miles from their campus. Assuming it goes done to the wire, which I assume it
will, what do you think is going to be the X-factor or what will fans tuning
in look for to see who will come out ahead?  
MATT McCALL: Is it only two miles? I think it's a bit further. Two miles is
the Washington Monument.  
  
Listen, we were in two battles with them. The first game we were a completely
different team. We had Rashaan Holloway, we had Chris Baldwin that first time
we played him. The second time we played them, we didn't have Pipkins. I think
both games are different. You know, and our guys are excited to play. You
know, neither one of those games is going to have any impact on this game.  
  
We've got to go out and execute and we've got to follow the game plan and
would he have got to get back tonight and get some rest and watch fell many as
a staff and find different ways to attack them that worked the last time.
Maybe we need to adjust some things this time and we've got to go out and
play.  
  
But those two games, you know, they are not going to have an impact on this
game here. They have got a terrific team. They have had a great year. You
know, Coach Paulson has done an unbelievable job putting them in position to
be in the top half of the league here and we're excited. We are excited to
continue to play and our guys, they will be ready to go.  
  
Q. You mentioned you'll watch some film tonight. Specifically, with such
a tight turnaround, can you share exactly what to might and tomorrow morning
will look like for you?  
MATT McCALL: Yeah, I think, what time is the game, 2:30? So, you know, it will
be a late night for me. Our players will get back. Our staff does an
unbelievable job of scouting, so our assistant coaches have already prepared
the scout for this game. George Mason didn't play today, so it's not like
you're going to watch that game film.  
  
We'll get back to the hotel. We'll show the guys a look of things we did well
in the game, things we didn't do well the last time we played them and both
times we've played them and where we need to get better, and then our guys
will get rest. They will get treatment. We'll be up watching tape and then
tomorrow morning will be a walk-through, no shootaround. We'll be walking
through some stuff in the hotel. Got to go out and play.  
  
This time of year, it always boils down to -- advancing in the tournament
comes down to playing inspired, playing really, really hard. Doing the little
things in the game because you're not always going it make shots. We made ten
threes tonight. I don't know if you can make ten threes tomorrow night. If we
don't, we've got to get ourselves second-chance opportunities, get to the
backboard and really guard.  
  
I thought late in the game, the last time we played them, we did a pretty good
job keeping the ball out of Otis Livingston's hand and we ended up fouling a
three-point shooter by the logo. So we've got to look at some of that stuff
and see how we can continue to be aggressive with him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Maurice Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20779)

### [Jair Bolden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34847)

### [Bo Zeigler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34848)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Washington 78, Fordham 72  
  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I credit my guys now for staying the course, going down 12 in
the first half and being able to come back and take a lead and go into
halftime with a one-point lead is special, and Jair was a huge part of that.
Bo got into foul trouble in the first half and wasn't able to play too many
minutes. Not sure how many minutes he played. He ended up with 16 points, and
I think all of those were in the second half if I'm not mistaken.  
  
Really proud of our guys and how spirited they played. A lot of credit goes to
Fordham for making us a little stagnant there for the majority of the game,
but really happy with this win and happy to be moving on and now we have to
get back and prepare for Saint Louis.  
  
Q. Jair, you guys were tied for quite a bit of the game and going back
and forth, lots of lead changes. What do you think in the end allowed you to
pull ahead?  
JAIR BOLDEN: We paid attention to the game plan better. We knew Coach on the
sideline always yells when it's time like that, it's winning time. We know
when it gets to crunch time, we have to pay more attention to the game plan
and get stops because that's ultimately what won us the game. We were able to
string together some stops.  
  
Q. Like Coach mentioned, first half, only a couple minutes there. How
did you stick with the game and kind of keep the mindset you needed to do what
you did there in the second half?  
BO ZEIGLER: I knew I had foul trouble in the first half. So I just told
myself, second half, I'm going to try to get every rebound that I can, and I
think just things started going well for me. I ended up in the right place at
the right time. Mazzulla started finding me, Jair started finding me and I
started getting my rhythm and my energy carried on to the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Jair, after losing to Saint Louis on the road, playing them tomorrow,
what are you looking forward to in the game or trying to focus on to try to
win this time?  
JAIR BOLDEN: This time, we had a lot of turnovers. I had a lot of turnovers in
that game. There were a couple times we weren't ready -- or I wasn't ready for
their 1-3-1 defense, their junk defense, the way they play. This game, we're
looking forward to executing more on offense and then getting those hustle
play that is we missed in the first game, those offensive rebounds that they
got late, just kind of the -- a little bit out-working us and we don't really
like when teams, as anyone does, when teams out work you.  
  
So this time around, looking to just play a lot harder and pay attention to
little details that win us the game.  
  
Q. Bo, difference in the second half, what do you feel you were able it
take advantage of? You had eight straight points.  
BO ZEIGLER: They were downing me. The way they play, they usually try to key
in on the major guys and then leave the other guys to just basically say,
these guys have to beat us. So I took it personal and tried to drive the ball
every time I got a chance to, things went well for me.  
  
Q. Jair, when it was a 12-point game there in the first half, you kind
of stepped up and were taking some shots and making some shots. Just what were
you feeling in that stretch and what you sort of needed to do to get back in
the game?  
JAIR BOLDEN: Well I knew the way they played, they were trying to take Yuta
off the game and Yuta is our leading scorer. When they keyed on Yuta and were
denying him the ball, I knew that someone had to step up.  
  
I was just, you know, just being aggressive at any chance I get and when I
have the ball, I'm always trying to be aggressive. The guys, our game plan was
good. Guys were setting really good screens up top and I was just able to get
open.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at what Fordham was able to do against Yuta and
make it a little more difficult for him than obviously the last time you
met?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: No. The first game, we were able to get out in transition a
great deal and Yuta was playing on his senior night. He had an extra jolt of
adrenaline and emotion and was playing like a man possessed. We knew that they
were going to be able to make adjustments going into this game and how they
played, and they did. They played top-sided, doubled him some. They really
didn't give him any daylight for the majority of the game. He got some open
looks, but they were very seldom.  
  
So they play a tough style of defense with their two-man zone and they deny
guys, and SO it's hard to make entry passes to the wings and sometimes they
will double-team ball screens and they will play topside in the post, and
sometimes it feels like you just don't have any ability to just make a pass.
You know, they really junk it up and they make it tough on teams to score. We
were able to find some holes, and Bo was able to take advantage of how they
play, and we executed the game plan in that regard. So I was really, really
happy about that.  
  
Then you know, we were able to -- like Jair said, string together stops late.
We didn't do a very good job throughout the course of the game of getting
consecutive stops with you we got some late and we were able to pull it out.  
  
So that was a tough win, tough team to play against. Tough style defensively
to pay against, and again a lot of credit to those guys because they played
really, really well. Chartouny's was making all kind of finishes, looking like
James Harden out there and Slanina came out of the gate and three straight
threes. They played really, really well, so a lot of credit to Fordham.  
  
Q. Terry Nolan, Jr. didn't play much tonight and he's been a pretty key
part of your starting lineup. What was it like having to adjust without him?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, he brings a lot to our team, deflection, steals,
rebounds, he gets a lot of assists. In this game last time, I think he only
had two or four points but he had nine rebounds and six assists in this game
against Fordham so we needed him to come out in transition, so I'm glad Maceo
Jack was able to come in and soften that blow a little bit. He got ten points
and played really well. Shot three-for-four, hit two huge, huge threes. So
situation like that, we have to have the next-man-up mentality and Maceo did
just that; Bo did just that and the guys stayed the course and we were able to
come out with a huge win against a team that's really tough to play against.  
  
Q. You guys won the battle of the boards tonight by 17. What was the key
in consistency getting those second chances offensively and then denying them
to one-and-done?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, that was a big part of our game plan. You know, a lot of
times, for us, our best offense is the glass. And Toro does a tremendous job
on the glass. He had 15 rebounds tonight, five of them on the offensive end
and then Bo came in, he had seven rebounds it seemed like in a span of ten
minutes there, had seven rebounds and four on the offensive glass. That was
part of the game plan.  
  
It's going to be tough for us to score. We're going to have to take some tough
contested shots because of the way they played, but we knew we would get some
opportunities on the glass if we were diligent about pursuing second chance
opportunities. On the other end we had to make sure our ball screen coverage
was sharp. It wasn't in the first half. We had to make some adjustments, a few
adjustments throughout the game because we were struggling with Slanina
initially picking and popping, and then when we did a better job on that and
limited him shooting, they got some things off their own penetration.  
  
So we didn't do a great job there, but once we started to hunker down, we were
able to get some stops, and they shot 12-for-27 in the second half; so really
didn't defend at a high clip but we did when we needed to late. Again,
sometimes that's what you need to do. Sometimes it's going to be ugly. You're
going to get scored on, you make your adjustments and when it counts, your
guys have to bite down and gets stops and be gritty and we were able to do
that. Yuta had a huge stop; Toro had a huge rebound.  
  
That play that Mazz made on the free throw line, when I think Bo, missed the
front end of a one-on-one, that's a huge winning play. That's probably the
play of the game where we brought it back out and able to eat more clock and
get fouled. Our guys were able to make winning plays late, and that's what
it's about. That's what we do to in order to win.  
  
Q. Lessons learned against Saint Louis the last time you faced them?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: The glass. You know, sometimes in the scouting reports, it's
not always going to be X's and O's, it's not going to be schemes and all that
kind of stuff and what you can do offensively and defensively. Sometimes
you've got to play tougher. They got 15 offensive rebounds in the game in our
gym last time and they were getting stops, our defense wasn't bad.  
  
We were getting stops, we were forcing them to take tough shots but French was
a monster on the glass. Johnson got on the glass. Best got some on the glass.
So we have to do a much better job on the glass than the first time around and
we have to be able to run our offense with some fluidity. They play the 1-3-1
and they switch to man and they play some three-two zones and some two-three
zones and switch up their defenses as well. We have to make sure we are not
stagnant and we are playing with some fluidity, as opposed to playing stagnant
trying to figure what they are in, because that's what he they want. They kind
of take the air out of the ball that way and they do a tremendous job at it
and that's why they are one of the best defensive teams in the conference. We
have to be better on the glass and we have to be sharper executing on offense
against their switching defenses, and if we do that, we give ourselves a shot
to win.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Tony Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34833)

### [Amar Stukes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34832)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
UMASS 69, La Salle 67  
  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: This was an emotional loss. Obviously it's the last loss of
the season. It's an emotional loss obviously for our seniors. It was
unfortunately typical of our season. We just couldn't get over the hump,
especially in close games. You know, our record in overtime games and games
that came down to the last shot is not good.  
  
You know, we give effort to put ourselves in position to win games, and we've
just come up a little bit short. But I'm proud of our guys, and I look forward
to Johnny, B.J. and Amar and Tony, being, you know, family for the rest of our
lives. As a coach who has done this for a long time, there's nothing better
than former players, because at that point, the relationship is not about
basketball any more, and it's actually more personal and more meaningful to
see these guys go on in life.  
  
You know, 1-for-16 on threes is a huge factor. Their offensive rebounds late
was a huge factor. You know, I thought Pookie's shots were great shots, and he
gave great effort to create them and just by bad luck they didn't go in. I
don't think our team or Pookie have anything in that area to feel bad about,
other than the because didn't go in the basket.  
  
UMASS, listen, in this league, everyone's good. UMASS has beaten Providence.
They have beat earn Georgia. In this league, you have good teams without good
records because of the schedules we play.  
  
So I have a lot of respect for UMASS. They beat us. They made the extra plays.
They defended. They got, as I said, some really big offensive rebounds and
they deserved it.  
  
Q. Amar, knowing that this is the last go-around in the Atlantic 10
Tournament for you guys, and when the shots aren't falling; that sometimes
maybe it can compound on itself, knowing what this tournament is for you guys,
and when the shots aren't falling, it can multiply?  
AMAR STUKES: I don't think it multiplies. Just we didn't hit shots today
honestly. That's pretty much what it was. We've already played against UMASS.
I mean, we were prepared. We just didn't make the shots.  
  
Q. Tony, when the shots weren't falling, they went inside to you. How
important was it for you to do some scoring and to keep it in there, and can
you talk about the frustration when you guys are seeing shots that just won't
go in? Not bad shots; they just don't go in.  
TONY WASHINGTON: I was trying hard to get the offensive rebound and whatnot,
but traffic got inside for me and I just had to do my part and tried to score
as much as I can, or create for other players on the team.  
  
Q. For either of you, I assume you guys practiced the last second, 3-2-1
play. Is it more about positioning or about having the exact strategy in mind,
or how do you guys do it in practice and how does it work out in practice?  
AMAR STUKES: I mean, you can't really draw up exactly what situation you're
going to be in, like where exactly the players are going to be. But I mean, we
came up with some late-second plays and we really just wanted to get the ball
to Pook. He's the fastest player on our team. We know he can get up the court
in four seconds. He's accustomed to making clutch shots, so we got the ball to
the right person. Just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Amar, you guys had several time outs, 14 seconds left. What were you
saying it each other at that point in the huddle?  
AMAR STUKES: We really just needed to buckle down and get a stop. That's all
we walking about, was either get the stop or we going home.  
  
Q. Is it difficult on the sidelines when the shot aren't falling, but
you're still in the game and it gets to a point where you just need one to go
in, and it doesn't; it's a good look, but it doesn't go in.  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: Yeah, I think, you know the answer to that. We were a shot
away and one for 16 on threes is historically low, probably our lowest of the
season. Those shots Pookie had were great.  
  
So yeah, it's disappointing. Like I said, UMASS deserves a lot of credit. I
thought their overall defense was good, and I thought they really hurt us on
some offensive rebounds late. But yeah, you're right, one of those balls goes
in and we win.  
  
Q. Amar is a kid who has worn a La Salle uniform for a long time and I
know you recruited him for a long time and he's been part of the program for
probably even past the five years that he has been. If you could just -- what
has it been like coaching him these last five years and what will it be like
without him?  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: I can't say enough good things about Amar Stukes. Sometimes
words just don't do justice. I trust him in every way, shape and form. He's
going to be enormously successful in life. He's never been anything but a
pleasure to be around. He's never been anything but a phenomenal
representative of La Salle.  
  
I just told him, I remembered I was on vacation in August when he committed to
us, and I remember the moment vividly and it was meaningful to me then and
it's still a very meaningful moment because I just appreciate having the
opportunity to coach him so much.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contribution you got from the inside players,
such as Tony and B.J., because it looks like when you needed offense, getting
the ball inside gave you --  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: Yeah, we did. We got a big one from B.J. late but Tony was
really the mainstay and it's really neat it see Tony play his best basketball
at the end of his career. He's always helped us and he's always done good
things, but you know, he was just terrific today. He's had some terrific games
late in the year.  
  
I'm just really happy for him. He's just another wonderful person and it's too
bad he didn't get the win today because individually he certainly played as
well as anyone in the game and deserved a positive outcome.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_New York, New York_  
  
UVA - 71, North Carolina - 63  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Congratulations to Virginia. Tony and his staff and their
players. I guess it was two years ago we won the regular season and the
conference tournament, and I saw Tony that spring, and he said,
congratulations, that's really, really hard to do. And I think that makes it
two times for him in the last four years, so they should feel really good
because I agree that it really is hard to do in this league.  
  
They're really good. We felt like we had to play really, really well, and I
don't think we did that. We shoot 40 percent. We were supposed to be a great
rebounding team. We only had two more rebounds than they did. But they're 9
for 17 from three. I think Hall and Guy and Jerome and Isaiah, those guys are
really hard to handle. Hunter coming off the bench is really, really good for
them, as well. Guy made a couple of big baskets, and Isaiah made a big drive
to the basket for a dunk.  
  
We got it to 2, Guy made two straight baskets, and we had one easy shot we
missed, and then we had a tough shot that we missed, and then we had a
turnover, and all of a sudden it goes from 2 back to 9 or 10. But not using
any excuses. We played four days in a row. The first day that we played they
were practicing. That's the way the tournament is set up. It's not playing
four days in a row that's hard, it's playing Virginia on the last day, and
they deserved what they got. But my team is getting better. We've got some
bigger goals in front of us, and we'll need to get back to work this week
after giving them some rest.  
  
Joel's ankle has been a little beat up. Cam's body is beat up. His back was
hurt last night, didn't feel very comfortable about playing him as much as I
even played him today, so we'll need a couple of days to rest. Everybody at
this time of year has got small injuries, and some of them are not real small.
I'm not saying that to use that as an excuse because Virginia beat our tails.
That's the bottom line.  
  
If you've got some questions for Joel, I'd like you to ask Joel's questions
first so we can let him get back to the locker room.  
  
Q. Joel, the way they played defense, when they get about a seven or
eight point lead, does it really kind of amp that urgency up because of how
difficult it is to score against them?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, I mean, that's how they build their lead. They get up on
you and then they put pressure on you thinking you have to come down, and
you're thinking you have to get a quick shot to try to get that lead back, and
then next thing you know, you take a bad shot, and then you've got to go back
down and play defense for 30 seconds again, and then now you're like, oh,
dang, we really have to get it going now.  
  
With them and how they play, the slow pace that they have, it does kind of put
pressure on you to think that you have to go down and take a quick shot and
try to get that lead back in one possession, and that's where they take
advantage of teams.  
  
Q. Joel, how do you balance the disappointment of not winning this
championship with the opportunity of winning an even bigger championship
ahead?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, we've just got to go back and we've just got to get
better. The biggest thing is we're blessed to be able to go back and watch the
selection show tomorrow, and then to be able to get back to the Dean Dome and
get better as a team, get a couple of days off or a day off, whatever Coach
gives us. But we're blessed, and we have to see that. So we have to put this
behind us.  
  
We wanted to win this. We came to the tournament to win. We didn't come here
just to say that we wanted to get it out of the way. We wanted to win. But it
didn't go in our favor, so we've just got to go back and get ready for the
NCAA Tournament and realize now this is the time you lose, you go home.  
  
Each play, each second of the game is very important. But like I said, we're
blessed to be able to get another chance to play.  
  
Q. Joel, in terms of the way that the second half went, did you expect
to eventually at some point have a one-possession game where you might be able
to catch them? I mean, the way it was going, it just seemed like you were
right on the cusp.  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, it was just -- we were right there, and it's just like,
they'll come down and they'll hit a big-time shot. I think we got it down to
four points maybe --  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think we got it to two.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: And then the next thing you know they come down and hit a big-
time shot. That's why we work on things in practice like stop, score, stop, so
we can go down, score the ball, then get a stop and come down and score and
then get another stop. So it was like we were right there, it was just we
didn't dig deep enough to try to get that stop so we can either tie it up or
get the lead. Those are the things.  
  
You know, it sounds like we say it over and over again, but it just goes to
show that every play is important. It really is.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You guys have to understand this little nut is playing his butt
off, too, and he does have some bigger dreams.  
  
To answer the question, I think it was 48-46, and I think Guy made two in a
row at that point, but -- I think he was one of them.  
  
Did we have the ball down two? Okay, so we had an opportunity and didn't get
over the hump like the little engine that could. That's what I felt like at
times.  
  
But against Virginia you've got to make plays. You've got to really, really,
really play well, and I don't think that we did that. Really, as I said, I
don't think we got it to that level.  
  
Q. So much attention is placed on their defense, and rightly so, but
they only committed four turnovers today, they made 16 straight free throws,
their first 16, made over 50 percent of their free throws. Do people overlook
how good and efficient offensively they are?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think definitely they do. They just talk about the lower
possessions. I've always said I don't think Tony holds the ball. I think they
wait until they get exactly the shot they want, and that's the way they play.
If it makes you play defense a little longer to play defense, then he's
getting double benefits from it because he's still getting the shot he wants
and he's wearing you down a little bit more.  
  
Even Nigel Johnson, he comes in, he was shooting in conference play like 27
percent from three, and he makes two out of three in the first half, and he
wasn't a great free-throw shooter, but he made his free throws in the first
half.  
  
Kids rise up and play better sometimes, and today we needed them to not play
quite as well, not make all the free throws, not only have one turnover in the
first half. I forget, we were down 10, and we got it back to four at the half,
and I felt like, okay, we're hanging right in there. But you've got to do a
little bit better against Virginia than just hang in there.  
  
Q. I was actually going to ask you if their guards are better than
recent versions perhaps that they've had, but also with Luke, he had 15 points
in the first half and only five in the second half. Did they do anything
different on him in the second half?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think they really focused on making sure they didn't let him
have the open looks. And then second half, I think he only made one three in
the second half. I'm not even sure it was one. But I do think that they
emphasized trying to cover him a little more. They went a little smaller a
lot.  
  
They had Salt, who's really, really good, does some great things for him, but
they guarded Luke with a little bit smaller player that could get out on the
court. Their guards, I thought Malcolm Brogdon was great, and -- yeah,
Perrantes, so that was really a good pair, too.  
  
But both these kids are 6'5" and can shoot the basketball and handle the
basketball.  
  
And in reality, one of the easiest coaching jobs I've ever had in my life was
in 2002, we made it all the way to the Final Four in Atlanta, I started three
point guards, and that's what Virginia plays. If I'm not mistaken Devon Hall
was a point guard in high school, so when you have three point guards out
there, they really make coaching a heck of a lot easier.  
  
But they're really good. They really are. They defend you. They work hard
defensively, too. But they can score.  
  
Q. You heard Joel talk about how even trailing by five against Virginia
the way they play can seem so big. Do you feel that, too? And second, what do
you tell them during time-outs, et cetera, when the game is really only five,
seven points away, but it feels like it's bigger?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I tell them that each possession is worth more in a low-
possession game. I do all that prior to it. During the game, I try to be as
positive as I can be or push them as much as I can. We don't talk that much
about, okay, we're only down five. We don't talk about that. I say we've still
got a chance. We're still in this game. The game is not decided. But we do
talk to them, as Joel said, in the pregame strategy, and when we're talking
about what we're doing, you've got to make every offensive possession be a
good one, all right, because they're going to make you work defensively. If
you go down and slop up a quick shot, now you've got to go back and defend,
and you might have to defend for a long time.  
  
But yeah, we made -- I didn't realize, Kirs just told me that play where Joel
tried to lob it to Theo, that's the only time we had it when we were down two,
but it wasn't a very good play at that point.  
  
Q. Teams have identities and styles that they like to play, obviously,
and games are always about who gets to impose their will on the other team.
Obviously you guys love the break and the secondary break. When you have to
switch your style of play but you can do it, is that difficult for your team
to morph into, we're not breaking now, we're going to play a little bit more
in the half court?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, but I think I've told every team I've ever coached, we can
win in the 50s and 60s, but I like it a lot more when we win when we're in the
80s and 90s. And our really good teams have been able to do both. We've
toughed out a couple of games this year in the much lower scoring games. But
no, I prefer a faster pace, more aggressive, all that kind of cute stuff it
sounds like, but sometimes you have to be able to win when the other team's
pace or style of play is more dominant than yours is.  
  
But you know, when you get to this level, you're going to play really good
teams. I mean, guys, the ACC is really a freaking -- really, whatever you want
to add there, good league. So to go through this and have some success puts us
in position. We think we still have a chance. Kirs can correct me, I may miss
it by one, but my teams have taken me to nine Final Fours. I think we've only
won conference tournaments twice. Is it two or three? Twice? Nine Final Fours,
and we've only been sitting up here happy faced twice. Last year we got our
tails beat, and then we were okay after that. We played pretty well. But this
has been a heck of a league. It's been a heck of a journey, heck of a
challenge, and we wanted to play this game, but we wanted to be the last ones
standing, too.  
  
Q. People talk about Virginia and they talk about how well they play
together and precision and skills. Do you believe that they have a quality
like clutch? Do you believe in a quality like clutch?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I do. Ability helps you be really clutch. Confidence in
your ability, talent helps you be that way.  
  
But I didn't even realize this: Tony said something else to me. He said, we
can beat you in the regular season but we can't beat you in the tournament. I
had forgotten about that because we had beaten them two years ago in The
Finals and maybe the year before that in the tournament, also.  
  
But I really like what he does. I don't mind telling you, today, again, he got
his club to do what he wanted better than I got what I wanted my club to do.  
  
But they're really tough-minded. They're really intelligent. They realize who
they are, and they play to their strengths and stay away from their
weaknesses, and as a coach, you have to admire that. And the other coach being
able to do that, I think he's one of the really best coaches anywhere. I mean,
I really believe that.  
  
We played his team from Washington State in one of the NCAAs, and they played
like this. He's just a very gifted kid who probably got most of his potential
-- I don't remember that much about Tony as a player. I know he's a good
shooter and had a great percentage, but I think he got as much as he could
when he was a player, and I think that's what he's trying to get his kids to
buy into, and they're buying into it.  
  
Q. Apologies for hitting your favorite topic here, but after what you
did against Duke, two out of three wins against them and all of your quadrant
one wins this year, would you like to start the tournament in Charlotte?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, Kirs and Clint and my wife and everybody has been
talking to me about all that stuff the last couple days, and last night is the
first time I asked my question. I don't mind you guys standing over on the
sidelines disagreeing with me, but I think last night is the first time I
said, do you think that will change where we are going, and the answer I got
from all three people, Kirs, Clint and my wife, was yes, they think that'll
put us in Charlotte. So I said, okay, let's win tomorrow, meaning today, and
then I felt like sure that it would do it. You guys think I'm whacko, hell, I
just want to go someplace warm. I've been freezing my butt off up here.  
  
Q. Not that you notice stuff like this, but did you think anything when
Virginia was picked sixth in the league before the season and was unranked in
the top 25?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, guys, I'm going to tell you, there's a lot of things I
don't give a flip about, and that's lower than anything else, okay.  
  
One of the greatest thrills of my life was walking in my gym in Kansas in
1990, and my senior point guard said, Coach, they picked us eighth in the Big
Eight. That's last. And I said, we're going to be all right. He said, no, they
picked us last. I said, son, do you think that gives the other team an
advantage, do we have to give them points or anything? We won 30 that year, so
I can tell you there's a lot of things in my life I worry about, and that damn
preseason poll has never made that list. But they've got to get somebody -- if
they asked the coaches we would vote, too, and we'd probably be just as wrong
as the media is.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Isaiah Wilkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30894)

### [Devon Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30893)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
UVA - 71, North Carolina - 63  
  
TONY BENNETT: There goes our humility. We bring the trophy with us. I'm so
thankful that these guys -- it's a good thing to enjoy a moment like this. If
you can't enjoy that, being with this group of guys and seeing their heart,
and we weren't perfect, but we battled, and the regular season and this means
a lot. But we know that it comes from the hard work of a lot of people around
us. So again, just very thankful just to see some of the plays made.  
  
I think when the big guy missed a shot from North Carolina, I said, well,
maybe this is a sign here. He had a lay-up and missed it, and you need some of
those. But both teams laid it out there, four games in four nights for them,
three for us in a row. So as I said, we're very thankful, and I usually don't
give an opening statement, but I figure after this we can give one.  
  
Q. Kyle, would you speak a little bit to the ball security you had?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, that's something we work on every single day. As soon as I got
on grounds, that's something that Coach preached, and it's always a good
feeling when what is normal for us, we do.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to win the ACC championship and particularly
in the context of the whole season?  
DEVON HALL: I think it's special. I think it speaks to this group and how
tough we are. We've been battling all season, so to be able to grab this, I
think it's a special, special moment for us.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Like Devon said, it's special, but it means a lot because we
do it with guys that we love. This is a family inside of here, so it adds a
little extra to it.  
  
KYLE GUY: What they said pretty much.  
  
Q. Isaiah, Luke may have had 15 in the first half, you guys held him to
five in the second. Was there kind of a focus on him to prevent him from
getting open looks in the second half?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think it was that. I think he hit a couple tough
shots, but I think we just had to clean it up altogether. There were times he
got loose and I lost him and things like that in transition, so we just tried
to clean that up, and it ended up working out for us.  
  
Q. For the players, what did it mean to you guys to have some of your
former players, even NBA guys, back here pulling for you and congratulating
you after the game?  
DEVON HALL: It was great because some of those guys have been in this spot, so
to have those guys here to support us is great, just to see them cheer us on.  
  
KYLE GUY: You know, even someone who didn't play with any of those guys, it's
very clear that it's still a family, and they treat me and other guys that
didn't play with them as such, so it's a good feeling to get a win for people
who started this.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Yeah. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What does this mean for your city? It's been through some tough
times. What does this championship mean to you city?  
TONY BENNETT: It means a lot. On the back of our jerseys, there's a hashtag,
#whostogether. And I think a basketball team embodies unity and diversity in a
way that's special. Not uniformity, unity and diversity. And I think it's the
greatest example. And like they said, there's love here. There's family,
there's issues we've got, but it's a beautiful thing.  
  
It's funny, I quoted a Psalm 133 before the game, and I said -- what it says
is it's a good and precious thing when brothers dwell together in unity. It's
like a fine oil poured upon your head. That's what I said to them before and
that's what I said after because it's unity, and that's what I think sets this
team apart. They're so unified. They're so unselfish. I don't mean to give a
long answer, but I think it's an important answer, and I think it's a blessing
to be a part of this.  
  
Q. Tomorrow there's a lot of thought that you guys are going to be named
the No. 1 overall seed. Have you thought about the path that you guys want to
take?  
TONY BENNETT: What do you mean? Don't they put you where you go? I haven't
really thought about it. I mean, obviously -- I think we want to go to the
John Paul Jones Arena and play there. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Some coaches measure programs by Final Fours or different benchmarks.
What do you use to measure the program in getting it to where you feel good
about?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I mean, again, I'm so thankful for these guys. To win a
regular season ACC, that's the long haul. That's big. This is tough. Of course
to advance, we went to an Elite 8, almost got to a Final Four, but the NCAA
Tournament, you want to do as well as you can in that. Those are the tangible
things everybody judges you on.  
  
But I heard our former fast break coach said, ask me 20 years from now if we
had a successful program and I'll tell you, and it'll be in what's going on
here. This is unique, what I'm seeing, and it's a joy that I haven't quite
experienced as a coach. I've experienced a lot of good things and good people,
but there's a lot of good stuff going both ways.  
  
But we've got to be ready to go when it comes to that. Of course, we want to
be as good as we can, but we know, like every coach said, there's so much
parity in this tournament, you get as healthy as you can, as ready as you can.
And don't over complicate it. Improve, prepare well, play to win. That's what
we have to do when we step up. And whoever it is or wherever it is, I don't
know if we have a choice on that or not.  
  
Q. Isaiah, obviously you hit two big free throws at the end. Talk about
the calmness, if you were feeling calmness at the time, and also, what did you
think of De'Andre's free throws down the stretch?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I was just talking to myself, like I do every time when I
shoot free throws, and it went in, so that was cool. But yeah, I'm happy for
Drey because his wrists are hurting a little bit. So for him to go up there
and make most of those is really special. He's like us, he's a first year, so
that's pretty cool.  
  
Q. It's a question for the players, a couple of you if you could. The
North Carolina players, they sort of describe, even though it's a tight game,
it feels like -- even though it's a two-possession game, it feels like more
when they play against you. What do you guys think about the fact that your
opponents see narrow margins as bigger because they're going against you
guys?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, I think that speaks to our defense and how we stand to get
back and build a wall. That was key for us with this team, especially with
them flying up and down the court. But I think we pretty much thrive on
defensive stops, so that gives us energy and it gives us momentum.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, you know, before the game, Coach writes on the board, backpack
and rebounds, so I like to say put your backpack on and rebound. And when we
do those things not give up transition points, and in the pack and rebound, we
can feel the energy going our way when we are at our best defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you addressed a bit the long haul versus the tournament, the
tournament being crazy and all the parity. I guess my question is it's the
same game you play, whether it's November or March, same sports and rules, but
is there something about play this time of year that kind of changes the
dynamics and changes the way you want your team to play?  
TONY BENNETT: I mean, I think it becomes a possession game. It tightens up. I
think defense is really important. Maturity is important. Just being sound --
I look at this stat, and I don't know how accurate this is, but they had three
points off turnovers, 12 second chance points but two fast break points. Those
are some keys, and we always talk about that.  
  
But yeah, you've got to take care of the ball. You've got to rebound well, and
I think to advance in the tournament, and of course you've got to not allow
people to score, and then guys have to make plays and play with the
intangibles, and this team is all about the intangibles. I've been fortunate
enough to -- they showed it and they did it over the long haul in the
conference, and then of course it gets tested in this, and it gets tested the
next time-out.  
  
Q. Devon, after ACC regular season and tournament championship and the
school record for wins in a season, what do you do, if anything, to kind of
refocus for the NCAA Tournament?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, I think we still have to room to improve. We'll go back
and find out what mistakes we made during this tournament and then grow from
it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're not about individual accolades, but I wanted to
let you know and get your reflection on it. There are only 12 head coaches who
have won more than one of these, so you're on a list with Mike Krzyzewski, Roy
Williams, Dean Smith, Jim Valvano, et cetera. What do you think about as the
son of your coach yourself when you see your name on a list like that?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, to me the celebration and the joy comes in that 40 minutes
or whatever it is of play, and then honestly stepping back -- and watching
them enjoy the celebration. That's the joy. Those things, it's an honor, and
I'm thankful because I've had good players. It's good, but I just -- I love
the game, and I know those things -- they fade. Again, 20 years ask me what
kind of relationship we have, what they're doing. That's the stuff that'll
last. I know that.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Roy Williams mentioned in the press conference before,
he's been to nine Final Fours, only, I think, won two of these conference
championships. What do you feel like winning or not winning a conference
championship does for a team heading into the bigger tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: You want to play your best basketball at the end of the year. As
I said, I think they're both significant, a regular season and this. Where I
grew up, that's just kind of how it was, that long haul. But I think you want
to play high level basketball as you head into the end of the year, and you
have to do that to be successful here. And again, we'll get our rest and
hopefully be ready to go at the highest level that we can play at.  
  
Q. You have no one-and-dones on this team. That's not to say you don't
have talented players, but do you see yourself as a team that really needs to
max out, that needs to be especially disciplined, that really has to sort of
maximize the finer points and be almost perfect?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: You know, I think that we know who we are. I think that's
something that we have to do, so we don't have a really big room for -- a
really big margin for error. Like you said, we don't have any one-and-done
guys or anything like that. As older guys, you develop over the years from
going to playing, like five minutes my first year to now, and you grow. I've
grown with Devon over time like that, so I think that's our way. It's not
going to be questioned or changed, unless you've got any plans, Coach.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, our one-and-done, I've joked about this is a shot goes up
and get a defensive rebound. But I think that's a great answer. I think every
team has to max out, but our way is that, and to see their improvement, I
think that was a key in this year. Every guy was challenged to -- of course
every coach wants them to get stronger in the weight room and go to work on
their game, and each guy really went to work on their skill development and
their physical improvement, and they all improved, and I think that total
improvement lifted this thing up. So they're serious, and they go after it in
the off-season.  
  
Q. You mentioned the intangibles being a big part of your team. What are
some of the tangible things that this year's team does better than a lot of
your good teams?  
TONY BENNETT: When you have guys -- our leaders, I'll start with Devon and
Isaiah and Jack, who I say they're almost like they started out as entry level
at a company, and now they've advanced up to executive level. They're so clear
in how they have to play. They're so sound. They hold guys accountable, and
they just -- they're our backbone defensively, and that matters a lot. And
Devon will do it, too. Jack is nicer than those guys. But those guys knowing
the way, that's huge. Coach-led teams can be good, player-led teams have a
chance to be really good, and that's what we have here.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Gabe DeVoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34257)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
UVA - 64, Clemson - 58  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, congratulations to Virginia. I thought they did the
things they needed to do to win. Extremely proud of our guys. I thought we
competed at a really high level today. I thought defensively we really matched
them in terms of being able to make things difficult. Credit some of their
under-the-radar guys like Jack Salt, who made some big plays late in some shot
clocks, a couple tip-ins, short shots, and then obviously the stretch in the
first half where we had trouble scoring was really the difference. Eli got the
second foul and went to the bench and we didn't play as well with him not in
there today.  
  
Great basketball game, extremely competitive, hard-fought by both teams.  
  
Questions?  
  
Q. Brad, was it just the fact that Eli wasn't in, or was there something
that you saw in that nine and a half-minute stretch that you either didn't
like or something that you weren't seeing?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, I think it was a combination. I think Eli not being in
was a major factor because we have to be able to do some other things to throw
the ball to the block because of the way they play. You know, they really
bottled up a lot of our ball screen stuff. They're just so big, long,
athletic, and there's a lot of them, so they keep rotating guys. A lot of
credit goes to them for how hard they play and how well they play, but we
certainly needed to do a few things a little bit better with spacing and ball
movement. But that stretch where we didn't have Eli certainly made a
difference.  
  
Q. It seems like in every postgame press conference involving Virginia,
a coach is asked a question about some long stretch in which the team didn't
score. What makes it so difficult, especially late in halves, to score on
Virginia?  
BRAD BROWNELL: They have good players. They have a very good system. Extremely
well-coached. They're extremely big, long and athletic. I don't think people
realize -- like they're bigger than we are at almost every position. Every
position you look at their guys and look at our guys, a couple inches
difference, five to ten pounds, strength. And that's true of a lot of teams
that they play against. Not all but a lot.  
  
You combine all those factors, they're going to be difficult to play against.
It's Tony's hallmark. It's what they do, and obviously if you don't do that,
you don't play. You know, certainly a lot of credit for the way they do
things.  
  
Q. Gabe, for you, what was it like playing out there on the perimeter
trying to get in the post against that defense? What makes them different?  
GABE DEVOE: They just limit a lot of the -- they just make you take tough
shots, limit the easy ones. They do a good job on ball screens, and they're
always in good positions. Just make you make tough shots. I had a couple good
looks, and they weren't able to go in today.  
  
Q. Gabe, for all the talk about the Virginia defense, on the glass, do
you find it hard to rebound against Virginia for any particular reason? You
talked about the athleticism, but do they do something style-wise that makes
it hard, especially on the defensive glad, their offensive?  
GABE DEVOE: Yeah, I think their big guys do a great job being active. They tip
out a lot of offensive rebounds. I think that's one of their pet things. So
just keeping a body on them because they're great at tipping them out.  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Philosophically I think because of their screening action, your
post players are involved in guarding the screens, and so sometimes you're
guarding a screen shot by Kyle Guy, and the post player is helping to contest
the shot. Obviously you can't contest the shot and block out your man at the
same time, so now guards are rotating out to block out big guys. That's a big
part of why they rebound, I think.  
  
Q. Coach, when you faced them in the regular season, I know you guys
were getting used to life without Grantham in the lineup. Now looking at this
game, how do you feel like you guys have changed and matured and grown, and
also how do you feel like this Virginia team has improved headed to the
postseason?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Our team has changed a lot because of this guy next to me. He's
been tremendous the last six weeks of the season. Not only elevated his play
to just about all-conference level, but also just leadership, confidence,
swagger, the way he's gotten our other guys to believe and rally. It's hard.
It's been hard. He's got his buddy, the guy he came in with, we're rolling. I
don't know, 17-2, 16-3, whatever we were, playing great, and you lose your
guy, your running mate, that's hard on you personally, and for you to rally
like that for your team and to also elevate your game just speaks to the
quality of person and player that he is. I mean, he's really had a lot on his
shoulders. We don't have a lot of other seniors. We have a graduate transfer
who hasn't been in our program a long time, and we have some juniors, but
there's been a lot on Gabe, and Gabe has done an unbelievable job. Because of
that, I think he's helped will our team -- I've tried to help will our team
that we can be good, and we have been pretty good here the last six weeks. But
it's a lot because of Gabe.  
  
Just because of Virginia, I just think that they do what they do, and they
just keep doing it better, and they don't ever back off. They play like this
every day. You go 17-1 it's because you don't have many bad days, effort and
execution. You might have a couple days where you don't shoot it well, but for
40 minutes you fight and they wear people down, and their guys like Hunter
have gotten better, Diakite has gotten better. That's how I view them as being
a little different.  
  
Q. You had been asked earlier about why they're difficult to play
against. Is there anything -- when they have the kind of stretch that they had
end of the first half when they kind of locked you guys down, was there
anything you could do schematically to free you guys up for shot or is it
something your guys have to fight through?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, I'm sure schematically I could do a better job in a
couple areas to create some things for our guys. I do think you need some
inside presence, and we really don't have that as much without Eli, so I do
think that was a factor. But I'm sure in terms of just screening and all that,
I don't know that -- they just guard a lot of things really well. I think you
have to make some individual plays. You've got to play in space a little bit
better. I don't think we -- we didn't do exactly what we probably wanted. I
would have liked to have had another day or two to really kind of work on it a
little bit more, but again, a lot of credit just goes to Virginia and how they
just guard you. They just make it really hard. By the way, our defense wasn't
too bad either tonight, just FYI. We're not too bad defensively. I hope Tony
said something nice about our defense. Good, okay.  
  
Q. Brad, as far as Elijah Thomas goes, how much was that second half
surge by design, getting him kind of involved in that second half, and Gabe,
what did you learn about your team's toughness and what can prepare you for
next week?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, obviously we were trying to get the ball to Eli in the
second half, you know, just to see how they were going to react, if they were
going to double. We had one bad play where they got us on a trap and thought
Eli was going to be able to get it out and we were going to get an open three
on the other side, he just didn't make a good pass. But beyond that, he was
great in the second half. I mean, he was the guy that got us going, and then
it kind of loosened a few things up for these guys. It just gave us a little
bit of confidence knowing that he could make a couple buckets. We obviously
played reasonably well in the second half offensively. We had 35 points. I
know we didn't shoot a great percentage, but we got to the free-throw line
because we were playing inside out.  
  
Q. It's been a while since Clemson was in the NCAA Tournament, so this
is for both Gabe and Coach. How excited are you guys for Sunday, and how
confident are you guys going into next week?  
GABE DEVOE: I mean, I'm super excited. This is my first time having this
opportunity to go to the tournament, and it's huge for me. The locker room,
the guys are really excited, and I think we're going to have a lot of
confidence going forward into the tournament, as well.  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, we're obviously extremely excited about this opportunity.
We've worked really hard, not just this season but as a program to put
ourselves in a better position to be able to do it more often. It's hard in
this league. You talk to a lot of us that aren't at some of the blue blood
schools, and it's a battle every time to do this, so we certainly feel
thankful and blessed that it's going to happen. But we know how hard we've
worked this year and really the last couple years to kind of make this a
reality. I'm as happy as I can be for guys like Gabe. I'm disappointed for
Donte because it was something that we kind of set out to do this year. It was
kind of our mission. And I do feel confident with our team. I think we're
playing pretty good basketball. I thought we got better this weekend.

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

### [Luke Maye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33294)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 74, Duke - 69  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I have nothing to say about the last five minutes. Coach
Robinson coached that part of the game. You guys be sure and tell Coach Rob I
said that. It was unbelievable. I thought from a big stretch in the second
half, we were really, really good. We were making shots. We were defending.
And then all of a sudden the five-minute mark, we have five turnovers. Thank
goodness when we missed a bunch of shots, we also got the rebound. Theo goes
to the line and makes two free throws to salt it away. Kenny took a big time
charge for us.  
  
But you've got to congratulate Duke, but gracious sakes, they made a bunch of
shots. They beat us over there seven days ago, I thought we were timid or
tight or scared, remember I told you that, you guys get to choose. I didn't
necessarily think we were that today, we were just sloppy. We threw one look
away pass and turned it over. We turned it over and Kenny is running down
there to get the ball in the back court and I'm screaming no, no, no, because
I knew that they threw the ball, it was going to be a backcourt violation, and
he slips and falls and it's their ball back out of bounds. It was some of the
weirdest stuff I've ever seen.  
  
But the bottom line is we made enough plays and we're still playing, so I'm
happy. And if you guys will direct your questions towards the players first so
we can let them get out of here, that would be good.  
  
Q. Theo, could you describe what that last six minutes was like? What's
going through your head, and how are you handling that?  
THEO PINSON: I know personally, it's just another thing I can say that I've
been through. I mean, me and J.B. been through literally every single
situation you can go through. I mean, going down the sideline, I got the ball
in my hands, and I feel it slip out of my hands. I'm just like, oh, my God,
you've got to make up for this one.  
  
But I just like how we fought back. At the same time, you've just got to keep
playing. You can't just stop. The game is still going on. You just want to
make plays. We got some big time offensive rebounds. That's part of the game,
also. We extended a couple drives in the time window -- extended possessions.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, I think towards the end we were just trying not to make
mistake and we ended up making mistakes instead of just continuing to be
aggressive. Coach always wants us to make the smart play, but at that time we
just stopped being aggressive and they were the ones that were being
aggressive. Situations like that, we've just got to keep playing and just
remember that we can't stop being aggressive. And at that time that's what we
did and that's why we made the game so close.  
  
Q. Theo, completely opposite game for you as far as overall from the
last game, but how did it feel to have the game in your hands at that point to
sort of end it well for you?  
THEO PINSON: Yeah, I mean, I made a big time turnover that I needed to make up
for, and I'm going to be honest, I was like, you're making these two free
throws, like you just almost blew the game for your team so you have to make
them. I went up to the line, Coach was like, be big time, make the shot, and I
stepped up to it and knocked them in.  
  
Q. Talk about playing against Virginia. The last time you guys played
them it was a tough game. What do you have to do tomorrow to win the game?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, we've just got to make sure we're taking good shots and
making sure we're moving them on the defensive end. They're great defensively,
and we've just got to make sure we limit our mistakes. If you make a turnover,
you know that you're going down and you're about to play defense for 30
seconds because they keep moving the ball until they get what they want to
get, so we have to limit our turnovers and make sure that we're getting great
shots on the offensive end.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I think also defensively we really stepped up these past couple
games and played a lot better, and I think that's important for us to
continue, especially against their team. They're very good defensively, as
well.  
  
Q. You guys played three games in a five-day stretch earlier in the
season and won them all. You played three in a three game stretch now. Are you
guys tired at all?  
THEO PINSON: No, I feel great.  
  
LUKE MAYE: We've got some of the best people on our staff to really help us
out. They do so much for us behind the scenes, and we're really lucky to have
them with us.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Luke is talking about they stayed here last night and they got
in the hot and the cold tub, they do all those things to try to restore their
legs. Jonas Sahratian, our trainer, and Doug Halverson, I mean Jonas is our
strength and distance coach and Doug Halverson, our trainer, really do a great
job. They don't get the credit, but behind the scenes they do a great deal
with all of these guys. They saw Joel last thing before he went to bed last
night, saw him first thing when he got up this morning, and those guys really
do try to make sure that they're as refreshed as they possibly can be, and
then other than that, it's all in your mind, and I hope it's not in our mind.  
  
Q. Theo, what's been key to this team's success against the 2-3 zone?
Did seeing Syracuse earlier this week help prepare for this game?  
THEO PINSON: Just playing against 2-3 zones. I mean, we went through it, went
through it couple games going against Syracuse and Duke. We already got passes
on this team, like I said before, we look for each other and very unselfish
and that's one thing we don't have to worry about. We're willing to move and
cut when you know guys are looking for you, so I think that's the biggest
thing for us.  
  
Q. Guys, Duke shot 41 percent, third straight game in this tournament
that you've played very good defense. You talked about needing to flip that
switch. Do you feel after three games that switch has been flipped
defensively?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think so. I think we can still get better on the defensive
end, but that's the one thing that's just been killing us. Like I always say,
we can score the ball. We have people that can score. But it's just about can
you stop other people from scoring, and when we're playing defense and we're
out there just running around and being active and competing, you know, it's
hard to stop us. That's why each and every time whenever I get a chance, I
just let them know we've got to get stops, we've got to get stops, because
that's what it's all about.  
  
Like I said, when we're playing defense and we're competing, we know we can
get the ball and go down and score. So it plays into our hands, so we've just
got to continue that.  
  
Q. After Grayson Allen's flagrant foul, what were you discussing out
there on center court?  
JOEL BERRY II: Oh, yeah, I told them, they're always going to get on him about
that. Any little trip he does, if he puts a finger on somebody, you know
they're going to react. So it's always a joking thing with me and Grayson. I
don't have any hatred towards him. We're good friends. We're both from
Florida, and we played with each other. But I just told him that you've just
got to watch yourself because anything you do like that you know they're going
to get on you about. That's why we laughed it off.  
  
THEO PINSON: All of us are good friends. Me and Joel played with him on the
same team in the summer. There was nothing -- we're cool with him. Just after
the game we told him good game and stuff like that.  
  
Q. How big was the contribution that Garrison Brooks gave you tonight,
and was it just a matchup thing you needed to get a big in there against their
bigs?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, a little bit of both. Theo got the two fouls, so I was
trying to be very cautious with him in the first half and hopefully didn't get
his third. And then when he got his third I put Garrison back in. But I
thought their bench had outscored our bench dramatically in the first two
games, and so we did challenge our guys. And I think with Garrison getting 10
and Sterling getting 6, that was big for us. So part of it was Theo's fouls,
part of it was trying to get some other guys involved, and part of it was the
match-ups. We had Theo guarding Marvin for quite a while. We had tried to
guard him with Cam for a while. So it was a little bit of both.  
  
But the most impressive thing to me, and I just looked down now and I
remembered that Steve Kirschner said, guys we had 28 field goals and we had 24
assists. That's pretty doggone impressive there, too.  
  
Q. Before the first Duke game, I asked you if I had switched identities
with Duke this season. I'm wondering if you're going to pull off this --
complete the analogy here by winning this tournament four games in four days
and by beating them.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, it is strange. I'm not as comfortable with this
change in personalities, I can tell you that. But for us we need to be North
Carolina. We're a good shooting team, and we haven't shot the ball very well
yet. We're a good attacking team, and we haven't attacked very well yet. The
thing that we've done better here for these three games is we've been very
unselfish, and we've guarded a little bit better, which I've always want to do
that, but we need to shoot the ball better.  
  
The turnovers, the sloppiness that we have at times can really kill you
against Virginia because they're so efficient on the offensive end of the
floor. If you don't continue scoring yourself, it's really, really difficult.  
  
So we've got to understand that, and I'd like to -- for one more day, one more
day, yes, I'd like to change personalities. I'd like to be able to do what
Duke did last year.  
  
Q. Those last 20 seconds, have you ever been involved in such a back and
forth, down to the wire like that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I don't think so. You know, I'd have to -- I've coached a lot of
games. I've been over there for a thousand, 1,100, 1,200, however dadgum many
it is. But I don't remember seeing anything like that. But yet last year in
the Final Four we missed four straight free throws and got the offensive
rebound.  
  
I'm up there and Kennedy Meeks says, oh, yeah, I've seen that. I said, I've
seen a million games and I've never seen anything like that. Luke loses a
dribble on the baseline. Theo drops the ball out of bounds. Kenny is coming to
pick up a loose ball in the backcourt one time, I'm screaming no, no, no,
because their guy clearly threw it backcourt and he falls and knocks the ball
out of bounds. You can't make that crap up. It's just something that happens.
So no, I've never seen anything like that.  
  
Q. Talk about your bench tonight, you guys outscored them 16-0. Is it
better from last night when you guys had to put them in early?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, and we said something to the guys before because the last
couple of games -- well, the last two games their bench has completely out-
manned ours, points, rebounds, everything, so we wanted our guys to give us a
good lift. I thought Garrison was really good. Sterling was -- what was is it,
six. I thought he gave us some moments. He's around that basket. I get on him
all the time about going up strong with it because I thought he's too soft.
His first two attempts were blocked. And I forget which time at it, might have
been after the flagrant foul or something. I think that's when it was. I
grabbed him by his shirt as hard as I've ever grabbed any player. I think I've
only grabbed three players in 30 years, but I grabbed him by by his shirt and
was screaming at him because I'm talking to my players about what we're going
to do. And I'm really good at math, and I counted one, two, three, four. My
big fella is standing over there -- my man was checking the crowd out. Now,
he's in the game. So I grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him over there. So
if anybody sees that I assaulted somebody I'm asking for forgiveness before
you guys accuse me of doing it. But then Theo said that I could grab him, and
I told him, I said, I've wanted to grab you a lot, too, but I've never done
it. But the bench was big for us, yes.  
  
Q. You mentioned the UVA game, turned it over 19 times, shot 30 percent
from the field roughly. Do you say that was two months ago, your lineup is
different, you've gotten better, or are there things you can take away from
what happened on January 6th?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'll say that we've got to play a heck of a lot better. Guys,
they're the No. 1 team in the country. They are the No. 1 team unanimously,
and they beat us by 77 points or whatever it was. So we've got to go in there
and try to play the perfect game. If we try to play the perfect game and play
as close as we can possibly play to that, then we'll have a chance to win.
There's nobody that has more respect and admiration for the way another coach
coaches than what I feel for Tony Bennett. I'm serious. I really enjoyed his
dad, liked his dad, liked watching his teams. We had some golf conversations.
And I think Tony has just been a marvelous job.  
  
You realize they weren't even picked in the top 25? What he's done this year
is the kind of year for a coach that you dream about. So I'm going to say
those things because they're well-deserved, but we have to play better. We
really have to play a lot better, and if we play a lot better, then we'll have
a chance.  
  
I think we have improved in some areas. I think the personnel is a little
different, the way we play. For us, a lot of things have to go right in order
to beat Virginia. It's 20.9 seconds average time of possession on the
defensive end of the floor for them. So we've got to be tough enough to bend
our knees and stay in a defensive stance long enough to get good shots from
all over, and again, we'll have a chance.

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

### [Jack Salt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33162)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
UVA - 64, Clemson - 58  
  
Q. Jack, the fans were chanting "Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack Salt," and they
gave you a standing ovation when you left the game. How did that feel and did
you even know that was occurring?  
JACK SALT: I didn't know. They were probably just surprised I was scoring so
much. It was a good game. Ground it out. It was a bit ugly at the end, but it
was good to get it.  
  
Q. For the players, there was a play toward the end where Clemson
pressed and, Ty, you ended up getting a three at the end of that. I was
wondering if you could take me through, you traversed the floor quite a bit
before you got the shot. Take me through that play?  
TY JEROME: I didn't hit any threes today.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Was it a two?  
  
TY JEROME: Okay. I guess we just broke the press and let the clock run down,
and I just -- you know, the floor was spread, and I made a play down to the
shot clock.  
  
Q. Tony, Clemson kind of had its way in its first 10 minutes and then
you held them without a field goal for the final 9:27. What changed and what
adjustments did you make?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, they were aggressive. They're a good team, and I think
Brad has done a terrific job without Grantham. And the first time we played
them was the very first game they were without Grantham, and I think now
they're comfortable in their roles, and their roles are very aggressive off
the dribble. They spread the floor and attacked us. We were on the edge with
our transition D and Thomas did a heck of a job on the interior. They were the
aggressors. We were kind of a little on our heels, not for a lack of effort,
but then I thought the guys really buckled down. I thought Jack gave us some
good stops, Ty, and I think our team defense picked up. And they're not going
to make every shot, so we bothered some shots, and then some of our shots
started falling.  
  
Q. There was a pretty cool moment in the game in the first half, you
guys were playing great defense, the shot clock was winding down, and the
crowd got loudest when you all were playing defense. Can you talk about how
great it is for your fans to just really enjoy defense and enjoy the way you
guys play?  
TONY BENNETT: You've never been to a game at the John Paul Jones arena, I can
tell, so we'll have to get you a ticket so you can come. They like it when we
get stops. That's what we try to do. And that's what our great crowd -- they
appreciate these guys laying it on the line.  
  
Whenever you play, well, most teams, but Clemson, this was a blue collar game
where you're gust gonna have to fight for everything, and both teams try to
really play hard-nosed defense. But I think our fans have appreciated how hard
these guys play and know that that's been our way.  
  
Q. Jack, Elijah Thomas had a really solid day but seemed like he was
able to get some shots up over some pretty solid defense. How do you overcome
that during the game and what were you seeing offensively that you really
liked in that stretch in the second half?  
JACK SALT: He's a great post player. He's got some really good moves. I was
trying to meet him two deep in the post and he just made really good moves and
scored on me quite a bit.  
  
But on the offensive end I just -- the opportunities were there, and I just
converted on it and got a few shots up.  
  
Q. Tony, obviously a big play in the second half was the flagrant foul.
What did you see there, and just talk about the impact it had.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I didn't. I was trying to ask our SID Eric, I said, did
you see anything? And they didn't show a replay. But Roger Ayers, who I trust,
he said, you're not going to like it, you'll see on the replay, but his elbow
went, hit him -- I don't know where he hit him, but we'll have to learn and
grow from it. Mamadi is pretty gangly and sometimes his elbows get up there.
It wasn't intentional. But those are important plays, but I liked how we
responded. I think, if I'm not mistaken, is that where Jack scored right after
that, and then we got a couple stops, Ty made that big long two you're talking
about. Those are the plays that you have to make against a hard-fought -- in a
hard-fought game.  
  
Q. Ty, Clemson got within four early in the second half and you scored,
you guys scored 10 in a row. What do you recall about that run that kind of
gave you some separation there?  
TY JEROME: Early in the second half you said? I think basketball is a game of
runs, and at this point of the year everyone is playing their best basketball
or everyone is amped up, so I think everyone is going to make runs, especially
a team like Clemson, a really good team, they don't give up. So we just stayed
poised. I guess Mamadi must have given us a huge lift. He did today and
yesterday, so he's been huge for us. It's just our job to stay poised.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to make the ACC Championship Game, and what
would it mean to win the ACC title if you do tomorrow?  
TY JEROME: It's a big step in the right direction, and we're just going to
rest up and get ready to play a good team, whoever it is, tomorrow.  
  
JACK SALT: Yeah, just excited to have a good game tomorrow against UNC or
Duke.  
  
Q. You talked about playing UNC or Duke tomorrow, two of the blue
bloods. Do you look forward to facing one of those teams just for the fact of
their stature and their history?  
JACK SALT: For sure those are two great programs, and any time we have a
chance to go against them it's a great opportunity, so we're very excited for
the game tomorrow.  
  
TY JEROME: I think at this time of the year and at this stage, everyone is
really good, so if it's Duke, UNC, Clemson, whoever it is, it's going to be a
good game.  
  
Q. Marcquise Reed, all-ACC, scores almost 20 points a game against
everybody else in this league. He's had six against you both games, 2 for 14
today. Is that just UVA defense, or is that a game plan for the leading scorer
or the other team?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, we just talk about making all of their players earn, and
if they're making contested, tough shots like Thomas did some today, we take
our hat off and we live with it.  
  
I thought Jack -- sometimes we didn't trap. He played good one-on-one defense,
Thomas scored, we live with it. Same thing with those guys. I think we made
them shoot mostly contested shots, and that's all you can do. Sometimes you
can run guys at and double, but we had different guys guarding him, but most
of his shots were contested, and I think he had to earn his looks, and that
was the difference.  
  
Q. Tony, can you talk about Mamadi's stretch there, and if he continues
to play like he has the last few games, what can he do for you now in the
postseason?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, well, any time when we got interior scoring, Jack gave us,
and Mamadi, both today, Mamadi as Ty said, yesterday and today, just you can
throw it inside and he's so quick off the floor and he can manufacture some
interior scoring, then it loosens it up for our perimeter guys. He's quick
defensively, so he's coming in the right direction. He's still kind of new to
the game, and every experience he gets is valuable. But for sure interior
scoring, inside out balancing it is big. And I'm so happy to see both of those
guys step up in a real tough, hard-fought game.  
  
Q. Jack, you had the game high in rebounds today with eight, and just
want to know, were Clemson's bigs ready for your post presence and presence on
the boards because it didn't seem like a lot of those tip drill kind of
rebounds happened today the way they happened against Louisville?  
JACK SALT: They were pretty hard on the boards. They were boxing us out some
when we were crashing. So no, I think we were just playing us tough down there
and we had to fight to get a few of our rebounds. And I thought the guys --
the bigs and the guards did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had more than 30 games to evaluate this team. How does
that athleticism compare to groups you've had in the past, and why do you feel
your brand of basketball fits this roster so well?  
TONY BENNETT: I'm not sure. I look keeping looking to your left, my right, and
I see No. 12, Joe Harris up there, who I'm so thankful that we had him. I've
been blessed to have such good players.  
  
More specific to answer your question, this is a complete group. Their unity
is as good as any as I've ever coached, and those other teams had very good
unity. I think there's some balance. We have good size, and they're relentless
the way they play, and that's the way we have to play to be good.  
  
They probably could play a lot of ways, but I think this way fits this group
of guys, and they have bought in and embraced it in a way that I'm thankful to
have, and they've been a joy to coach.  
  
Q. Talk about Reed; what did you guys do to contain him tonight because
normally he's a good player outside the perimeter.  
TONY BENNETT: I think we just made him earn his looks and contested his shots,
just because those guys can get going, we know that, and I thought he was
challenged most of the time, and he probably missed a couple open ones, but it
was players like that, they have to earn their looks.  
  
Q. Tony, I'm asking the question here not with a cynical tone but with a
questioning tone; you've got the best defense in the country, you're going to
be able to be in every game. How would you describe your confidence level with
the team's ability to score against maybe teams that are going to look more
athletic?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, I think you maybe misspoke there because you don't ever
assume defensively that you just got it and you're going to show up. We
weren't quite right to start the game and they had their way, so you have to
-- they have to be so right defensively, and that's where you start.  
  
I think we showed some interior scoring. We've showed Ty can make some plays.
So I think that balance is important, and these guys play the right way, so I
think they're a balanced, efficient team.  
  
But Clemson is a good defensive team, and that was just one of those games
where you're going to kind of be going at it.  
  
Q. Tony and Ty, Jack is a young man of very few words. Could you two
guys talk about what he did tonight and what he gives you each night?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, I think that chant you started, you missed one of the
Jacks. I think you said Jack seven times not six times, the Jack Salt chant.
But Jack and Isaiah, but I'll talk about Jack, they embody everything that our
program -- we're here because of guys like that who are servants, who screen,
run the floor, rebound, and do whatever you ask. And he's unbelievable. And he
was named a captain this year as a third year, which we usually don't do
eligibility-wise. So he's just all heart, and he'll do whatever you ask.
That's the way he was raised. And that's how it is probably in New Zealand,
right, you just fight and you don't back down, and I was fortunate enough to
live there to see that, but I think we have a team full of guys like that. But
again, that's what I'd say.  
  
TY JEROME: I don't know what I'm going to say after that.  
  
JACK SALT: You don't have to say anything.  
  
TY JEROME: He's not really a man of few words, though. He might be shy up
here, but he's not really a man of few words.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Gary Trent](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34933)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 74, Duke - 69  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it was a really physical game, and congratulations to
North Carolina. You know, we've had three really good games against one
another in a short period of time. Kind of a disjointed game. It was kind of a
weird game tonight.  
  
But the turnovers hurt us, and their offensive rebounds. We're not going to
win a game against a team that caliber if we turned it over 18 times.  
  
We learned a lot here. We played two really good games, two really good teams,
and we know we can play better. I'm proud of my guys. I thought in the last
six minutes they showed an incredible will to win against a very, very good
basketball team. We had a chance. We had a chance, but we've got to do that a
little bit earlier.  
  
Q. Grayson, can you just walk us through the flagrant foul from your
perspective and what happened there?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, they got a fast break and I bumped him and fouled him.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I was surprised there was stoppage. But we'll go with the
call and move forward.  
  
Q. Grayson, just knowing that you guys had a chance to come back and
claw back at the end, does it hurt that much more? I can sort of see it in
your face a little bit.  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, I mean, we were right there, and when you fight back to
bring it that close, you often think back to why you got down in the first
place. So for us, we can't get to that position. We just can't let it happen.
That's something we need to learn from moving forward is you've got to fight,
fight, and you can't get down, because when you play against good teams, it
doesn't always work in your favor when you try to come back.  
  
Q. Grayson, could you take us through the last play, what was called and
what you saw out there on the last shot?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: With the three? So we had a chance to draw something out. I had
a ball screen from the big on both sides and was trying to get a three off to
tie it up. Initially went for the pump fake to try to get him in the air, but
he didn't commit to come foul me, so then tried to get up a shot up towards
the rim, make it, or hopefully one of the big guys would get a rebound.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: They switched.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, so...  
  
Q. Grayson, when Joel Berry and Theo Pinson were in here, Joel was asked
about the flagrant foul and he and Theo both had nice things to say about you,
that you guys go way back. You've gone head to head with Joel for four years
now. What makes him such a tough competitor to play against?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, he is tough, and he's been that way ever since I've known
him. First time I played against him was in eighth grade. I don't even know if
he remembers me, but we were at a camp, and he was big, strong and tough back
then, and he's just a real tough player. If you go at him, he comes right
back. He's the type of guy where if he makes a mistake on the next play, he's
coming at you to get it right back. Just a very good competitor, and a tough
guy to have to play against for the last four years.  
  
Q. Talk about the slow start from the start of the game. Were you guys
nervous, too amped up before you got everything rolling at the end of the
first half?  
GARY TRENT JR: We just came out, we tried to be aggressive. We tried to be
strong early. We came out a little bit flat. I felt like as we continued to
go, we got more comfortable with the game. It started coming more natural to
us, and we just kept fighting and kept trying to compete.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, we were a little bit just too fast at the start.
Defensively me and Trey up top needed to do a little bit better job of trying
to keep it out the middle, and then offensively just working the ball,
relaxing, and relaxing a little bit and just playing, just playing basketball.
Once we settled in, that's when we came back in the first half and got the
lead, or narrowed down the lead a little bit.  
  
Q. Grayson, in the locker room Garrison did say that he thinks you're a
great player but he thought that the hip check was not accidental, so I think
you should have the opportunity to respond. Was it?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, any foul in a game is not -- you don't want any
foul in a game. So that was another foul in a game. Do you think that that was
the only time someone was hipped in the game? If he look in the low post,
that's going on all the time, so it happened at half court, they got it, it's
done, and that didn't win or lose the game.  
  
Q. What gave you trouble on your zone defense tonight?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, they scored 74 points.  
  
Q. Was it specifically what they were doing?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah -- no. You're going to -- 74 points is okay against
them. If we don't turn it over 18 times -- we're not going to -- you're trying
to limit their threes. If we were playing man and they shot 18 out of 24 from
three, then you'd be asking why didn't you defend the three better. But
holding them to 74 points was good. They're one of the explosive teams, as
explosive as anybody. And they have two kids that can really handle the ball
well in the middle of the zone in Pinson and Maye. So that's good for us.  
  
The two games we played here, Colson can do that, too, so we got a chance to
work our zone against probably two of the best teams that would work against
us, and we gave up 70 and 74 points. So we'll take a look at it and see what
we can learn from that, but overall that should have been good enough to win
if we don't turn it over like we did.  
  
One of the key things is these long rebounds. So they got 18, I think. Yeah,
they had 18. That's the other stat that hurt us. Again, they've got to do that
better. But overall, it wasn't bad. The zone wasn't bad. The offense was bad.
It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.  
  
Q. As a whole from this tournament, what did you learn most about your
team that you're going to try to pull forward?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I just think the experience, one, playing against a
desperate, old, really good team in Notre Dame, and being we were really ready
for the tournament, and I thought we played really well last night. Even to
play the second game where you have just a 20-minute warmup, those kids
haven't -- Grayson has gone through it, but I'm not blaming it on them, I'm
just saying it's different, and that's what can happen in the NCAA Tournament.
You can play the first game or the second game. You'll get about 30 minutes
then. And then you're playing at 9:30 or 9:45 or whatever, it's different. So
you learn from those experiences. That's the whole year for us is there's so
many new things for these guys, and playing against two top-quality opponents.
Winning and then -- I thought we got off to a bad start, not that we weren't
ready. I thought that we weren't physical enough.  
  
Kind of like in the first half against Notre Dame where you -- the game is
physical. I'm not saying they're fouls. It's physical inside. So you have to
do more than try to get your shot off because you're going to -- there's
bumping in that, not necessarily fouls but there's bumping, and so you have to
-- yesterday in the second half, we did a great job of that. And today at the
start of the game, we did not, and then ^ Treton got hurt, there were
disruptions. It was kind of a weird thing.  
  
And then we kind of played the game in different stages today, and we have to
play it at the same stage throughout. It's just maturing. It's our 33rd game,
and these kids have won 26, and they've been really good, and they have a will
to win. They just hopefully will get a few good days of practice, hopefully
Trey is not -- the X-rays are negative, we got that done right away, and we
can get healthy and then move on.  
  
Everyone is 0-0 starting next week, so that's the way we're looking at it. I
think we're much better prepared for the NCAA Tournament than we were a month
ago, and these two games will help us, even though we lost tonight and could
have played better. But they make you not play well. They're very good. They
did a good job against us.  
  
Q. So many of your best teams have had either superstar point guard play
or incredibly dependable point guard play. Grayson and Trevon had 9 of your 18
turnovers. How do you assess that given that you're really on the verge of the
NCAA Tournament here?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, Trey has gotten better, and I have to thank that
-- we'll be really good if he's good, and he has been good. Again, when you
get that injury -- like I thought he -- I didn't expect him to come back and
play. I think that had an impact. And then you're playing against a really
good team.  
  
But he has -- we can't turn it over like that. A few of the turnovers were
just like, whoa. They were whoa turnovers, you know? But I think the injury
hurt -- that was a problem for him.  
  
Q. You talked to scouts or other teams in your league this week here,
and they say you are undoubtedly the most talented team in college basketball.
I'm wondering how you balance coaching a group like this, a lot of guys who
will only be here for one season, and trying to get them to grow up fast.
There's obviously some deficiencies that you have, defensive intensity,
shooting et cetera. How do you bring a group like this along this fast?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, they're good kids. They want to be good. You just
try to -- there's going to be slippage. There's going to be a game like this
where it's kind of disjointed for us. But overall they've gotten better. They
like each other a lot. They want each other -- we talk about talent -- we have
a different bench in that we don't have a lot of perimeter players. That's a
stumbling block. And so our perimeter has got to play long. They have to play
a lot of minutes. And where we can alternate a little bit with the bigs. But
they've been great. But we have to accept some slippage.  
  
For tonight, look, I'm disappointed we didn't win, but we've got to move on,
learn from it, and they -- they can't hold back. I thought when things weren't
going well in the first half, we didn't have the looks that we normally have.
And then at the end of the game, we did. Boy, we had great looks. But it's
just a different experience. I'm not complaining. I think we have a chance to
do well in the tournament, and we have to learn from every time we go out on
the court. And these guys will. They accept responsibility for everything.  
  
Q. I know you guys have faced these double digit deficits whether in the
first half or the second half, and you guys have been able to come back on
multiple occasions. What can your guys learn from not being able to come back
in this one and not having to put themselves in such a hole that they have to
fight all the way back?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I mean, no one wants to put themselves in a hole.
Sometimes you can play well and the other guys are just hitting and whatever.
Like in the first half, boy, boom, boom, boom, they got threes, and that can
knock you out, but it didn't knock our team out. You just try to have a
consistent effort for 40 minutes and not put yourself in those positions. But
if we are, like throughout the last 15 minutes of the game, we kept telling
our guys, look, stay with it, stay with it, just stay with it, and we've been
here before. We will have an opportunity. And we've added some things to our
defense in the zone where we can trap. We've just added them in the last week.
And to be quite frank with you, a couple of those things worked today, which
we hadn't had. So we're just trying to get better, and maybe we do those
things a little bit earlier, I don't know. I'm good with my team.  
  
Again, congratulations to Carolina and Virginia. I mean, Virginia has been
stupendous, and again, thank you for the people here, for their hospitality. I
think Brooklyn has been great. The Barclay's have been great, and we'll just
find out Sunday where we're going and be 0-0 and go for it.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 82, Miami - 65  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Weird game to say the least. Down 14-0, wasn't real pleased with
those guys. After that, those five guys that came in off the bench, seventh,
Andrew, B. Rob, Garrison and Sterling, really did a great job.  
  
THEO PINSON: He would say it would be a weird game when I have 25-11. That is
amazing.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: It was a weird game. But those five guys got in, and the best
play was seventh taking the ball to the basket because the first group in
there acted like we were going to be shot and killed and done all kinds of
things. We missed shots and we were tight and missing everything, missing lay-
ups.  
  
Defensively I thought even Theo's five, I thought they were doing okay
defensively, and I just wanted to shake them a little bit and put those five
guys in, they got it to 14-5 and sort of calmed the came down a little bit.  
  
At the time-out I told them, and I really meant it, let's give these five guys
a chance and if they don't turn around and start playing better then I'll put
you back in and let them sit the rest of the half, and I really meant that. I
thought that was huge for us getting us back in the game, and then all of a
sudden, it may have been like 16-16, something close to that. I very seldom
look at the score but I did a couple of times in the first half today.  
  
After that point, I thought Theo was sensational, 25 points, 11 rebounds,
really controlled the whole tempo of the game on the offensive end. I've said
many times he's a play maker and in some ways maybe as good a play maker as
anybody I've ever coached in 30 years as a head coach. Everybody wants to talk
about the dunk, but I like the way he sort of read the defense. There's a lot
of guys on the street corner that can dunk, but read the defense and see what
they gave him there was sensational.  
  
I'm really surprised. I thought he had three assists. Maybe one of his most
important ones was to Joel Berry in the corner right in front of our bench.
Didn't you give him that one? And sort of just perked the whole team up for
Joel to make a shot.  
  
We rebounded the ball better in the second half. They beat us second-chance
points in Chapel Hill, they beat us in points off turnovers in Chapel Hill. We
didn't guard them at all. They dominated the game in Chapel Hill even though
it was won on a last second shot they dominated the game.  
  
For us it was a little more revenge, and I even used the word redeem. Never
used it last year until we got to Phoenix. I hadn't even heard it, but I said
let's redeem ourselves by how we play defense tonight.  
  
I'd like to say weird game. Ja'Quan just kept playing. I think he likes to
play against the Carolina Blues. He played awfully well tonight, and Lawrence
made those two threes in a row that were really big. Really happy for our
team. Luke made 13 rebounds. So he did something even though he was 1 for 15.
I believe in being straightforward with people. I told him if he had gotten
one more rebound, he could say he rebounded all his misses. But 1 for 15 and
still win and do some things, I think that's fantastic.  
  
Q. Theo, what goes through your head, and what do you say to each other
when you guys miss the first 13 shots you take, and seven minutes into the
game you look up at the scoreboard and you're down two touchdowns?  
THEO PINSON: I think at that point, we've been here before, even with the same
team. We was in the same situation last week. We knew that we was going to
make a run. There were shots that they could make, but I think we were rushing
them. We were a little antsy about the game, and they just didn't fall for us.  
  
I'm just really proud of the guys that came off the bench, like Coach
mentioned. I told them in the locker room even after the game when they
interviewed me, I told them, those five really won the game for us. I mean,
they settled us down. They got us playing to the way we needed to play. 7 set
the tone by getting to the basket, and that was a huge play for us to see that
we just shot all threes. We need to get to the cup and see what could happen.  
  
Q. Theo, what does it mean to you to be able to play Duke again here in
the semifinals of the ACC Tournament in Brooklyn?  
THEO PINSON: We did it last year. It's the next game. We just take it one game
at a time. I think that's the way I tried to tell the team that we need to
approach this. Like me and Coach mentioned to the team yesterday, we can't win
the championship unless you win Game 1. You can't win the championship unless
you win Game 2. Game 3 is against Duke, and we're excited, and they're excited
also, I'm sure, and we're going to try to do everything we can to win the
game.  
  
Q. Theo, I need a much better answer than that last one. Duke-Carolina,
what does it mean?  
ROY WILLIAMS: What's wrong with telling the truth?  
  
THEO PINSON: Yeah, I don't know --  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You say you don't like our answer. We don't like your question
worth a damn.  
  
Q. Well, I was being facetious with him.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Okay, I apologize. Go ahead.  
  
THEO PINSON: No, I mean, I know all about the rivalry. I've been here four
years. It's a big-time game. Everybody and their mama is going to be watching
the game tomorrow. Everybody knows that. I'm going to be ready. My teammates
are going to be ready. We understand we lost the last game, so that's going to
get us even more hyped up about it, but at the same time, you can't be bigger
than the game. You've got to be settled down and just play.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, last year we lost this game that's going to be played
tomorrow. I think we kept playing. I think, my memory is not as good as it
used to be, but I think we kept playing.  
  
Q. Theo, career high tonight. You've been scoring more the last couple
weeks, but you've also been shooting more. Has that been a mindset change for
you?  
THEO PINSON: Not really, just taking what the defense gives me. I have the
ball in my hands a lot, so I have the choice of shooting the ball or passing
to my teammates. Of course I would like to get my teammates -- I love getting
my teammates going. I have joy in doing that. But at the same time, if they're
not going to play me, I've got to be aggressive. That gets my teammates going.
If I'm scoring, I'm a threat, so that means they have to guard me, too, and
that just gets those guys even more open shots.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, the first three he took tonight I was really happy he
took it. The second one -- was that when the shot clock was winding down? I'll
answer this for him. He's had some walk-around games on the defensive end of
the floor. And I think he's gotten more focused defensively in the last 10
games, and I think that's made him more active offensively, too.  
  
But we've tried to put the ball in his hands more consciously. I think it's
been good for him, and I like 9 for 12, but I think 2 for 2, also. But I did
really like the first one. The second one, somebody has got to take a shot
because the clock is winding down. Not just scoring, guys -- 11 rebounds. He
doesn't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger up here, but 11 rebounds, and I think
the way he plays has just been sensational. I am moving him this week from
honorable mention to high honorable mention.  
  
Q. Coach, two of your more important players, Joel and Luke, go 5 for
29, yet you guys still can pull away with a victory. What does this say about
your group?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we've always felt like we're not just one guy, not just
two guys. We lost Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson a couple years ago. It's
impossible to be more important to the team than they were but we win the
National Championship the next year because Theo and Joel, those guys, Justin
we tried to make sure they felt important their junior year when we lost in
Houston.  
  
But I think the way we've always tried to coach is have kids who will buy into
being part of a family, buy into being part of a team, and know that when one
guy is down, somebody has got to pick them up, and I think we've had that
happen. And I will agree with you, that may have been about as heavy a lifting
as we've ever done, 4 for 29. But again, you just think about those guys that
came off the bench. You think about Theo, you think about Cam. 13.7 rebounds,
five assists, zero turnovers. We had Theo diving on the floor for a loose ball
that got us a possession. We had Kenny getting on the floor for a loose ball
and a missed free throw that got us another possession.  
  
So those two guys have gotten most of the accolades, but it is a team out
there, and I'm happy about that.  
  
Q. Coach, you do the five for five substitution as much as any coach
we've ever seen. Just remind us why you choose that route more than anybody
else? And Theo, you and Marvin Bagley both had double-doubles today. You end
up dealing with him when y'all go head to head. How long is the list of things
you and Marvin Bagley have in common?  
THEO PINSON: He's left-handed, I'm right-handed. He's 6'11", I'm 6'6".  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: He said in common, not different.  
  
THEO PINSON: I don't see anything common right now. We just both have a
double-double. He's a great player. We're both competitors, so we're both
going to go at it. He knows it's not going to be easy, I know it's not going
to be easy. We're just going to do all we can to -- he's a team guy more than
people think. I mean, you can just tell the way he plays. He cares about
winning just like everybody else on the team. I'm the same way. I think that's
what's good about both of us. That's common.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, substituting five for five, I've done it several
times. One year my high school coach told me, I could never do that. But
generally what was I supposed to do, take out Theo, leave the other four in,
or take out Joel? I was mad at everybody. I was less mad at Theo because I
don't think you had taken a shot during that stretch. But the other guys, they
practice every day, and they really enjoy it when they beat the white team,
and they talk trash to them and stuff like that, but it is competition every
day.  
  
I can sit over there and say, well, they'll work their way out of it, but I
like to see if I can jar them a little bit more and slap them in the face a
little bit more with the action, not personally but -- sometimes it's worked,
sometimes it hasn't, but I do have a great deal of confidence that the game is
not going to be lost in the first seven or eight minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the varying recruiting philosophies
that you and Duke have had the past couple of years? You obviously have made
it to two Monday nights. Your highest draft pick have been 15th. I'm wondering
if you can reflect on that for me, please.  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, there is a difference, but it's a smaller difference
than most people think. I'd like some of those guys -- I really would, and we
tried to recruit Wendell, something I thought he was really good, I tried to
recruit Jayson Tatum, I tried to recruit Harry Giles, Luke Kennard. We haven't
been able to get them. But probably the little difference is if I had one or
two, I wouldn't want three or four more. I'd love to have Brandon Wright and
Marvin Williams and Tony Bradley, okay, they were one-and-done for us. What
people don't realize, we've had just as many guys leave early for the NBA as
Duke has, and maybe one more since I've been back, it's just they haven't been
one-and-dones, there's only been three freshmen.  
  
But I'd love to have one or two of those guys, but I like some other guys that
I get to enjoy and get to know even better and are not there only eight or
nine months or something like that. It's a smaller philosophy difference. I
told Calipari the same thing, I tried to recruit those guys. We tried to
recruit PJ Washington and Kevin Knox that he has. But I would struggle -- I'm
old fashioned. I'm old school. I just told them that in the locker room there.
I like to have some guys that can stay and have a special relationship with
for a long time. Everybody likes talent, and I do, too, and I think I've got
one of the talented guys beside me that has meant a great deal to our program,
and in a corny, corny way but in a truthful way, he's really meant a lot to
Roy Williams, and I really like that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [David Padgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17012)

### [Ray Spalding](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33228)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia - 75, Louisville - 58  
  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, we were hoping third time was a charm against these guys,
but it obviously wasn't the case. There's a reason why they're No. 1 in the
country, and it was evident tonight. I said it all year long, I think their
offense is very underrated. As good as their defense is, I think their offense
is very underrated, and they shot the ball well tonight. They exploited us in
a couple mismatch opportunities, and it seems like every time we got a little
momentum, we just ball would drop out of our hands, they'd get it laid in, or
they just would hit a tough shot at the end of the shot clock, those kinds of
things. But that's just the way the game goes sometimes. Really proud of our
effort, and we're looking forward to next week.  
  
Q. Over that seven, eight minute stretch to close the game, Dave, how
did that keep you guys off the scoring board?  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, we missed some. You know, we didn't turn the ball over
today. We took pretty good care of the ball. We missed some looks, and we did
a decent job of getting to the foul line there for a little bit, but it really
was just our defense tonight. They shot 53 percent for the game. We did a
decent job scoring and attacking, shot the ball fairly well, but just got to
give them credit. They made a lot of big plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. For Ray, you were the team's leading rebounder tonight but Virginia
out-rebounded the team. Do you notice the way that they sort of tip it out to
their guards a lot of the time? Does that cause problems for you and your
teammates down low at all?  
RAY SPALDING: Yes, sir, definitely. I think we prepared for that as a team.
Coach let us know what we needed to do to box those guys out, but I mean, it
is pretty difficult boxing out a guy like that. Kind of frustrating, as well,
when you're trying to get position and then the guy reaches over and tips it
out. It's pretty good technique.  
  
Q. Coach Padgett, do you think the resume for the season is good enough
to get into the NCAA Tournament?  
DAVID PADGETT: Without a doubt. Unfortunately that's not my decision, but if
you look at our overall body of work, we haven't done anything wrong. I think
that's getting lost a lot in the shuffle this year is people used to put a lot
of emphasis and a lot of weight on these, quote-unquote, bad losses. Well, we
don't have any of those. We've played a top-20 schedule, we finished .500 in
the toughest league in the country which, without a doubt, it's the toughest
league in the country, and we got 20 wins. We haven't done anything wrong.  
  
And people will say, well, maybe you guys haven't done as much right as other
people and all that, but not having done something wrong is doing something
right. We've played a very, very difficult schedule, under very difficult
circumstances this year, and my guys have 120 percent earned an opportunity to
have their name called on Sunday.  
  
Like I said, it's not up to us, but they without a doubt earned it. And you
can't possibly sit here and tell me that we're not one of the best 68 teams in
the country. Anybody who's seen us play, anybody who watched our game against
the No. 1 team in the country a week ago today knows that we are one of the
best 68 teams in the country.  
  
Q. Ray, can you talk about the preparation this tournament might have
given you, assuming you do get into the NCAA Tournament next week?  
RAY SPALDING: I mean, it prepared us mentally and physically, being able to
spend time with my teammates and really sitting down and talking about how we
prepare for different teams. Kind of some of our younger guys, they're not
used to playing games back to back, coming from AAU and different stuff like
that, but this has definitely prepared us for that and also prepared this team
so we can get more close together.  
  
Q. David, did you say anything or did Tony say anything to you after the
game? Did you exchange any conversation?  
DAVID PADGETT: No, there was just a little -- no, it was no big deal. Tony is
-- no, it was something that was probably blown out of proportion. Just wanted
to make sure there wasn't an issue after the game. But give them credit, they
made big plays, and Tony did a great job of having them prepared today.  
  
Q. I'm curious, one, are you planning on watching Selection Sunday as a
team, and then two, kind of all season, David, you've preached this staying
present; is that the same message you delivered to your team after today's
loss?  
DAVID PADGETT: Yeah, we have no choice but to stay in the present. I mean,
we've played 33 very difficult games, and we've won 20 of them, and so we feel
like, like I said, that that's more than enough to get us in. But we've got to
wait. Today is Thursday. We've got to wait about 72 hours before we find out,
just like quite a few other teams in the country.  
  
You know, what we're going to do on Sunday will stay between us. We haven't
officially decided anything yet, but more than anything, these 14 players,
with everything that they've been through this year, you can't tell me that
they don't deserve an opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But like I said, it's been a year of ups and downs, so unfortunately that
decision is out of our control, but I hope it goes in the right way for their
sake and their sake alone.  
  
Q. When you say everything they've been through, you mean?  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, I mean, I think it's pretty obvious. Their head coach
that they came here to play for got relieved of his duties three days before
practice starts. We have to deal -- I'm coaching the team by myself for three
weeks. I'm not able to hire assistant coaches for the first month of the
season. We have to deal with the distractions of a scandal that happened
before most of them were even here. It just kind of goes on and on.  
  
But hey, the way these guys, for being 18 to 22 years old, have handled it is
absolutely remarkable. Whatever happens on Sunday, they deserve a ton of
credit for that publicly, because so many times this year they could have just
folded up and said, this is not why we came here. They could have felt sorry
for themselves. And not one single time throughout the last four or five
months did they do that. And I mean that with all sincerity. It's been the
most remarkable thing I've ever seen. Just getting the opportunity to coach
these guys day in and day out has been the best experience of my basketball
career, both as a player and a coach.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Jim Larrañaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30874)

### [Ja'Quan Newton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33217)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 82, Miami - 65  
  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, we felt like there were three things we had to do, and we
didn't do two of them. Carolina deserves a lot of credit for that. They are a
tremendous team in the open court, and we were not able to get back and set
our defense enough times throughout the contest to put ourselves in a position
to win the game. We gave up way too many lay-ups, and then second shots, they
were all over the offensive boards, especially in the last 10 minutes of the
game.  
  
We didn't turn the ball over that much, which was good, but we didn't defend
them great, either. Congratulations to them. We have a tremendous amount of
respect for Roy Williams, his staff and that program, and we played a great
game against them in Chapel Hill nine or ten days ago and were hoping to play
that well today, but we really showed our inexperience. We were very anxious,
in a hurry, and right in the very beginning, even when we had the lead, some
of the shots we took and plays and decisions we made were really not
characteristic of the way we've been playing.  
  
Hopefully we can regroup, and hopefully we'll be chosen for the NCAA
Tournament, and we'll get ready for that.  
  
Q. Jim, the way the game was going back and forth so fast, can the pace
sometimes get too fast on a team?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, I think what ends up happening is when the game gets very
fast, your mind needs to slow down. You can't have your mind going fast
forward while you're running at top speed because eventually you've got to
make a decision, and at the end, we weren't making good decisions at top speed
and they were. They made better plays in the second half in the open court
than we did.  
  
Some of the credit just goes to their players, who did a terrific job, and
some of our situation, I think, we -- playing three freshmen, first time in
the ACC Tournament, and we got very, very anxious.  
  
Q. Ja'Quan, talk about how disappointing it is to lose a game where you
get out to such a big lead at the beginning.  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Very disappointing knowing that we had a big lead on them, but
there's nothing we can do now. We just go back, watch film, see what we did
wrong and get ready for whatever is next for us.  
  
Q. Coach, a little bit of a clarification from your opening statement.
You said you didn't do two of the three things you needed to do. I think I
caught not getting back on defense, giving up second shots. The thing you did
right was not turning the ball over?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Yeah, exactly.  
  
Q. And how many of those three things did you do right in the win nine
days ago?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, we didn't turn the ball over. I can't remember the
numbers on the rebounding, but it was (indiscernible), and we gave up some
fast break points in that, but we also got some. It was kind of very well-
balanced. In that game we got ahead not immediately, we fell behind 16-8, but
by halftime we had taken the lead, and by the start of the second half we were
up 16 with about 16 to go. And then they went on a tremendous run. Their
defense was picked up, and we got a little scattery. But Ja'Quan was really in
control that day and really distributing the ball well, and then at the end he
made a lot of big plays. He scored nine straight points in the closing minutes
of that game to get us the win.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you could give me a little sense how you feel about
your team going into the tournament, how you are in real time.  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: I might look at things a little differently than most certainly
fans and coaches, but I think the NCAA Tournament is really about who plays
well that day, are they in sync with their teammates, are they really playing
at the top of their game. One of the things that you can look up statistically
is how many wins a team has away from home because there are a lot of teams in
this country that play a lot of home games and do really, really well at home,
not so great when they have to travel. And the NCAA Tournament is not played
on your home court.  
  
Our team, we've got, I think it's eight wins on the opponents' home court or
something like that. We're like 8-5 or 8-6 or something, and I think there's
only three teams in the ACC -- no, four teams in the ACC with winning road
records, and that's Virginia, Duke, Carolina and Miami. And if you look around
the country, that's true in almost all the leagues. There are a lot of good
teams who are good at home and not so good away from home so I think we've got
as good a chance as anybody, even though we're young and we do lack
experience, but this will be our third trip to the NCAA Tournament, and that
makes me and my coaching staff feel good about our chances no matter who we
match up with.  
  
Q. I know it's important to have the lead at the half; how important was
it in your view, that last foul call instead of having a lead at the half, you
guys are down at the half, and it seemed like that was a deflating play.  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: I really thought that was a very typical situation in terms of
us not being as sharp mentally as we needed to be. We just didn't make smart
decisions. We had a nice lead. We were playing well, and all of a sudden we
started rushing. We got caught up. We had a couple of fast breaks where we hit
under the rim because the defense was swiping at the ball and we were not in
control. Yeah, it was important. It was definitely a shift in the momentum.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

### [Marvin Bagley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34893)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 88, Notre Dame - 70  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We beat a really good team tonight. You know, look, I hope
they get in, because I think they can beat anybody. That was a big-time game
tonight. Mike has that team together the whole year, forget it; they could be
-- I'm telling you, if they get in, they'll be -- they're going to beat
people, and they'll have a chance. Veteran, you've got a kid, Farrell, 12
assists, one turnover, Colson, keep getting in shape. I don't know how that
bubble works and that, but they're very good. And we were very good in order
to beat them.  
  
I thought Grayson's leadership has continued to get better and better, and
tonight was a great example of him being at his best. He came out as hot as a
player could come out hitting shots, and then the nature of the game changed,
and he didn't force anything. He was 7 for 10, 5 for 6 from threes, and no
turnovers, but he was leading us throughout. And then obviously Marvin had a
great game, and there were some things that -- where we could go to him and he
was taking advantage of it.  
  
When you see Grayson, these guys say, okay, he's got it right now and go to
him, you know, that's terrific. And I know it makes Marvin feel great in that
regard. And Marvin is telling Grayson to shoot. And then Tre getting 11
assists was big.  
  
Carter has got an injury problem with his foot that he didn't practice this
week, and he was -- he played gingerly tonight, and we'll see about tomorrow.  
  
We just have to be really careful. But he did not play at the level because
he's not physically at that level.  
  
Marques came in and did a really good job, especially in the second half. It
was a big team win for us.  
  
Any questions you want to ask these guys, you do what you want to do.  
  
Q. Mike Brey talked about you guys keeping balls in play above the rim
around the net. How big of a thing is that for your success?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, Marvin gets 17 rebounds, but 13 of them are defensive,
yeah, they're one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country, and
he's getting rebounds rim high or above and being strong, you limit them to
one shot, that's big. I mean, we out-rebounded them. But the defensive boards
like that were critical.  
  
Q. You guys really forced them into a lot of bad three-point shots and
also important was you guys not fouling, they only took 11 free throws. Can
you talk about that?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, you know, we haven't been fouling. I think in the seven
games previous to this, we've given up maybe about nine free throws a game.
The zone gives us an opportunity not to foul.  
  
Today I thought the way our perimeter was playing, they extended their three-
point shots a little bit, and so they were taking them -- Farrell can take
them from anywhere and hit them, but they were extended a little bit more. And
we were giving up twos, and sometimes that can get really frustrating, but we
weren't giving up threes. That was one of our goals going in is no threes.
They could get 10, 12; they're that good. But our perimeter did a good job in
staying high.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask one for each player. Marvin, do you think that this
is the best that this team has played all season, the way you guys are playing
right now?  
MARVIN BAGLEY: Absolutely. You know, we're definitely on a roll right now.
Everything is -- we don't have it all figured out yet. We're still learning,
one thing at a time. But I definitely think that we're getting better and
we're continuing to grow as a team, and it's not a better time to grow as it
is in March when we're getting into tournaments and stuff like that. It's a
perfect time for us to continue to come together and play at our best.  
  
Q. Grayson, this is sort of an outside looking in thing, but you can
sort of enlighten us a little bit here, but the '15 team was a great deal of
talented freshmen with a senior leader, and you were on that, and you're a
senior leader surrounded by a bunch of freshmen. Are there similarities that
we should be seeing?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: That's one similarity, yeah. You know, the way we play is
different. One trend that I'm seeing that is a good thing for our team is our
defense at the end of the year is the best that it's been all season, and
that's the same thing that happened in 2015.  
  
At the end of that year, by the time the tournament came around, we were
playing -- we were one of the best defenses in the country, and so for this
team, that's one of the things that we need to keep up is keep improving our
defense, stay at it, and like Marvin said, keep playing our best basketball.  
  
But keep getting better. I mean, we're going to review film and get ready for
the next game, but we know there's a few things we can do better both
offensively and defensively, but as long as we keep clicking on the defensive
side of the ball, we'll be good.  
  
Q. Grayson, how important was it to get off to a hot start, not only for
you individually but the team overall?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: You know, it was important for our team, especially in a
tournament like this. You're playing in a new gym with a new ball, and it's
really good for all of our guys to see some shots go in, especially early on.
That really got us going offensively for the rest of the game.  
  
When we started pushing the ball early, we were getting very good looks,
especially with Marvin running the floor, and either getting in great position
or getting someone else open on the wing, and I think that got not only him
going but a lot of the guards going, as well.  
  
Q. Marvin, what's it like for you in March Madness here to be pursuing
championships here and then the NCAA Tournament, and also how would you assess
how you played tonight?  
MARVIN BAGLEY: It was a great team win. But for this -- my first time being
here, a lot of the freshmen's first time being here, it's a great experience.
We can't do anything but take it one game at a time. We can't look ahead. We
can't assume that we have an extra day because one loss and we're back home
and we don't get to come back, practice a little bit more, come back and play
in this tournament again, so we really have to every single day lock in and
just come together, man, and just try to figure everything out that we need to
figure out and just continue to get wins.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen Tony Bennett's Virginia defense develop over the
last couple years. What do you feel like makes it so special, and why do you
feel like it might be --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I'll talk about them if we play them. We haven't
played them for a month, so I haven't watched them. Obviously they're playing
everything well, but if we play them, I'll study them and I'll give you a more
intelligent answer than for somebody who might have an opinion on something
that they haven't seen.  
  
But they've been great. Tony is National Coach of the Year and deserves it.
Those kids play with such togetherness, both offensively and defensively, and
for any good defensive team, their offense has to help, and so they don't turn
it over. They make you play defense. So that's part of their defense. But they
do it really well, and they do it well enough to be the No. 1 team in the
country. But specifically I'd rather talk about it if we are going to play
them.  
  
Q. Coach, was it really just about activity increasing defensively from
first half to second half for you guys?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, it's about practice and finding out about our team. You
know, when you start a book, do you already know the ending? You know, no. Or
else you wouldn't read the book. The season is different, and it's really
different when you have all the freshmen that we have. And so part of it is
getting to know them, not just individually but how collectively they make
each other better.  
  
You know, we found that zone was better for us like the second week of
February, but we played a lot of zone before then. But if we didn't do all the
man-to-man stuff before that, we wouldn't be as good in zone, and we've been
able to practice. In December we didn't practice that much because of breaks.  
  
We're just growing. Like Marvin said, Marvin's comment was really good. We're
still learning and we're still trying to get better.  
  
Q. Marvin, first half to second half tonight, was there anything Colson
was doing specifically on the first half that you were missing shots, or were
you just missing, and then the second half you made the same shots?  
MARVIN BAGLEY: They just weren't falling. My teammates did a great job of
hitting me on a seal when I was posting, but they weren't falling. Second
half, we just had to have a short memory, move on to the next play, and don't
worry about anything that happened in the first half.  
  
It's a new 20 minutes, and our goal was to come out and play hard the first
four minutes of the second half or just to get a run. We started doing that.
We started playing. Everybody was hitting shots. Everything was starting to
fall.  
  
You know, we didn't think about anything that happened in the first half. We
had a short memory, like I said. We just went on a run and kept it going
throughout the rest of the game.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think one thing for all the young big guys is the biggest
difference -- big guys have the biggest adjustment from high school to college
because of the physicality, and especially on shots, and so I thought he made
an adjustment, instead of just shooting the ball -- they weren't fouling him,
but there was physicality. He played through resistance. I was just noticing
-- I didn't realize he was 11 for 12 in the second half, and he played through
resistance, I thought.  
  
You keep adjusting. You keep learning about the game.  
  
Q. Marvin, my question for you, you two are very different players, but
from one big to another, are there little things that you can get from
observing Bonzie, whether it's how he draws a foul or just little tricks of
the game?  
MARVIN BAGLEY: Oh, yeah, you can learn -- for me, I try to learn from every
player. He's a great player in this conference, and he does a lot of great
things on offense. Being able to score, his moves in the post. So yeah,
definitely I just try to take a little bit of small stuff from everybody and
try to put it in my game.  
  
But he's a great player, man, and being able to go up against him tonight, it
was a great experience. They have a great team, great coach, and it was a
great game tonight.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Jerome Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32044)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Clemson - 90, Boston College - 82  
  
JIM CHRISTIAN: You know, I give a lot of credit to Clemson. I thought they
played extremely, extremely well. They guard very well. They have three guards
that put a lot of foul pressure on you because they drive the ball so well,
and they made threes today from a lot of different guys. Oliver came off the
bench, and eight minutes hit three threes. That's not really -- I think he's
hit four on the season. So again, this is that time of the year when guys have
to step up, and if they do, they become more difficult to guard. But proud of
our effort. I thought we fought to the very end. Every time they got away from
us a little bit, we fought back and cut it.  
  
A lot for us to build off. I don't think we're done playing, so we're excited
to continue to play.  
  
Q. What did they do defensively to try to keep you from getting really
any clean looks for most of the night?  
JEROME ROBINSON: I mean, they just guard really well. Great on-ball pressure,
and they iced a lot of the ball screens, and are just trying to take us out of
our offense I think is what they did.  
  
Q. Jerome, how are the legs today, and what sparked that late run? You
guys seemed to run out of gas then just kind of flipped the switch and got
within two. What got that going?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I mean, the legs, it's tough playing three games in
three days, but that's what you want to do. That's what we wanted, and I think
we did well today, and the spark of that run was just our intensity. We knew
we needed to pick it up on defense and get a couple stops and get a couple
easy baskets, and then we got to cut it down, but we ended up coming up short.  
  
Q. Jerome, why weren't you able to go all the way back after you made
that run in the middle of the half?  
JEROME ROBINSON: They just kept getting -- they just kept scoring. We ended up
not getting a couple stops late in the stretch. They got a couple tough
baskets, and we ended up missing a couple open threes that I thought we could
have hit, and it's just the way the game goes sometimes.  
  
Q. Jim, we talk a lot about how much Ky and Jerome drive this team, but
this was one of those nights where it was hard to get either one of them --
how much of a challenge is it when those two guys can't get off --  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I mean, they were going. You had one guy with 20, the other guy
with 23. I mean, we scored 82 points on an unbelievably good defensive team.
They give up about 70 points a game, so we had our moments. We did miss some
shots. We missed some free throws. We missed some shots on top of the rim. But
you're not shooting 58 percent every night. It was tough, but we still made
some shots. Jordan Chatman got some looks because of it. The first time we
played them chatty didn't score, so they did a great job of any time these
guys were driving the ball, they would stay really, really long and other guys
had to make some plays for us. Again, we get 11 from Steff, 15 from Chatty.
Again, scored 82 points. We had to guard a little better.  
  
Q. Jerome, you and Ky always talk about getting this program back to
where it was in the early 2000s, mid 2000s. Even with the loss today, do you
feel like you did that in season?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I feel like it's just the first step for us. We know we
want to get it back to where it was, and I think we've earned a little bit of
respect. Our program has earned respect as a whole. I mean, that's just a
vision, and that's what we wanted.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned being excited about continuing to play. Can you
just sum up the run you made here in the three days and what it can be for you
going forward assuming you're in the NIT?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Again, these are all steps. I just think the last two weeks of
the season, we really improved, just mentally improved, just watching the guys
prepare for the game, the way we were in film, the way we were preparing in
the game, the way we attacked the game. Just watching them before they hit the
court, the enthusiasm they came with. You don't know where -- a winning
culture you don't really know where it's going to start and where it's going
to grow from, but in the last two weeks, and we lost some of those games, the
culture has completely changed. The mentality completely changed. The attitude
with which we played completely changed. And it was really fun to be around.  
  
And like I said, I think these guys -- I told them after the game that when we
first got here, there was a lot of guys that didn't want to wear Boston
College basketball shirts. I thought they brought a lot of pride with how they
played here and how they played all year to Boston College.  
  
Q. In your third year here now, this is the first time you've had a deep
run into March. How does it feel for you and some of the other guys who have
been here for a few years now to be able to play some extra games that you
haven't in years before?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, it feels good. We know -- it sucks sitting at home and
watching it on TV and being on spring break. You don't want to be on spring
break, you want to be playing in March and be part of March Madness and all
that stuff. I mean, it's the college basketball dream is to be able to play in
March, and we know that we've worked hard enough to make it here now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the possibility -- the case you made for playing
in the postseason and the value of being able to do it?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: The case we made? The value is it's a reward for hard work and
for dedication and for staying resilient. The case we made, I think we -- we
won 19 games. We won nine games in this league, the best league in the
country. We beat nationally ranked teams. Again, I'm not on the committee that
picks teams for postseason events, but I'm not going to sit here and make a
case. We played 34 games, I think we made a pretty good case for a team that's
worthy of playing in the postseason, and we'll do well.  
  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I agree with Coach. I think our belief in ourselves and
in each other is what's got us this far, and I think that we also believe that
we deserve to be in the postseason, and I think we worked hard enough to, and
as Coach said, our culture has definitely changed since these last two weeks.  
  
Q. Brad Brownell was in here, and he said as coaches they've known all
along what you bring to the table, but your record didn't reflect it until
now, and the rest of the world is kind of figuring it out. Can you already see
that on the recruiting trail and otherwise on campus because perception does
matter even if you know what you're doing?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: You know, I think people -- I think people respect teams that
they know are going to give everything they've got, and I think anybody who
steps on the court against these guys know that they were going to play
unbelievably hard. We needed to learn the process along the way to get
ourselves in this position, that's winning close games, that's executing down
the stretch, and that's making big plays. And I think those things, they just
kind of come with -- as you mature, and I think that's what happened this year
is we had a good nucleus of guys, and we matured as the year went on, and I
think that's what everybody is starting to see now.  
  
And it was -- I'll be honest with you, it was not easy because we had to
regroup in the first week of December when we lost Deontae Hawkins. That was a
huge loss for us because he was our most experienced, most winning player, and
he was our most vocal guy. So I really give these guys a lot of credit for
reinventing themselves and still chasing the dream to the levels they chased
it because I don't think -- again, I don't think anybody walked off the court
today from Clemson looking at these guys and didn't have some respect for the
effort they put in.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Shelton Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32774)

### [Gabe DeVoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34257)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Clemson - 90, Boston College - 82  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Okay, just a really good win by our guys. I thought we --
obviously we shot it well. These guys played great. I thought we showed pretty
good poise. We actually didn't get off to a great start in the game, but I
liked the way we were playing. Even though we missed some shots early, we got
down maybe it was 7-0. I told our guys I liked our rhythm, I liked what we
were doing, let's just stick with it. I thought we hung in there defensively
and did about as good a job as you can do on Robinson and Bowman. They're just
playing terrific basketball. Jimmy has done an unbelievable job with their
team. They're in a really good position with how they're doing things. You
could just tell the confidence that they were playing with today, that they
were going to come back on us and make a fight.  
  
I thought our guys did a lot of good things down the stretch handling some
press, they mixed up some zones against us, 1-3-1 and 3-2. We did a good job
of executing against a lot of different defenses, and we made our free throws
down the stretch.  
  
Q. Brad, you guys scored 90 today, but against Virginia, who you're on
to next, 36. What's different about their defense?  
BRAD BROWNELL: What's the average? I'd like to -- we'll take the average
tomorrow. What's different about their defense? I mean, they just do
everything really well. They're unbelievably sound. Tony obviously is as good
a coach as there is in our game.  
  
I think sometimes Virginia, because they play slow on offense, they don't get
enough credit for how good their players are. I think sometimes everybody gets
so into their scheme, but you don't win 17 out of 18 ACC games unless you have
really good players. And they're big, they're athletic, and they're obviously
very sound fundamentally. So they just do a lot of really good things. They're
difficult to play against.  
  
You know, the first time we did play them was the first game we played without
Donte Grantham, so hopefully we're playing a little better than a two- or one-
day prep for Virginia at Virginia without one of our best players.  
  
Q. Brad, you talked earlier in the week about kind of trying to shake
the rust off after not necessarily playing for a couple days; how much of that
did you notice? I know you started 2 of 11.  
BRAD BROWNELL: I don't think it had anything to do with that. Again, these
guys are going to make shots, miss shots. That's part of basketball. Again, I
was pleased with how we were playing. I thought we had good practices leading
in. These guys were very focused. Monday and Tuesday we practiced extremely
hard. We tapered back on Wednesday. But we tried to use Monday and Tuesday as
a way for our team to get better, and I think we did that.  
  
But a lot of credit goes to these guys next to me because of their approach.
Their approach has been great all year, handled adversity all year, and
they've been extremely coachable group.  
  
Q. Shelton and Gabe, what was the plan against Bowman and Robinson, and
how did you execute it?  
GABE DEVOE: Just tried to make them make tough plays. We know they can shoot
the ball well. Just making them make tough plays and trying to run them in
transition. They played three games in three days. We knew they would have a
little tired legs, so just trying to get out in transition.  
  
SHELTON MITCHELL: Yeah, basically like he said, try to make them take tough
twos, eliminate the easy ones, get the open threes and the easy layups and
stuff like that.  
  
Q. BC made a big run after you in the second half. What did you do to
get the lead back and command?  
GABE DEVOE: I feel like just we've done all season, just staying composed when
those situations happen. The game got close, and we made a couple big plays on
the offensive end and were able to get stops defensively, were rebounding the
ball well, so it just helped out down the stretch.  
  
SHELTON MITCHELL: Yeah, we knew they were going to make a run, like he said,
they're a good team, so really just weather the storm, stay together and try
and make a lot of winning plays at the end when it mattered.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got a guy coming off the bench today just made some big
plays for you, big threes in A.J. Talk about what he did for you.  
And also for Shelton, if you could talk about the big plays down the
stretch.  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, A.J., tremendous to see that. A.J. hadn't played a lot
this year, got some time early in the year and really struggled and just
couldn't find his legs. Probably lost his confidence midway through the year,
and just has hung with it, with an unbelievable attitude. He's just been
coachable, worked extremely hard, put more time in the gym, and really hasn't
played much at all, but he's been playing well the last month in practice. You
know, I just told him that I was going to reward him here at the end of
season. And I'm kind of one of those guys that guys will go five games without
playing for me, and then all of a sudden I'll throw them in like Malik William
against North Carolina at home. It's going to happen.  
  
Obviously what he did today was huge. We needed it. Two shots in the first
half were big, but then the one late in the game was a big-time shot. It was a
great pass, first of all. But couldn't be more proud of him because it hasn't
been easy. It's been a hard year. You lose your confidence, kind of get it
back, earn its way back. And he really hasn't played much at all, but comes
into the biggest of stages and makes three big shots today. So just really
proud of him with the attitude that he's kept all year.  
  
Q. Y'all mentioned that BC was playing its third game in three days; how
conscious were you of trying to wear them down, and how surprised were you
that they had enough gas left in the tank to make that run late?  
SHELTON MITCHELL: They were going to make a run at some point. Really we just
knew if we could try to eliminate their easy shots, make them take tough twos,
we could get stops, rebound and run, and then they would have to get back and
play transition defense. But I wouldn't say I was necessarily surprised, like
I said, because they're a good team.  
  
Q. Jim mentioned you guys are pretty close yesterday, and I was curious,
did you talk at all leading up to today or during the course of the season?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, Jim and I talk probably every two weeks, maybe every two
to three weeks, just depending on what's going on. It's mostly words of
encouragement. We both had tough years last year, and we've known each other
from just being mid-major guys about the same age for a long time. I've got an
unbelievable amount of respect for him. Martin Jarmond actually played at UNC-
Wilmington when I was an assistant there, and I told him when he got the job
at Boston College that he had one hell of a coach and that people probably
don't realize it, but you will see it this year with this team. And dadgum, I
almost saw too much of it today, but he's just done an unbelievable job with
it. He's got these guys playing at a high level. Their belief is at a high
level. And he's just -- he just does things the right way in our business.
He's a hard-working guy. He's a great offensive mind, and we've just competed
against each other occasionally, but really just guys who are similar ages
growing up in the business in a similar area.  
  
Q. Shelton, can you talk about those big plays at the end, the free
throws, and mainly the big basket that kind of kept you guys on the front of
the score?  
SHELTON MITCHELL: Really I just saw an opening. I think I forgot who it was, I
think Skara had a good screen, and I had a big backing up, so I felt like I
could make that shot. And really just making free throws. Really just staying
focused. We shoot free throws all the time in practice. So just sticking to
the same routine, I was confident I was going to be able to knock them down.  
  
Q. Gabe, you kind of went through a little bit of a shooting lull near
the end of the season, kind of picked it back up senior day and obviously
today. What were you doing during that time to try and get yourself out of the
funk?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Gabe, if you don't make five, it's a shooting lull, you
understand that, right? It's tough.  
  
GABE DEVOE: Nothing different. Just staying confident, shooting the ball.
Nothing changed. I just got hot during the middle of the season, like you
said, just making five a game. I made three today, and I guess that's a
shooting lull. But just staying confident.  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: He made five two-point baskets, which I'm proud of.  
  
Q. Coach, Tony Bennett said earlier this year in one of his radio shows
that you're a guy that he roots for, so do you think he'll be rooting for you
tomorrow?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Tony Bennett is not a very nice guy. Like he -- he's got like
nine Coach of the Year awards, and he won't let me have one.  
  
No, I don't think he'll be rooting real hard for me. Just another Midwest guy
that I respect. You know, didn't know Tony very well until I got to Clemson,
but philosophically we have some similarities. He does things better than I
do, considerably, but just have always respected his father first. Growing up
in the Midwest, you knew about Dick Bennett. My father was a high school
coach. I read his book, watched his teams at Green Bay, watched Tony. I
followed them while they were out at Washington State. I have a lot of respect
for people that do things the right way in our business, and Tony and Jim are
two guys that I've known here a little while, gotten to know better, and I
just have a lot of respect for those guys.  
  
Q. You had mentioned that you played Virginia, I think it was two days
or two or three days after Donte got hurt. Could you say that was the worst
possible time to play them, or how much of poor timing was that?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, it was hard, no question. But it's going to be hard
tomorrow, I know that. I mean, they just make it hard. You've got to play
exceptionally well. You've got to make plays. But I do think our team is in a
better place.  
  
You know, you just -- we were rolling when we had Donte Grantham. We felt like
we were one of the better teams in the country. And had kind of proven some of
that early on, and we've had to adjust, specifically these two guys and
Marquise, they've had to adjust. There's been a lot more responsibility in
terms of scoring and different things falling on their shoulders. And we had
to tweak some things in our offense just to try to take advantage of other
situations where we were using Donte in our offense, and we've gotten better
at that. We've gotten better at that.  
  
We've got a couple guys, like Aamir is better now than he was then. David
Skara is a guy that's continued to get minutes and gotten. Obviously a guy
like A.J. Oliver played well today. But still, Shelton Mitchell, Marcquise
Reed, Gabe DeVoe for us, those guys are the guys that have really led this
team now that Donte has been out.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 88, Notre Dame - 70  
  
MIKE BREY: They're just such an explosive offensive unit, and tonight we had
no answers. Overall I kind of liked our offensive rhythm, but we just couldn't
get enough stops. We had some key turnovers in the second half when we had it
to about 10, that was the difference, and Bagley was just the first pick in
the draft. He made a couple, and I just said to myself, wow, he's really good.  
  
I'm very impressed with what our guys did here to get to this point. We have
emptied the tank, and we'll see what our fate is down the road. Whatever it
is, we'll be accepting and proud, and we're actually getting healthier, so I
look forward to playing in the postseason because we're feeling a little
better.  
  
Q. How did you feel at halftime, 41-37?  
MIKE BREY: I told our guys we're in a lot better position than we were the
night before. You know, I mean, we were laughing, like this is -- we're in
great position. Even at the 15-minute mark when we made our run, we kind of
made a reference. But that's a different animal out there tonight when they're
in an offensive rhythm like that. You know, you're darned if you do, darned if
you don't. They made all these threes early, we didn't want to help in the
post because we thought we could maybe absorb twos, but then Bagley was just
unbelievable.  
  
Q. Bonzie, what was it like playing against Bagley tonight?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, you know, since I've been here, he's one of the toughest
players I've ever gone against. He's really explosive as he has a really
explosive first step, so a lot of respect to him and how he played. He
deserved all the honors he got this year, and he's a heck of a player. I
respect him a lot.  
  
Q. You said your team is just getting healthy. What did you guys get out
of this tournament having your starting lineup together for the first time?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I loved seeing this group play together for three games, and
really four games when you add Virginia, where he played his 33-35 minutes.
You know, we're excited about what the next challenge is in postseason,
whatever it may be, because we're feeling a little better about ourselves
physically.  
  
Q. When Bagley turns his left shoulder and just goes with the lay-up
into the basket, what are you thinking and what's that going to be like at the
next level for the NBA guys?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I mean, he's really impressive. I mean, it's -- he's a
can't-miss star in my opinion, just watching that tonight.  
  
You know, they rebound at a level above the rim that I haven't seen in college
basketball. I don't remember some of the rebounds above the rim like that with
their size and their athletic ability. It was interesting to be floor level
and see how they explode off the court.  
  
Q. There's a storybook aspect to Bonzie's whole career and staying in
school and wanting his diploma; you don't know where you're going, but can you
just tell us how you would both digest going from almost a Disney script to
maybe not even being in the NCAA Tournament if it comes to that?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, you know, I think we're -- this has been a really mature
group. They have taken their punches, and we're prepared to go wherever they
send us. You know, when you lose seven in a row and you're under .500, you're
talking and dreaming about making a run to get to the bubble, which I'm very
proud that we did, but you're also talking very realistically with our seniors
that if it's the NIT, we'd be honored, and let's come back to the Garden. None
of these guys have played in the Garden.  
  
I think we know exactly where we're at. I'm just glad we're going to keep
playing with this group and that he gets to play some more college games.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I think Coach summed it up. Myself and the captains and
the seniors, we stayed together through it all. We continued to give
confidence to the rest of the players that we could be special, and we know
that we're going to play somewhere. We're excited about it, and we think we
gave the committee a heck of a run of what we can do.  
  
All you can ask from us is just go and give it all and play until the buzzer
ends. Play with heart, passion, energy, and that's what we did today, and
you've got to give a lot to credit to Duke.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Devon Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30893)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia - 75, Louisville - 58  
  
Q. Kyle, it looked like coming out you maybe were a little uncomfortable
with the brace. You subbed out, subbed back in, and obviously had a great game
after that. What were you feeling and what was it like playing with that?  
KYLE GUY: I felt really good actually in practice. It took a while to get used
to wearing a brace, but I felt fine from tip-off. Maybe it just took a minute
to get in a groove.  
  
Q. Tony, the final nine minutes, you held them to one field goal. How
was that defensive effort down the stretch there?  
TONY BENNETT: I think a couple times they helped us out. There just were a
couple hot bounces and they missed a few easy ones. But they made a nice run
to cut it to four or six, and we answered, and we got enough stops and guys
made some good plays. Because they played them three times, we know how they
can pull up and hit shots and touch the paint. So I just think we tightened up
a little more, and a majority of the game they did have to earn their baskets.  
  
Q. Devon, when you look at playing a team for a third time, especially a
week ago you played that emotional game at Louisville, how do you approach
preparing for the game, and is there anything different when you get ready for
something like this?  
DEVON HALL: Yeah, I think so. Most of the time it was us having a conversation
of coming out and punching first. When we played there at Louisville, they
kind of hit us in the mouth and we kind of had to respond. The idea was to
come out and try to punch first.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys seemed like you were in control; they made the run
in the second half. Was it at all hard to keep your focus when you went up
big, or are you kind of used to that situation at this point?  
DEVON HALL: Basketball is a game of runs.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, we just tried to win the media time-out, so four-minute
stints, just leave it all on the floor and try to win those four minutes.  
  
Q. Tony, could you talk about Mamadi's performance?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I thought he gave us a real nice lift with some nice
baskets and offensive rebounds to scores, and then a couple times -- he
actually had a couple good quality individual defense because Spalding is such
a good scorer. And when we were trapping, it was effective a little bit, and
then they started getting open shots, so he did some good one-on-one shots.
But a couple of those moves and put-backs, guys finding him were very key.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, you have a game tomorrow, hopefully a game
after that. It's more that March schedule of lots of games, short prep time.
How do you change how the team prepares?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think tournament basketball, it's about the possessions
matter. We talk about this, and we just have been talking about the last -- I
don't know how long, not to overcomplicate it, just to try to prepare well,
and preparing well is how we rest, how we watch film and get ready for whoever
we play next, try to improve from the things we saw, and then when the ball is
tipped, really be ready to go and play at our highest.  
  
We're a possession-by-possession team. That doesn't change. I don't know if
that sets itself up for this. But records are out now, and it's just teams can
play at a high level. You saw Pitt play Notre Dame close. You saw the swings
in the Virginia Tech-Notre Dame game, so you just try to lock in. Louisville
made one against us. I think our guys understand how we have to be.  
  
Q. Does it impact you at all when you take the court knowing you're the
No. 1 team in the country?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, I think we know we're going to get everybody's best shot,
so going into it, we have to have a mindset of trying to come out, and like I
said earlier, try and punch first. Like Coach said, we're a possession-by-
possession team, so there's not going to be too many home run plays. We're
going to get everybody's best shot. We've got to play like that every
possession.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, when we're -- every time we come out onto the court, we just
try to remember our pillar of humility, and I think we do a really good job of
that, not getting too high or too low and just staying positive and leaving it
all on the floor.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustment, if any, have you made playing with the
brace? Looked like it was just fine today.  
KYLE GUY: No, all week in practice I was just trying to get used to it.
There's definitely a mental part of it where you sort of feel safe with it on.
Like I said, it didn't really bother me much.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys do a real nice job of keeping the ball
alive. How long have you worked on that, and what's the philosophy behind
making that work?  
DEVON HALL: Well, our bigs are -- do a heck of a job of doing that. I think
Isaiah is probably the best at it, even being undersized down there, but he
just has so much fight. And our bigs, on our own shots, they crash the glass.
Tipping those out are huge momentum swings for us.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, Isaiah is gifted in that aspect. I think I had seven rebounds,
and it wasn't because they couldn't keep me off the boards. I think he was
tipping it out to me.  
  
Q. Tony, you'd seen Louisville twice before. What were the keys to the
rebounding advantage?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, again, I have so much respect for Spalding and Mahmoud and
just the way they go at the glass, and they're quick, and they're mobile.
They're not just long and bouncy, they're real mobile. So quality block-outs,
and then these guys, like Kyle coming back and Dev and rebounding, group
rebounding, and really pursuing, and once a shot goes up, staying engaged the
whole time, but quality block-outs. If they get alleys or lanes like Isaiah
does offensively, they're going to keep stuff alive, and I thought for the
most part we were disciplined in that. The tape always really reveals that,
but we always look at that; are we staying engaged through the whole shot and
the defensive rebounding; that's such a key.  
  
Q. Devon, this may be the last time you face Louisville; just talk about
the rivalry this season, and what did you think when you saw them on the
bracket sheet coming up?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, they're a heck of a team, and we know that walking into
it, it was going to be a battle. Every time we've played them it's been a
battle, and they've got some really talented players in Adel and Spalding and
Mahmoud and Snider, as well. We knew walking into it, it was going to be a
battle, so I enjoyed it.  
  
Q. Devon, when you saw your teammate Kyle go down in the first half of
that game against Notre Dame, didn't know what the seriousness of it was, what
were your initial thoughts, and how relieved are you to be able to have him on
the court here in March?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, you guys know how good Kyle is, so obviously we were
happy. But to see him go down, I didn't know exactly what happened and what
was going on, but in that situation it is kind of next man up. At the end of
the season, guys go down, guys get hit with injuries, and he's tough enough to
fight through it, so that's good to see.  
  
Q. Could you talk about two shots you took? You drove into the paint,
sort of had both hands on the ball over your head and you got the shot off and
drew a foul, and also about your dunk?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I did dunk it, I told you.  
  
On the and-one, I don't even think that Adel fouled me. I felt like I got
fouled before that. But once I heard the whistle I just tried to get it up,
and fortunate it to go in. On the dunk, if I wasn't on a game play, I probably
could have done something a little more special than that, right, buddy?  
  
DEVON HALL: Or been a good teammate and handed it off. But it is what it is.  
  
Q. Boston College is a 12 seed here, is making a little bit of a run,
and you may or may not face them tomorrow in the first semifinal. Have you
seen any tape of them recently and have you been preparing for possibly basing
Boston College?  
TONY BENNETT: I mean, they're terrific. They're hard to guard. We remember our
first game of the ACC regular season, they gave us everything we could handle.
Interesting ending, the way it was. But they are good, and is it Popovich --
no, that's not -- he's playing really well for them. That's the guy who
coaches the Spurs, right? Popovic? Close. But he's playing well, their guards
are great. But they've got to get by. We had to get by Louisville. They've got
to play a quality team. At this level, it's just who's playing their best
basketball. So we don't look at it that way.  
  
Q. Have you had an injury in your basketball career that has forced you
to wear a knee brace like that before?  
KYLE GUY: I have never really had any scares, thankfully.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Kenny Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34857)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 78, Syracuse - 59  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we're trying to get out of here, so I'll be quick as I
can. Feel very good about it. We played exceptionally well at times and didn't
play with our brain at times. But I thought defensively it was one of our
better games of the year, if not the best game of the year.  
  
Second half, we hit a bad stretch in there. We missed free throws, turned it
over, took a couple of bad shots, and they made a run at us, and they did the
same thing at Syracuse. Those three guys are really, really hard to guard out
there.  
  
Second half I think we did a better job of guarding the three or perhaps they
were even tired, but who knows; we're still playing.  
  
Q. Roy, two questions: Were you trying to rip your jacket? And two,
after the last two games, did you guys need a win like this?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'll answer the second one first. I don't know if we needed it.
I really wanted us to maintain the lead so I didn't have to play Joel and Theo
and those guys as many minutes as I did tonight. That was the one thing I
wanted. And yes, in the locker room, in case you guys want to find out, I'll
tell you individually. I talked to the guys about how to rip a jacket in half,
and how I did not do it properly. I started around the collar where it's
folded over so the material is twice as strong. If you really want to rip a
jacket in half, start at the back at the bottom where it's already split. Now
you learn something. If you've covered me for 30 years, it may be something I
really thought you, so don't forget.  
  
Q. Theo, what were you doing to get so many good looks around the rim?  
THEO PINSON: Getting me the ball (laughter). No. Like Coach said yesterday in
practice, we're such an unselfish team. He doesn't really have to worry about
us moving the ball. You can see I think it was multiple times tonight where
guys had shots but they were looking for their teammates, so that's one thing
that's good about -- since I've been here, we've always been good at passing
the ball. We love playing with each other and we want to get each other going.
We really don't run into that problem.  
  
Q. Roy, had you tried to rip your jacket before, like why were you doing
that -- was it Cam's shot? Was it the shot selection? What was the --  
ROY WILLIAMS: No, I've never tried to rip one. It's embarrassing to try the
sucker and can't do it. I thought I was stronger than that to be honest with
you, but I do believe it's harder to do up there. At halftime we spent quite a
bit of time talking about we should have had the last shot of the half. I may
get the math wrong now, but I think we were up 11. If we get the last shot of
the half, it's still 11 even if it doesn't go in. But instead we get an
offensive rebound and decide we're going to attack the basket, and we missed
the shot, and Sterling gets it and dunks it. So what do they do, they go down
and get three so we lost, three points to two. I've said that forever -- I
swear to goodness, guys, I have looked, it is not in the constitution of the
United States that just because you get an offensive rebound means you get to
shoot.  
  
And so my answer to you is just about as dadgum long as we talked about it at
halftime. So some guy who's the best play maker, maybe the best play maker
I've ever coached gets an offensive rebound late in the second half, and he
thought it says in the constitution of the United States that he had the right
to shoot the ball. Not one to point fingers at anybody, so he shot it, he said
he saw a sliver of light there, and shot it and missed it. We could have run
another 25 seconds because you've got to play the clock any other team, but
late game situations we've got to be smarter than that.  
  
I told him I was trying to rip my jacket because I couldn't put my hands on
him.  
  
THEO PINSON: I thought all-ACC honorable mention gave me a little leeway on
that.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I told him he was high honorable mention, like the Olympics. I
don't love anybody more than I love that boy, but I'm telling you, at that
moment, me and his mama both wanted to strangle him.  
  
Q. Theo, what made you so effective in getting Syracuse's front court
into foul trouble today?  
THEO PINSON: Attacking them. They contest every shot that goes to the rim, so
every point we could get in the middle I wanted to put pressure on them to
make a good play and keep attacking, and we got the call, so it was good on
our part to get the -- I mean, it helped us. Having No. 13 at the game was
huge for us, so I think that was a big part in the game.  
  
Q. Kenny, is foul trouble something you can try to game plan to force on
the other team, or is that something you just kind of get and roll with if you
are able to?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I think that's part of why Coach wants us to get the ball
inside so much, to get the other bigs in foul trouble, and I think we did a
good job of that tonight, Theo, Luke, a couple guys got them in foul trouble
early, and they weren't able to be effective.  
  
Q. Kenny, obviously it's March, but was there a little extra motivation
or maybe energy out of you guys with this game considering the way your season
ended, the regular season?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: We knew we had to come in and take care of business. We never
talk about, oh, we lost two in a row, we've got to get this one. But we know
it's March, it's tournament time, and after the last game we were saying it's
go time. I think everybody had an extra pep in their step tonight.  
  
Q. Roy, tough game for you and everybody at Carolina with Woody passing
away. Any thoughts about that, and how much did that kind of affect maybe
giving some extra inspiration or anything like that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I'm not belittling this: Woody Durham was a great friend.
He was a legend, but it had nothing to do with my game preparation. I coached
two different times in my career with Dean Smith on the other sideline and
never thought about him one second. He would have been extremely disappointed
if I had thought about him.  
  
Tonight the same thing; if I had been thinking anything about Woody, he would
have been extremely disappointed. It was our job to try to coach our kids, and
it was the coach's job to go out and play. I think we did a nice job. Eric
Hoots' idea, I think, I know he's the one that brought it to me about putting
Woody's name on the back of our shooting shirt. It was a sad day for all of us
because I lost a friend, but we lost a guy who's a legend in North Carolina
basketball.  
  
But you've got to understand, nobody on my team ever worked with Woody. It's
something like that. I loved him to death, love his family, went over to tell
Wes something before the game, but it had nothing to do with the game. Woody
himself would have been extremely disappointed if I said something different.  
  
Q. Kenny, Battle hit a couple big shots early, but after that you guys
were able to lock down on their perimeter players. Why were you so successful
defensively against them?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: We knew we had to lock down on them. We knew Battle, Brissett
and Howard took the majority of their shots, so we knew -- and we knew that
they played a good game against us up at Syracuse. We just had to lock in. And
yeah, he got a couple early, and I had to step it up a little bit after that.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: And just understand, too, they play a lot of minutes. You've got
to appreciate what in the heck they've done all year long, and they played a
lot of minutes yesterday, as well. I do think our defensive play was better
today than it had been in a long time, but those guys were -- they've been
unbelievable for Jimmy and his club, and hopefully Sunday afternoon they'll be
rewarded for it.  
  
Q. Along the same lines, it seemed like Syracuse had some trouble
scoring in the paint, getting to the free-throw line. What about your defense
kept them from being effective from underneath the rim?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, you look at their scoring all year long, 76 percent of
their scoring comes from those three guys. They're not going to get in the
tournament and change who they are. The big guys, 13, I think, is a
magnificent shot blocker. It was important for us to get him in foul trouble.
But he's not the offensive player those other guys are, and they got here,
they won 20 or 21 games because those guys did a great job. You realize where
your strengths are and let those guys take most of the shots, so that's who
they are. I don't think our defense had anything to do with that kind of
focus. That's just who they are.  
  
Q. Looking ahead at Miami, I know you said that you thought that your
team had one of the best defensive efforts this game; what are you guys
looking to do? You lost a buzzer beater last time. What kind of momentum are
you looking to take into this game?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I used to say I wanted to enjoy one victory until 12:00
midnight. What time is it now?  
  
Q. 12:02.  
ROY WILLIAMS: So I guess we can't even enjoy the hell out of it for two
minutes.  
  
Miami played a big time game against us. We couldn't stop them. Ja'Quan made
10 or 12 of their last 13 or 14 points. We remember that. They remember that.
But we have to play better tomorrow.  
  
You know, we're up here in New York, and I will say this: I'm not as strong as
Jimmy was. Jimmy said they shouldn't be in Greensboro, but think about this:
The ACC goes from South Bend, Indiana, to Boston to Miami. Why can't we find
someplace warm to play this sucker? Thank you, guys. I'm outta here.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Chris Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34841)

### [Justin Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30517)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 71, Virginia Tech - 65  
  
Q. Basically, what do you feel was the turning point in the second half?
You guys were up 21, you were playing outstanding, and things sort of fell
apart. What changed?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: We disintegrated. We didn't guard. They scored 45 points in the
last 15 minutes. We were okay offensively, not great. Didn't guard the ball.
They forced help, made some threes.  
  
But just completely fell apart the last 15 minutes defensively.  
  
Q. For the players, you're up 17 with 11 minutes to go, and of course it
changed there. Did they do certain things defensively to start making it tough
looks for you guys? Did they do certain things better offensively during the
last 11 minutes? What changed from your perspective?  
JUSTIN AMMERMAN: I would say no. Like Coach said, we just fell apart. I mean,
it's a learning experience, hopefully we take positives and negatives from
this and just move on.  
  
CHRIS CLARKE: I would also say no, as Coach and Justin just said. I think we
fell apart, as well, on defense, and I feel like it translated over to our
offensive game.  
  
Q. Chris, what happened on the technical foul there?  
CHRIS CLARKE: I had the ball from the rebound or whatever happened. Matt
Farrell took the ball from me, and I tried to get it back, and he flopped and
fell on the ground and got the technical.  
  
Q. Buzz, those last 11 minutes did Notre Dame give you tougher looks?
Obviously you guys went kind of cold there; what do you think kind of changed
from that standpoint?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, the whole ambiance of the game I thought changed after
they called the first time-out. I think we scored four points on run-outs.
They had scored zero, time-out. So from whatever that number was, 15 minutes
to go in the game, they scored 50 points. I think you can point to a lot of
things. Offense wasn't great. They started switching everything just to try to
keep us in front. Rightfully so. I thought we had done a good job up until
that point through the first 25 minutes.  
  
I didn't necessarily think that we were great in the first half or the second
half offensively. I thought we were really good defensively in the first half
other than their seven offensive rebounds. But if you give up 50 points in 15
minutes, I don't know that as a coach that I would point to offense being a
problem.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that you believe your team is an NCAA Tournament team,
but what about Notre Dame? Do you feel like them at full strength is an NCAA
Tournament caliber team?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I think after maybe when they won Maui, I don't know what
that would have been, maybe the first week in December, the first Monday in
December, they were ranked fifth in the country. Those two guys have made a
huge difference when they have played. And, you know, I'm not smart enough to
be on the committee. I don't even -- I try to stay away from all politics. But
when you look at their team, I don't think that they're a 10 seed in the ACC
with those guys healthy the entire time. I think it changes the complexion of
the league race from top to bottom. I think Coach did an outstanding job even
keeping them in the mix until those guys got back. I guess that's their fourth
game since both of them have been back. Played great at Charlottesville, and
then I think they won their other two games, and obviously they won the two
games since they've been in New York.  
  
In my opinion, yes.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [David Padgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17012)

### [Quentin Snider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28779)

### [Deng Adel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32872)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Louisville - 82, Florida State - 74  
  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, we knew they were going to make a run. I get 100 times
more nervous about games like that when you have a big lead, especially at
halftime, than actually if you're down. If we're tied or down at the half I'm
actually more calm, but those are tough. Because you know the other team is
going to make a run. They made some very good adjustments in the second half,
especially against our zone, and hit some big shots at some crucial times.
You've got to give them credit for clawing back into the game. But I thought
our guys did a great job of executing our late-game situations, our full-court
pressure situations and taking care of the ball. They only had nine turnovers
against a team that athletic and that presses that much is a big reason why we
won the game and also the backboard.  
  
Very proud of our guys, very happy with the win, and got to get ready for the
No. 1 team in the country yet again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering kind of what your approach has been this
season, the sort of big picture. Obviously against the backdrop of so much
stuff surrounding the program and the school, kind of how you've managed to
navigate things with the players this year.  
DAVID PADGETT: Keeping my focus on them and them only. I haven't focused on
anything since that day in September when I was named coach, and their concern
is my concern. I haven't deviated from that one bit whatsoever.  
  
Like I've said numerous times, and these guys know it, and I believe it, they
don't get a chance to do this season over again, so I'm going to put
everything I have into making sure that it's successful, especially for this
guy sitting next to me and his other senior teammate Anas because it's their
last go-around, and they deserve nothing but the absolutely best opportunity
to make it a magical season.  
  
Q. David, you talked about sometimes having a deficit can be easier than
holding onto a lead. What are the keys to holding onto a lead? I know that's
sometimes been difficult for Louisville.  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, we did a good job of taking care of the ball. I don't
know how many turnovers we had in the first half, but we only had nine for the
games, and they picked us up full court the entire second half. We did a very
good job of running our press break offense of getting the ball into the right
person's hands, and we just made good decisions. We stayed confident. We
didn't panic when it got close. And fortunately we've been in this situation a
lot before, it just hasn't always turned out in our favor, but tonight it did,
so we're very happy with that.  
  
Q. There's a lot of talk by the bracketology guys that you needed to win
this game to solidify your chance of getting into the NCAA Tournament. Do you
feel confident that you're in now or do you feel you've made the case that you
guys belong in?  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, this win certainly helped. It's a team that's been ranked
in and out of the top 25 all year. We've beat them twice now, so yeah, we feel
it helped getting that 20th win. I don't know if any of us know if there's a
definitive answer to what's required to get into the tournament. We've tried
to approach it one game at a time and we just said we have to try to win this
game so we can advance in the ACC Tournament.  
  
You know, I'm sure this significantly helps our resume, but our focus now is
just going to turn to Virginia, a team that we've lost to twice and who we've
played well against, so I know if we're able to come out and get a win
tomorrow against the No. 1 team in the country that I would surely think
they're in.  
  
Q. Are you guys glad to get Virginia again, given what happened last
Thursday?  
DAVID PADGETT: Yeah, we haven't talked about it to be honest. The reason we're
happy to get them is because it's a chance to beat the No. 1 team in the
country and a team that has played well all year long.  
  
Look, last Thursday was tough, there's no denying that, but we haven't said,
well, we've got to beat Florida State so we can get to Virginia. No, we just
said we've got to beat Florida State so we can move on. Virginia is going to
be ready for us, as they have been all year, and we just have to come out and
just leave it all out on the court. We've played well against them both times,
but that doesn't change the outcome. We came up short both times. We've got to
be ready to compete for 40 minutes tomorrow against the best team in the
country.  
  
Q. For the players, to follow up on that, are you guys looking forward
to getting another crack at Virginia because it was so close last time? Do you
guys have some confidence going into this one, and what did you do
particularly well in that second game against Virginia that you want to do the
same thing tomorrow?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: I thought that game we did a great job of really attacking the
basket. This is our chance. We're just going to focus on Virginia and try to
get this win tomorrow.  
  
DENG ADEL: Yeah, just losing to them twice both at their place and then at our
place, we're definitely excited to face them because they're the No. 1 team in
the country and everybody wants to beat them. So we're definitely excited for
that.  
  
And to answer your second question, I think we did a good job of defending
them, stopping their actions, and then we did a good job being patient
offensively.  
  
Q. For the players, how, if at all, have you had to adjust your
expectations for this season as the year went along and everything kind of
happened, the whirlwind?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: The main thing is just staying together as a team, our
sanctuary on the basketball court. We don't need to worry about nothing else
that happens. Right now we're just trying to focus on getting on to the next
game.  
  
DENG ADEL: Like Q said, our biggest thing is to stand together in the locker
room because no matter what happens outside the court, we're always a family.
And Coach DP does a great job of just making sure we just focus on ourselves
and not worry about anything that's happening in the media or in the outside
world. So we just do a good job of just staying together. Our number one goal
is to win a championship starting in say October or so, so that never changed.
We're still playing basketball and we're still doing what we love.  
  
Q. David, when Florida State made that run late today, did you attack
that late-game situation with the lead differently because of the ending
against Virginia last week?  
DAVID PADGETT: Not really. I just tried to put the right pieces in at the
right times, wanted to make sure we had good ball handlers and good free-throw
shooters on the court. That game last week was just a perfect storm of stuff
that had to go right for them and wrong for us, and it did. But hey, that's
sports. Will any of us ever see a game like that ever again? Probably not.  
  
But we didn't panic today. Our guys did a great job. They didn't panic when
they made a run, when they cut it to six or eight or whatever it was, and we
just kept executing. I'm just really proud of the way they handled it late
game, and look, I can only do so many things, but when these guys are out on
the court making the right plays to help us win, they're the ones that get all
the credit.  
  
Q. How much do you guys follow all that bracketology, and given that,
what did this game mean for you guys today?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: You know, I follow it. But this game really means a lot, but
right now we're just going to move on, get ready for Virginia. That's just the
main thing.  
  
DENG ADEL: I mean, personally, I haven't really looked at it at all this year
just from hearing media and from fans and stuff. But our biggest focus is just
getting wins and getting our 20th win was big today. If we just continue to
win and do what we can control, I think the rest will happen itself.  
  
Q. As you look back at the two regular season meetings with Virginia,
what did you feel adjustment-wise you did better going from the first meeting
to the second meeting, and what do you need to do even better in order to get
the W tomorrow?  
DAVID PADGETT: Well, I thought the biggest difference between the first and
the second game was the way we defended. I thought we played much better
defense. We just tried to be aggressive on both ends of the floor, and we did
a good job of defending the three-point line, which I think against them is
big because obviously they've got guys that can really shoot the ball. I think
they're a very underappreciated offensive team this year. I think that's gone
unnoticed because of how good their defense is. We just tried to defend well.
I thought we did a good job the second game, and you know, they made some good
adjustments against us the last couple minutes of that game, kind of put us in
some isolation situations.  
  
But we've just got to go back, look at the film, see what we did well, see
where they hurt us, and it's a quick turnaround, we've got less than 24 hours
now. But with that being said, they kind of do, as well, because they
obviously didn't know who was going to win this game. It's going to be a quick
turnaround, but that's the beauty of postseason play is you've just got to get
back to the hotel, get off your feet and get ready for the next one.  
  
Q. If you go all the way back to the preseason, a lot of folks thought
there would be a lot of games where these two guys and Ray led you to this
kind of victory. How do you explain to folks who haven't seen all your games
why this has not happened as often as folks expected it to happen?  
DAVID PADGETT: You mean as far as -- why what hasn't happened?  
  
Q. If we went back to the preseason, we could have envisioned a lot of
wins like the one we just saw. Instead you're kind of on the bubble wondering
why that script didn't happen more frequently this season. What do you
attribute that to?  
DAVID PADGETT: Playing good teams. I mean, lose at Purdue; Seton Hall at home,
tournament team; Virginia twice, No. 1 team in the country; at Duke; North
Carolina; at Kentucky. So it's not like we've had any, quote-unquote, bad
losses this year. I think the only team, if you had to pick one, I guess, our
worst loss, which to me is not a bad loss, would be Syracuse. They're right on
the verge of making the tournament, too. You've got to give the other teams a
lot of credit in situations like that, too. Conversely, there's been a lot of
situations where our guys have made big plays tonight. For one, we've had
other games, Indiana was one, where it could have gone the other way, but our
guys made big plays. Look, I'm going to put the ball in these guys' hands at
the end of the game and they're going to make the right decisions, and I have
the utmost confidence in them.  
  
Q. Deng, because of what happened late in the game last Thursday, how
much are you personally kind of relishing the chance to get another crack at
knocking Virginia off, and do you think your team is going to have some
confidence tomorrow knowing that we know how to beat these guys because we
almost did beat them?  
DENG ADEL: Yeah, like I said earlier, I'm looking forward to playing Virginia
because we know we can compete with anybody in the country. But our biggest
thing is getting another win. Like everybody said, we're on the bubble of the
tournament, so our biggest thing is getting a win, and no matter who's
standing in our way, we're going to find a way.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

### [Omer Yurtseven](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34822)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Boston College - 91, NC State - 87.  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Guys, I want to congratulate Boston College. I thought they did
a tremendous job, especially in the first half. When you look at those guards,
I thought they played extremely well tonight. Not only did they score for
themselves, but they did a great job of getting everybody involved.  
  
I thought we had -- I thought we were a little slow getting started. Obviously
we got in a big deficit early, and we had to battle back at halftime. We
talked about obviously staying the course, and I felt like if our guys stayed
the course, and obviously we made some shots, we would get back in the game
because I thought our press could get us back in the game. And certainly we
did and put ourselves in a situation to be able to win the game at the end.  
  
Very unfortunate, I think those guys in the locker room battled extremely
hard, obviously, for the win, and came up a little bit short.  
  
I'll take questions.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys tied the game five times but were never able to get
ahead. How important was that to try to get that lead and make them come back
on you?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, it was important. You know, they had an answer and they
did a good job. Every time we made a basket, they would come down and make a
basket. If you were a fan, the last three minutes of the game was pretty
exciting. For us, we just couldn't get over the hump.  
  
Q. How tough is it to face two guards like Jerome Robinson and Ky
Bowman, and what do they do that makes them so difficult to guard?  
KEVIN KEATTS: They're good players. When you look at it, both of those guys
can -- they're very good at getting into the paint. They can score from all
three levels because those guys can finish around the rim. They're very good
at free-throw shooting when you foul them, and then both of them shoot very
well behind the arc. Very good players. I've said this before, could be
arguably the best backcourt in the ACC.  
  
Q. You spent the past few years coaching in a league where the
conference tournament sort of determined if you kept playing. In the ACC,
there's a good chance that you'll be playing even after you've lost this time.
What's the difference in mentality for coaching in one of those leagues versus
coaching in a league where you don't need this to extend your season?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I think the approach is the same. You know, you don't --
obviously you go into every game expecting to win the game. We obviously went
into this game with the expectation that we were going to win and we were
going to advance. It's a little different because you're right, when you went
to -- last year when I was at UNCW, we had won 28 games, and I knew if I
didn't win that championship game, there was a good chance that I might not
make any postseason play. So it's a little bit different. But I think as far
as your preparation and you're mentally prepared for it, with our team, we're
prepared to win every game.  
  
Q. How will you approach Selection Sunday? Where will you guys watch it,
and how confident are you that you'll hear your name called on Sunday?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, we'll get together as a team. We haven't decided,
obviously, where we're going to watch it, but I'm excited about our team. Our
body of work is pretty good when you think about what we've done in a short
amount of time and look at winning -- beating five top-25 teams and winning on
the road and a couple wins against the No. 2 team in the country.  
  
So I'm excited about it. You know, I'm excited for these guys for the
opportunity.  
  
Q. As you go back home and reset for the next tournament, do you put
this out of your mind and just flush it, or do you keep it in mind and kind of
use it as motivation?  
OMER YURTSEVEN: I definitely use it as a motivation. These type of losses
hurt, and you've got to use that pain basically as energy for your next
opponent.  
  
Q. When y'all tied it late, we looked it up, and if you had won this
game, it would have tied the biggest halftime deficit comeback in the history
of the 65-year-old ACC Tournament. I know you're disappointed, but can you
take something from what you saw and what was almost a record-tying come
back?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I wish you would have dropped a little note to me so we
could know that.  
  
You know, I told the guys that the next opportunity that we have to play a
game, it's going to be the last time that the seniors get a chance to play
together. We cannot have the start that we had -- we didn't have a great first
half. I challenged these guys at halftime, and obviously they responded. I
thought they did a tremendous job.  
  
For whatever reason, we didn't play extremely well to start the game. But what
we'll take from this is that when it's one-and-done, you've got to play the
entire game. You've got to finish games. And obviously we didn't do a great
job starting, and I thought we finished the game.  
  
But we were right there to win the game, and certainly it would have been a
great win for us.  
  
Q. Omer, you had most of your points in the second half; what kind of
adjustments did you make coming out of halftime that let you do so well in the
second half?  
OMER YURTSEVEN: I would say I just kept shooting. That was the mentality. I
just made the regular shots that I would. They didn't fall down in the first
half, but I just stuck with it.  
  
Q. Kevin, how big a deal was it to have Torin get two fouls so quickly,
only play like four minutes in the first half? Seemed like he was really
active on the boards early, and then the energy kind of went down when he went
out.  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, it changes our team. Obviously we've been a little bit
more successful when we've got a four-guard rotation for the majority of the
ACC play, and it changed us a little bit. Malik, I thought Malik came in and
did a good job, but certainly he got in foul trouble. But it definitely
changes you.  
  
Q. Kevin, what happened there at the end? What did you see, and what was
the explanation?  
KEVIN KEATTS: On which part?  
  
Q. On the technical.  
KEVIN KEATTS: Oh, you know, Markell Johnson got caught into a motion. The one
thing that we try to do as a staff is we try to tell them how many timeouts we
have and whose possession because we're always a trapping team, and if it's
our possession, then certainly we'll take a tie-up because we'll take a
possession. And he's not to blame on it. He made a play. I wanted him to get
to the hole with obviously seven seconds to go, and then obviously get back
into our defense and try to get a steal and quick foul, and he just got caught
up in the motion.  
  
I didn't see it, but I'm assuming that he called a time-out.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Louisville - 82, FSU - 74  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought in the first half Louisville did a great job
maintaining their poise and executing on the offensive end. They were
extremely patient, and they executed so well, and we had a hard time making
them miss, and even when the ball got down to -- the clock got down to the
last maybe eight or nine seconds of the shot clock, they always seemed to come
up with a big basket.  
  
We shot the ball very poorly the first half, but I thought our defense -- our
lack of offense gave them an exceptional number of long bounces, got out in
transition, and they were able to get a lot more points in transition than
what we had anticipated. I just thought they did a much better job of
executing and being who they were than we were.  
  
The second half, the last 15 minutes, I thought we played with a tremendous
amount of energy, but we had dug such a hole for ourselves at that point, it
was very difficult to overcome their outstanding execution and their ability
to make timely shots.  
  
I think they might have banked three shots in there as the clock was running
down, but that's what happens when you don't make a team miss, and they
absolutely were not going to miss any shots if we didn't do something
defensively to cause them to miss.  
  
Q. Just how do you bounce back from a game like this? Looks like you'll
be in the tournament. How do you come back?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, we don't have a lot of upper class leadership on this
team, so the ones that we have, Phil and Terance, are guys that are going to
have to give us a lot of leadership here. But we've had a tendency to bounce
back whenever we have come up a little short, and today I just think that we
played against a team that was really dialed in, tuned in, and we weren't
quite as sharp as we needed to be.  
  
But if we have an opportunity to go to the NCAA Tournament, I'm sure that
we'll play with a lot more sense of urgency to bounce back from what we
thought was a poor performance today.

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Jerome Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32044)

### [Ky Bowman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34260)

### [Steffon Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34824)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Boston College - 91, NC State - 87  
  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Just a tremendous game. 40-minute game, tremendous. I thought
that both teams played unbelievably hard, and I just thought the resilience,
the toughness, the mental toughness that we showed down the stretch when they
came back, huge step forward for our team, for our program. Couldn't be more
happy for these guys for these things that they've gone through. To have
moments like this makes it all worthwhile.  
  
Couldn't be prouder of a team. That was just a gutsy effort.  
  
Q. Jerome, you're from Raleigh. What does a win against NC State and
playing so well and hitting some big shots down the stretch mean to you in
moving forward throughout this tournament?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I think it's big for me. I think it's big for this
team, as well. We lost to them early in the year at NC State, and just to get
them back in the tournament definitely feels good.  
  
Q. Jim, just going into half, I'm sure you didn't have to say much about
how you had to play 40 minutes, but the way the game shook out, how proud are
you of the way they showed poise?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I mean, it's ridiculous. I knew they would come back. They're a
good basketball team. You talk about one of the top teams in the country, a
team that's going to go to the NCAA Tournament and win games, so again, when
they made a run at us, we've been in that situation now the last couple weeks
three times, and this is growth. This was growth. This was growth attacking
pressure. This was growth making free throws. This was growth with poise on
defense, and they still made some great plays. They made some big time shots
but then we responded, and that's what happens in great games.  
  
Q. Ky, they got even with you five times but weren't able to take the
lead. How important was it to not let them get ahead? And then also, could
both you and Jerome talk about the steal at the end on the inbound play?  
KY BOWMAN: Just that we knew we were going to have to handle the pressure and
we knew they were going to pick up the pressure in the second half. So that
was big for us. But also the steal Jerome had was the biggest play of the
night, just for us getting there and knowing that we had to have a smart play,
and that was a smart play.  
  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, the steal I knew they were going to try to get it to
11, and I tried to take it away, and then at the last second I jumped, I knew
I only had a second or two left, and I ended up getting a deflection off of
it, and I ended up tipping it over to Ky, so that was definitely a big play
for us towards the end.  
  
Q. Steff, just the number of rebounds you grabbed, there was one that
you grabbed before Jerome's dunk where you got two in a row and you were busy
roaring while Jerome was dunking and then you had to roar again. How excited
are you to take balls off the glass and give your man an extra opportunity?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I mean, we have to rebound by committee so it's not just one
guy. Steff was tremendous. The offensive rebounds he made were huge, just to
get us extra possessions, and that's what he does. He brings all the
intangible things that help you win games. And he's a freshman, so the moment
is not too big for him. He deserves it. He's worked unbelievably hard all year
long, and that's the kind of player he is, and those guys kind of feed off it.  
  
STEFFON MITCHELL: Yeah, I lost my voice during that game (laughter), but --
no, I just think when we get the ball -- I just like playing the game. If the
ball is up there I'm trying to get it and just throwing it out to my
teammates. So there it is.  
  
Q. Ky and Jerome, Coach mentioned things you've had to go through. Can
you kind of expand on that? What have been some of the tough times like at
Boston College?  
KY BOWMAN: Just being in games that we know we should have won last year, and
this year, just knowing that our team is a lot more better, and everybody
understands the role that they've got to play, so that plays in a lot this
year, and just the confidence we've been building off of from the home games
to the road games, it's just great for us.  
  
JEROME ROBINSON: Just going off of that, this is my third year here. In my
first two years we had two ACC wins, and we knew that was just a process. And,
I mean, I stuck with it, with Coach. It's hard for some people to see the
vision through a smoky mirror and just sticking to it, man, and we knew it was
going to pay off. And we just listened to Coach, and he had the vision. It
takes the right people to know and to stick with it, and I think that's what
we've done so far.  
  
Q. Jerome, what did you see on the play where you hit the big shot? What
were you trying to get accomplished there? It seemed like you had a screen and
decided to not necessarily use it.  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, so they were icing that ball screen and I was trying to
get around the big fella, and then by that time I got a little space, and I
had seen he was trying to cut me off and probably take a charge there, so just
pulled up for a mid-range. I can shoot the mid-range, so I was just getting to
my comfort spot and getting to a spot that I knew I could make a shot at.  
  
Q. Jim, how does the challenge shift towards Clemson, and what is the
unique challenge of beating them in a tournament setting?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, first, I said this yesterday, they need to start enjoying
these moments. They've had enough moments, I want these guys to enjoy this
moment and not worry about Clemson yet. We'll start worrying about Clemson as
a coaching staff.  
  
Nobody in the country has more respect for them than me. That's one of my
closest friends coaching their team. They're one of the top teams country for
a reason. They're so good defensively. They've got weapons all over the court.
But we just have to regroup and get fresh. That's our thing.  
  
Again, it's a great opportunity just to get an opportunity to play in this
game, to play in the quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament is a huge step
forward for us.  
  
Q. You guys played with a fearless aggression from the start; is that
something that you wanted your players to do, to go to the cup, and is there
an us-against-the-world mentality that you guys brought into this
tournament?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I don't know if it's us against the world. It's maybe us
believing in ourselves. It's maybe us taking that next step. This isn't new to
us. We were good all year long. We beat some really good teams and had some
opportunities to beat some others. I mean, right up until the last couple --
coming into this game, the last four games of the year were the best four
games we played, and we only won one of them, but I thought it was the best
four games we played. We just had some breakdowns. It got a little bit better
yesterday, and it got a lot better today.  
  
I'll tell you the hugest step forward for me, when we had the technical foul
at the end of the game, we had three guys that wanted to shoot the ball. Last
year we would have had five guys running the other way. Not five, these couple
guys would have wanted to shoot. But three guys wanted to go to the line. And
that's what it's all about for me, just confident basketball players, playing
on a big stage or wanting to make plays. That's beautiful. That's what
basketball to me is all about.  
  
Q. Jerome and Ky, outside of advancing to the quarterfinals and helping
your postseason resume, this has to have a little bit of special to it,
beating NC State, right?  
KY BOWMAN: As Coach was saying, just enjoying the moment. It felt good beating
a team from North Carolina, but also it felt good just to see another day in
the tournament.  
  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, we know it's another team, and we know it's another
step for us to move forward, so it's a good feeling to get the win and enjoy
the moment now, but we know we've got to prepare for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Clemson has been off since last Saturday. You guys have played a
couple games now. In your opinion, in this kind of format, is it easier for
you guys because you've played a couple games and got in that rhythm, or an
advantage for Clemson because they haven't?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Again, I coached in the MAC for six years. In order to get to
the tournament, you've got to win three games in a row. This is the third game
in a row. These guys, again, if the strategy is to wear them out, that's not a
good strategy, because I think if we wanted to play a double header today, I
think they'd go play again. This is March basketball. This is what it's about.
That's what these guys live for.  
  
We're going to get as much rest as we can; we have sports massage with us; we
have every medical thing we could have with us to us get ourselves ready, but
it's really more mental than anything else. Let's just get confident, let's
stay confident, and I'm sure they're excited to play. They're playing for a
lot of great things, and they've had a tremendous season. It's going to be an
unbelievable challenge, but we're going to have to step up and play with the
same kind of confidence we played with today.  
  
Q. These guys as your guards have been so amazing, they've created
opportunities for your bigs pretty much all year. When y'all lost to State,
your bigs didn't usually convert those, and today, I mean, Nik was 6 for 11
and Johncarlos was 5 for 5. Can you just describe that evolution and the
stick-to-itiveness because that's a pretty big contrast?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I think it's development. I think those guys are getting
better. I think those guys are getting more confident. Like I said, the last
two or three weeks, Niko has kind of slowed down around the basket. He's able
to finish plays and use his skills. And again, these guys are such weapons
that you have to make a choice, so when they collapse, it's either going to be
a kick-out to maybe Chatman or finish inside, and those guys are finishing
plays. It's what's made us better.  
  
Q. You called that Duke win a landmark moment for this program earlier
in the year. Multiple big wins for the program as a whole; what is this year
meaning for Boston College as a program?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I'll let you know when it's done. But again, we're proud -- I'm
proud of these guys. Like I said, they've been through so many things, and
it's good for these guys to have these moments because it's something to
revert back on. And again, we have no seniors. So a lot of these guys,
including Ky, is playing his first ACC Tournament here. So it's something to
build on, for our program to build on.  
  
But again, it's just confidence. We established who we are and what we're
trying to do. I'm more happy for them than anything else in the world. They
deserve every single thing that they're getting right now, the attention, the
accolades they got for during the year. All that stuff came through loyalty,
loyalty to the program, loyalty to BC, and never lost upon me, loyalty to me.  
  
Q. Two-part question for you: When Pop goes down, tell me what's going
through your mind, and then the way he came back and played down the
stretch?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, the way he hopped off the court, I knew he was coming
back. But again, he's a tough kid now, so if he's hurt. He's going to have to
be really hurt. So I thought J.C. came in and really -- he scored as soon as
he got in the game, which gave him confidence, did a great job with the
defensive game plan. And I think when Niko came back, it did uplift us and
then we were able to rotate those guys because both were playing well. We were
able to rotate them and keep them a little fresh, and that helped -- Yurtseven
is a hard guy to match up with down there, especially when he gets deep, and
they had such good shooters spread around him, it made it hard in the second
half.  
  
Q. I have a personal question for you: What's it like for you to do this
here given where you're from?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Special. It's special. First of all, it's the ACC Tournament.
It doesn't get much more special than that. I love the group of guys I'm here
with, but being from here, it makes it real special for me. Definitely not
lost upon me, no doubt about it.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Rex Pflueger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30854)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 71, Virginia Tech - 65  
  
MIKE BREY: Well, how about that one, huh? I've never been prouder of a group
because they were thumping us pretty good because they're really hard to
guard. But I thought in the second half, with the last 15 minutes, we got
better defensively, and we made some adjustments offensively and were able to
get scoring again.  
  
You know, it's a great group, man. They're just -- all the stuff they've been
through, they're such tough dudes. And tonight you saw it, the toughness of
hanging on in there. I don't know if I've ever been prouder of a team, in a
game that really matters.  
  
Q. Bonzie, I think it's fair to say you did not have a good first half;
what were you going through? How tired were you, and how did you feel in that
second half, especially at the end when you made some big plays?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I mean, give a lot of credit to Virginia Tech. They got
in front of me in the post, they made it hard for me to catch it, for me to go
work down there. But in the locker room, Coach Brey left it up to us. He told
us that we have to do our thing and we took it like grown men, and we came out
stronger and better in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously at the 15-minute mark, you guys were down 21. Can
you speak to having senior leadership on your team to not panic and have that
comeback?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, that's really been a key all year, too, in the midst of
losing seven in a row, in the midst of all the tough stuff that we've had
unbelievable senior leadership and a great class. They do the talking in the
huddles now. I don't really say a whole lot. I didn't say much at halftime. I
went in and said to them, y'all figure it out. They've had ownership of
themselves for a long time, and that really helps us in tough moments.  
  
Q. For the players, you're down 17 with 11 minutes to go. What changed
for you guys offensively and defensively in those last 11 minutes of the
game?  
MATT FARRELL: I think we really dug in defensively, and that helped us on the
offensive end. When we defend, we think we can be a very good team. TJ did a
great job because Coach kind of put me off the ball, and TJ was getting in the
lane and making plays for guys and guys were hitting shots. That felt like us
on the offensive end, but I think our defense was the thing that got us
together.  
  
REX PFLUEGER: Yeah, just to agree with Matt on that, I think TJ did a fabulous
job running the point, and everyone contributed on the offensive and defensive
end. And you've got to give credit to Austin Torres, he came in and gave us
that defensive edge that we were looking for. I think like they were saying,
the defense really translated over to the offensive end.  
  
Q. Bonzie, take us through the three-pointer that I know you definitely
called bank on there at the end.  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I mean, that felt good. Backboard is there for a reason.
My dad actually taught me it's your best front. I shot it and I looked it in,
and it went in. But you know, those are the shots that you've got to hit
during those times, and it felt good.  
  
Q. Matt, you guys had already cut the lead by 13, but on the technical
foul, that knocked you out of bounds, how did that play inspire you guys to
win the game?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think it kind of showed toughness. We've got to start
games like that. We've got to show toughness right away like that. But I think
for sure it shifted the momentum.  
  
Q. What would you credit to helping you get freed up in the second half
and be able to hit three of four shots after the struggles you had in the
first half?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, just keep staying locked in, staying composed with it
all. I know it's not going to be easy. We went small, we did some pick-and-
rolls and pick-and-pops and I think that got us going in the second half. TJ,
Matt, Torres, all these guys, Rex, gave us great movement off the ball. And we
have open shots, we shoot them with confidence, and that's what we did
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, can you elaborate on kind of the offensive and defensive
adjustments you made down the stretch?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I thought to put 50 up in the second half was certainly a
key. And, you know, one thing we did was get Matty off the ball, because they
were doubling, and he couldn't see over the big double teams. We got ball
screens early for TJ Gibbs and told him to just go downhill, and Matty played
off the ball and got some stuff, and that really kind of jump started us, and
then we did improve defensively. I thought we were moving and we rebounded
better.  
  
Q. There was obviously a lot of bracketology questions about what this
win meant for you. Where do you think you stand now and what's the
significance of the game tomorrow?  
MIKE BREY: You know, I've never been a big guy to campaign, but I think we
really deserve to be in. And I don't want to hear about one of the best 68.
When I have my guys back, we're a top-20 team, and I think people in that
committee know that. I feel strongly that we should be part of it. We have
another great opportunity to end all the drama of it tomorrow night, but we
need to get some rest.  
  
Q. Matt, at the end of the game, you and Bonzie embraced kind of mid
court and I saw you yelling something to each other. If you're willing to
share, what was that? And why was this so emotional obviously with everything
you've been through?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I don't think I could share some of the words that were
said, but just everything that we've gone through as a team and me and him
individually, spending four hours a day in the training room, just being with
each other 24/7, that meant a lot to us. Just everything we've gone through.
It was just a great win for us, and it was kind of emotional. And he's been a
brother to me for my four years here.  
  
Q. Rex, when you guys were down 21-19 and it was looking really bleak,
what was being said in the huddle, and do you think in the first half you
didn't have your legs or what was going on?  
REX PFLUEGER: We just don't really start off games better. That's something we
really need to improve on. But I think it's just that mentality when we went
into halftime and we were talking about how this could be our last game of the
season. I think everyone really took that to heart. And when we came out
there, everybody just dug deep.  
  
In those time-outs Coach does a great job with us. He says the right things
all the time, but when he hears us say some good things, he lets us talk and
communicate, and that leads to us playing well together on the floor, as well.  
  
Q. Bonzie, what is it about the ACC Tournament where it just brings out
a different part of your game? Last year you dominated; tonight obviously you
hit the shots that you needed to hit at the end of the game.  
BONZIE COLSON: You know, this is a time when we've gone up and we've watched a
lot of games where it's tournament play. For us to be here as a group, it's
something that we all dream of. But all the hard work that we've worked, in
the summer and in the fall to get here, it's something special. So you have to
give it your all. You can't take this game for granted. You have to give it
your all. Throughout the tough times we stayed together, throughout the
adversity we stayed together, so it kind of shows our character and who we are
as a group.  
  
Q. Bonzie, it's kind of a hard question because it seemed like all the
shots were short in the first half, but it seemed like you had a little bit
more to your game at the end. Can you sort of describe to us where you are in
terms of conditioning and how close you are to being the guy who you were
before you got hurt?  
BONZIE COLSON: You know, I'm feeling good out there. I think how they played
me earlier in the game it was tough to find open spots on the offensive end.
Coach Brey did a great job, and us as a group to adjusting to that in the
second half. You've still got to keep looking your shots in. My teammates give
me all the confidence to tell me to keep shooting the ball, to keep looking
them in, and that gives me confidence, obviously. Just keep plugging in, being
a leader you have to step up. These are times where you've got to show your
leadership. You've got to make big plays, and Matt and I and the group, we had
to show that today.  
  
Q. Mike, you all lost to Duke January 29th, but you didn't have Bonzie
and Matt. What can we expect from that game? And then if you all could talk
about what it was like to watch on the sidelines, without you guys, your team
lose to Duke?  
MIKE BREY: Well, I talked to them after the game last night, the Pittsburgh
game, saying I'm excited to play Virginia Tech with you two back because we
didn't have you guys against Virginia Tech. For a while there, we looked worse
with those two guys back, but we salvaged it.  
  
But one thing, these guys wanted to play, and play in Cameron and play against
Duke and they couldn't. So they're excited and we're excited for an
unbelievable challenge. Duke is playing really well right now.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, it was tough to watch. It was tough to watch all the games
we weren't playing in. With how close we are as a team and what we've gone
through, it obviously wasn't easy to watch. But we tried to stay together. And
we went down by 20-something. And there's three things you can control:
Effort, attitude and energy, and that's what they did, and we got a shot. We
got a shot back at them tomorrow.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I agree. Obviously it was tough to go through something
like that, but as leaders you've still got to be a vocal leader out there if
you're not playing, and we did that. You've just got to ask the guys to give
it your all and empty the tank. That's all you can ask the group, and we did
that. And obviously it's going to be a little different game with Matt and
myself playing, and it's going to be another opportunity for us, and we're
excited about it.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Tyus Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34258)

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Frank Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34259)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 78, Syracuse - 59  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, I thought that we -- we have trouble -- Carolina has
really played good defense against us in the two games. I thought in Syracuse
we handled it a little bit better. But I thought their defense was really good
half court, and we just really couldn't get any penetration against them. You
know, we had some opportunities -- this team has fought as hard as any team
I've ever coached. I think there was a time there where with 10 minutes to go,
we were down about 18 or 19, they just dug in and got it all the way back to
nine, and they fought as hard as you can ask a team. We're a little limited.
Obviously seven guys, it's tough to play as many games as we've had to play in
the last really two weeks. But very proud of what they've done. They've really
worked hard through it.  
  
I thought we had some opportunities, and when it got back, we had a couple
pretty good looks. When we got it to nine, we just didn't capitalize. These
guys fought as hard as you could ask them to fight, and I'm very proud of this
team.  
  
Q. Jim, do you think this is a tournament team? Have they earned a
bid?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Every coach in the country thinks this team is a tournament team.
Anybody that's anywhere near -- as I said yesterday, we've got the best
strength of schedule we've had in years. I think 15, 20, something like that,
both non-conference and conference. Our RPI was, what, 42 going into today.
With that RPI and that strength of schedule, that's pretty good.  
  
Last year we didn't win road games. We won at Miami, won at Louisville, won
four or five road games. It'll be close. I mean, there's a lot of teams. It
just depends what the committee decides, how they decide things. There's a
whole group of teams that -- some that's almost a coin flip.  
  
This team I think has played very well. I think we're competitive with
anybody. We'll see what they decide.  
  
Q. Frank and Tyus, how difficult was it to get to the rim tonight?  
FRANK HOWARD: They did a great job of flooding the paint and staying in front
of us. You know, they're a great defensive team. They play the ball screen
very well, and yeah, just made it difficult for us.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Just like Frank said, they played the ball screen well. They made
it tough getting to the basket. They were setting us up trying to take charges
and stuff like that, so they played us well.  
  
Q. Obviously a four-day stretch before Selection Sunday. What do you
plan to do over the next four days, and where will you be watching?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We practice and watch it in the practice facility on Sunday, but
we'll take a couple days and do some stuff Friday or Saturday and Sunday and
see what happens. We're going to play next week. We'll be ready.  
  
Q. Jim, despite the injuries and departures as a young team, what do you
think allowed you to be in play for a tournament spot this year?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Like I said at the beginning, this team is -- has really battled
all year. We had a stretch, we lost some games and we had to go to Louisville,
which was obviously a tough place to play and a very good basketball team, and
we won there. And then we had another stretch that we went to Miami, and we
were able to get a win there. You know, we played North Carolina, North
Carolina State, tie game played. We couldn't make a play. But we had those
opportunities, and we had a couple other opportunities early in the year. But
these guys have hung in there. It's very -- you can play 40 minutes but not
when you play Wednesday-Saturday-Wednesday-Saturday-Tuesday-Wednesday. That's
just too much. We've had the last part -- just not enough rest days in
between. It's not just the 40 minutes, but when you're -- when you have to
make plays off the dribble, which we really have to do, it takes an extra toll
on you.  
  
But like I said, these guys, considering everything, I think they've done
everything we could ask them to do. I can't fault anything that this group has
done.  
  
Q. Jim, Oshae didn't seem to have his best yesterday, passed up some
open threes, and tonight he made five. Was there anything you saw that played
into that?  
JIM BOEHEIM: No, he shot the ball from the three-point line the last half,
three quarters of the year. He's our best three-point shooters. He started out
slow, but he shot it well. He kept us in there a little bit tonight with it,
but he's had a great freshman year.  
  
At the end of the day, we're playing four freshmen and a front line and one
junior who has never played a whole season. So to do what they've done, the
front-line guys, I just can't say enough about what they've done this year,
how they've played, how they've competed. And then these two guys -- you can
play a lot of minutes, but you need a little bit of a break. The problem with
playing a lot of minutes the way we're playing is that these guys have to
really do it off the dribble. We just don't have a post game. We've got four
perimeter guys and a big guy that's getting better defensively, but he's not a
factor on the offensive end.  
  
But I think that both our big guys are getting better. Bourama has been hurt.
His knee is bothering him. When he gets going, he's a good player. I think he
can get his knee fixed pretty easily. It's not a big fix. And I think he'll be
fully healthy next year, and we'll have a couple guys that come in that give
us some depth that we need.  
  
You know, when you're coaching a team and you have six guys, you say during
the year that's enough, but you're never going to -- I'm never going to say,
well, we don't have enough, or I'm never going to say these guys can't play 40
minutes, because for us to get where we are now, three guys had to play 40
minutes every game.  
  
Q. Jim, what made North Carolina so effective inside today, and how did
you try to counter that?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, they're very good inside. They're a very good passing team.
They've got guys that can finish around the basket. We've guarded them pretty
well on the three-point line in the two games. We just haven't been able to do
anything inside. Paschal getting in foul trouble is not a good thing. That's
just the way the game went.  
  
The first play was a bad start. I thought we got a good block, and it was a
foul. But him out is not good for our inside defense. You know, some of that's
just learning -- he's learning the game.  
  
But our front-line guys, you know, they're playing against guys that won the
National Championship, guys that are very smart players, interior passers, and
very good offensive players.  
  
But in this game we had to be able to score more than we did, and we weren't
able to do that. You have to give Carolina credit for that, as well.  
  
Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2018

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

### [Marcus Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34811)

### [Jared Wilson-Frame](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34812)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 67, Pitt - 64.  
  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I thought it was a good basketball game. I thought our guys
played very, very well, particularly in the second half. Obviously the
difference was our inability to keep them off the foul line. And to hold them
to four field goals in the second half is a tremendous accomplishment for our
group defensively. And as our defense continued to play better, our offense
started to get better.  
  
But I've really admired my team all season long, to fight through the
adversity that we've had and the results that we've had, and to see that they
still have this kind of fight in them is inspiring to me and very impressive.
We're disappointed with the outcome of the game. I'm certainly not
disappointed in the effort or the performance of my players, though.  
  
Q. Kevin, I know your season just ended, but what kind of concern do you
have about your job status considering the way this year went and all the
speculation kind of at the end of the year?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I don't have a whole lot of concern because I don't -- I try
not to worry about things I can't control, and that's not in my control. I
don't -- I worry about these guys. That's what I spend my time worrying about.  
  
Q. Kevin, the team that you saw today and with the way that they played,
how closely did it resemble the team you believe that they can consistently be
capable of being?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: Are you talking about next year?  
  
Q. Even just throughout this year, too, the team that you saw today, how
closely did it resemble the team that they could have been this year on a
consistent basis?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I think that the team that I saw today was a team that
continued to progress and continued to play hard and practice hard and be
coachable, and I think as a result of that, it allowed us to play the way that
we played today.  
  
We had some inconsistencies. We had some inconsistencies in the game today.
Honestly, we got the game kind of right where we needed it and we had a
possession where we could tie it. We took a shot that wasn't great and then we
fouled a guy on the rebound that's a 90 percent foul shooter 90 feet from the
basket. So now all of a sudden instead of being three points, it's five
points. And again, that's just the kind of mistakes that you don't want to
make when it's in that situation.  
  
But I just felt like our team continued to work and continued to try to
improve, and that's why it enabled us to play well like we did today.  
  
Q. You were in a ton of games this year, a lot of them came down to the
wire like today. How much hope does that give you guys for next year and the
years to come?  
MARCUS CARR: I think it speaks to just kind of like Coach was saying, our
progress throughout the year. We just kept getting better and found ourselves
in positions multiple times to win games. For next year, it's definitely a
learning experience for us, so whenever these games arise next year, we know
that we've been through something like this before and we can kind of use what
we learned from the previous experiences to get the job done.  
  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: Like Marcus said, just piggy-backing off what he said, we
made a lot of baby steps this year and a lot of close games, putting ourselves
in opportunities to win the games, and I think building on next year with the
guys we have in our coaching staff, we can take big steps and learn how to,
like Marcus said, just get the job done when we're put in those adverse
situations again.  
  
Q. We've spoken with you the past couple weeks about your job status and
you've mentioned how it's a decision that's ultimately out of your control.
What do you anticipate coming in the next couple days as far as conversations
with your bosses, and do you believe you'll be back?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I have not the slightest idea. I have not the slightest idea.
And I have not the slightest idea what to expect. I know about as much as you
do.  
  
Q. Jared, I saw you calling a couple huddles with your team throughout
the game. What were you trying to emphasize with them on the court throughout
the course of it?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: Just the same thing that I tell them every game when we
huddle up: Just keep fighting. Just keep fighting. Pick your head up. Just
play harder. Little things that I see in the game, if we missed a box-out here
or there, just things like that, just trying to keep everybody on the same
page so we can play as a unit.  
  
Q. Jared and Marcus both, this has obviously been a difficult season,
but when you guys look back on it now and even years from now, what do you
think that you'll see where you kind of look at it and see as maybe a
highlight or a point of consolation?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: You know, just like I said before, we just learned a lot
of things this year. Just learned multiple situations. It being my first year,
along with a lot of the young guys, our first year playing at this level, you
learn a lot of new things. Things that you think you knew might seem a little
different when you watch it from home. So I think things like that are a lot
of things we picked up, and I think going forward and looking back on this
season, it'll just be something to build on, a learning experience, so that
when you're put in a situation again, you can overcome them.  
  
Q. How much would you say the loss of Ryan contributed to ultimately
what became a winless ACC season?  
MARCUS CARR: Ryan was definitely a key piece to our team. Anybody who's seen
us play before since the beginning of the season knows he's a great player who
pretty much does everything, is steady, and does everything on the court for
us. The loss of him was definitely pretty big and definitely affected our
team, but he continued to be at practice with us and trying to help us grow as
a team without him so that we could play our best without him. But looking
forward to next year, I can't wait to have him back, and I'm excited for what
next year could be.  
  
KEVIN STALLINGS: You know, I think that -- well, I don't have a crystal ball,
but I firmly believe that we would not have gone winless with Ryan on our
team. I think that there were a few wins in there that we would have had with
his presence, and not only do you lose your experience and your go-to guy and
a guy that's averaging a double-double, but you also lose the guy that
everybody generates their confidence in when he's on the court.  
  
We were kind of up against it, and these guys did a tremendous job of battling
and doing the best. I think that's why we all have good feelings about what
might be next year.  
  
Q. Kevin, do you feel like you have to sell your bosses on your vision
in order to come back next year?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I doubt it. And I think they know what my vision is. I think
that's already been communicated. I doubt if that really is something that
plays into it.  
  
But again, I could be wrong. I don't know. We've recruited great kids and guys
of great character, and we had to turn over an entire roster. We knew this was
going to be a little bit of a tough season. We didn't know it would be this
tough. We didn't know we would lose Ryan. But it is what it is.  
  
I'm certainly not ashamed of it or apologetic for it. I'm proud of these guys.
I'm proud of their character and their efforts and who they are as human
beings and what they've done in the classroom and what they've done in the
community and all the great things that they've done that don't show up in a
final score during a game or after a game.  
  
Again, I don't really know how to answer the question. But I'm sure
comfortable with how we coached this group and how they responded to us and
how we all held together and supported each other. The one thing I don't have
any question about is they've got my back, so that -- and I think they know
that I've got theirs. That's all you can hope for over the course of a season
is your team to fight their butts off for you and you fight yours off for
them, and whatever happens happens.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2018

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Ben Lammers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34261)

### [Tadric Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34809)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Boston College - 87, Georgia Tech - 77.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Okay, give Boston College credit. You know, they made some
plays, and we just unfortunately just didn't shoot the ball well enough,
missed some key free throws. We had four turnovers the first half, and we took
care of the ball, but we had some chances where we could just -- couldn't get
over the hump. Missed a couple front ends of one-on-ones and had a couple rim
out on us. We did a good job guarding the three against Boston College, but we
didn't make our shots.  
  
And then nine turnovers the second half.  
  
We made a great run late. That's kind of like the microcosm of our team this
entire year where they just have fought and competed, and every step of the
way, every second of the way, we've dug ourselves into holes, and we find
ourselves to keep competing and fighting and never giving up. That's who we've
been all year long, it's just we've been one of those teams that we dig
ourselves into a hole, and then when we get ourselves into a hole, we fight
our way out of it, we just don't -- the hole is sometimes a little bit too
deep.  
  
I'm proud of these two young men to my left here in Ben Lammers and Tadric
Jackson, who great seniors who have given everything that they've had to
Georgia Tech. Ben Lammers is a mechanical engineer, and Tadric Jackson is
going to graduate with business in the spring. Both are going to have great
careers both on and off the floor moving forward. We've got a really good
nucleus coming back. They've got great time and experience, especially with
all the injuries, it's allowed some guys to really get playing time and
experience for them that maybe they would not have gotten, and we have a good
recruiting class coming in.  
  
We're excited for the long-term and especially for the off-season, summer and
the fall.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the fifth foul and also it seemed like you
had all the momentum in the game and had a chance to really cut it down
there.  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, I mean, look, I think the ACC officials are the best in
the country. They do a great job, and I think Brian Kersey and his whole
entire crew is excellent. Of course there's going to be times throughout the
way you're going to disagree with a call here and there, but in the end, you
know, I think the officiating in the ACC for the entire year has been
excellent, and I've said that many times before. That's a credit to the league
and the conference.  
  
Yeah, there's going to be times we disagree with a call, but in the end, we
just dug ourselves in a little bit too deep of a hole.  
  
Q. Ben, Boston College talked about how you were the focus of their
defense basically in preparation; could you feel the difficulty of getting to
a spot and sort of being pushed out on the coverage?  
BEN LAMMERS: I mean, I could kind of tell that they were trying to focus on me
or at least like trying to bump me out when they could, but since like five or
six games ago, we made a lot of effort focusing on like me getting in the
right position, especially on our offense where I'm at the high post. I
noticed it a little bit, but it didn't really affect me too much.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk a little bit about Okogie's struggles today?
Seemed like he was just off all around on defense and on offense.  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, unfortunately he was really good last week defensively. He
was really good, and then today he just wasn't really good either side of the
ball. You know, he's just had a tough game today, and because of our lack of
depth, and I've said this, in the part of the rebuild, we've got to get old
and stay old and get to a point where we've got about eight surefire upper
tier ACC type of guys. When you have a guy who's off and/or injured, next man
up is upper tier ACC level. And that's just part of the plan of through
recruiting we've got to get it done.  
  
So a guy like today where Josh struggled because of our lack of depth at that
spot, it just made it tough, and you're going to roll with him, and he just
never could get out of kind of that funk he was in. Look, he was third-team
all league, he's had a great sophomore campaign. I said before he played a
game here, I said he was going to be an all league guy by his junior year, so
he's moved it up a year. He's going to be a key focal point for us to do what
we need to do next year and he's going to be an important part of that
obviously and I think he'll be a great leader for us and continue to improve.  
  
Q. I'm curious about Ben. In the first half, did you feel like there was
more you could have done to get him the ball?  
JOSH PASTNER: Well, we were talking about it in the time-outs, and we wanted
to get Ben the ball more. He got to the free-throw line. They did foul him,
and he got to the line 12 times. But part of it, Josh had some good looks,
Tadric had a couple really good looks, and then we swung the ball to Moses a
couple times and he had some great looks, we just missed some shots and they
stayed clamped down and tight on Ben. It's a shooter's game. You've got to
make some shots. The more shots you make, it's going to open some things, and
we've got to get shooting through recruiting to be able to shoot the ball. I
mean, that's such a big part for us, especially the way we play offensively
with some of the cutting that we do and our spacing.  
  
Last year we weren't a good three-point shooting team, and this year we
haven't been. So we've got to increase that through recruiting, recruiting
guys who can really fill it up from the three.  
  
Q. Tadric, after today and overall, how did you feel about the way the
season panned out for you guys? I know injuries were a struggle.  
TADRIC JACKSON: I mean, of course you're going to be down. It's not where we
wanted to be. To lose the first round, and could have had a chance to win, it
just hurt, just deep down. To sit here and say it'll be all right, but it's
not, but at the end of the day, you've got to just keep moving on with life
and just keep getting better.  
  
Q. Tadric, it seemed like you kind of willed the team back into the game
there in that late stretch. Was there something -- was that just kind of the
mentality this could be your last game and you wanted to kind of spark them to
do something?  
TADRIC JACKSON: No, it just started from getting stops. Once we started
getting turnovers. It wasn't all me. It was definitely a team effort. Getting
deflections and stops and turnovers there just gave us a better chance to run
the break and get a score.  
  
Q. Josh, did you give any thought, particularly with the way Moses was
struggling to getting Abdoulaye in the game earlier?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, you know, Moses had six boards the first half. And Moses
is going to be really good for us, as is Evan, and as is A.D. A.D. got great
experience this year and it's going to bode well for him next year. But I
wanted to kind of see if Moses could get out of it because he was rebounding,
he was guarding, it was just the offensive issue. And I felt with A.D. in
there, shooting-wise he's not much better than Moses, and so -- but I felt the
experience and the way Moses was going on the glass, as in terms of him
playing hard, and I thought that was a good sign for him and us, and hopefully
this experience will pay dividends for us and for him next season.  
  
Q. How much has not having a point guard affected your ability to play
A.D. and Ben together? It seems like that's kind of why --  
JOSH PASTNER: It's a recipe for disaster to play in the ACC without a point
guard. The good news is we've got José coming back after his injury. We signed
a kid Michael Devoe. So we'll have two on the roster. We'll end up maybe even
-- you can always slide Josh as a third option at the point spot and then
possibly we'll see what we can sign in the spring if there's a need on that.  
  
But recipe for disaster to play in the ACC without a true point. But that's
what happened when Jose went down versus Duke. It was kind of like our eighth
team during one season trying to adjust with the guys. But they've adjusted,
and Tadric has done a nice job over the last few weeks running the point. I
know that's not his natural position, but he's taken a load of it and has
handled it well, and we won two great games last week, and part of that was
the way Tadric ran the point.  
  
Q. For Ben and Tadric, can you talk about this being your last game at
Georgia Tech, kind of what your emotions are like right now?  
BEN LAMMERS: Obviously it's very sad knowing that this is the last game I'll
be able to play for Georgia Tech. I've had a great time playing for the
school. They've been nothing but amazing to both of us. I wish I could maybe
have a few more years to represent Georgia Tech.  
  
TADRIC JACKSON: Yeah, just going to piggy back on what Ben said. Any seniors
don't want to end off with a game like this on their first day, and obviously
you want to keep winning and stay out here on the road and try to extend it as
long as you can. But it's just a -- we've both just got to move on to our
careers. And I just want to thank the coaching staff and all the players and
the organization and Georgia Tech for me having this opportunity.  
  
Q. The start of the second half, you had some stops, and it seemed like
they were kind of opening a door for you but you weren't able to walk
through.  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, we got stops. We were guarded, and we just couldn't score.
We had some good looks -- we had some great looks and just couldn't make some
shots there and had some opportunities we just didn't take advantage of. You
know, it's been one of those years where the ball just hasn't bounced our way.
In that type of segment there when that door was open, we just didn't take
advantage of it and score the ball there, but we did get some stops and just
didn't make it happen.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2018

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Syracuse - 73, Wake Forest - 64  
  
DANNY MANNING: Well, obviously we didn't play well enough to win. I thought
there were a couple spurts or a few spurts throughout the course of the
ballgame that we went on that gave us life and gave us a chance to get back in
it, but we could never get over the hump. Late in the game, we gave up too
many dribble drive opportunities, and they were able to throw the ball over
the top for lobs, and we couldn't get back into the ballgame.  
  
Q. Bryant, they kind of knocked you back the first eight, ten minutes of
the game. What happened, was it nerves? Did they just kind of hit you with
something you weren't expecting?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Yeah, we came out flat. They came out with way more energy
than us, and they were hitting shots. We were trying to match their shots with
jump shots, which is something that they wanted us to shoot, and when we
started to get it into the paint and get lay-ups or found open shooters, then
things started going in our favor.  
  
Q. Danny, last year you guys were a fairly successful team. This year
obviously your season just ended. Why do you think things changed so
dramatically in the course of a year?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, obviously you don't have the same team each year. Just a
different team. You know, we lose a couple guys that are doing fairly well at
the professional level right now that were underclassmen, and when we started
out the season, we didn't get off to a good start, and we battled back. We had
a little winning streak at the beginning of the season, and then we got to
conference play, and we couldn't get over the hump in quite a few ballgames.
We put ourselves in situations to have some success. In most of those games in
league play we had the lead at some point in the second half, we just weren't
able to finish ballgames.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact that Marek had, and obviously it's a
surprise, but when you're focusing on their big three, how does he change
Syracuse when he's being so aggressive?  
DANNY MANNING: That was the scouting report. We know three guys that you try
to take away, and that's what we tried to do. He found himself -- he did a
very good job of finding open areas and getting to the rim. I know one time he
kept an offensive rebound alive and did some good things in that regard.  
  
Q. Syracuse is going to be a team on the bubble of the tournament.
You've seen them three times this year. What do you make of them as a team?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, obviously I think they have what I consider their big
three, very talented basketball players, and that's no disrespect to any of
the other guys on the team, but those three guys do the majority, I think 72
percent of their scoring. And so those guys are as talented as they come, and
those other guys do a good job of fill-in roles. I think they're a talented
team, and I think hopefully for our league, we get as many teams in and
possible, and I definitely think they're a team that their name should be
called.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about kind of the learning curve this year? You're
having to play a lot of guards, play a young lineup, undersized, particularly
in this game it kind of showed a lot of times in your match-ups. Can you talk
about how that's going to pay dividends down the road for you?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, we hope it does, but part of that tonight was I didn't
think our bigs rebounded the ball well enough. Our leading rebounder came in
off the bench for us. So our bigs have to have more of a presence on the
glass, rebounding the basketball. And we played that four-guard lineup quite a
bit throughout the course of the year. You know, it gave us a chance to go on
some runs and win some games and get back into some ballgames, as well.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2018

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Nik Popovic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34810)

### [Ky Bowman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34260)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Boston College - 87, Georgia Tech - 77  
  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I was really proud with our defensive effort today. I thought
for 40 minutes, maybe up until the last two minutes, one of our better
defensive efforts. Guys were locked in on the game plan, really making it
difficult for them to get to the basket. And then obviously offensively, if we
can go 2 for 14 from three and win the game, we played a really good floor
game today. That's what gave us a chance. That's usually not our MO, so I know
we'll shoot the ball better in this tournament, and we're happy to move on.
We're lucky enough to play another day.  
  
Q. Ky, we all know how this ended for you last year, but I never asked
you, how much did that drive you to get back here this year?  
KY BOWMAN: I knew my opportunity was going to come around again, so just being
able to come here again and play again was a great feeling for me, but being
able to get back on the court with my teammates was even better.  
  
Q. At the same time, can you just talk about the number of ways he
impacted this game, whether it was with his play making at the end of the
first half, the and-ones in the middle of the second half, and even with eight
turnovers?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Yeah, the turnovers sometimes, they're just plays he's just
going to grow from, but he's got the ball a lot, so we depend on him to do a
lot of things. It's running our offense, it's being the point of our defense,
it's rebounding the basketball, leading the break. The one thing we did our
guards rebounded the ball again today and we were able to get out and run.
When we're able to get out and run we can make plays on the break and that's
the difference with our team. We have to get stops, we have to rebound, and
then we have to attack. And when we get another guy, an additional guy to
Jordan, Ky and Jerome, today Niko played phenomenal, maybe the best game he's
played since he's been here. When we can get that other guy to step up, we
become a really good team.  
  
Q. Nik, what has happened with your game over the last month? You've
become so much more efficient. What has changed for you?  
NIK POPOVIC: My guards, like my teammates find a way to feed me all the time.
Sometimes it's like I waste balls sometimes. Not this game I didn't. So I do a
good job recognizing when I have a good day, and they open up shots for me.  
  
Q. I know the game just ended, but you play NC State tomorrow, a team
that plays up tempo and very fast. Do you think getting this win helps you
today? Do you think that might hurt that you have to play two games back to
back like that?  
KY BOWMAN: I think with us playing today, it just builds off of this. We can
just build confidence going into the next game. It's just going to help us.
Our strategy to win the next game should be higher.  
  
NIK POPOVIC: Yeah, definitely. We know the weaknesses from the last game, so
it should be better this time.  
  
Q. You talked about this was one of your better defensive performances.
Georgia Tech started out 2 of 10 but 0 of 5 from three-point land. Did you try
to force them outside of the arc?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: No, we just do what we always do, and just be aware of certain
guys. I think it was more important for us to take away the drives and some of
their basket cuts than it was to -- if they're going to beat us from three,
they're going to beat us from three. But it changes every night who you play,
and you can't just play one way in this league, the teams are too good. And
they adjusted and they attacked us I thought in the second half much better
than they did in the first half. Then we had to execute on the offensive end,
which I thought we did until maybe the last two minutes where we had a couple
mistakes against the pressure. I thought we executed very well all day.  
  
Q. Jim, you guys were up by 19 with about six and a half minutes to go.
What happened at that point? Did they just turn it on or did you guys get a
little sloppy?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I think it was both. I thought we stopped guarding, and we
started giving up lay-ups. If you give up lay-ups they're going to get back in
the game. We made a couple mistakes turnover wise, but it happens. Guys will
just keep playing. It's going to be like that the whole way. They're not going
to go down easily in March, nobody is. So it's really not one way or the
other, it's a combination really.  
  
Q. Did you ever feel like the lead was threatened or did you feel like
you still had it under control all the way?  
KY BOWMAN: I felt like we still had it under control. They were picking up
pressure. We know in the ACC tournament everybody is going to make a good run,
so they made a good run on us so we just had to bounce back from it.  
  
Q. Ky, you seemed very free, loose, play making out there today. Why
were you able to be so successful?  
KY BOWMAN: Just last year this opportunity I had, I wasn't able to play the
second half with my team, so this year was even a better feeling for me to get
out there and play a game with my teammates.  
  
Q. About 24 hours until you tip off again. What is that preparation like
moving forward?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: My preparation probably begins in about 20 seconds. Their
preparation doesn't begin until we meet with them later -- get off their legs,
rest, enjoy this win, until we meet and talk about NC State. But this is an
important time to enjoy. I want these guys to enjoy it, and then we'll start
getting ready right away. We've already played them once. We know a lot of
stuff that they do. We know how they're going to attack us in certain ways,
and we'll be prepared and ready to go, but really it's about rest right now.  
  
Q. Given the way that Ben Lammers finished the season playing a little
healthier, and also the way he played against you, were you braced for a full
dose of him?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, if you looked at how he played coming down the stretch at
the last five games, he got back to maybe the way he was at the old. They
played him at the 5 a lot more where he's a little more comfortable. And he's
a huge piece, so he was a real big focal point of ours. It was the majority of
our preparation in this game was to try to take him off certain spots of the
floor. He's so effective and such a good player. That was really the focal
point of our preparation in playing them.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about just the importance of you guys wanting
to make a run in this tournament. This is obviously the first step, but it's a
big one.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: It's always the hardest step. The first game is always the
hardest to play. Kids are excited. They're a little bit nervous in a good way
because for the first time we're actually trying to win games. They're
fighting for their season, as was Georgia Tech. It's rewarding for everybody
that we're fortunate enough to play the next night, or afternoon.  
  
Q. Nik, Ben Lammers has played 40 minutes. As a big guy, can you kind of
appreciate that sort of effort that goes into playing that many minutes?  
NIK POPOVIC: I mean, yes, and I certainly know that he didn't play his best
game, because I played him before, and I know this wasn't his best game for
sure. I mean, he played 40 minutes, and that was a lot. I mean, even it's a
lot for me, so I don't know how he handled playing a 40-minute game.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2018

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 67, Pitt - 64  
  
MIKE BREY: We are thrilled to escape, and that's kind of what you expect in
tournament play, that they're all going to be tough. I thought our defense was
a key, and we obviously really got to the foul line and made free throws to
escape Pittsburgh, who I thought really played very well in the second half.
So we are thrilled that we live to fight another day.  
  
Q. Congrats on win 500. Did it seem a little bit more pressurized than
you expected?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, and I fought the whole time. I just thought it was going to
be hard. You know what, everything has been hard for this team, everything.
You know, even Matt Farrell said when we came in the locker room, said
everything has been a grind for us the whole year. I'm glad -- I kind of liked
that we had some game pressure on us and had to make some decisions because I
have a feeling we're going to be in that situation tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bonzie, how does the foot feel, and how has the last couple days been
getting ready to play?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I mean, the foot is healed. It's fine. I did everything I
can through the time I was hurt to get it ready as soon as possible. And it
feels good to be back out there, and feeling good. And today we knew it was
going to be a grind. We knew it was going to come down to game situations, and
we've been through a lot of those this year.  
  
It's good to get that first win.  
  
Q. No minutes restrictions?  
MIKE BREY: No, he's ready to roll. Hey, I'm going to get my money's worth out
of his eligibility. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Mike, looking ahead to the Virginia Tech game tomorrow, what you need
to do differently or better than the first meeting, and how completely
different a game is this going to be, because obviously you did not have
either one of these guys for the last meeting.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I mentioned that in the locker room. I thought we played our
hearts out at our place without those two guys. It's great to have them back.
But Virginia Tech is really hard to defend, and we're going to have to be good
offensively tomorrow because you're just not going to stop them. I really have
a lot of respect for them, and it's a great challenge for us the way they
spread you out with guards and the way they shoot the ball.  
  
Q. For the players, it would be easy to look past a team like Pitt today
coming into the game with their record. Do you feel like that happened at all,
and were you surprised to be in a game that was as close as it was down the
stretch?  
MATT FARRELL: No, they shoot the ball from three very well. If they were
making shots, we knew we were going to be in a tough game. And looking at the
stats, we were 5 for 19 from three, so we didn't really play the way we wanted
to offensively, but we defended well enough to win, which is a really good
sign for us. And if we want to go far in this tournament, we've got to defend.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Like Matt said, we knew a lot of their shots were three-
pointers, so we tried our best to guard that, and we've got to be a little bit
better on the offensive end and just getting good shots every time, but it was
good to get the first win.  
  
Q. Mike, how big of a part was you guys getting in the bonus early in
that second half?  
MIKE BREY: That was the difference in the game, that we got to the bonus
quick. We got to the double bonus quicker than we've gotten to it all year,
and we're really good from the line, and it's a great weapon for us. We tried
to emphasize driving the ball more as we got ready for up here, and so you do
pick up some more fouls. But it won the game for us, our free throw -- getting
there and then making them.  
  
Q. Matt, Coach mentioned when you went into the locker room, you talked
about how this whole season has been a grind. How has this whole season with
injuries and everything prepared you and prepared this whole team for March
and what it brings?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, we feel we've come through more adversity than anybody in
the country, but our guys have fought hard all year, and I think it's made us
mentally tough. We know a lot of games down here are going to come down to
game situations just like today, and that's things we practice, so we just
need to stay calm and do what we do. But it's been a tough year, but we've had
a lot of success here, so we're excited.  
  
Q. For the players, do you feel any pressure going into tomorrow
thinking, okay, well, we probably need to win another game to impress the
tournament selection committee?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, that's not what we're focusing on, the future. We're
focusing on getting a win tomorrow and doing what we have to do to get the
win. We've still got to stick with our habits on both sides of the floor and
do what we do, share the ball, defend and get stops. But yeah, the future will
happen with the tournament. That's not what we're focusing on right now.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yep, he said it. We're focused on winning this. That's all that
matters right now.  
  
Q. 7-1 in Brooklyn here all-time including the two games in the
tournament a couple years ago and the ACC run here last year. How confident
did you feel about making a run here knowing your success in this building?  
MIKE BREY: Well, I reminded them a lot as we prepared for Brooklyn that we
have been really good in this building and we're very comfortable in this
building and we believe in this building. I think that was our eighth win in
this building today.  
  
I think it really helps us. It helps us that we got all the way to Saturday
night last year, and this group experienced a deep run.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I think we're really good and confident in this building,
and we know we've had a lot of wins. And we like that city life, get away from
South Bend a little bit, so I think that helps a little bit. Having our family
come down to support, a lot of us are from the East Coast, so that's good, as
well. We feed off the energy, and we've just got to keep doing us.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, we definitely enjoy being here, that's for sure. It's nice
to get away from South Bend for a little bit and be here in the city, so it's
fun.  
  
MIKE BREY: These guys are killing my recruiting. (Laughter).  
  
Q. For the players, Mike getting his 500th win. Do you think he can
catch Krzyzewski?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, he's a great coach. He gives a lot of his guys
confidence, and he lets his players go out there and play the game, and I
think that's important for all of us. Having confidence, when your coach gives
you confidence, you feel like you can do anything on the court. Really happy
for him getting that accomplishment.  
  
MATT FARRELL: He's the best coach I've ever had for sure, and he treats you
like a man, so that's something that I really respect. I think I could speak
for Bonzie that we've had a lot of success here, and we've been blessed to be
here for the four years.  
  
Q. Mike, what do you need to do better than you did today offensively to
get a win tomorrow. And also, you didn't get to take these guys out early. How
much does that concern you?  
MIKE BREY: Well, we've got all our recovery people back at the hotel, and I
love the fact that we don't play until 7:00 tomorrow. So that gives a little
longer. But these guys are getting ice baths and we've got the chiropractor
here. And we knew how to do it last year. I'm not concerned. I think these
guys needed to play here, and this group -- again, the starting group, because
Bonz had been out, hadn't played as much together. I think it helps them that
they get to play together.  
  
You know, I think us going inside and taking advantage maybe of some size, can
we get to the backboard, can we post a little bit against them. But chasing
them off the three-point line and keeping drivers in front of you. You know,
it's easy to say. It's hard to do with Virginia Tech. They are really
explosive.  
  
Q. Along with what Matt was saying, I think you addressed some of it,
but when he said that all the adversity you guys have faced, how much tougher
it's made you, could you just comment on that? How does that show itself in a
game like this?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I think this senior class, I've had a lot of great seniors.
We have guys that go four and five years, and this senior class will always
have a special spot in my heart because of how they led through really kind of
a crisis situation, you know, with the injuries. And they have been men, and
they have kept the group together, and they've kept us believing. I almost
feel that they deserve some good fortune now after going through it all. But
we'll need more than good fortune against the Hokies. They're really good.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2018

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Frank Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34259)

### [Tyus Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34258)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Syracuse - 73, Wake Forest - 64  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: At the start of the game in the zone (indiscernible) in the first
half we had a lot of good looks and just couldn't make anything. I think the
second half we attacked the zone better. I thought Frank did a great job,
Marek was tremendous getting into the open spots. He has been looking to score
better over the last part of the year.  
  
But I thought our defense really was the difference. They're a very, very good
offensive team, and I thought we got them off their spot. They made 14 threes
in Syracuse the last time we played, and I thought we did a much better job
guarding them on the three-point line. It was a really good win. I think Wake
Forest is a really good offensive basketball team.  
  
Q. Jim, what, if anything, did you say to Marek between Saturday and
today?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Nothing. Nothing.  
  
Q. What did you see from him -- what did he do differently today that
allowed him to be successful?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, when they went to the zone, they left him in open spots,
and he converted in the fast break situations. When they pressed, he took the
ball to the basket. In the middle of the zone, they didn't guard him in the
high post area. He can make that shot.  
  
I thought he really played well. He was aggressive. He made some good passes.
But he was very, very good today.  
  
Q. For either of the two guards, you get to play North Carolina
obviously tomorrow. You guys nearly beat them at your place. How much are you
looking forward to that matchup and what do you have to do differently to get
you over the top against them?  
FRANK HOWARD: Just finish the game. I think we've got to -- some good schemes
we can run against them. They're a great team, attack the zone very well, but
I think down there there were some costly turnovers, and we'll just take care
of the ball and run our stuff.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: We played well. Like frank said, we just made some costly
turnovers that ended the game, but we just have to clean those things up, and
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Tyus, what did you pull from those first two games? They challenged
you during the regular season, and it seemed like you were more prepared for
this matchup.  
TYUS BATTLE: I think the second time we played them they were pretty good.
They just hit a couple of threes at the end that brought them back into the
game. Today we were better defensively, run them off the line, and just made
them take tough shots.  
  
Q. With you guys' length and talent and the way you're playing now, do
you feel very confident that not only you can make a run here but put
yourselves in a great position to also get to the tournament and make a run
there?  
TYUS BATTLE: We're confident against anyone we play. I don't care who it is.
We hung in there with some of the best teams in the country, and when we're on
the floor one-on-one with them, we're confident we're going to come out with
the win.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: Yeah, I'm going to second that, as well. That's just our mindset
as a team. We want to be aggressive. We want to always feel like we can win.
We don't look at anyone different, we just got to change the schemes.  
  
Q. Tyus and Frank, you both hooked up with (indiscernible) I was
wondering if you thought that was going to be such an option in this matchup
today considering their personnel?  
TYUS BATTLE: Well, last game I don't think they did a great job stepping up,
and we usually got to the basket pretty easy, so we knew they were going to
change things up, and Vick stepped up and left Paschal wide open, and he's
going to catch that lob every time.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: Yeah, I think in practice Coach Griffin has done a great job
with Paschal, and he's been catching those in practice, he's got to get some
in the game.  
  
Q. Jim, with a minute and a half to go, Wake had just cut it to six and
they're pressing. What were you thinking as Marek got the ball at half court
and attacked the rim?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, you get in that two-on-one situation, I think you've
got to attack it. We had taken the clock down pretty well. You know, with that
lead, and you hold the ball and you don't turn it over, it's going to get
closer, but you're going to win the game. If he hadn't gone to the basket,
they would have had to probably foul. So we had enough margin in that
situation.  
  
We tried to use the clock, but we still wanted to be able to score, and we've
been very good at that this year when we've had the beat. We've been able to
get by people and make plays, either the lob to Paschal or finish the play.
But you want to shorten the game as much as you can when you have that kind of
lead. I thought they did a good job in their pressure, but we had just -- we
had enough cushion.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead to tomorrow to North Carolina, you guys played
really good defense in the second half against them. What do you have to do
tomorrow to prevent the ball movement like they had in the first half against
you guys?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, it was a good game. We played pretty well, but they're
a really, really good team. They're capable of beating anybody in the country
when they play well, and they're going to come in and play well. But they've
got veteran guys that have won National Championships, contended for one and
won one, so they're a really good team, and it's a great challenge.  
  
Q. Frank and Tyus, you've seen Marek these past couple of games. How
have you seen him improve aggressively as he tries to get more baskets around
the rim?  
FRANK HOWARD: He's a talented kid, so we just want to put him in spots where
he can be productive. They gave him some open shots in the middle of the
night, and he was being aggressive and made a lot of plays. On the fast break,
he has a high enough IQ to make the right plays, so we trust him and just got
to put him in the right spots.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Well, I think Coach Red has done a great job improving his game
as the season has gone on. He's developed a jump shot. He's always made pretty
good decisions in the middle. He's just been more aggressive in making the
right play as the season went on.  
  
Q. There's a lot of talk about what you guys have to do to get in the
tournament, that tomorrow's game could really determine whether you're in or
not. Do you look at the bubble talk, and how do you approach the fact that
tomorrow could be really the determining factor?  
FRANK HOWARD: We're just playing basketball. We don't look at any game as a do
or die, know what I mean? We don't want to put any pressure on ourselves.
We're just playing basketball. This is what we come here to do. This is the
best time of the year, so the intensity is higher anyway.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Yeah, we don't -- personally I don't look at what the media says.
We just play. We just play. We work on -- we focus on the circle, which is our
team, and we just go out there and play.  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think the whole thing with the tournament is we just are going
to keep playing, and we had a great strength of schedule this year, much
better than last year. We didn't win on the road last year; we won on the road
this year. So we've done some good things. There's a lot of teams that look
good. It's just one of those things that's going to be tough decisions. The
committee is just going to -- they're going to make whatever decision they
make, and we're just going to try to play the best we can. And I think we've
got a good basketball team, and I think we can compete, and we've proven that
we can compete with anybody.  
  
I thought last year we had won two or three monster games, but they were all
at home. And this year we won a good -- obviously Clemson is good, and we've
won games, but we won at Miami and at Louisville, which are two hard places to
win, and I think that gives us a little bit of boost from where we were last
year. But we'll just try to play tomorrow the best we can, and they're going
to be very tough calls for the committee in this tournament. Very tough.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Ty Outlaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36131)

### [Ahmed Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28466)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: And probably, not stereotyping, those aren't the guys
that I want on our team, and so there's not always going to be just this
stamp. I hope that one stamp that's assured is we play incredibly hard. We
play with little to no ego, and the love that we have for one another is
evident if you watch us play.  
  
Q. Since Coach has arrived, there's been a new energy on game day. You
talk about not wanting to have a drop-off as it pertains to the student
athletes coming behind you, there's also sort of an obligation not having a
drop-off in the energy in Castle. Is there a responsibility of sorts that you
have on game day creating that environment everybody wants?  
AHMED HILL: Yes, me and Ty was talking about it earlier, down on the floor, I
remember freshman year, it was probably 600, 700 people in the stands. Now the
younger guys come in and all they know is that the gym is packed and sold out.  
  
When you have to bring your own energy at 12 o'clock on noon day against North
Carolina, it's really hard. But nowadays, since we have built kind of a good
culture of winning, and we wants to continue that, 12 o'clock games be sold
out within the first few minutes of the schedule coming out.  
  
I think that's the most biggest thing is having the energy in Castle to where
you can feed off that energy and play hard because the way we play is so hard
and it's so hard to maintain that energy throughout the whole game with just
us, with nobody in the stands, no energy from the fans helping us.  
  
So I think from the sold out games are, and the energy it brings to help our
new defense to play hard, to fly around, to dive on the loose balls and get
rewarded for it with cheering and clapping.  
  
TY OUTLAW: The energy starts in practice because there's really nobody in the
stands in practice. We have that same energy in practice. It's not much
difference between the game and practice as far as our energy. As soon as the
energy drops off, if we don't get it straight, Coach going to get it straight.
It's the same in the game. We just practice that, take it to the game and
can't let it be any drop-off because that's a moment we're going to slip.  
  
Coming from junior college where I can count on a couple hands how many people
were in the stands coming to the 600 TO 700 who were in the stands my first
year here, even that was still a hundred times more than what I was used to.  
  
To me, sold out game is impossible not to have energy but to some of these
guys who might have been part of bigger problems all their life, the goal is
to learn how to play with energy or not -- well, coming from the stands, that
is, making our own energy. Because at the end of the day, we're not worried
about what is in the stands. Yeah, we want support. But even if everybody was
against us, even if we are in Cameron indoor stadium, everybody is trying to
rip our throat out, we still going to have energy. We are not intimidated by
any of the other stuff.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned that he doesn't feel like the team is ready for the
first game, at least not quite yet. What is it like as a team you feel like
you need to work on between now and November 9?  
TY OUTLAW: I don't feel like we're ready for that first game, either. I know
we're going to be ready when that first game comes. But right now I think we
need to keep working on our defensive principles and taking up space and
boxing out and getting those rebounds. We know what we can do offensively. We
know what our Achilles' heel is. It's been the same story pretty much since
I've been here based on how we play ball. It's just keep working on those same
things.  
  
Q. As you look at building a schedule, a non-conference schedule each
year and the schedule you want to be on building a program, how is it you
schedule your non-conference games? What's the philosophy?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I think it will change with 20 games in the ACC Network,
starting next year. I think there's -- you want to make sure just a general
statement in answering that question.  
  
You want to make sure that your non-conference schedule prepares your team for
the conference schedule. And there's multiple levels of preparation, whether
that's on the road, whether that's at home, whether that's a specific style of
play that you're playing against and you're playing that team and non-
conference for the represent that you need of that style in conference play.  
  
I even think some of that has extended with certain programs. You know, we
have played a Frank Martin team every season that I've been a head coach in a
scrimmage and/or a game.  
  
So some of that probably is institutionalized regardless of what league and
regardless of how many games. And then you know, some of the opportunities
that have been afforded to us have been because of what has transpired during
the time that these guys have been here.  
  
Worked really hard to see if we could get in Maui before these guys left, and
we're in Maui next year. We're not going to be any good in Maui next year, but
we're in Maui as a program because of what these guys have been able to do for
us during their tenure.  
  
So it's a delicate balance, and I think similar to recruiting. The pace of
scheduling happens way in advance. I signed two contracts for next season
yesterday before I left to come here, just because the scheduling is happening
so far in advance, and I don't know that I have the right answers on how the
20-game schedule is going to impact non-conference scheduling or MTEs, but I
do think it is going to have an impact.  
  
Q. I want to follow up on that line of thinking for a second. When you
arrived at Virginia Tech, you knew that you were going up against internally
the football program. How has progress been made there so that you can secure
the dollars you need and the other support so that you can build your program
to where you want to take it?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I've never -- that was one of the attractions, to be
honest for me as a person. I love college football. I love football probably
more so than basketball. I love coaches in general.  
  
I never viewed football at Virginia Tech as a negative or as a competitor. I
viewed it completely 1,000 percent as a teammate.  
  
Coach Beamer was over-the-top gracious to me during his tenure, and really
excited about what Coach Fuente is doing in his regime/tenure as he gets Tech
going.  
  
But I viewed it as a positive all along. Obviously Dr. Sands I think had been
the president for less than 90 days when I was hired, and I think that Whit
had been the AD for less than 60 days.  
  
So I understood the magnitude of the decision that they had to make and I also
understood that from listening to them, that they knew that their commitment
level to the program was going to have to change.  
  
I think from a hierarchy standpoint, I know it comes across maybe in the wrong
way. I think the combination of Whit Babcock and Dr. Sands is the best
combination of leadership from an athletic department and an institution that
I've ever seen.  
  
I think they are the best in the country and I think so much of what has
transpired in our tenure, it should always be about the guys and it always
will be, but too much has been made of me, or a recruit or a player.  
  
We finished in last place in year No. 1 for the fourth consecutive year.
Distinct last place. Like we need to win in overtime by one and if we can, the
shot-is-coming-from-the-deep-corner-off-the-backboard-type stuff.  
  
For us to have tied the largest turnaround in the history of this league,
which was before any of us was born, in year No. 2, was just unheard of in my
opinion. And then I know you understand the previous two years, the last time
that happened was 32 years ago, and if we have a chance to play in the NCAA
Tournament again this year, I don't know that we do, but we have a chance as
of today. It's never happened in the history of the school.  
  
I think one thing that I've learned -- sorry for talking a little too much --
one thing that I've learned through all of this is how important Ty Outlaw's
visit was in the spring of year No. 1, hen I was exhausted after losing more
games than I had ever lost before. One thing I've learned is how important my
relationship with Med's mom was when she signed a national letter of intent
for him to come to Blacksburg and he had never been here.  
  
But the thing that I have learned the most is the people that never get in
front of a microphone, the people whose names are never printed on a roster or
in a media guide, how critical they are to the opportunity for a metamorphosis
of a program. All of the manager, all of the trainers, all of the s IDs, all
of the people that are trying to help and they are all pulling in the same
direction.  
  
I really think that's just as much a part of why we are in this position as
anything else is not one person, not one player, not four seniors. It's not a
specific category that did it. It was the collective group that did it.  
  
You know, like, hey, we fired a coach and we hired a good coach. That's like
super-fan ignorance. They don't know. You know, we had the 15th-ranked class
in the country. We are going to be better next year. That's super fan
ignorance. The people that are voting on those classes, they don't know. They
have never coached. They have never played.  
  
It's everybody pulling in the direction, and I've learned so many lessons from
a leadership standpoint during my tenure, way more leadership lessons than
coaching lessons, but it's the value of everybody in the program that are
washing their clothes, that are helping supply their energy every morning at
5:15 when they practice. It's all of the people that are sweeping the floor
that they get one polo shirt and it's the polo shirt that Dyer is wearing
today. Like they are so thankful and have that attitude of gratitude.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina.  
  
Q. Players, what did you guys learn about the state of the team's
readiness for the season from the scrimmage with Villanova?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I think there's definitely areas that we can improve. I think
there's definitely some spots that we did well in. But we see the areas that
we can improve, and we've addressed them. And I think going forward we know
how to correct it and we know that we can correct it, which is a big thing.  
  
There's definitely some areas -- you know, rebounding defensively, even
offensively -- that we can improve on. And it showed us a lot about ourselves.
And I think Villanova is a team that plays with great energy and intensity,
and it's the intensity that we're going to have to match and even do better
than whenever we step on the court for games that matter.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: We went up there saw areas where we could improve, but also in
those areas we showed ourselves that we could do it. It's just a matter of
doing it consistently. And I think we definitely watched the film and we saw
what it is that we needed to work on, and we addressed those things and we'll
work on them the next two weeks going into the first game.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't have anything to add. They said that pretty well.  
  
Q. What's it like coming to this building knowing that you're back here
again in March and there's already a bit of a history with this club here?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: That was actually the first thing I said to Cameron when we
got out of the car. I talked about our last time being here, how we ended our
season here.  
  
We know what happened here. And we know that we have some history now. And
we've just used that as motivation in practice and in the preseason. Coach
definitely hasn't let us forget it.  
  
But we use it as fuel and motivation to get back there and not let it happen
again in that same situation. So it's definitely something that we won't
forget.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: When Kenny and I stepped out of the car, we could kind of
feel -- I still felt there were some emotions left over in the loading dock
from exiting the game against Texas A&M in the tournament. So we weren't even
thinking about ACC tournament or, you know, what's upcoming. I think that
sting of the tournament was still kind of there.  
  
And Coach hadn't let us forget that much over the past couple of days, past
couple of weeks. And it's definitely motivation going forward because that's
not something you want to happen in the first place, let alone two times. And
it's something we learn from, and it pushes us in a little bit of a different
way.  
  
Q. Coach, you chuckled when you said you don't let them forget, but
there's a fine line between keeping it as motivation and then just tucking it
away and let it be gone. How do you strike that balance?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You'll have to ask them if I've done it successfully or not.
But I don't think you should forget things that you have an opportunity to
learn from. And I think we didn't play as well as we wanted to play against
A&M. They did a better job than we did. But I don't think you should just let
those things go.  
  
I think as Kenny said use it as fuel, use it as motivation to play better, as
Cam said remember that and try to play better when you get out there.  
  
But we've been beaten a lot in the NCAA Tournament over the years. We've won
some as well. But I think every year you should remember those things and try
to make sure you don't make the same mistakes.  
  
And last year I didn't think we defended around the rim very well, and we
didn't score around the rim very well. Both of those holes in our game really
showed up against A&M. So we've got to try to correct that.  
  
Q. How are the big men progressing? What are your thoughts about the 5
position at this point? And obviously too early to tell how much you will play
the 5 or how many times you may go smaller, but what do the big guys have to
do to meet your satisfaction?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Part of the answer is in the really easy. I have no idea how
many times we'll go big or small. We've got three weeks of practice. We've got
two more weeks before the first game. And things change during the course of
the season as to how successful you are, whether you want to stick with what
you're doing. Sometimes it's driven by some guy's playing great, some guy's
playing poorly, some guy's got a sprained ankle or whatever. So I don't know
that part of the answer.  
  
The big guys, Brandon Huffman's had two practices, all of them that he's been
fully healthy because he's had knee problems. Sterling Manley looks like he's
playing bigger, which you like to have length around that basket. I still want
him to work about 7,433 times harder. But I think that he has improved.  
  
Walker Miller's improved. Garrison Brooks does more of the little things that
coaches appreciate and doing it on the defensive end of the floor and being
more aware than the other guys have.  
  
But somebody needs to step up and say, hey, I can do this, and not only say it
but do it, prove it to us out on the court. If one of those guys steps up and
proves it to us on the court, I will be more comfortable.  
  
And sometimes that's good that the coach is more comfortable. Sometimes it
doesn't make any difference. But I would like for one of those guys to step
forward, or all of them collectively. It's hard to go in a game and say which
guys will do it tonight? You give player A, B, C and D all a chance, and A, B
and C stink it up, by the time D gets in there, it's too late sometimes.  
  
But I would like for them to step up and be more consistent with their effort
and with their concentration in those two areas more than anything.  
  
Q. As someone who has been in this game for a bit and is viewed as a
steward of the game, if you will, what is your responsibility as you look at
kind of the tenor of things right now with the trial and everything in terms
of addressing that and perhaps helping people understand what's going on with
it all?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's really hard. That's really a good question. I've stated
what my thoughts were, that it's a world that I don't operate in. I've never
had a parent ask me for anything. I've never used an agent. Never used a shoe
company. Don't do those kind of things. And I think a very intelligent person
one time told me there's a difference between being indifferent or having a
lack of knowledge.  
  
And my problem is I have a lack of knowledge about those things. I'm not very
indifferent about it at all. I think that there's some major problems, some
problems that need to be worked out, some things that need to be changed.  
  
I don't think you can legislate morality. I don't think you can legislate
honesty. But what we have here is a very big problem that's a national problem
that's in the news that we've got to be aware of it.  
  
But it's hard for me to understand. I mean, like somebody -- if I were to ask
you guys how do you do a drug deal or how do you take care of our nuclear
armament process that we have, how do you do something in nuclear sub, all of
you guys are very intelligent, doesn't mean you're not intelligent, but you
have no idea how to do all three of those things. I would think that you would
know how to do all those things.  
  
But being indifferent is something I'm not. I think the problem that we have
is something that has to be addressed. If I'm able to mentor a college coach,
if I'm able to mentor a player that wants to know about the college game, I
would say that our glass is really half full. I think there's great things
going on in college basketball.  
  
I'm a coach that thinks there's great things going on in summer basketball. I
had a person that was on one of those committees. I said it to Pete Shem
(phonetic). I said, "Sit right here with me and watch the game." And at the
end of the game -- and it was a great game -- one team scored five points in
one second and won the game. And people were excited and everything. I said,
"Now tell me what was wrong with what you just saw." And he said, "Absolutely
nothing." Now, I didn't plan the game was going to be that good, but I just
wanted to see what he really thought was negative there.  
  
But there are some things, and we've got to be aware of that and try to
address those situations. If we do have penalties and somebody's found guilty
of things, then I think those penalties should be really harsh.  
  
But, again, I'll go back to this thing. 1906, I think I'm close, is when the
NCAA was formed. There were some bad things going on in college basketball
recruiting. President Roosevelt says we need somebody to oversee this, and
that was when the NCAA came out.  
  
We've had times in our game, whether it's in football, basketball, in the
sports world, we've had some times where some negative things have been going
on and times that there haven't been. And I think this is one of those, but I
don't think that I'm trying to put my head in the sand and ignore it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how Sean May has grown from being an All-
American player to now a prominent member of your coaching staff?  
COACH WILLIAMS: How he's grown? Yes, he has. Kenny and Cam will remind him
when he gets back. He's not exactly my man's playing weight, okay (laughter).
No, he's turned the page. I've said this many times. Sean May was one of the
five most intelligent guys I've ever coached. Sean played the 5 spot for us.
And he could have run any position in practice, in any drill. He knew exactly
what to do.  
  
In fact, I'll say it and challenge these two guys. He could have played the
point guard or the wing in any dummy offense and knew what to do.  
  
Again, one of the five most intelligent guys I've ever coached. In his senior
year, I thought he was the best player in basketball -- junior year, excuse
me, his last year. But he's turned the page on playing and wants to coach and
wants to work with guys that he thinks that he might be able to help, and he's
a positive role model for them. He's helped put a banner on one end and his
jersey is on the other end. He's been very successful. And I'm very, very
fortunate to have him back with us and love having him with us every day.  
  
Q. Coach, curious what your thoughts are on the increase in the
conference schedule to 20 games in the future and pros and cons, if you
will?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That has been an issue that I've been very outspoken about. I
didn't like the way it was done. I asked one time I said some TV folks, I said
would you rather have us against a team that's last place really struggling,
have no players, or would you rather see us play Kentucky or Kansas or
Arizona? They said of course those games. And I said, well, we go to 20 games,
I'm not going to play as many of those games.  
  
Last four years, our schedule, by the tournament committee, has been No. 1,
No. 6, No. 6 and No. 1 in the last four years. So we've played a very
difficult schedule. And, heck, this year may be the most difficult schedule
we've ever played.  
  
But in reality, to move to 20 games, it's really a 21-game schedule. Because
we have the ACC-Big Ten and we're not going to do away with that and
shouldn't. It does make it harder. You can't play the Golden State Warriors
one night and Boston Celtics the next night and Portland the next night in
college because you have to have some time where your guys gain some
confidence.  
  
I used this as an example earlier today. I had two first-year players one time
at Kansas. Both gifted, very highly rated, very important to our program.
First game of the year we played Georgia. Hugh Durham was a coach who was a
great defensive coach. He backed off those youngsters about 12 feet. They
didn't make a shot. The next game we went to Indianapolis and played Bob
Knight's Indiana team, and they backed off those same guys two guys 12 feet.
Now, much different than the two guys sitting up here with me. I could not get
those guys to shoot for three months.  
  
These guys are shooting three seconds up here. But those kids completely lost
their confidence. And so I think there's some times for building confidence.
There's times for building team chemistry, and it's hard to do that if you're
playing those kind of teams all the time.  
  
So I'm not in favor of it. Coaches had no voice in it whatsoever. And we go to
the spring meetings, there's no talk about it. And then all of a sudden in
July we're doing it. So that's what happened.  
  
Q. Cam, this is your second year in the program. And from what I
understand, you're healthier now. How will the experience and the improved
health enhance what you're able to do on the court this year?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I think it will go a long way for me. Going into a new
program last year, adjusting to everything that comes along with that and
having to sit out a couple of weeks before getting back and having to jump in
really close to conference play was a little bit different.  
  
So this year I feel like I'm just on a better foot. I feel like I have more
knowledge of the system, more knowledge of what Coach wants and what the
teammates want to do. With my body feeling better, I can step out on the court
each day focused on basketball more than kind of the ache or pain of the day,
anything like that.  
  
It's a burden off my shoulders, a little bit of a burden off my back, and I'm
looking forward to getting a heavier portion of non-conference and getting my
feet under me towards conference play this year.  
  
Q. Coach, what are your initial thoughts over North Carolina Senator
Rick Gunn and John Alexander Jr., just talking about their open letter to the
NCAA expressing their displeasures over the Hurricane Florence charity game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Steve Kirschner is going to appreciate you guys because you're
throwing me some lobs. I saw the letter from Mr. Emmert, the president of the
NCAA, which is the hardest job in the world as far as I'm concerned.  
  
It's frustrating, the response was frustrating, it's still frustrating. Fairly
close -- I can't give you the exact date, I may be able to go back figure it
out on my calendar. But after the hurricane hit, I'm trying to think of some
ways that we might be able to do some things. And last year we did something
very simple, very small, and we raised a little bit of money. I was trying to
think of a way to make a lot of money that we could give to the hurricane
victims.  
  
I'm in eastern North Carolina quite a bit, and I see what's gone on. I have a
house in Wilmington. And so I know what went on down there.  
  
You watch TV, I watched The Weather Channel for three days, and more of those
three days I ever have in my life. I was seeing what was going on, tried to
figure out a way to make a lot of money. The two areas hurt more than anyone,
and not the only ones, but hurt more than anyone was North Carolina and South
Carolina. I called Frank Martin to see if he would be willing, and he jumped
on immediately and said he would be willing to do it.  
  
And so we applied for the waiver. And the fact of the matter is when our
compliance girl is on the phone, they said: We don't want you to apply because
we're not going to say yes. We're not going to permit it. We've made the
decision we're not doing any waivers.  
  
And so then I made the statements at my press day that I was really sad that
it happened. And someone immediately called back and said, well, you didn't
ask for a waiver. Come on now, let's not play games. The reason we didn't ask
for a waiver, we were told not to because it wouldn't do any good.  
  
Then I hear about the senator sending the letter and the response was back
that every school had two opportunities: You can play two scrimmages, you can
play two exhibitions or one of each.  
  
We already had an exhibition scheduled with Mount Olive. We do it with teams
in our state to give them some money to help their programs. Every year I've
been there, I've played an exhibition game against somebody in our state. We
already had that scheduled. We didn't want to take money away from them. And I
didn't necessarily think that would raise a lot of money. Like I thought North
Carolina and South Carolina would particularly if we did in this building.  
  
We also had a private scrimmage scheduled. We had a signed contract for a
private scrimmage. And it was bringing in some other state that was not as
heavily damaged as our state was.  
  
So, again, a waiver means that somebody can get a waiver. You don't have a
waiver program if you're not ever going to give anybody a waiver, but there
was a waiver program. And so I was disappointed that the answer was North
Carolina, South Carolina could have made some changes and they had all the
opportunities in the world.  
  
Well, the fact of the matter is we wanted to do it quickly. Quickly. And when
it was really in front of everybody it was some situations that people were
still living through.  
  
And so I was disappointed by the answer because -- like I say, I think he's
got the toughest job there is. But you're talking about some people who had
tremendous tragedies going on in their life. We were not going to gain any
advantage on State or Duke or Wake or Virginia or Florida State by playing
that game. We were trying to make some money to help some people. That's the
bottom line. Yes, you could say we could have canceled Mount Olive, we could
have canceled our scrimmage and tried to get it, but I thought we could have
done that so quickly, getting North Carolina and South Carolina involved that
it was a home run.  
  
And again, if there is a waiver process, I don't believe you have to treat
everybody the same. Just treat everybody fairly. And I think somebody, pick a
state, somebody in Arizona or Idaho or something, that sees The Weather
Channel, sees what's going on, I don't think it would hurt them.  
  
Q. John Swofford said today they'll kick off the season with an ACC
conference game, play a couple games before Christmas. Thoughts on that kind
of change to the ACC conference slate?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That doesn't bother me if we're chosen in a year to be one of
those. It's going to be the same for everybody. You still play 18 this year.
So it doesn't bother me. I think it's wise.  
  
I don't think we'd be doing it if people didn't think it was a good idea.  
  
Q. Coach, when was the first time that you saw Luke Maye play in high
school, and how has he changed and grown since then?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The first time I saw Luke play in high school was I'm guessing
sophomore year, but he'd been in my basketball camp before that. So maybe in
the seventh and eighth grade is the first time I had seen Luke. I went to that
game just to see Luke. His body's gotten 100% better or at least 99% better
than he was then. He's much stronger, leaner, quicker, bouncier, all those
kind of things.  
  
The other part I would say that's changed, whenever that was, sophomore,
junior year, the kid spent an unbelievable amount of time and sweat to be the
player that he is right now. He's one of the better players in our game, and
it's all because of sweat.  
  
Q. Coach, so obviously 3-point defense was somewhat of a struggle last
year. How have the newcomers come in? Have any of them impressed you as
perimeter defenders so far?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, the new guys, I think Coby is good defensively, has a
chance to be really good. I think Leaky is very good defensively and has a
chance to be really good. And Nassir is so athletic he can be really good as
well and he works really hard.  
  
So I'm hopeful that all three of those guys can be very good defenders for
them.  
  
And you're right, I said something about scoring around the rim and defending
around the rim. The other thing that was a negative for us last year was
guarding 3-point shot, and so far the chances that we've had this year we
haven't done a much better job of it. In our secret scrimmage.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: It's always great to be with you. And we welcome you to
this year's edition of ACC Operation Basketball, as we start another ACC
basketball season.  
  
I'm especially pleased that we're gathered here at the Spectrum Center. Great
facility. Obviously run by outstanding people. We've got a terrific
relationship with Fred Whitfield, who oversees this and works very closely,
obviously, with Michael Jordan, as president of the Hornets, and had the
opportunity to spend some time with him last night. I know they're looking
forward to our tournament being here at the end of the year.  
  
So it's great to start here and terrific to end here. Before you spend the day
with the coaches and the players, I just have a few remarks to share, and then
I do want to leave ample time for your questions.  
  
It's an exciting time for our league, and quite frankly, we have and have had
a great deal to celebrate. Competitively, our teams have seen outstanding
success. And I know you've seen some of this before but I want you and others
to hear it again because sometimes it doesn't register. The ACC is the only
conference to win national championships in football, men's basketball,
women's basketball and baseball over the last four years.  
  
The ACC has won a combined four football and men's basketball national titles
over the last five years. And that's twice as many as any other conference.
The ACC has tied for the second-most team national championships in the last
five years with 22 across all sports. And I think you know how committed this
league has been to broadbased programs and our Olympic sports over the years.
And I think that synopsis is really indicative of the league's strength in
obviously the revenue of sports, football, and men's basketball, but also our
Olympic sports.  
  
Beyond the competition, our institutions, and particularly our student-
athletes, continue to set a high standard academically. Whether it's the
academic progress rates, the graduation success rates, or U.S. News and World
Report rankings of our schools, our schools collectively, as a league, are at
the top of those lists and they are at the top of those lists consistently on
a year in, year out basis.  
  
So the quality of leadership at our schools and the investments that continue
to be made on our campuses are paying great dividends. And as I said, I know
you've seen and heard all of this before. But I candidly cannot underscore
enough how proud I am of our programs and in almost a lifetime career in
college athletics.  
  
I learned a long time ago that success should never be taken for granted.  
  
(Video).  
  
Well, we've talked about this for a lot of years and we're now less than a
year away from the August 2019 launch of the ACC Network. As I said over the
summer, and I'm sure I'll continue to say as we move toward August, a lot of
work has been done in preparation for the launch by our partners at ESPN here
in Charlotte and in Bristol, our office in Greensboro, and certainly on the
campuses of our schools.  
  
The work continues to intensify as does the level of excitement and
anticipation as this draws near. We're in the midst of discussions to finalize
the live event programming schedule for fall, winter and spring sports.  
  
Our non-live programming needs and reviewing different show ideas for the
network itself, and by the spring, we will have identified the talent for the
programs that we create as well as our game announcers for the live events. So
as you can imagine, there's an awful lot going on at this point in time. There
will be an awfully lot going on between now and August, and we look forward to
that, tremendously.  
  
Specific to ACC basketball, you're aware from our announcement back in July of
2016 that beginning with next season, the '19-'20 season, we'll move to a
20-game conference schedule. The 20 games will consist of four games against
primary rivals, two home and two away. The team's primary rivals have been in
place since we became a 15-member conference, and those will stay the same.  
  
Eight games against repeat opponents. Four of those will be at home; four of
those will be away. And the remaining eight games will be split into four
games at home and four on the road against teams that will be played once
during the regular season.  
  
Beyond the obvious competitive benefits of a 20-game league schedule, it will
now take three years, less than half the time of our current schedule, to get
through the full cycle of opponents. Everyone will have played its primary
rivals six times and all other teams four times during the three-year cycle.  
  
We're also planning to begin the 2019-20 season with a full round of
conference games to open the season in November, which should make the tip-off
of that season truly special.  
  
It was around this time last year when we learned of the federal investigation
surrounding college basketball. Although I'm still not in a position to say
much about the specifics that are being dealt with in court and that ruling
could come out any day now, I am pleased that the NCAA board of directors made
the decision to implement the recommendations of the Rice Commission on
college basketball.  
  
That was a critical step toward the future success and integrity of the sport
and enhancing the culture of the support. With that said, I think we're going
to have to be mindful that although we won't reach perfection with what's come
out of the Rice Commission the first go-around, we can't let that stand in the
way of significant progress. And I think significant progress will be made and
made immediately.  
  
But anytime you're dealing with something this complex, and you're
implementing something this quickly, and with all due credit to the NCAA,
because I don't think I've ever seen the NCAA move as quickly on something of
this significance as it did over the summer once the Rice Commission report
came out. And I think that should be noted, because one of the things that
many of us, including you, criticize the NCAA about at times is how slow it
can move. A lot of times heard it described as turning a battleship.  
  
And that was not the case this summer. So at least in terms of moving quickly
on something that's extraordinarily important going forward, the process did
that. But as I said, I don't think -- I don't think it's going to be perfect.
I think we're going to have to test some of the things that are being changed,
tweak them as we go along and make sure we're addressing the problems,
whatever they may be, as thoroughly as we can possibly do that. So I think
there be unintended consequences and we'll need to evaluate and make
adjustments as we go along. But I think it will have an impact on changing a
culture that obviously has some problems in certain areas and needs to be
changed.  
  
As a leader in college athletics and a fan, as we all are, of a great sport in
college basketball, I can't help but be concerned about the allegations and
the testimony in the case. While we don't know what role the NCAA enforcement
process will or can play with the evidence, it's critical to the long-term
health of the sport and the health of college athletics that there's
institutional and public confidence in the integrity of the sport.  
  
We must find ways to keep the bad actors out of the game and away from the
game so the many who do it right, and there are many, in my opinion, can do so
with confidence.  
  
In terms of ACC basketball, I don't need to tell you how special the sport is
to this league, to our schools to our alumni to our fans.  
  
This year, as with any other years in this league, when it comes to
basketball, it's filled with the highest of expectations. And how can it not
be that based on the history and tradition of the league and when you consider
that the 15 programs we now have as a part of the ACC have, A, captured seven
of the last 18 national championships, made 61 Final Four appearances, have
won 624 NCAA Tournament games, and just last week I saw where we have 82
players on opening day NBA rosters, and that's by far the most of any
conference.  
  
In addition, six of the 30 winningest programs in NCAA basketball history are
in the ACC. And since 1981, the league has produced 45 consensus All-
Americans.  
  
As I previously mentioned, we'll return to the Spectrum Center for the 2019
New York Life ACC basketball tournament. Earlier this fall we also announced
that college basketball's premier conference tournament, meaning this one,
will be back in Greensboro in 2020, Washington D.C. in 2021, and Brooklyn in
2022.  
  
That is a rotation that is working very well for us. We're still a relatively
new expanded footprint as a conference. We've talked a lot about respecting
the past and embracing the present and the future.  
  
And I think that rotation that we're currently in and have been in is doing
just that from a tournament standpoint. We're fortunate to have outstanding
venues in our footprint that are run extraordinarily well. And we're extremely
fortunate to have fan bases at our schools that continue to make our
tournament successful wherever it is played.  
  
Now, the first game of this season for all 15 league teams is less than two
weeks away. We'll welcome two outstanding new head coaches in Chris Mack at
Louisville and Jeff Capel at Pitt, both with ACC experiences in their past,
and we'll continue our very successful officiating alliance that will expand
to 10 conferences with the addition of the MEAC this year.  
  
Bryan Kersey has turned out to be an extraordinarily good hire as he came off
the court after many years of being on the court and is just doing a
tremendous job with our league and with the alliance with the other
conferences.  
  
All 135 ACC regular season league games and all 14 games of the New York Life
ACC Tournament will be available on any ESPN Network, Raycom, CBS Sports, the
regional sports networks or ACC Network Extra. Each of these entities
continues to be a valued partner and we appreciate their coverage as I know
all of our fans do.  
  
In speaking of Raycom Sports, this will be its 37th consecutive year
broadcasting ACC basketball. The partnership began with the 1982/83 season.
And over the last three decades, it's brought some of the most memorable
moments in ACC history to our fans. Although it will not be through the
current syndicated package, as this will be the last year of the syndicated
package, we look forward to continuing our partnership with Raycom beyond this
season.  
  
Again, let me thank you for being here. I now want to open it up for any
questions that you might have in regard to anything I did cover or did not
cover. We appreciate your coverage.  
  
Q. What was your reaction to the NBA's G League outreach and the offer
of contracts to elite players?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: David, I think it's fine. I think it's like a lot of
things. I think we'll have to see from a practical standpoint how it works. I
certainly don't have a problem with it at all from a collegiate perspective. I
think it gives another avenue that a young person can take, if he so chooses.
And that may be in the best interests of some of those young people.  
  
And hopefully it helps get us to the point where the one-and-done rule can be
out of the picture and helps us get to the point where the NBA and the Players
Association where players, if they want to, can go directly to the NBA draft.
But I don't know a lot about the particulars of it, and I get the impression
that the G League and the NBA is still working on a number of those
particulars. But fundamentally I think it's good in the sense that it gives
some young people another avenue.  
  
And I'm not one that I use Kobe Bryant as an example, obviously one of the
great players of all time, and there are others you could use. College
basketball never saw Kobe Bryant. And therefore we didn't experience Kobe
Bryant. Therefore, I don't think we missed Kobe Bryant.  
  
So I don't think that college basketball is going to be hurt by a half dozen
or a dozen really elite players that would have been with us for one year but
now being if we reach that point they can go directly into the NBA and would
never have been on our campuses.  
  
I just don't believe that creates a negative for college basketball.  
  
Q. You said that you were concerned about what was going on, some of the
testimony in the trial. You didn't know what the NCAA was going to do but you
were worried about the, quote, integrity of the sport. Do you think that the
NCAA needs to act based on what has come up in the testimony at trial to
protect the integrity of the sport?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, I don't think that what has come up can be
ignored in any way, shape or form. So, yes, I think there does need to be some
action and I'm sure there will be. I think it's premature to know exactly what
that will be. We're in a transition, obviously, at the NCAA, in terms of how
major cases will be addressed and how -- I don't know how the NCAA, for
instance, Luke, will use court testimony in terms of its processes.  
  
But this sort of puts an interesting and maybe healthy test in front of the
NCAA and the transition in the new approach that we're trying to take that's
coming out of the Rice Commission right off the bat. And I think that's
probably a good thing.  
  
Q. Following up on the November conference games, do you envision every
school playing one conference game? When would the games be played in
November? Would they be more than just the opening game? Do you see games in
December as well in order to get 20 into the schedule?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Yes, yes and yes. We've got 15 schools in basketball.
So not everybody can necessarily play a conference game those opening couple
of nights. So there will be one that plays a non-conference, very high-profile
game that will fit right in in terms of the quality of the game to tip off the
season.  
  
Q. Over the course of the trial, some coaches, including some in the
ACC, have said they were dumbfounded or surprised at some of the comments and
that's not the world they're familiar with. Other coaches, on the other hand,
have said they're very familiar with it and it's a problem that needs to be
cleaned up. Where do you stand in that?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: I think anytime you have the letters "FBI" associated
with NCAA in just about any way, shape or form, in this case, basketball, I'm
concerned about it. I'm very concerned about it. It's not a good place for
college basketball to be. I think the coaches that indicate they -- I wouldn't
interpret what some coaches have said to be that they're not concerned about
it. I suspect, and I can't speak for them, I suspect what they're saying is
they haven't seen it firsthand. Have not experienced it firsthand. It's not
their world. And hopefully it's not. That's a good thing if it's not their
world. But there's obviously -- and maybe someone described it as -- a
conversation I was having, Paul Brazeau in our office and I were talking, and
we kind of felt like in a sense that if there's a silver lining in this, it
fully exposes a subculture that diminishes college basketball and raises the
awareness of it, heightens the sensitivity to it and the need to dig deeper
into it, find out what it is and correct it as best as we can correct it.  
  
And you can change systems, change processes all you want. And you need to.
And obviously we are collectively in college basketball doing that maybe in a
way that it's never been done before coming out of the Rice Commission. And I
think that's really appropriate.  
  
But what I don't think we're all talking enough about is individual integrity
and accountability. You can have the best rules everything and the best system
and the best process. And if people still don't understand you play by the
rules, then it seems to me that's where you have to attack it because
ultimately it gets down to individuals making deceivious decisions, bad
decisions, inappropriate decisions, that undermine those that are in the game
that do it well and do it the right way and do it with within the rules.  
  
It's an affront to those people. It's an affront to the system. It's an
affront to college basketball. And I think we need to talk about that more. I
think we need to attack it more from that perspective.  
  
Q. Going back to the G League, is there a concern in college basketball
circles going forward that the NBA might take an all-hands approach to the
development from high school, AAU, working with their advertisers and then
bypassing college altogether, almost like a European Academy model that would
take away the college model for future draft picks?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: I don't know. It doesn't say -- I'm not saying it
couldn't happen. That's hard for me to imagine getting to that point. So I
don't have great concern about that. But in today's world, my eyes are open to
just about anything in terms of whether it could happen or not.  
  
Q. Could you view it as a way for colleges to increase competition with
the G League, like, okay, they're offering this to you now, maybe it helps
with the Rice Commission of you know what, maybe we can make likenesses
available for you to cash in on?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, I don't know. I don't look at the G League and
what they're going to be doing. At least now and as I see it, because I don't
think the numbers are going to be great with the G League. And I think there
are going to continue to be an awfully lot of young men out there coming out
of high school that are very good basketball players that understand and see
the value of a college education over their lifetime. And that's good. That
keeps us where we need to be. And I'm confident that will continue to be the
case.  
  
Q. Had a question for you about the men's tournament. You mentioned -- I
think you were saying you like the four cities: Charlotte, Greensboro, DC and
Brooklyn. First of all, did I hear you correctly on that? And secondly, do you
then view it as you would like to stay pretty steady with those four cities
rotating as host sites?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, I really like the rotation we have with those
four cities. You heard me absolutely correctly in regard to that, because I
think it serves our league extremely well and we need to be in different parts
of the league with our footprint at this point in time, and we've talked about
New York before. Washington, the last two times we've been there, has been
tremendous.  
  
And our schools, not just athletically, but our presidents and institutional
personnel that deal with Washington DC kinds of things, if you will, it's
important for there to be a presence there. And the fan feedback we got was
tremendous in regard to being in DC. New York maybe for different purposes,
not as much governmental, but really important for all of our schools to be
there periodically. And obviously that's a part of our footprint in those two
years there from our perspective went extremely well. And while we've had some
history in Washington, it's relatively new, but, you know, fits the footprint
better than it ever has before.  
  
And then you have North Carolina, where the tournament was built and became
what it became in Greensboro and in Charlotte. And I can't guarantee you the
future. Ultimately the schools vote on it. But I think most everyone in our
league would tell you this rotation is serving us well, has served us well.
And that's why we basically came right back to it for those next two years.  
  
And I mentioned in my remarks, I mean, there doesn't seem to be another league
out there that can move their tournament around and have the success with it
that we've been fortunate enough to have. And that's because of our fans and
the tradition and history that was built with the tournament over a long
period of time and most of that was built in North Carolina.  
  
So that thought of respecting the past and embracing the future as well as the
present really relates to a lot of things and how we try to address things in
our league.  
  
But it really fits the tournament rotation from my perspective.  
  
And Erik being from Charlotte, this is quite a Charlotte-centric year for us
as a league, obviously, with this event being here, the football kickoff was
here, our football championship game has truly found a home here and we'll be
here for that for a number of years.  
  
And then coming back here periodically this year with the basketball
tournament. It's a pretty special year between Charlotte and the ACC.  
  
Q. Have there been further discussions pertaining to gambling? And with
that said, what sort of feedback have you gotten concerning the removal of the
requirement of injury reports on a weekly basis during ACC contests?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: We've had a number of discussions about gambling and
where that's headed and what that means for us. The biggest thing we're trying
to do as a league, and I think this is flowing well, is getting educated about
what legalized gambling means or could mean in terms of college athletics and
our world.  
  
And the approach that we're taking and seemingly most of our colleagues are
taking a similar approach as is the NCAA, is to not jump into this too quickly
until we really understand it and see where it's totally going to land.  
  
We haven't had any states as yet in our footprint legalize gambling. It
doesn't mean they won't, and I would fully expect that some of those states
will.  
  
There's also a hope that Congress may, for those states who do choose to
legalize gambling, that Congress brings some consistency in terms of how
that's done in those states. So that -- for instance, in our league, we have
schools in 10 states. We could have 10 different set of processes and
regulations and requirements to deal with. We'd much rather have one.  
  
Obviously Congress is not going to step in and tell the states they can't
legalize it. Congress, I think, could exempt amateur sports or collegiate
athletics or high school athletics.  
  
I don't know whether that will happen or not. Candidly, that would be my first
choice. But I don't necessarily expect that to happen. But it could happen.  
  
So there's a lot of clarity that will need to be brought to this, and we're
going to need to continue to understand what it can mean to us and what we as
a conference, what our institutions at the campus level would need to do in
terms of educating our players, what it would mean in terms of the people
around our players.  
  
Does it create an environment where young people think, well, it's legal,
therefore it's okay -- there's nothing wrong with this. And then does that
make it easier to infiltrate into affecting the outcome of games? College
athletics has been there before, a long, long time ago. And we certainly don't
want to be back there again.  
  
But it's going on anyway. We get that. It's happening. It's happening
illegally. What does legalizing it mean? So we're laying the groundwork on
that. And we brought in some legal advisors that have been prominently
involved with Europe and the Premier League in Europe and legalized gambling
there.  
  
So that's what we're in the process of doing now. They've been very helpful,
too. Very insightful.  
  
And I think you asked about the injury reports. We were the only one doing
that. And it was kind of a gentleman's agreement. Our coaches decided they
would not rather do it this year, as all of this started playing out. I think
there will need to -- I think we need that going forward. It's not just an
injury. It could be -- I guess you'd call it player availability because you
can have suspensions or other situations that can come up where a player might
not be playing, and in the legalized gambling world I think that needs to be
there.  
  
Q. You talked about television and the 20-game schedule kind of
separately but we hear they're interconnected. How did you weigh the value of
playing conference games in November and just how much did television impact
that?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: It had an impact. I think there are a lot of reasons to
do a 20-game schedule even without television. Television adds another reason
to do so. Probably makes it a little tougher on the coaches. But I suspect
most of you welcome that. I think fans welcome that.  
  
So I think it will be popular. Having our own channel is a factor in that,
because we need quality inventory and there's nothing of any higher quality,
generally speaking, than two ACC basketball teams playing each other.  
  
And the early season, you know, we've talked a lot about how do you tip off
the basketball season in a way that you kick off the football season? And
that's really hard to do, because of obvious circumstances. And our
discussions have been more national about that.  
  
This is a way we can sort of address it just as a conference in terms of
tipping off the year. And if you go back -- gosh, you can go back in the '60s,
there were ACC conference games in December in the '60s. A lot of people
forget that. I think it will be fun. I think it will be a terrific thing.  
  
Q. Would this basically be everyone plays one conference game at the
start of the season and then it's all non-conference until end of December or
it will be coupled conference games for everybody in November? How will that
be working out?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: There will be a couple before Christmas and then it
will get back into the more normal flow.  
  
Q. Will they all be on the new channel or will these November games be
spread out among different -- ESPN, that kind of thing?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: They'll be spread out but some of them will definitely
be on the ACC channel.  
  
Q. Whose idea was this and are the coaches being kind of dragged,
kicking and screaming, along with this idea, or what was kind of their
reaction there?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: No, they bought into the idea pretty readily, actually.
Kind of coming out of the discussions about how do you give some bang, so to
speak, to the start of the season.  
  
Q. You touched on this briefly with your answer here. But as far as when
it comes to a lot of coaches saying that they don't feel like their teams are
ready to play a team of an ACC caliber right off the bat, how do you go about
making sure that those fears are quelled? And also, when it comes to non-
conference scheduling, to make sure that that still stays up to par with the
rest of the teams?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, that becomes institutional. And I'm not real
worried about the non-conference scheduling staying up to par where it should.
If it doesn't, of course the additional couple of conference games enhances
your schedule right there. But I think you'll still see quality non-conference
games going on. I don't think our schools are all of a sudden going to quit
playing those kinds of games for a lot of reasons.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Brandon Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36122)

### [Jose Alvarado](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36123)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia Tech.  
  
Q. Coach, this is your third season. Every coach talks about a building
process, where do you think you are in your building process?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, I would like to say, first, that Coach Cremins is here
and I want to go on record saying how many times I have asked him to actually
coach with me during the game and sit on the bench, and he's such a nice
person that he never wants to do that. But I said: Your name is on the court.
You can -- I'll move over -- I'll be the associate head coach for that game.  
  
But I want to give a great shoutout to one of the all-time greats ever in
Coach Cremins being here.  
  
But we're in year three and I really like our team. Obviously we're still
building the right way, and I believe in our vision of how we want to get
there and how Georgia Tech wants it to be done and what our -- obviously our
goals is to be knocking on the doors to be in that NCAA Tournament and all
those good things.  
  
But we still take it one day at a time. I've got the two young men, to my left
Brandon Alston and Jose to my right, helping us get to where we need to get
to. And we're still in a situation where it's important for our team and our
program that when we're on the floor that we make sure that we take care of
the basketball, that we don't beat ourselves so we're really good defensively
the way we cut, how hard we cut, all those type of things that go with that,
that we control -- control the controllables and really do our job in that
area.  
  
And if we can do that, we can put ourselves in a chance to have success. So
we're looking forward to this year. I like our group. And we're excited to get
-- kick it off with games coming up here, first game is November 9th versus
Lamar.  
  
Q. Jose, you were cooking pretty well last year your freshman year until
you got hurt. What was your mindset when the injury did happen, again because
you had so much great momentum going, and what have you done since to make
sure you're ready for this year?  
JOSE ALVARADO: My mindset was the same getting injured. It definitely affected
me as a person because I love the game of basketball.  
  
But when I knew I couldn't come back, I knew my role was still the same,
getting my teammates involved, getting my teammates knowing that I'm going to
support them as much as I can on the bench.  
  
And rehab was very difficult getting back to my motion of it, but I had great
people around me, my teammates, the staff, the coaching and my family
definitely helped me and it really went well and I'm glad I had those people
around me.  
  
Q. Brandon, you're sort of the old guy in the group here. Graduate
student. Got your degree in three years from Lehigh. What is it about your
drive, what is it that gets you going to where you are as focused as you are,
and what have you learned in this basketball journey of yours?  
BRANDON ALSTON: I think my parents have always instilled in me that if you're
going to do something try to be the best you can. Or there's no reason to do
it.  
  
So I think just trying to strive to be better every day is just something
that's always been a part of me and always looking, being your hardest critic.
So when other people critique you it's not that bad because you know there's
always more you can give even on good games. So that's always been something
that I try to pride myself in.  
  
Q. Jose, how do you describe your teammate to your left?  
JOSE ALVARADO: Great guy. He wants the best for all of us, not just himself.
He cares about the team, and he just wants to motivate all of us to be the
best that we can be on and off the court.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about being comfortable with the team you have. This
time next year when we're having media day, who do you think are going to be
the names you'll be talking about having a great '18/'19 season?  
COACH PASTNER: I'm hoping these two guys. I also want to give a shoutout to
Brandon, he did get his economics degree from Lehigh university in three
years, and he's going to get his Master's from Georgia Tech in economics in
the spring, which is extremely impressive.  
  
I hope I'm talking about these two guys next season and a few other guys.
We'll see how we are. We need to get on the floor and play against another
opponent instead of ourselves.  
  
We've worked hard. We've conditioned a lot. We've kept at it. Obviously we
lost some seniors and lost Josh Okogie to the NBA draft. Gives other guys like
Jose and Brandon, other guys on our team, opportunities to step up to the
challenge and really help us move the needle. Also want to give a shoutout to
LaPhonso Ellis, even though he's not a Georgia Tech grad, he's a class act and
an amazing human being as well. I wish he had some eligibility so we could
recruit him to play for us. He still looks like he can play. Though he told me
he doesn't play any defense anymore. But we need some help offensively. If he
could still shoot it, I would put him on the roster.  
  
Q. Josh, Ben Lammers has moved on. Obviously a great passer. The guy
that seems to be the guy to next step up would be Abdoulaye Gueye. Tell me
about where he was this summer, your expectations of him, and what do you
expect of him coming in this season?  
COACH PASTNER: As you know, you watched us play. We did a lot through Ben.
Literally every time we came down he touched the ball and we played through
him and he was a great passer.  
  
So we'll have to be a little bit different on that. Because AD is different
than Ben, and Abdoulaye Gueye is different than Ben Lammers in that situation.
But the one thing that Abdoulaye Gueye is better than Ben's at -- and he's one
of the guys who maybe -- he's probably one of the better in the country
personally, I believe -- is being able to score, you could throw it to him and
score.  
  
And he's not a guy that can just overpower you. He has enough skill that he
can shoot a right-hand and left-hand jump hook and make it. As you know,
that's not ordinary in this day and age.  
  
So he can score with his back to the basket. We're able to throw it to him and
he's able to put the ball in the basket. We'll have to do more of that, maybe
not so much from the high post from him, but from the low back, trying to get
him to be able to score the ball from down there, because he's able to do
that.  
  
Q. Brandon, when you look over your right shoulder you see the floor
here of the Spectrum Center where the tournament will be played in March being
here today, does that give you a bit of a leg up in understanding what the
season is about and where it's all going to conclude, the regular season of
the tournament, anyway?  
BRANDON ALSTON: Yes and no. You can see the immensity of the moment. You've
got ESPN here. People you see on TV all the time here, the cameras. But
playing in the ACC, you kind of know what comes with it every night.  
  
I used to laugh with my brother because when you looked at the schedule,
before, when I was at Lehigh, I used to look at the schedule and I'd be like:
All right, we've got these three games, got to do my best for these three
games.  
  
Now I look at the schedule and it's like every single night -- we play
Tennessee the second game of the season. So it's really exciting knowing that
you just get to compete at that high level all the time and not just for a few
games out of the season.  
  
Q. Jose, same question.  
JOSE ALVARADO: I mean, this is a great environment. But I wish I played last
year in the Barclays Center because that's where I'm from. But down here like
Brandon what he was saying is exactly right: We play in the ACC. Every night
it's a dogfight as far as you've got to come in with 110 what you got.  
  
You can't just come in thinking one day you can take a day off. No, that can't
happen in this league. You've got to give everything you've got every game no
matter who is in front of you.  
  
COACH PASTNER: I just want to say with Jose, when we recruited him, we sold --
I mean, hit on hard with Coach Cremins about that, selling about Coach Cremins
and his pipeline that he had in New York, when he got it going back in the
day.  
  
And so I told Jose he's got a lot of big-time shoes to fill coming from that
New York guard and so we hit on that hard.  
  
I told him, though, I said, look, I'm not going to be as good of a coach as
Coach Cremins, but you need to be as good as Kenny Anderson and Stephon
Marbury. If you can do that, I'll look almost as good as Coach Cremins then.  
  
Him getting injured last year obviously hurt us toward the end, because he was
playing really well and starting to turn the corner.  
  
I can see now in his maturation and Jose's maturity, it's very evident in
practice, even on the defensive end, he's taking -- how serious he's taken on
the defensive end.  
  
And Brandon has gotten so much better. Like he said, the competition level, I
think, that he played against last year has risen his game. It's allowed him
to understand what he's got to do in the offseason to work -- usually for
graduate transfers, you only get them for one year. We were fortunate with
Brandon we get him for two, and he can take from last year's learning
opportunity moving into this season.  
  
Q. You welcome a freshman class that is touted as 46th in the nation. 46
out of 351-some-odd schools. Is the number important to you? Obviously the
kids and type of people you're bringing into the program is important, but do
you strive to be top 20 with a freshman class? Is that a metric that
matters?  
COACH PASTNER: Absolutely not. I think the entire key thing on metric is
evaluation. I think everyone talks about recruiting and recruiting,
recruiting. It's evaluating.  
  
I'll give an example of Notre Dame. Matt Farrell. Who was it, Notre Dame, and
a low Division I, mid-major, he was a two-star guy. The guy was really good.  
  
Josh Okogie wasn't ranked in the top ten players in Georgia, three-star
recruit. And the guy is now starting for the Minnesota Timberwolves two years
later.  
  
So I think people can get caught up in rankings but it's really the
evaluation. It's all about the evaluation in the recruiting aspect of it, of
evaluating the right person for your program and then being able to develop
them to an ACC level player.  
  
But I think, yes, the ranking stuff, it's all well and good. But in the end
it's about production on the floor, and the way you produce is on how you
evaluate making sure guys can come in and help you.  
  
So I think there's plenty of two-star players that are ranked two stars that
are really, really good. And there's probably a lot of five-star guys out
there that are over overhyped.  
  
Q. Brandon, what's your role and responsibility of being a teacher,
given all that you have seen?  
BRANDON ALSTON: Trying to bring intensity every game. We had a lot of games
last year where Coach always tells us we've got to win the games, not just
against the hardest competition in our schedule, but also the games like first
game of the season against Lamar.  
  
So I think it's really important for me to bring that intensity on those type
of games also because younger players might not be as hyped up. That's not
necessarily why they came to Georgia Tech.  
  
So just little things like that. And then when things go bad is really when --
especially in practice -- when me and Jose have to show leadership qualities.
When everybody is good and everybody's making shots, it's okay and nothing
needs to be said. But when you go on an 0-8 run or start up a game, when
you're running and Coach is having one of those days where he's a little bit
more hyped up, you really gotta make sure that things don't get out of hand.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of team do you think you'll have when you come back
here in March?  
COACH PASTNER: You know, to be determined. I mean, we've got to continue to
get better. We're still a work in progress. I like our team a lot. I really,
really do. I'm projecting that we're going to be a really good, much better
shooting team from 3-point range than we've been in our last two years. We've
been dead last in 3-point line in the ACC. So we've got to be better in that
area.  
  
I wanted to get back who we were in year one. We were an elite defensive team.
Last year we were good defensive. But we've got to get back to elite and a
team that takes care of the ball, values the ball.  
  
We're not in a position where we can make silly, careless turnovers and expect
to win games. We've got to be so good and so sound. And I use the words --
we've got to really play a clean, mature basketball game. That's how we've got
to play every time we step on the floor we've got to be very clean and mature.
And that's with everything that we do and the stuff that we can control.  
  
So we'll see how we are, and I'm excited for us and we've got a tough
schedule. And I tell our guys all the time: Everybody's good. In this day and
age, there are no gimmes, everybody's good and everybody's got talent. Yes,
you're playing against in the ACC the best of the best, but even the other
games when maybe the names aren't as familiar, all those teams are good. And
if you take off one possession, you're going to get beat.  
  
And we always talk about motor. Like your motor has to be on running at such a
high octane level every moment, and if you don't, if it's not running like
that you've got a good chance to get beat. And it's just the motor, the motor,
the motor.  
  
That engine's gotta go every second and if not then you know you're going to
get beat. No matter if it's an ACC play or non-conference games.  
  
Q. Jose, because you were close to that podium, when I asked that
question, I heard and saw you react; what kind of team do you think you'll be
back in March?  
JOSE ALVARADO: Me and my teammates, I don't think no one understands how much
we matured, even the young guys coming in as freshmen and sophomores. And last
year we didn't go -- my freshman year we were like we're going to do this, do
this. It didn't go as well as we wanted it to.  
  
I think ever since then we changed our whole mindset. Like I said before, our
practice is more intense. And, like, Coach -- he's seen us improve. But I
don't think he knows how ready we are. Like in the locker room I'm telling you
it's a different vibe. It's like I think all our teammates -- like we're all
ready for what we're here to do.  
  
I think we're done losing. I think we're ready to win. Like no one likes
losing, and I think everyone knows that. And I think the guys are ready to
show that we're not here just to just play basketball. We're here to show to
bring Georgia Tech back to where it was.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Chaundee Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36126)

### [Brandon Childress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32821)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome in the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest. Who wants our
first question?  
  
Q. Brandon, you're stepping into a role as the point guard of this team.
How have you prepared for that? We talked in the summer about how you were
preparing. Since then, what have you been doing as the season quickly
approaches?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I'm just taking it one day at a time, cherishing these
moments with these guys, building the chemistry, building a better bond
between one another, helping these guys out.  
  
A lot of young guys on the team, a lot of new faces. Four of us returning from
last year. Basically we got a whole new team. Just showing them how we do
things over here at Wake Forest.  
  
I'm probably maybe the only guy on the team besides an Anthony Bilas and Aaron
Spivey in terms of post-season success, in terms of making it to the NCAA
tournament. Helping them out with that so we can get back in the swing of
things and put Wake Forest back on the map and put the program where it needs
to be going.  
  
Q. Brandon and coach, obviously last year didn't finish the way you
would have liked. Besides the incoming freshmen, what is different about this
team this year that should flip the script?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: Our versatility is going to be a big thing for us. We got a
lot of guys that can play multiple positions. We didn't have a lot of that
last year. I think this year that will help us out a lot, especially how we
transition on to this new year.  
  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I like to agree with what Brandon just mentioned. I think
our versatility this year will be something we'll be able to lean on at
different points throughout the course of the season, whether it's defensively
or offensively. Just the mix of guys.  
  
Yeah, we have a lot of new blood, but this group has kind of bonded really
well. They're very well connected. They go out and they compete at a high
level. That's something that for us as a coaching staff we enjoy and we
respect.  
  
We have to continue to take steps each and every day. But we're looking
forward to stepping out on the court and representing our university and our
program in a way we feel like it needs to be represented. That's at the
highest competitive level.  
  
Q. What did you learn about yourself and college basketball in your
freshman year, Chaundee?  
CHAUNDEE BROWN: This is a tough conference. Every day you got to bring it.
You're playing one of the best teams in the conference. You got to bring it
every day. You can't take days off. You got to stack days, like Coach Manning
has been telling us every day. We have to buy into the principles they've been
teaching us and just come together.  
  
Q. You had a good recruiting year. What do you expect the five freshmen
will be able to contribute this year?  
DANNY MANNING: We feel like they're a very talented group. We feel like they
have an opportunity or will have an opportunity to have a contribution
throughout the course of the year.  
  
But they're also freshmen. At some point in time, all of them had really
special moments in practice, then they've all had their freshmen moments, as
well.  
  
For us, it's going to be continuing to challenge them, encourage them to enjoy
the process. It's not something that's going to happen overnight. Chaundee for
us played quite a few minutes last year as a true freshman, about 20 minutes a
game, started every game for us. There were some nights last year that he
played really, really well, then there were some nights he was a freshman.
That's to be expected.  
  
The biggest thing is making sure you stay encouraged throughout the course of
the process, getting better, challenging your teammates to get better, go out
there on the court and find ways to help your team be successful.  
  
This freshman group has definitely come in and been willing to do that. The
two guys on my left and right are part of the reason we had that mindset,
because they are helping these guys in this process.  
  
Q. Danny, you mentioned a couple weeks ago the versatility for this team
wasn't quite there yet. Update on that. Then also when you mentioned
versatility, I'm curious, is your philosophy on whether it means kind of the
position-less basketball or multiple guys able to play multiple spots two
through five, one through five?  
DANNY MANNING: To be honest with you, I think it's all the above. I think we
have a chance to be extremely versatile. In order to be versatile, you have to
know multiple spots. So we've got a lot of guys that we're teaching spots to.
They're picking it up. But we still have to continue to work, to have a better
understanding of those spots.  
  
As far as how we want to play, we think with our skill set and versatility, we
have a lot of guys that we can put in different positions out on the court,
take advantage of certain things in terms of matchups and things of that
nature.  
  
It's early on. Getting freshmen to know, Hey, you need to learn this spot, now
you need to learn this spot, that spot. It just takes a little bit of time. We
feel they do have the skill set and the talent to be versatile, but we also
have to understand all those positions and what we're looking for, as well.  
  
Q. How much more difficult is it to establish versatility when you're
trying to work in five freshmen and two grad transfers, some newcomers
there?  
DANNY MANNING: That's our challenge (laughter). It is what it is.  
  
I think for us as a coaching staff, our guys have come in, they compete at a
high level. They have a thirst for trying to understand bigger things ut,
whether it's coming in the office and talking with coaches about different
things we're trying to accomplish defensively or offensively, coming in and
watching film, looking at mistakes, figuring out ways to try to eliminate
those mistakes.  
  
As long as we continue with that mindset, that's going to speed up that
learning curve.  
  
Q. Chaundee, with 10 new guys on the roster, at what point in the summer
did you look around and be like, Who are all these guys?  
CHAUNDEE BROWN: It didn't hit me till, like, the middle of the summer. When we
first started practicing, a lot of people didn't know the plays, did not
really realize that a lot of people went out and a lot of people come in. We
just got to buy in as a group.  
  
I'm glad we had the summer to get the freshmen on campus, to get them to know
the drills, some of the plays.  
  
I would say the middle of the summer when I realized it.  
  
Q. Coach Manning, obviously the FBI investigation in college basketball
has been a big talk for really the last year. I wanted to ask you, because as
a former elite college basketball player, now a coach, has any of this kind of
surprised you? What are your thoughts as far as what's been going on?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, for us, it's certainly something that has caught the
attention and brought a lot of additional attention to our sport. But right
now I think we're still in the fact-finding phases of this situation or this
ordeal. I think there are a lot of other things that will come about.  
  
When you look at our game of basketball in college, I think it's at a good
place. I think we have one of the premier events when you talk about the Final
Four, all of athletics. That's something that is very special, regardless of
whether you're talking about the Super Bowl or the NBA Finals or the World
Series. The Final Four from college basketball ranks up there.  
  
I think our game is in a very unique place in terms of the attention that
we're getting because of this. I don't think it's as bad as what it's
portrayed out there. Obviously there's some smoke, but we don't know the
extent of the fire. We're still trying to figure that out.  
  
I still think college basketball's a wonderful sport. We've got to continue to
help these young people use this sport to gain their education and hopefully
have a professional career of some sort, and if not, get prepared for life.  
  
Q. Brandon, an assistant coach, who happens to be your dad. It's one
thing to be a high school student in which you're coming home to dad every
day, but now you're seeing him every day.  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: It's definitely an adjustment. Biggest thing for me coming
in as a freshman, understanding, taking coaching, understanding that taking it
from Coach Childress and dad. That's kind of the battle I had in the
beginning. As time comes along, things have gotten much better before. I'm not
saying it was bad before, but it's an adjustment from, Hey, dad how can I do
this, to, That's Coach Childress talking to me, coaching me, telling me what
to do, how to become whether it's a better leader, my jump shot, putting guys
in the right spots and things like that.  
  
Sometimes it's intriguing just to hear like, This is my dad talking to me,
then I have to snap out of it, understand that this it's Coach Childress.  
  
One thing I do like about our coaching staff, Coach Manning can vouch for
this, his son went through the same thing in college. I talk to Evan a lot
about going through it now. Evan helps me out a lot with this. I appreciate
him every day, giving me advice on taking coaching from your father, not
taking it personal, just understanding that it's Coach Childress, not my
father talking to me, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you gave a half smile in there. What has been your perspective
of that evolution either with the Childresses or Mannings?  
DANNY MANNING: I went through it. My father was an assistant coach in Kansas.
We kind of coined the phrase that coaches' kids probably get a little more
aggressive counseling than other people at certain times because you get that
24/7 when you go home. Understanding that.  
  
But it comes from a good place. He understands that we want what's best for
him, we want what's best for all of our student-athletes. We're very
fortunate.  
  
The one thing that does not get enough credit for us as college coaches, we
get a chance to impact lives every day. We get a chance to coach these young
men and help prepare them. It's no different from Brandon. He just happens to
be one of our sons.  
  
We're going to coach and help prepare him, get him prepared for life, just
like anyone else. To me, I think it's kind of a cool story that you're able to
be with your father day in and day out. He can see that growth, from the
father's side, not necessarily a coach side, but the father side. I think
that's pretty cool.  
  
Q. At the previous press conference, Leonard Hamilton was talking about
growing up an ACC fan, talked about his excitement about having the tournament
in Charlotte. You grew up in North Carolina. What are your thoughts as someone
who grew up an ACC fan and is now an ACC coach about having the tournament
cycle here for a couple years?  
DANNY MANNING: I like it in this area (smiling). Obviously for me, growing up,
I remember being in junior high, I remember being in elementary school,
teachers rolling in TVs, plugging them in. They're still teaching class, but
you're watching the games on TV. That was just a great time.  
  
Even so for me, the NCAA tournament is a huge deal. But growing up in this
area, it's the ACC tournament. That's the tournament that you always talked
about.  
  
So I enjoy it in this area. I think our area has embraced it. To me, it just
feeling right being in this general vicinity.  
  
Q. Chaundee, what kind of team are you bringing back here in March?  
CHAUNDEE BROWN: A winning team, most of all. Like Coach Manning was saying
earlier, very versatile, a lot of newcomers, freshmen, grad transfers. We can
just buy in and switch up positions, switch up defenses. We'll use our length.  
  
Q. Does it help you to see this building today as you think about the
season and the progress that it's going to take to get to March?  
CHAUNDEE BROWN: It does. It does most of all. That's our goal since the
beginning of the summer, since we got on campus, just to get here.  
  
Q. Chaundee, what has been one of the things that's impressed you or the
main thing about the freshmen so far?  
CHAUNDEE BROWN: I would say the bond they have with each other. They're really
close. They came in, a lot of chemistry. They acted like they know each other
for years already.  
  
As a team, it's like that right now. We act like we've been knowing each other
for years, hang out on weekends, we don't have practices, get food after
practices, whatever we're dealing. It feels like a whole bonding team.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have to have a trophy to call the year successful?  
DANNY MANNING: It helps (smiling).  
  
You know what, I mean, a lot of it, too, is everybody's definition of success.
For us, we want to obviously win as many basketball games as we possibly can.
That's part of the equation or the definition of success.  
  
But also it's seeing your young people walk across that stage and get their
diploma. It's also seeing them five years down the road when they bring their
son and their daughter to practice. It's also seven years down the road when
they get a promotion at the job and now they become one of the leaders of the
company that they're working at.  
  
The definition of success is very broad. At the end of the day we want to help
all of our young people we come in contact with get prepared for life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Wake Forest, thank you. Good luck this year.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, welcome to the league, or welcome back to the league. What
have your impressions been like today?  
CHRIS MACK: It's been great. Obviously, when you have Media Day, you know
basketball season is right around the corner, and for our guys, the first true
test comes this Sunday against Bellarmine exhibition, and before you know it,
we'll be battling Nicholas State on November 8th.  
  
So the start of basketball season is right around the corner. We've used this
time over the summer and early fall to try to learn personalities, gain
relationships with the guys on our team, and in the hopes that we can build
trust between the coaching staff and players, and try to get to the point
where terminology becomes consistent and becomes instinctive for our guys, and
really try to build towards a season, hopefully, one that we'll remember for a
while.  
  
Q. Chris, you've seen quite a bit in your collegiate career. What has
been your impression over the last couple of months in terms of the change in
leadership in Louisville?  
CHRIS MACK: I think it's been a positive one. I think so much has been talked
about our program over the last year, two years, that hasn't put Louisville
basketball in the greatest of light. But the players I have on our team and
the ones in the locker room that I coach every day are high-character guys,
and guys that I've really enjoyed coaching and being around. We've got a lot
of work to do, and I think they'd be the first to tell you.  
  
But I think the willingness to improve, and the willingness to learn has been
really good, and it's been a very enjoyable ride so far, and we're looking
forward to a very productive season in one of the toughest leagues, if not the
toughest league in all of the country.  
  
Q. Athletic directors talk about having a 100-day plan when they take
the chair administratively. Did you have a 100-day plan? Did you have a
120-day plan? Was there a process of months or weeks that you had going into
it?  
CHRIS MACK: I had a one-day plan, and that was figure out what I needed to do
that next day. You know, you get thrown so many different things and you're
trying to do them all at the same time. From hiring a coaching staff to
learning personalities of your players and their families, just learning your
way around the city and the school, and who you need to lean on. So there's a
ton of stuff that's thrown at you.  
  
It's old hat in a way, because it's what you did at your previous stop, but
it's in a whole new place. So it's been a quick transition. The six months
have flown by. But it's been a great one at the same time.  
  
Q. V.J., what are your impressions of this new staff and this new era
that is starting to unfold for Louisville basketball?  
V.J. KING: I thought they've done a great job up to this point. I feel like
we've established a totally new culture, and like Coach Mack said, it's been a
positive for us, and I think we're headed in the right direction.  
  
Q. Christen, same question of you. Your impressions, and you're not
allowed to say, same thing.  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, the coaching staff has been great. They came in
right away and started establishing a new culture. I mean, they're different
from what I've been accustomed to, but they've done a great job, and we're
looking forward to a great year.  
  
Q. Coach, in putting together your coaching staff, how much of the
assembly of the staff was based on your personality, that of the school, that
of the league? As you put it together, how strategic did you need to be?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't worry about all that. I want people that I can trust,
people that I've had established relationships with that know how to coach the
game of basketball and that are high-character people. So it wouldn't matter
if I was coaching in the ACC or the MEAC, I would want the same thing.  
  
So I brought with me Luke Murray and Mike Pegues who had been on my staff for
several years at Xavier. I hired Dino Gaudio who was probably covering this
event a year ago and was a guy that coached me at Xavier, and I've had the
utmost respect for over the years. And all the administrative guys that are on
my coaching staff I've viewed the same way. I want them to be high-character
people that I can trust. I think that's the most important thing.  
  
Q. Christen, it says in the media guide that you have been elected a
team captain along with V.J. What does it mean to be a captain?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: It means a lot. It just shows that my teammates hold me
at a high standard, and they felt like I was capable of leading them this
year. So it meant a lot to me. Each day I come to work, I keep that in mind
with the decisions I make and how diligently I go about my work each day.  
  
Q. V.J., is there pressure in being a captain?  
V.J. KING: I wouldn't say pressure. I think the word we'd use would be more
responsibility. Kind of piggybacking off what C.C. said, just having that in
mind that our teammates did choose us as captains and to keep that in the back
of our minds when we come every day, we go to class every day, we come to
workouts or whatever it is that we do, that our teammates are always looking
up to us and that we are that example to set for them, so we have to be at our
best, even when we may not be. Like I said, it's been a great honor up to this
point.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned exhibiting against Bellarmine this upcoming
weekend. Is the team ready for its first game? We had a coach earlier say
we're almost ready, but we're not quite there yet. What is your status at this
point?  
CHRIS MACK: Regardless of whether we're ready or not, I think it's needed. I
think players feel like they could go two or three practices, and all right,
Coach, we're ready to play. And I think coaches need three, four, five months
to start their first game before they play their first game.  
  
So, it is what it is. I think we'll learn a lot from it. I think every
experience that you have both positively and negatively you learn from it. If
you don't, you're not getting better. So I'm excited to see how Sunday plays
out. We still have some practices to go prior to that. But that will be a good
measuring stick of things that we need to get better at.  
  
Q. Chris, your first year at Xavier as head coach was my first year at
ESPN, and of course I was in the A-10 at that time, and got a chance to know
the DNA of your teams very well. How much offensively and defensively, and I
know you may not have the personnel that you had established at Xavier, but
how much of your offensive and defensive philosophies should I plan on seeing
this year?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, I'd like to think that defensively we'd be very similar. You
know, we brought the same belief and the same style of play and the same
terminology that we used at Xavier all those many years because it's what our
staff's most comfortable with. I feel like you can win on the road with that
style. You can win against the best teams with that style. It relies on being
together. It relies on communication. It relies on toughness.  
  
Offensively we'll be a little different than Louisville teams in the past. I
think offensively a good coach puts his players in the best position to be
successful, and, a year ago if I would have taken Louisville basketball, I
would have probably coached offensively a little different because of the
personnel they had.  
  
But we're not last year's team. So we don't have a plethora of five-men. So
we're going to have to be a little unique with how we play. I think our guys
are getting better every single day. As long as we play the right way, and by
that, I mean playing together, making the correct decision, making the correct
pass, I think you can be successful offensively.  
  
But plays from one year to the next will be tweaked and changed just depending
on who we have on our team and what they do well.  
  
Q. Christen, going back to leadership, there is always a young crop of
new student-athletes on a team. What is your role in coaching them along?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Just making sure that they're comfortable each day. That
they have a good understanding of what Coach Mack and the staff are trying to
implement for that day. Like understanding terminology and things like that,
just holding them accountable. Making sure if anybody starts slacking that,
you know, not being afraid to confront them, whether it's in front of the team
or off to the side.  
  
But just always making sure that they're locked in and ready to go.  
  
Q. Chris, you inherit kind of the job and the questions about some of
the things going on in college basketball today at the end of your time
downstairs you were asked about the verdict that came down in the trial
recently. What effect, if any, do you think those things have on the
University of Louisville, and what you're doing?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, it's my understanding that Louisville wasn't on trial. So,
you know, certainly we've operated under that cloud of suspicion all around
the country.  
  
But there are a lot of good things that are happening. I'm represented by a
great group of young men that are high-character. So my focus has only been on
tomorrow's practice, the next day's practice, Bellarmine on Sunday, and at
some point we'll have to worry about that. But right now is not the time for
at least me.  
  
I'm more concerned about C.C.'s experience as his one and only shot playing
for the university of Louisville.  
  
Q. Coach, we've asked some of our head coaches about building out a non-
conference schedule, and obviously because of your hiring you haven't had too
much of a hand in this year's non-conference schedule. But does it help that
as a new head coach you do have a fairly high number of games at home before
having to get on the road and create that are strategy, that infrastructure of
travel, and movement and all of that?  
CHRIS MACK: You must not have looked at the opponents of who we were playing
both home and away. You know, I think for us, the non-conference part of the
schedule is all about challenging ourselves and preparing ourselves for ACC
play. I don't know if a program has done a better job with their non-
conference, of which I take zero credit, and our coaching staff takes zero
credit, because that schedule, like you said, was probably 98% of the way
through before I accepted the position.  
  
So we'll have one of the most challenging schedules in all of college
basketball but history will show the Selection Committee favors those teams
that go out and aren't afraid to play anybody. So no one's going to accuse us
of being afraid to play anybody, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Whether
we play at home or on the road is really inconsequential because they're all
good teams.  
  
Q. Players, one of the interesting questions that have come up here
today, and it actually came from the floor from a member of the media early on
today, was what kind of team will you have when you come back here in March?
Now, granted, it's one game at a time, it's one month at a time, but as you
think about coming back here, what kind of team do you hope you'll come back
with, V.J.?  
V.J. KING: Right now I'm not worried about March right now. Like I said, we're
preparing for Sunday, to get ready for that first exhibition. We're taking
this day by day. If we compete and continue to get better, like we have been
each and every single day I feel like we put ourselves in a good position to
be where we want to be in March when that time comes.  
  
Q. Christen?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, with the preconference schedule we have -- I don't
think we can begin to worry about March at this point. After we finish that
we'll deal with the conference schedule we have.  
  
But, I think it's every team's goal to be playing our best basketball at the
end of the season. That's when it matters, so we're going to focus on working
day by day, game by game, and that will take care of itself.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Dewan Hernandez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36129)

### [Anthony Lawrence](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36130)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, as we think about this being in October and knowing that
we're back here in March, what type of team would you like to come back to
this arena with in a couple of months.  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well personally I would like to come back with a championship
team. A team that plays great defense, does an outstanding job of sharing the
ball on offense, we have got great group of guys who are working towards that
goal.  
  
Q. Anthony, what's your expectation you're a senior and I don't know how
that happened so quickly, it just seemed like just the other day you were a
freshman. So what's your expectation this year?  
ANTHONY LAWRENCE: Personally I want to get back to the NCAA tournament and win
an ace championship this year.  
  
Q. Dewan, a long season ahead obviously and everybody's enthusiastic
right now at practice. Is this the type of team, does it have the personality
to keep that high energy up for the entire season?  
DEWAN HERNANDEZ: Definitely. We have a bunch of guys that just want to win and
have fun, so when you look at winning teams, that's where it starts.  
  
Q. You you've got a new crop of kids coming in. As ever program does
every year. This time next year when we're reflecting on the '18-' 19 season
what are the names of the young people that we think that are going to be
highlighted for us this year?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, we have several young players who I think will be
tremendous contributors for us. Chris Lykes is a sophomore, he's a dynamic
little point guard, he's a high octane scorer, but he also can be a real pest
defensively and we need him to be our quarterback, our leader, the guy who is
the catalyst of our offense and defense. So he's one key player. We have a
sophomore by the name of Deng Gak who will be new to ACC fans, he's 6'-11",
he's long, he's athletic, he's got a lot of potential, we think he's going to
be an outstanding player. And then Anthony Mack. He's a transfer student from
Wyoming, he's a sophomore, he has long range shooting ability, but he's also
very strong and very tough minded.  
  
Q. Dewan, you just about doubled your scoring totals from your freshman
year to your sophomore year. Not that there's an expectation for you to double
it yet again for your junior year, but what does this say about the evolution
of your game, the time that you were a freshman to the time that you're now a
Junior?  
DEWAN HERNANDEZ: I think it just shows the ability for me to get better,
that's all it shows. With hard work, that's all I did all summer, I think it's
going to happen again my junior year.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you describe Dewan in one word?  
ANTHONY LAWRENCE: Goofy.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. That's not exactly what I was expecting, but why goofy?  
ANTHONY LAWRENCE: Always laughing, very fun to be around, playing around all
the time.  
  
Q. Anthony, you get equal time if you want to describe your teammate in
one word. I mean, Dewan, if you want to describe Anthony in one word.  
DEWAN HERNANDEZ: He's a cool dude.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously this is a team that sort of likes each other, at
least by these two guys. Is that going to be a personality that's going to
help you out this year?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well I think these two young men have great personalities, they
work very well together. Dewan is obviously the big man inside for us, but he
also has added range to his jump shot, he can knock down the three-point shot.
Amp, who plays multiple positions can shoot the 3, he's great at driving the
ball to the basket, but the one thing that he does maybe better than anybody,
he really finds the open man, he's very team oriented. He was coached by his
dad in high school and you can see the characteristics and skills that he has
developed from the high school ranks all the way through his four years in
college.  
  
Q. One of the interesting questions that came up earlier today was the
type of non-conference schedule you put together in anticipation of the league
season as well as the entire season. What is it about the strategy of the
teams that you put on the non-conference schedule that helps prepare you for
the in-season schedule, the league schedule?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well we have had a scheduling philosophy for many, many years
and it's always been to put a competitive schedule together to prepare us for
the ACC and also to win an at-large bid. We try to schedule four games of
people in what is now known as quadrant one, four non-conference games in
quadrant one, four in quadrant two, and then four in quadrants three and four.
If you have good balance in your schedule, with good home games and really
strong competitive away games and neutral site games, we think that prepares
you for the ACC.  
  
Q. Even though it's one game at a time, do you ever look at the
conference season and think about the rotation of home games against the
amount of time on the road or who those opponents are?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, I try to avoid looking at our conference schedule too far
in advance because it gives me a headache knowing how good they are. Last year
we ended the season with a game at Notre Dame, at North Carolina, then home
against Virginia Tech and it took three great wins to put us in the NCAA
tournament. So looking down the road is always hard in this conference.  
  
Q. Anthony, when you think about your senior year, to be successful do
you have to have a trophy? I know that it helps to win a championship, but to
have a successful season, senior season do you have to win a title?  
ANTHONY LAWRENCE: Of course that's the main goal, but if that doesn't happen
just to have a great year, go far in the tournament, in the ACC tournament,
and just to have a lot of great memories in my senior year, that's a
successful senior year.  
  
Q. Any one venue that you'll be excited to play in because you know it
will be your last time playing there?  
ANTHONY LAWRENCE: Cameron Indoor is one of the venues I like to play in.  
  
Q. In the past you had a chance to end our media session with you with a
great story, we talked a couple years ago about how you were mistaken for
Larry David, last year you told us about how it is that you kept your lunch
money and bought chocolates with it is there something that you can add to the
forum this year that's different?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, one of the biggest things in order to build a basketball
program you have to sign great recruits and my favorite recruiting story is
when I was an assistant at the University of Virginia and we recruited a young
man named Tom Sheehey, who was a high school All-American out of Rochester,
New York. And Dave Odom, the great head coach of Wake Forest, he and I flew to
New York City, he dropped me off to pick up three outstanding recruits, Kenny
Smith, Bruce Dalrymple and Olden Polynice and then he took the Lear jet up to
Rochester to pick up Tom Sheehey. And he picked up Tom at like 6 o'clock in
the morning at his house in a taxi cab and he put Tommy's gear, bag in the
trunk, they hopped in the cab and took off, and then all of a sudden you
heard, a dog crying. They had run over Tommy's dog. So that didn't get the
recruiting weekend off to such a great start, but it ended on a good note,
Tommy Sheehey ended up signing with the University of Virginia and in his
freshman year he helped get us to the Final Four. So it must have been a
pretty good recruiting weekend.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for being with us today.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jack White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36124)

### [Javin DeLaurier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36125)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. With what you know about the G league, and Duke having kind of the
tradition of players leaving a little bit early, how do you think that will
affect the college game and mainly your program?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You're talking about the new thing, the 125,000, is that what
you're talking about? Okay. I think it's great that the NBA is looking for
another alternative to see if high school players can have entry into the NBA.
To me it's very difficult to imagine, say these two guys were coming out, and
how do you allocate them? In other words, if Javin came to me and I'm with the
Celtics, I'm with the Celtic affiliate, and I train him the entire time and
then he goes into the draft I don't know how you work that out.  
  
So there is a lot that has to be done before we can give a definitive answer
in that regard. I wonder in some respects is it a preemptive strike by the NBA
to say that we're making this attempt where maybe they might not go forward in
2022 with what they're doing with the so-called one-and-done.  
  
So I think it's good. I think change is good, and to look at it, and I would
hope that the college game could keep abreast of those instead of just being
reactionary to it.  
  
Q. Coach K, obviously as Zion Williamson, very, very well known, before
he even enrolled with you guys, for his highlight reel dunks and all the
highlights on video. Could you just expand a little bit just on his entire
skill set and other things he brings to the table above the obvious highlight
things that he does?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: So, can I use momentum of your question to maybe to ask these
guys questions? Because they played with him?  
  
You know, what do you guys think about playing with Zion? And then I'll answer
and fill in the blanks for them.  
  
Q. So, Javin, how about you go first?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: For me, knowing what I knew about Zion heading into the
summer, I was actually very surprised at what a graceful athlete he is. You
see all the YouTube highlights and all the stuff that he can do, but his foot
work, his body control, and his skillset is really incredible. Going up
against him every day has really been a challenge, but it's been really fun,
I've enjoyed it.  
  
JACK WHITE: Yeah, you guard this guy every day. You work out pretty quick, but
he's so much more than just an incredible athlete. One thing that sticks out
to me is his passing ability, he can really pass the ball.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He means passing, by the way. Passing abilities.  
  
JACK WHITE: Pass. Yeah, passing. He can really distribute the ball, and every
time the ball gets into his hands he's a really smart player. He always seems
to make the right play. He makes his teammates better. He's a great guy off
the floor to be around, great locker room guy. You know, I can't speak highly
enough of him. He's been great since day one since he's come here.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I feel like I'm coaching USA Basketball and I'm the
interpreter for the Australian team.  
  
Just to add a little bit more, he's been a joy to coach. You know, he's such a
good guy. He's an extremely hard worker. He's a good basketball player, and
has guard skills and has fit in fabulously and won the respect of these guys
and the coaching staff. Just, I think, one of the more unique basketball
players that I've had a chance to coach, and the best athlete that I've had a
chance to coach at Duke.  
  
Q. Javin, a question for you. You played with a lot of talented scorers
last year, and yet when you were in the game, you always found a way to
influence the game. This year you'll again be playing with talented scorers.
What are your objectives? How do you see your role in terms of blocking shots,
getting in passing lanes, setting screens, rebounds with the players that
you'll be around this year?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: My job is just to come in and try to make as many plays as I
can to help us win, and that might be taking a charge, getting rebounds, stuff
like that. Stuff that may not necessarily show up in the box score because,
like you said, when you have guys who are really talented in scoring the ball,
you know, that's what they do.  
  
So I'm going to let them do what they do, and I'm going to do what I do well
and hopefully win games.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: One thing I'd add with Javin, two of the things that he will
add this year, one he's been an outstanding leader for this group, his
leadership, the leadership aspect and his ability to score the ball. He's
become a good shooter.  
  
Did you ever think I'd say that?  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: No (laughing).  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: But he's worked really hard, and we have confidence of him
hitting the three and obviously scoring on offensive boards and that. But he's
worked really hard on his game as has Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, what can Zion do to get even better in his time with you?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, he's getting better. One, you learn how to work. You play
against Jack every day, you know, Jack has fought him when he's opposed him --
fought him, like competed against him, which that's what he needs. And it's
made both of them better players, same thing with Jav. Just his knowledge of
the game. Overall, just everything. He has a big upside.  
  
I think people are amazed, really, because they saw all the dunking, and they
saw dunks last night too. But he can defend. He can improve in every way. He's
going to be an outstanding player for us for the one year, and I think he's
going to be -- he has a chance of being even an NBA All-Star.  
  
Q. This can be for you and the players, you talked last night about Joey
Baker making a jump this past week. What have you seen from him over the
summer going into the preseason?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, let these guys answer, then I'll add if I need to.  
  
JACK WHITE: I mean, first of all, I love Joey. Since day one I've looked at
him as kind of my little brother. I see a lot of myself in him.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Brother, his little brother.  
  
JACK WHITE: My little brother. I see a lot of myself in him since day one,
same as all the freshmen, it's the same. He's come in and worked hard, just
the improvement I've seen in his game since the summer up until last night in
the exhibition game has been tremendous. It's a credit to him and the work
he's put in. Really buying into the system, and working out how he can really
contribute to the team and help us win. He's done a great job, and I'm really
excited to see how he's going to continue to improve as the season goes on.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Like Jack said, Joey's a great kid. He's supposed to be in
high school right now, and he came and worked his tail off over the summer.
You can see how much he's improved. From when we first got here to last week,
he had an amazing week of practice. We went and talked to him about it. We're
like, Joey, we see you getting so much better, keep working hard, keep it up.
And last night he came in and showed a little bit of what he can do for us. He
can really help.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I just echo those. By the way, I see Bobby Cremins in the
back, and while he's still awake, I wanted to say something. You know, Bobby
--  
  
You haven't met Coach Cremins yet.  
  
JACK WHITE: No.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I want him to be Matt Harpring, okay? That would be a good
thing. We're going to get some tapes and show you. Obviously, Coach Cremins
was one of the great coaches in our league, and we've had storied battles to
include the worse game that the ACC ever had, a 47 to 45 game when we were
both building our programs in Cameron.  
  
Q. First of all, what were you able to take away from last night, and
for Javin, what's up with the foot?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: The foot is good. It's getting better. Just really trying to
take my time with it and make sure it's okay and it's not going to be
something that's nagging.  
  
And last night was a good test for us. We saw some things that we can do
really well. We tried out some new lineups. Saw some potentially very scary
things. Then also we saw some things that we need to work on, especially
talking in transition and making sure we have defensive balance.  
  
JACK WHITE: Yeah, I think last night was a good game for us, a good learning
experience. At the start of the game we were a bit rusty, but I think as the
game went on we really improved and worked on things we needed to. We came in
at halftime and addressed a few things, and I think we can really see the
difference in that in the second half. I was just really happy with our first
game out as a team, and looking forward to competing with these guys in the
future.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a great deal of success with Tre Jones' brother as
your point guard a few years back. In what ways does Tre's game remind you of
Tyus's game, and what are things he does differently?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, they are different in the fact that (Inaudible) command
defense in high school. And he's now a really good pro, and he played good
man-to-man for us. But we usually put Quinn Cook on the ball. When he played,
Tre can really play defense. He puts disciplined pressure on the ball kind of
like how Amaker, Hurley, Wojo, Duhon, those guys, he does that, and that
starts our offense. He, like Tyus, is a pass-first point guard. The ball
doesn't stick in his hands. Really easy to play with.  
  
At this time in his career Tyus was a better shooter or looked to shoot more.
We've got to get -- I think Tre's a good shooter. He doesn't look to shoot as
much. But they're both winners, and that's the similarity, and easy to coach
and great teammates to these guys.  
  
Q. You mentioned at this event before that college basketball at the
start of the season just is too slow out of the gate and didn't generate
enough interest. Do you then like the conference next season playing league
games right at the start, or would you like to see that experiment as a full-
time approach?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I liked the way we're doing it this year where we've taken
the Champion's Classic with us and Kentucky and Kansas and Michigan State
starting off that night. It was brought up that this might be a good thing for
the ACC. I'm not a huge proponent for it, but I'll go along with it to see if
it would -- again, a number of the coaches wanted it, so let's take a look at
it.  
  
The fact that 20 games will be played, that makes it better, I think, because
you have to fit them in. It will be interesting what happens with the
proposals that they have the oversight committee on looking at what you do at
the 31 games and what that will do with events, you know, tournaments. Will a
team get to use 31 games or will we have 27, the four-game exemption or how
that works out. So we're in that exempt and how you do it. So the fact that
the ACC is going to do this, I think it's worth looking at and then evaluating
it after that year.  
  
Q. With Duke playing in Hawaii in a couple weeks, is this an opportunity
for a lot of family members to travel over to watch you play?  
JACK WHITE: Yeah, obviously, Hawaii's about halfway between Durham and
Australia, so it will be a good opportunity to get some family and friends out
and have a look and experience college basketball for the first time. So
really looking forward to that, and also just going out and competing with my
teammates and trying -- trying to win the tournament.  
  
Q. Javin, you shook your head. Is that just too far of a distance to
go?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Yeah, we ask Jack all the time, "How did Duke even find you
all the way down there?" And it's always funny when he talks about going home
because he gets two winters. Like when it's summer here, it's winter there. So
it's a lot of fun that we have with him with him being in Australia.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you find him all the way down there?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We actually saw tape of him. And then we're really -- one of
my best friends internationally is Patrick Hunt who headed the Institute of
Sport in Australia. I've known him for -- he now heads FIBA, their technical
committee, and he knew about Jack. He vouched for him as a good kid, and
obviously we saw on tape he's a good player. We're lucky to have him.  
  
Q. Continuing with the international theme, you have a pretty good
Canadian player joining you this year, what makes RJ Barrett unique?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, he's an outstanding basketball player, and really ahead
maturity-wise. He seems like he's a senior or a junior at least. He's always
played up with the National Team and been the leader of whatever age group
he's with. But has played older all the time. Playing for Kevin Boyle at
Mumford where they were undefeated, he's just ahead. He's a winner.  
  
He's just an outstanding basketball player that is truly positionless, and is
a really good teammate. He's a good guy to play with, a winner, a real winner.  
  
Q. A question was asked earlier, what type of team do you think you'll
have when you come back to this building in March?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: A healthy one, I hope. You know, hopefully Javin's thrown
that boot and given it to someone else who might need it, hopefully. Not to
wish any harm or anything I say might be taken a little bit differently. So I
didn't mean to harm anybody. But healthy would be the main thing.  
  
And I think we're going to be really together. This group likes one another,
we're going to be a lot better than we are now and hopefully we'll be worthy
with our work and our effort to have a chance to win.  
  
Q. Could you just expand a little bit on calling Zion Williamson the
most unique player you've coached? Is that just uniquely based off his
athleticism?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, the athlete. The best and unique athlete, and most
unique player I've ever coached was Laettner because he won all the time. But
no, being he's just, you can't say Zion is like somebody, you know? He has a
chance to be -- he already is like a one-name guy, you know? Not many people
get that. And he can back -- I think he'll be able to back it up.  
  
So, yeah, he has a great support system in his family too and his community.
You know from being there how good he is with kids, right? Yeah. He's a Pied
Piper. He just has so many good people skills. So that along with his
extraordinary athletic ability and work ethic, it's like the perfect storm for
uniqueness and success.  
  
Q. Jack, your game has progressed over the last two years. How would you
describe yourself as a basketball player at Duke University?  
JACK WHITE: I think I guess just solid. I think I've really tried to work on
my consistency with my game. I think my three-point shot has improved a lot
since I've gotten here, and my defense and leadership as well. You know, I
still need to work on my ball handling a lot and keep that tight. But I feel I
can -- I don't want to hear it, Javin.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think he's going to confession (laughing).  
  
JACK WHITE: But, yeah, obviously playing against great teammates every day,
guarding since my freshman year, Jason, Matt, Grayson, to last year, Gary, and
all these guys, I'm guarding great talent every day. Obviously now this year
the same thing too.  
  
So I think just playing against these guys every day, it can only help it get
better. You know, that experience for me has been great. I wanted to come here
to challenge myself, and I knew that was going to help me get better as a
player on and off the court.  
  
This year I'm looking to be a dependable player for the team, consistent, a
leader for us, and just someone who is willing to do anything to help us win.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Can I say one thing too. Just on behalf of Duke Athletics and
especially our basketball program and me, because I've been in it as long as
this guy, we lose a true superstar in our conference at the end of this year
in Brian Morrison. You know, what he's done in promoting the league and
getting us together, and getting -- he's been terrific to work with. We want
to thank him for all that he's done for our program and for the ACC. What a
class guy.  
  
He's walking around here today. It's his last hurrah for Media Day. And if you
see him, give him a hug. He deserves a big hug. He's been a stud guy. You talk
about unique, Brian Morrison has been unique, and it's helped the growth of
this great conference. So on behalf of Duke athletics and Duke basketball,
just a huge thank you to Brian Morrison.  
  
THE MODERATOR: With that said, Duke, thank you. Good luck. We'll see you back
here in March.

BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, what is the latest on Braxton's hand, and how does that injury
-- do you have a sense of how long he'll be out? How does that injury impact
your season?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, Bob, he had successful surgery yesterday, and had a great
conversation with him after the surgery, talked to the surgeon. Told
everything went very well. We're very hopeful that mid-way through non-
conference we'll get him back.  
  
But it certainly changes our team a little bit. At the time he was playing
great basketball, he was shooting the ball very well. Certainly he's a guy
that we have on our roster that can stretch the defense and open up driving
lanes for us, and you know, with that being said, we've got to have some other
guys that step up and play well in his absence.  
  
Q. I didn't get a chance to ask you down there, but with so many new
pieces this year and guys that are now eligible to play, who are some guys
that you expect to have a big impact that weren't able to play for you last
year?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, obviously, Torin played for us last year, but we had three
guys sitting out that I think have a chance to impact our team and help us
become better. One of them to my left is C.J. Bryce who played for me at
Wilmington, and had two really good years for us. Almost averaged 18 points a
game as a sophomore. The thing that makes him special is he's a guy on our
roster that's played for me the longest, which is two years.  
  
But C.J. will bring a certain toughness to us, when you look at him, he's
6'5", I know he wants to say he's 200 pounds, but we've got him listed at
6'5", 1393. But I think he brings score being, his ability to get to the rim.
He's developed an outside shot from behind the arc from three. Then Devon
Daniels is a guy that transferred in from Utah who averages almost ten points
a game. He's a slasher, can score the ball. Then last but not least, Blake
Harris who is also a transfer from Missouri who can play the one and two.  
  
Q. Coach, last year you got a win in Chapel Hill in overtime, and this
year you've got Duke at Cameron. Does last year's win in Chapel Hill in that
raucous environment give you extra confidence for this season's match-up?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Are you asking me because we won at Chapel Hill will we win at
Duke?  
  
Q. Yes.  
KEVIN KEATTS: You know, I've said this, our win at Chapel Hill was special for
a lot of reasons. The reason being because before I took over the program that
year before we as a program lost about 51. I thought it was great for our
guys, especially the guys who played in the program, like Torin, Markel,
Malik, and Lennard to have a chance to go back into Carolina and be able to
win.  
  
That being said that has nothing to do with this year. We have a new roster, a
new team. We're going to take one game at a time. Right now I have no idea
when we play Duke. All I'm getting ready for is our first exhibition, which
will be on Monday, but I like the team. I like our versatility. We've got to
get better.  
  
One of the things I think we've got to get better as a team is defensively
we've got to talk and communicate more.  
  
Q. We try not to talk a lot about last year during this event. But in
that overtime win, given the family history that you have with North Carolina
and Chapel Hill, what was it like for family going into that game, and then
what was the conversation coming out of that game?  
TORIN DORN: Having family ties to the rivalry, I think a lot of people will
look at it and think it's a riff inside the family, but, no. It's really
they're very supportive of me and the things that I'm doing. So when we're
winning, they're happy. When my brother's playing and he's winning, they're
happy.  
  
They're really supportive of our team and coach, and everything that we're
doing. So it was definitely fun for them to see us win after the loss that we
suffered the year before.  
  
Q. C.J., a question for you, and Torin I'll ask you the same question.
C.J., you went to North Meck, so this is sort of a homecoming for you. You're
walking into this building knowing this is where the tournament will be in
March. How special is it, how surreal is it, how strange, what are your
reactions?  
CJ BRYCE: It's great for me being back in my hometown, especially for the
tournament, having some family come out to the games, just seeing us compete
every day is something I'm definitely looking forward to.  
  
Q. Torin, same question for you, a Vance graduate, so you're right at
home as well.  
TORIN DORN: Definitely. It's always fun coming home and being in the spectrum
center and seeing familiar faces and people that work here that I've known
growing up and things like that. So it's definitely fun and something that I
take a lot of pride in.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm sure you've been following that federal trial on
corruption in college basketball. Just minutes ago all three of those
defendants were found guilty. What, if any, impact can you see that having on
the program and on recruiting?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I don't see any of this really having an impact on our
program. Obviously a lot of that stuff predated me as the coach. We've been
able to just lock in and obviously focus on our new roster. Really haven't put
much thought into what was going on in the outside world.  
  
You know, the fortunate thing about it is that most of our guys are new, and
they have nothing to do with or understand anything that's happening in
college basketball. So for us, we've kind of shut out the outside world and
really just concentrate on this current roster and be able to get better as a
team.  
  
Q. You did talk about all the new players on the roster. I've heard you
say before that because of your experience at Hargrave that you're comfortable
with rebuilding the roster, but it's not for everybody. What is different
about a season like this or a season like last year where you're bringing in
so many new players as opposed to a coach who has seven or eight players back
from the same team?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, that's a great question. For you guys that don't know, I
spent 12 years at Hargrave Military Academy, ten of those being the head
coach. And we ended up in those ten years as head coach, I had 103 guys sign
Division I. So we were able to put in a system where guys would play as hard
as they could for as long as they could, and then raise their hand up and then
I would put five more guys in.  
  
That being said, every year I lost my whole roster. So I'm not saying that I'm
the only one in college basketball that can, you know, withstand a new roster.
But if anybody's equipped to do it, it's me.  
  
I'm used to teaching, and that's one of the things that we spent all summer
and early part of, so far since school has started, being able to teach these
guys. It helps. A little bit different from Hargrave because I've got three
guys that played for me last year, obviously, Torin being one, and then C.J.
Bryce playing for me at Wilmington. So I've got four guys to help teach my
system where I didn't have any at Hargrave.  
  
Q. Different subject, Torin's versatility, his ability to guard bigger
people, go inside and rebound and take the ball inside as well as shoot the
three, how does that help you play the style you want to play, which is
smaller, faster shots?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, his versatility is what made us special last year. You
know, obviously we play four guards, and I consider Torin as a big guard. But
what allowed us to play small last year is that if you go back and look at the
stats, are he led us in rebounding. I thought that was impressive.  
  
But when you look at the season that he had, you know, if you needed a guy to
get to the rim, he got there. If you needed somebody to get to the free-throw
line, he got there. When he needed a big shot, he made it. When you needed a
big rebound, he made it. So you were able to play that way if you got a guy
that can fill the stat sheet up.  
  
Ironically, we're talking about it. I sent him a text the other day and just
said get back to who you are, because you are a guy who fills the stat sheet
up.  
  
Q. I hate to beat the same drum for you, but what kind of process,
again, we're talking about the investigation, but what kind of process does
your school or even the compliance office go through when you're looking at
recruits to make sure that things are on the up and up?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, you know, first of all, anytime somebody is recruited to
N.C. State, we try to educate them as much as we can on the visit. When you
look at what we do, anytime you have a kid take an official visit, we give
them a form that they have to read to fill out to make sure that anything --
nothing improper went on. I think that's one of the processes that we go
through.  
  
Plus, I do this a little different than some of the programs. Anytime a kid
will come on our visit, if available, I try to have him to meet with our
athletic director and our chancellor to be able to answer any questions that
they may have outside of basketball about our program. And I think that's
important because you want to be able to -- anytime somebody's taking a visit,
you want to make sure that can you give all the information to make sure that
they can make the best decision for them.  
  
Q. Torin, in your two years in the ACC your numbers have jumped from a
scoring perspective both in league play and overall. Do you expect another
elevation this year? Is there still more to your game? And I know points on
the only thing, but what is the next level for you?  
TORIN DORN: I definitely think the next level for me is becoming more of a
leader on this team. I think with a lot of new pieces, a lot of young guys, I
think myself stepping out of my comfort zone and being more of a vocal leader
is probably the next step for me. Just cutting down on small things like
turnovers, defensive mental errors and things like that. It's not all about
scoring. But I think being a more efficient player is something that I could
work on, and that I worked on in the off-season, I could help the team win
this year.  
  
Q. You've obviously thought about it. How do you define leadership? What
is your interpretation?  
TORIN DORN: Leadership takes various forms. You can lead by actions, you can
lead by being vocal. But leadership is doing the right things and being able
to understand how to best motivate other people, you know, everybody's not
motivated in the same way, you have to know how to motivate them and get a
group of guys to come together and work together for a common goal.  
  
Q. Coach, you took your program down east for a series of practices.
What was the back story to that?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, C.J. Bryce wanted to get back to Wilmington, first of all.
No, I'm only kidding. Last year we had the opportunity to go to Italy for a
foreign trip, but it was very helpful for our team. Per NCAA you can only do
it once every four years, so I needed somewhere that I could go to get them
away from the distractions, to have practice for us to come together as a
team, for us to do some team building stuff.  
  
I thought it was great. Our guys responded. We had tug of war, we had a bunch
of games on the beach, but more importantly, we did an exercise where I would
take Torin and I would take C.J. and they'd have to interview each other and
stand up in front of the crowd, in front of our team and tell us something
about each other that we didn't know, and it was hilarious.  
  
We got great answers. I found out a lot of stuff about different guys. But it
was one of those things that I thought was necessary for the team.  
  
Q. That's way too easy. So what did we find out about these two guys
that we didn't know beforehand? C.J.?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Go ahead, C.J., tell them what you found out. Did you know
anything about T.D. that you found out?  
  
Q. I meant to call out himself. But it's up to you?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, tell us what you shared about yourself that nobody knew.  
  
CJ BRYCE: I mean for the most part people knew most of the things I talked
about, but I shared that my favorite place to eat in Raleigh was The Pit,
because I worked there. My favorite color is orange. Favorite rapper is Chief
Keef. Yeah, things like that.  
  
Q. All right, Torin, your turn?  
TORIN DORN: Oh, man. I feel like they know everything at this point. But
favorite color is also orange. Favorite rapper is Drake. I can say the 50
states in alphabetical order.  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: We don't have time for that. You know if you say that, they'll
make you do it though.  
  
TORIN DORN: We don't have time for that though.  
  
Q. Were the coaches, were you susceptible to that, or did you have to
tell the players something about yourself?  
KEVIN KEATTS: We didn't do it this year, we did it last year when we went to
Italy. But I think everybody knows everything about me. You know, I'm finding
out that Torin is traveling around and he's imitating me, and if he doesn't do
a good job it's going to dramatically change his playing time, so I just want
him to know that.  
  
But I found out today and yesterday that he does a great Coach Keatts
impression, which is good. So go ahead, T.D., I want to hear the coach 's
impression. These guys want to hear it.  
  
TORIN DORN: You want the uncut, or the edited version (laughing)? No. He would
be like, "I think we have a great team. I think if we come together we can do
a lot of things this year. We're really versatile." (Laughing).  
  
When he gets on, he'll go, "T.D., if you let your man catch the ball one more
time you're coming out of the game, T.D., I promise you. I promise you you're
coming out of the game, if you let your man catch the ball one more time
(laughing)."  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Paul, do I sound like that (laughing)?  
  
Q. What type of team are you going to bring back here in March?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I hope I bring a team back that has matured by March. I've
said the word, the word that I would use to describe this team more than any
other team is versatility. We have a bunch of guys who can play a lot of
different positions. Our weakness right now is our chemistry. Unfortunately,
because we've got so many new guys, we haven't had a chance to be on the floor
a lot together. So we've got to take the non-conference to grow up and get
better as a team.  
  
Q. Last year, Coach, your seven was the non-guard on the floor most of
the time. Who do you see as the two or three leading candidates to be the non-
guard this year?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, we have three guys that I think have to step in. Anytime
you lose a guy who averages 14 and 7, you don't automatically replace him with
new guys. We've got three guys that I think can step in and do it in a
different way. White Walker who was a good player at Samford, transferred as a
graduate student who has two years of play. He's more around the basket guy,
very good rebounder, very good passer.  
  
D.J. Funderburk who was arguably the number one JUCO player in the country
last year, he's long, he's athletic. Can step out, shoot it out the three. Has
a chance to be a really good basketball player. Defensively he can be solid.
Then obviously last but not least is Ian Steer who is a freshman who is
physically ready to play but has a lot to learn.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach Leonard Hamilton, this is a question about energy and karma.
How would you describe the energy that your tremendous run in the NCAA
Tournament has brought to this season? And then on the question of karma,
we're sitting here in Charlotte, just a stone's throw from where you grew up
in Gastonia. We'll be coming back here for the ACC Tournament in Charlotte.
What does the karma of that and the energy of your NCAA Tournament have to do
with this possibly being a Florida State season?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: To be honest with you, I think our players understood
beginning of last year we had an opportunity to have a really good season and
we had the potential to be a good basketball team. We had 22 weeks of
injuries. We had 17 games a combination of three players missed. So we played
with a lot of energy, but we kind of sputtered a lot with making the
adjustment.  
  
We feel that we fell a little short last year. We thought we had a chance to
get to the Final Four. No one else thought we did, but that's how we felt at
the beginning of the year. So the energy was good during the year. We just had
some challenges that we had to overcome. We've gone into this year now even
more determined, and we've utilized what we think we came up a little short as
a motivator to evaluate what we could have done a little better last year to
maybe not come up short, and obviously, we couldn't avoid the injuries.  
  
But I think that we shot 35 percent from three-point range. Could we have
spent a little bit more time at the gym and put that at 38? That would have
won three or four more games for us. We shot 69 percent from the free-throw
line, which we should have shot, let's say, 76 percent, 75 percent. 70 percent
of all games in the ACC are decided by four points or less. So if those two
things alone could have improved our record a little bit. We didn't get to the
free-throw line nearly as much. So we focus on those areas where we think we
can throw.  
  
Sure, we've had energy. Sure, there's some excitement about our program, and
on the outside people feel good about where we are and what we were able to
accomplish by going to the Elite Eight. But as a team, we feel we came up a
little short. So even though we enjoyed it, we realize we still have a lot of
work to do. We have some goals we'd like to reach, and I think that's going to
parlay itself into hopefully a little better focus. It has in the preseason,
and it also is working well for us as we go through our preparation for
practice as we look to the start of the season.  
  
As far as being close to Gastonia, obviously, growing up as a kid in North
Carolina admiring and respecting and being an ACC basketball fan, it meant an
awful lot to me. I remember all the good old days. I remember Vick
(inaudible), Bones McKinney, and Norm Sloan. Gosh, those guys were legends to
me, and I read about them every day. I couldn't wait the next morning to get
the newspaper to read what happened the night before. So I was an avid ACC fan
and watched the whole transition when Tyler Scott and Davis and all those kids
matriculated into school.  
  
But coming back to the ACC area to play in the tournament, I realize that,
because of the Tobacco Road teams, the teams in the close proximity to each
other, they created years and years of excitement with the competitive spirit
and the energy that it brought in this generally located area, and it's kind
of spilled off into Virginia and added Clemson, Georgia Tech. Those teams all
got caught up in it. So coming back to Charlotte, where fans have not had an
opportunity to see the tournament for a number of years, I'm expecting them to
be at their most highest level of enthusiasm and support and looking forward
to it.  
  
The tournament has always been run well here in North Carolina, but the
excitement, I think, that the tournament will bring to an area of people who
have grown to love and respect ACC basketball is going to be extremely
exciting.  
  
Q. Terance, a question from the podium. You had a birthday last week,
and you're starting your senior season. Where did the time go? How did all
this happen?  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I know. I came here an 18-year-old freshman from
Massachusetts not really knowing much, but I've grown in my four years here so
far. It's been an amazing experience to be able to go to the tournament and
make an impact on an ACC team. It's just a dream come true really.  
  
Q. Trent, what does a guy like Terance Mann mean to this program?  
TRENT FORREST: Terance means a lot. He's the glue guy for our team. He's the
voice of our team. All the players, we look up to Terance. He's a great leader
for us. We enjoy playing and following after Terance.  
  
Q. Obviously, there's a little bit of injury going on with Florida
State. Phil Cofer was due to be here, Coach. How's he doing? What's his
mindset? What's the team's mindset knowing that Phil may be out for a little
while?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We're probably one of the more experienced teams in the ACC
in dealing with injuries. Last year Christ Koumadje had a stress fracture. He
was out seven weeks. Trent had a bone bruise. He was out eight weeks. P.J.
Savoy had another bone bruise. He was out seven weeks. A total of 17 games
that those guys missed.  
  
I think our team is built to handle adversity. We play a lot of people. We
have quality of our depth has been something that we've always tried to put at
the forefront of our program. We've used it to the best of our ability.
Someone else is going to step up. We have to make some adjustments in our
rotation, I'm sure, but hopefully Phil will come back strong. Other guys will
have more opportunity to get more minutes here early.  
  
The main thing is we've got to figure out a way to win basketball games
without one of our leaders, and hopefully, that will be an adjustment we can
make. But we went through this similar situation last year. We sputtered a
little bit. Hopefully, we'll be stronger this year and be able to handle it a
little better.  
  
Q. Question for the players -- and, Coach, you may want to jump in on
this as well -- looking at your roster, I'm counting at least eight players
that got quite a bit of playing time last year. That's more than most schools
in the league. How does that make practice more competitive? How does that
influence the season to have that much experience?  
TRENT FORREST: It just adds a lot of experience. Everybody knows what we're
supposed to do. Everybody has the feeling that at any time they can be called
upon, and I feel like, when we go into practice, that makes it more
competitive because we know each other, we know what we're supposed to be
doing, and it makes for a good atmosphere. So then when we get to the games,
it's much easier when a Coach goes nine, ten, or however far deep in the bench
that he wants to, and everybody is okay with that.  
  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I agree. I think the competitive spirit is definitely a
good thing for us. We've got five teams of five in practice sometimes. So just
having that, just competitive, always playing against competition, knowing
that, you know, if injury does happen like it does, we've got somebody, people
who are prepared for it because they go over stuff in practice, they see it in
the games and stuff like that.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: What we've tried to do is play positionless basketball, and
we only have one guy who only plays one position on our team, and that's
Koumadje, the 7'4" guy. He's the only one that doesn't bring the ball down the
court. He's the only one that doesn't push it. When he gets the rebound, the
only time we throw it to the outlet is when he gets the rebound. Everyone else
-- so we're interchangeable. I even have my guards setting ball screens.  
  
So we are prepared, and the interesting thing about our team is that a lot of
guys are in close proximity to each other from a talent standpoint. We've had
two scrimmages. Yesterday we had a scrimmage, and I think it was a one-point
game, I believe, in the first segment. In the second segment, it was tied up,
and we actually mixed all the teams up, and they know the plays, they know
each other, they know what to expect. But I think our team is so closely
divided, in terms of even with talent -- obviously, we have guys like Terance
with more experience, he and Phil -- but I think our talent level is close, so
we're comfortable playing eight, nine, ten, eleven deep. Many times we'll play
11 guys in the first ten minutes. Not because we're doing anything other than
we want everybody to play hard with a tremendous amount of energy.  
  
And we try to develop a system where everyone is on the same page, and we
practice that way every day. We normally go five-on-five-on-five. We have
three teams of five, and regardless of who, it always seems to work out that
way. So we prepare the quality of our depth. We don't put starting lineups out
there with any group in practice because we all are intertwined.  
  
Right now if I had to pick a starting lineup, I'd say I have a starting eight,
but I'm going to have a starting nine or ten. We feel like the strength of our
team is in our numbers, and we win games by committee.  
  
Q. Trent, I say this almost jokingly, though, with that type of
practice, knowing that everybody is next up means you've really got to pay
attention during the game too, right? It might be your number that's getting
ready to be called.  
TRENT FORREST: Definitely. I feel like that's what helped me my first two
years is always being locked into what's going on in the game, seeing things
that maybe the starters don't see, and then when you get in the game, you can
execute that, and that's just a way for us to bring energy to the game. At
that point in time, you never know, that may be a turning point for the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked last year about maybe doing a little bit more to
control a destiny, and this is sort of along those lines. When you look at
your non-conference schedule, how do you schedule with the idea of putting
yourself in the best position possible come conference play?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: There's no doubt that this non-conference schedule is a
little more challenging. It's as challenging a one as we have faced since I've
been at Florida State. They have the opportunity to play against the St. Louis
team that's picked to win its conference in Ft. Lauderdale, a neutral site.
Obviously, playing in the tournament in Orlando, if we're successful against a
UAB, I'm pretty sure we have an opportunity to play LSU. And then if you win
that game, you have a chance to play against the National Champions in
Villanova. Obviously, Purdue coming through our place this year. In the ACC,
challenge is going to be a significant opportunity for us once again. And then
we go on the road at Tulane.  
  
But I think that level, that kind of schedule is ongoing to prepare us for the
ACC race. And one thing about the ACC, in regards to who you're playing, home
or on the road, if you're not really mentally and emotionally ready, something
bad could happen to you. I think the preseason schedule we have, and now that
we probably won't have Phil for the majority of it, it's going to be extremely
challenging. Someone else has to step up.  
  
Q. Terance, what do you expect of yourself for your senior season?
Obviously, you want to contribute, you want to play hard, you want to leave a
legacy. Game by game, how are you going to approach it, this being your last
run?  
TERANCE MANN: Just really playing as hard as I can, just having my teammates
know that they can rely on me for whatever it is really, just being that
leader out there on the court. Not really too much big expectations. We're
just trying to get back to that second weekend in March and get to that Final
Four.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask you about Kabengele's development. Made some big plays
at tournament time last year, 6'10 ", can play all over the court. What does
he bring to your program?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: He has developed in such a positive way that I can't find
words to express how proud we are of him. I think he was 6'6" in high school.
He went to a prep school. Grew to be 6'10". Well, really grew to be about
6'7-1/2", 6'8". We brought him in and redshirted him as a freshman. Now he's
6'10", 250. He actually shed almost 18, 19 pounds during this process, and he
did it all on his own by getting up early in the morning, jogging by himself.
What was it, P90?  
  
TERANCE MANN: P-90X.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: P-90X, whatever that is, he got involved with that program,
watching what he's eating. He's becoming more and more of a complete player.
He's kind of our secret weapon. He's a big strong kid that can play the five
position, but he's also a guy that can step away from the court and be one of
our better three-point shooters. He's a good rebounder.  
  
He's a guy that we're expecting great things from. He's in that eight that I'm
talking about, guys that it doesn't really matter, we might change lineups at
halftime. I don't know. We haven't even given it a thought. We just know that
we've got to develop a large rotation in order for us to compete the way we
want to. I'm very pleased with his progress.  
  
There's no doubt that he's one of our better players. Nothing that he does
surprises us because we have a tremendous amount of respect for him. He has
that high motor. Plays with a tremendous amount of energy. He's strong,
determined, and he's a guy that I think is going to surprise a lot of people
in the ACC.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking of Kabengele's development, M.J. Walker had great
moments for you last year too, and I know you give challenges to each of your
guys coming into the next year. What's been your big challenge to him coming
into the season?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I'm sure I can speak for the whole staff, and I'm sure my
players want to step in and make some comments. I have been unbelievably
pleased with the progress he's made from his freshman year to his sophomore
year. He's a great youngster who gave us a tremendous lift offensively last
year, but he was trying to figure it out, and I think he's figured it out. His
defense has been outstanding. He's playing with an extreme amount of
confidence. He doesn't allow anything to deter him.  
  
Last year I felt, like most freshmen sometimes, when he didn't get off to a
good start, sometimes he would maybe not play with the level of confidence
that a mature player would play with. But his effort has been excellent. He's
a guy that I think we're going to enjoy watching. I mean, he's done a great
job up to this point, and I'm really excited about what the prospects of him
having an outstanding year.  
  
He's very important for us. He has the ability to defend. He's a very good
outside shooter. He takes the ball to the basket aggressively, and he's a good
passer and sees the floor. So there's no doubt that in order -- we expected
him to be a main contributor to our team.  
  
Q. Terance, your reaction?  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I agree. I'm really impressed with the way he grew
defensively especially. I know during practice he always tries to guard me. He
tells everybody, yeah, get away. I'm guarding Terance. Get away. So he's been
doing -- he's been having a conscious effort on the defensive end, which is
really nice to see because we're definitely going to need that out of him and
for him to step up big time this year.  
  
Q. Trent, you get the last question. When you come back here in March,
what type of team do you think you're going to be bringing with you?  
TRENT FORREST: I would say hungry, a hungry team. The last two years, we
haven't done as good as we wanted to in the ACC Championship or in the
tournament. So now I feel like that's something that's on our shoulders. We
have five seniors. I know they want to go out with a bang and win the ACC
Championship. So I feel like, by the time we get there, we're going to be
ready to make it to the last day of the tournament.  
  
Q. Quick follow-up. Does it help that you now see the building, that you
can see the scale of it?  
TRENT FORREST: Definitely. It helps a lot. The atmosphere here, we can already
expect there's going to be a lot of energy, a lot of fans, and we're just
looking forward to the tournament.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boston College.  
  
Q. Coach, you lost Jerome Robinson to the NBA which obviously is a big
loss. On the other hand, you returned four starters. How would you compare
where you are coming into this season at Boston College with your previous
seasons?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I think it's been really helpful for us to have those many
guys back, especially in practice. For the first time I feel like we're not
explaining things for the first time to everybody. And really an important
ingredient is that we have older guys who are able to teach the younger guys.  
  
It's something that we all think is important. But we've never had a chance to
have that. So for the first time we've got guys who have been in the program
in three years, and four years can explain some of the things we do and why we
do it. I think we're just way ahead of where we were because of that.  
  
Q. Ky, your point production per game is going up steadily, your
freshman year to sophomore year, what do you expect of yourself from your
junior season?  
KY BOWMAN: To be more consistent from the 3-point line is a big thing for me.
Also being a leader on the court and to establish the roles for other players
to help us get these road wins and home wins.  
  
Q. Ky and Jordan, last year, with Jerome as the third shooter, the three
of you were very difficult for opposing defenses to cover. Without Jerome,
maybe they can key on two of you, unless you find a third shooter. Is there a
third shooter in the hopper?  
KY BOWMAN: So the freshmen coming in is going to help a lot. But also the
players we still have in the system from there are maturing into the level is
going to help a lot knowing big shots and just every shot we take needs to go
in. So it's going to help us a lot as far as dedicating on one person but also
having to look out for the whole team.  
  
JORDAN CHATMAN: I think we have more versatility this year. Steffon and Niko
are both back, and they've taken steps, as well as myself and Ky, and the
freshmen coming in will help us a lot.  
  
Q. Jordan, there's a line in the media guide that says last year the
Eagles were 17-9 when you scored 10 points or more. Is that a coincidence or
is that just sort of what you bring to the floor?  
JORDAN CHATMAN: I just try to be aggressive and take the shots I can get and I
think it just works out when everyone's aggressive and trying to play their
game, good things happen.  
  
Q. You averaged about seven rebounds a game. Not every 6'1 " player does
that. How do you explain -- does your football background come into play here?
How do you explain your success on the glass?  
KY BOWMAN: I say that we know that we need to get in transition so the easiest
way for us to get into transition is me getting the rebound to start the
break. So it helps out a lot if I just go for the rebound, just play off that.  
  
Q. Coach, from the podium couple years ago football and men's basketball
did not have a great run throughout the league. But since then everything is
ticking up. From a patience standpoint, from building a product, building a
program, what's your comment from where you were a couple years ago to where
you are today?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: It's part of a plan and I had a plan when I took over this
job and there's no timeframe for that. You don't know how quickly things will
come together. But I think just by sticking with our plan and getting really
key pieces to remain loyal. And I think that's the hardest part of rebuilding
anything, because we understand how hard it is to just pass one team in this
league.  
  
So I think those key pieces, their ability to stay loyal to me, our program
and to Boston College have attracted other players now, because their story is
out there. And they can tell it. That there was nothing there. They believed
in it and now these other guys were coming and now they get a chance to see
it. And once that happens it just keeps going. And that's how things get
built. It's not an easy process but you have to stay loyal to the plan and
believe in what you do and we never wavered from it, not for one second.  
  
Q. That same type of patience, have you been taught the patience? Have
you naturally been patient players? You obviously have to be part of that
building of the program as well, you're reaction, Ky?  
KY BOWMAN: I say going into my first year we all had to believe in one thing
and that's just being able to compete against other teams. But also being able
to know that we have each other's backs. So we stepped into an environment
where we knew what we was getting ourselves into, but also knowing that every
day we was going to fight to bid ourselves throughout the whole system.  
  
JORDAN CHATMAN: Playing in the ACC, we all know it's a tough conference. So
patience is just something that we've had to learn, just to take every game
step-by-step and as we've trusted in the coaching staff good things have
happened.  
  
Q. Coach, when you lose a player to the first round of the NBA draft, do
you feel like you can be better this next year and what have you seen in
practice that makes you think that this year's team can make strides from
where you were last year?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I think you're going to be different because a lot of stuff
that we did, Jerome was a big part of that, in terms of things we ran and
options that we had off those particular plays because of how he was going to
be guarded.  
  
But in a lot of ways, our team, this year, because we added two impactful
freshmen, in my mind we literally have six starters. I couldn't tell you today
which group of the five are going to start. But I know -- group of the six,
rather, are going to start.  
  
But I think our team with the addition of those guys and then the continual
growth of not only the returning players but some who played a lot some of the
returning players who came off the bench, I think in a lot ways our team is
more versatile we can do a lot more things now than we could, and I think that
helps.  
  
Obviously you never want to lose a great player. Although we couldn't be
happier for Jerome. Happy when it all happened throughout the whole process
for him. But I think in a lot of ways, our team, now, because of the addition
of new players, is a lot more versatile.  
  
Q. If I recall, you had a front court injury last year. And there were
some teams you had a size disadvantage against. How would you assess your
height and strength in the front court this year?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Again, Steffon Mitchell is the all-time leading freshman
rebounder in the school. Think about that. There's some unbelievable players
at Boston College, unrecruited player. Nik Popovic is back as a junior. If you
watched our team the last eight or ten games when he was starting to get
consistent, he always had ability, when he was consistent we were a different
team.  
  
So another year of growth for him. You add a Jairus Hamilton, who is 6'8", 240
pounds, coming in the door, explosively athletic. And the development of
Johncarlos Reyes, for us it's formidable. And we just have to keep developing
and getting better. We have a guard that's a unique guy.  
  
We might not have been as tall. But I didn't really look at many games, but
they outtoughed us. We weren't a team that outpost every play. We didn't have
to do those things because we had some tough kids, some physically strong,
tough kids, and I think it's only gotten better.  
  
Q. Jim, this question is for you. Chris Mack, one of two new coaches in
the league this year, what do you think with the new style of play he's
bringing to Louisville, what are the unique challenges their team is going to
pose to you guys this season?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Obviously he's an unbelievable -- I've known Chris a long
time. I scrimmaged against his teams when I was at Ohio. I'm familiar with
him. We have similar backgrounds, other people who taught him also taught me.  
  
You know you're going to have a hard-nosed, tough basketball team that's going
to fight every possession. They're going to execute very, very well. He's just
a phenomenal coach.  
  
And so I'm expecting nothing but great success from him. He's had nothing but
success. And I think his adjustments to the league will happen. I think
there's some adjustments you have to make because of the unique styles of a
lot of teams in this league and you have to do it on short preparations.  
  
When you're going from one style of you're playing a Virginia to the next game
you're playing Syracuse, well, not everything you do against every team that
plays that way works against them. So you're going to have to do some things
that in a short period of time that these players are going to have to grasp
to give yourself a chance.  
  
Q. Ky, you've been given some good-natured ribbing about your hair over
the last couple of years. One, how did it start? And two, how do you decide
what color it might be for a game?  
KY BOWMAN: It started coming out of high school. So every year that we went to
the state championship for football, all our teammates would dye our hair
blond. So my senior year I didn't play football. So I already had it blond.
But I started to cut it out. But then again I got it back. So I got tired of
seeing everybody with blond, so I decided to go red.  
  
But then I had one game where I dyed it jet black and Coach didn't like it.
And we just had a horrible game that day. So I decided not to dye it back. So
I kept it colored now.  
  
Q. Coach, your reaction to the hair at all?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I'm excited about it. I'm excited about it. I think I told
him that if we make the NCAA Tournament I'll go red, too. If he wants me to go
red, if that's what it takes to get us there, we'll do that.  
  
But he's a unique guy. The enthusiasm he brings to everybody in our program,
everybody at the school, it's a once-in-a-lifetime type personality.  
  
Q. Jordan, you've been on a bit of a basketball journey. Can you take us
through the changes in your life and how it is you ultimately decided on BC?  
JORDAN CHATMAN: Yeah. You know, just I met with the coaching staff when they
started recruiting me when I decided to transfer. And, you know, I didn't play
a lot in my previous school. And they had a lot of confidence in me and
believed in me. So that was the biggest reason I chose to come play for them.  
  
But, yeah, it's been a lot of hard work, a lot of patience. And I just trusted
in the process and good things have happened.  
  
Q. Coach, to follow back up on building a program, do you have to have a
trophy this year in order to say that you had a successful season?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I think there's one goal and one goal in mind. Everybody else
in this league, we're going to try to do what we can to put ourselves in
position to compete for the regular season championship and play in the NCAA
Tournament. That's our goal and should be the goal for every team here. And
we're no different.  
  
We have some good aspirations. And I just feel a different swagger about our
team this year. I think just the way we practice, the way we approach things,
this is just a different maturity. Some of that is confidence. Some of that is
we know, if we do what we're supposed to do, we can play with anybody in the
country. And that's got to carry over.  
  
Q. Thinking back to your first year in the league, have you made changes
in the way you play offensively and defensively as you've gotten more and
better players?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I think you have to. I think because the players are
different. So they come with different strengths, different abilities. So,
yeah, we have. And I think the other thing, we've worked on our area this year
of concentration. We have to become a better defensive team, especially on the
road. More consistent.  
  
But I think we spent a lot of time talking about what we did, what broke down
and how do we fix it and keep playing in that possession, as well as working
on some secondary defenses that we can go to when things just aren't going our
way.  
  
We started doing that a little bit last year. It was effective for us in a lot
of games. But I think, again, it comes down to understanding and being through
it.  
  
So we have now -- we have points of reference with this group of guys because
everybody's back, minus Jerome, that we can go to and say: Man, look at this
play, look at our attitude or our mindset or determination on this play,
imagine if we upped it a bit what would have happened.  
  
We were one of those teams, a ball goes in here, ball goes in there, Teddy
Hawkins doesn't get hurt, we'd be having a different conversation about where
our program was. And I think our guys feel that.  
  
Q. I'm going to stay on building the program aspect. How do you design a
non-conference schedule with the thought of building towards something? What
are the variables that go into those games outside of the league?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: That's a great question. I mean, it changes. It changes
because there's the fine line of you want to get confidence. You want to work
on things but you also want to build yourself a resumé. So we wanted to
challenge ourselves on the road a little bit in non-conference.  
  
So we're going to a Texas A&M. We're going to a DePaul. We play an NCAA
Tournament team in Providence at home. And obviously the ACC-Big Ten challenge
and 18 grueling games.  
  
It's a fine line between you have to really get a good gauge on your team:
What can we handle. Where we need to -- different styles we're going to play
against that are similar to some of the things we play against in the year in
the ACC play. So it's a great question. I wish I had a simple answer to it.  
  
Q. Ky, I think we asked you this question last year. Again on a lighter
note. Being from Havelock, North Carolina in the Tar Heel state are you
getting used to the Boston winters yet?  
KY BOWMAN: It's been easy for me to get through, as far as living on the
coast, getting all the wind from the beaches. It's easier for me to adjust to
the Boston weather.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach Capel, what appealed to you about the Pitt job? They came off a
tough season. What did you see that appealed to you and what made you think it
was an opportunity at this time?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, first and foremost, it was the opportunity to coach in the
ACC. Since I got into coaching that was always a dream of mine was to have an
opportunity to coach in this league. I grew up in this league. I grew up
loving the ACC. I had the great fortune to be able to play in this league and
then to have an opportunity to be a head coach in this league was something
that appealed to me greatly.  
  
The second thing is that I knew the tradition of this program. Before all the
conference realignment, Pitt was one of the best teams and programs in the Big
East. And during that time the Big East and the ACC were the two best
conferences. You could probably flip a coin and -- so you knew the tradition.
You knew it had been done and the opportunity to do it again was there. There
was a commitment to the program. There's a passion for the program. There's a
pride in the program.  
  
And the third thing is that I had a chance to meet with and spend some time
with our athletic director Heather Lyke and our chancellor, Chancellor
Gallagher, and I felt their commitment to the program and I felt the
connection with them most importantly.  
  
All these jobs are hard, every one. And I don't care who you are, you're going
to face some adversity. There's going to be moments, maybe moments where you
go through some difficult times.  
  
When you go through that you want someone that's in that foxhole with you that
believes in you. That was probably as important as anything for me considering
the things that I've been through in my career. And I found that. I felt that
with Heather and Chancellor Gallagher. I trusted it. I believed in it. And I
went for it.  
  
Q. You recruited in Richmond and Norman, Oklahoma and as an assistant in
Durham. How would you contrast your experience for recruiting for the
University of Pittsburgh?  
COACH CAPEL: Look, recruiting is hard, no matter where you are. But recruiting
is the lifeblood of every program. And it's about trying to develop
relationships, trying to identify the talent that you feel will fit what you
want to do, your program, how you want to play, what you want your program to
be about.  
  
Again, we have a lot of great things at the University of Pittsburgh to sell.
We have a really good university. We have tradition. We have good facilities
that we're improving on.  
  
We have an amazing city. We have a city that loves sports. I don't know how
many people I've had come up to me, just random people, or people within the
pro sports organizations there that have told me when this thing was going,
when Pitt men's basketball was going, it was the toughest ticket in town to
get over the Steelers or Penguins or Pirates. That's exciting to me. We have
all those things to sell and it's now our job to get it done with recruiting.  
  
Q. Malik, you're a transfer, you'll be playing your first year at Pitt.
You were named a team captain. What does that say about either your rapport
with your teammates or you as a student-athlete being named captain right out
of the blocks?  
MALIK ELLISON: First of all, it's a tremendous honor to be named team captain.
I've dreamed about that my whole life, just being a captain at the college
level. It shows how much trust the team and the coaches have in me. And I look
forward to having a great year leading by example and being vocal as well.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you were head coach at VCU, I think you might have been
the youngest head coach in the country at that time. And I wondered what
coaching at VCU meant to you, how it shaped you and what -- how far you've
come since being there?  
COACH CAPEL: It was an honor to be the coach there. I was named the head coach
when I was 27 years old. I'd only had two years of coaching experience.  
  
I'd never been on the road recruiting. The first time I went out on the road
recruiting was when I was the head coach there. But it was an unbelievable
experience. It was a great learning experience.  
  
We were able to have some success during my time there. The thing I was most
proud of during my four years as the head coach there is that we changed the
culture of the program. I had the fortune of being an assistant for a year.  
  
So when I took over, I had a great idea right away of what needed to change.
It was about implementing those changes, and look, we won games. We went to
back-to-back postseasons which hadn't been done there in a while. But the
thing that we did was we changed the culture. And that's the thing that I was
most proud of that those young men that I had and I was very fortunate to be
left a guy like Domonic Jones, who was an incredible ambassador as a student-
athlete of what I wanted a VCU basketball player to be about.  
  
And we had a good first year but we really made the jump in year two. As those
guys became acclimated with the way we were doing things, we were able to add
a couple of pieces and then we were able to win the regular season. And in
that time in that league you have to win the conference tournament, which we
were able to do.  
  
It was a fun time. It was a great time. It was a great learning experience.
The thing I realize now is how naive I was. I was incredibly naive. There was
a lot things I didn't know. When I was there I was named head coach of
University of Oklahoma at 31. And I was probably even more naive going to that
level.  
  
So I think I've learned a lot through those experiences being back at Duke the
last seven years and understanding how to run a program better, understanding
the ins and outs and understanding really I think the business side of
everything. But my experience at VCU, I look back with great memories, fond
memories, relationships I was able to establish that I still have to this day.  
  
Q. Jared, question for you. How would you describe the style offensively
and defensively that Coach Capel has you playing and how is that different
from what we saw last year?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: First word is just intensity. And attention to detail. And
that's on both ends. On offense, I like to play fast. I like to push it up the
floor. If not, we're looking for the best shot, like our shot, the best shot
for us. Not just a good shot, but a great shot.  
  
Defensively just being intense, you know, and having pressure on that ball,
and everybody else kind of helping out and being in the right spots off the
ball also.  
  
Q. Jeff, what are your thoughts of playing not just two extra ACC games,
but playing at the very beginning of the season, potentially in your first
game? And also maybe reaction from Jared about the idea of starting the season
with an ACC game?  
COACH CAPEL: That will be next year when we do that. It's exciting. I mean,
with the ACC Network coming, look, we're already the most visible league in
the country. And it's going to become even more visible.  
  
I don't think any coach will think you're ready for an ACC game to start. But
I think for a player it's exciting. Look, you want to play in big games. And
every ACC game is a big game. And the greater the challenge, the more
difficult the challenge, you get to find out a lot about your team early and
see exactly where you are early.  
  
And one of the great things about it is you're able to make some decisions, to
see what it is you need to work on, to see maybe what you're pretty good at
and to figure it out. By the time you get to the second ACC game maybe you're
a little bit better, hopefully you're a little bit better.  
  
But it's exciting. It's exciting for the ACC Network. It's exciting to add
even more visibility to our league, which I think is the best league in all of
college basketball.  
  
Q. Wanted to get a quick reaction from you Malik, Jared touched on it
what are differences heading into this year as opposed to last year with your
new coach coming in?  
MALIK ELLISON: When Coach got here in the summertime, you could see in our
workouts the intensity went up ten times more than it did last year. Even our
practices, our practices are way more intense, way more attention to detail. I
think we've gotten a lot better since Coach got here in the summertime and our
team has gotten closer as well. I think it's just going to be a great season
this year and I'm really excited.  
  
Q. When you go through the type of season you guys had last year and you
lose your coach, what makes you want to stay at Pitt and what did you need to
see and hear from the new coach coming in to make you want to stay at Pitt?  
MALIK ELLISON: I think for me, I didn't play last year, but it was equally as
hard for me to go through a losing season like we did last year. And I think
the main thing with Coach Capel coming in, just seeing how much of a hard
worker he is and how big he is on family and just being together and just
being tough. I think that right there really opened a lot of guys' eyes on the
team and it made us realize what it's going to take to win at this level.  
  
Coach Capel has won at every level there is in college. He played a national
championship. He coached in the NCAA Tournament. He's coached under Coach K
and also been around the U.S.A. Team. So the levels of success that he's been
around, I think it's just really rubbing off on us. And we know what it's
going to take for us to win. And I think we'll have a great year.  
  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: Touching on what Malik said, as far as Coach Capel's
basketball pedigree and in his mind, when he first got the job the first
conversation we had, already knowing things about him, seeing him during the
ACC, you know just knowing his track record, that jumped off the page to me.
And when he touched on the importance of togetherness and family and attention
to detail, that really hit home for me. And I never really planned on leaving
the program to be honest, talking to the athletic directors, on what they were
asking me what I was looking for in a head coach and other players who were
leaning towards staying, when they hired Coach Capel it was almost a no-
brainer, I told them when we talked on the phone I already planned on staying
once I saw he was going to be the head coach before I talked to him. Since
he's been here like Malik said from the summer workouts to day one, I know
myself I was dead tired. I couldn't even move, almost.  
  
But that was a motivational thing for me. It was kind of a wake up call, like
you do need to work a little harder. You do need to get a lot better.  
  
And he's shown great attention to us and care towards us as far as getting
better every day and it's a trust in him and like Malik said he's brought us
closer together as teammates and as men and he's kind of an example of what
we're striving to be as men in our life. And he was also that on the court as
a basketball player.  
  
Q. You obviously grew up in a basketball household. What influence did
your father, Jeff Capel, Sr., have on your coaching philosophy and the way you
interact with your players?  
COACH CAPEL: You know, my coaching philosophy, I had a chance to coach with my
dad for a year. That was my introduction into coaching on his staff at Old
Dominion. I thought he did an amazing job under very adverse circumstances
that year. That was his last year. He got fired at the end of the season. Kind
of going into it knew that was going to happen.  
  
And it was amazing to me how incredibly positive he was with his team that
year with how he showed up every day, we showed up as a staff every day and
that team showed up every day and they got better. They got better as men.
They got better as a team and we competed and we fought every day.  
  
And so the attitude that he brought, that's something that I know. But those
are things he taught me growing up and so his influence on me is more as a
man, as a father, as a husband, probably more than anything. Now, growing up,
from the time he was a high school coach, we always had players in our house.
My dad was big on that whether when I was little when Jason and I were little,
they were our baby-sitters, up until he was at Wake Forest as an assistant.  
  
They became like our big brothers. I remember when I was younger when he was a
coach at Pine Crest High School, I used to say: When I grow up, I want to play
defense like Johnny Hines, want to jump like Antonio Johnson and play hard
like Bobby Collins and shoot like Bernard McNair those were the guys I wanted
to be like but they were always around and so team has always been sacred to
me. Being part of a team, being around the team and things like that and I
feel the great fortune that I've been able to be a part of that as a player.
I've been able to be a part of that as a coach, as an assistant and as a head
coach and I get a chance to do it again. And there's a spirit when I walked
into this building, I remember walking into this building a lot with my dad.  
  
My dad was an assistant here when the Bobcats came back and I tried to sneak
into his old office. They have a punch code. I couldn't get in there. But
there's a spirit here especially being back in this state that brings me back
to incredible memories of my dad.  
  
Q. Jared, I'm not trying to walk you toward an answer but with Jason
Capel being on the bench as an assistant coach, are you feeling that sense of
family? Is it penetrating what the student-athlete's experience is all
about?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: Definitely. When you see the way him and coach interact
with each other and just the bond and trust they have in what they're saying
to each other, that kind of helped us be like that with each other and when me
and Malik we're first and foremost me and Malik will get on each other before
we get on anybody else and just saying that we have to hold it down as leaders
of the team.  
  
That came from Coach Capel and Jason Capel, just the camaraderie and chemistry
they had together and the rest of the staff as well. The energy that O'Toole
brings in and the mind that -- I'm not going to go on too much O'Toole's
energy -- but Coach Brown and the togetherness they had, they're all like
brothers. They all could have been Coach Capel. All last names could have been
Capel that's how it seemed when they came in. That's rubbed off on me and
Malik and the rest of the team as well.  
  
Q. Malik, we just heard Jared talk about leadership styles. Leadership
is more than yelling and screaming and high energy. How would you describe the
style of leadership that the two of you have?  
MALIK ELLISON: I think me and Jared, you know, we lead by example first and
foremost. And I think also vocally, especially Jared. He has a very powerful
voice. He's able to attract a lot of ears, a lot of listeners. And for myself
as well, I tend to get along with my teammates and I tend to just lead by
example as well. I'm a hard worker. Jared is a hard worker. So I think both of
us just, that's just a God-given talent that we have of leadership, just being
able to rub it off on our teammates.  
  
Q. Jared, you can't say the same thing he just said. So what are your
impressions about leadership?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: Just I think one of the things me personally growing up,
my father wasn't around that much. So my mother was kind of that role. And she
played that role for us.  
  
And I grew up in a house and it was five of us in the house, one mother. Two
girls. One of which was way younger than the rest of us. And the oldest
brother left to college when I was 11 years old. And he went to Moore House
College in Atlanta, Georgia. That's really far from Hartford, Connecticut. And
I think just having to look out for my younger siblings all the time, going to
the same schools and not even the same schools, having to pick them up from
the bus stop and things like that and make sure I was taking care of them at
home and I was at a age where I didn't even know very well how to take care of
somebody else. I think that stuff for me growing up kind of led me to just
become a natural leader and kind of have a natural voice and mind to just know
that I have to kind of take the initiative and show how it's done sometimes
and I've brought that to people I've been around my whole life. And I see that
same thing in Malik.  
  
I'm not speaking on his life situation growing up, but I just know from the
talks that we've had that, you know, he's had the same experiences that shaped
him as a young man to be a natural leader.  
  
That's just something that rubs off on each other every day and it rubs off on
the rest of our team to just kind of be together and kind of be able to take
that first step forward and not have any fear in your heart and kind of be
brave about it.  
  
Q. Fast forwarding into the future because I just looked into the
schedule and Duke comes to Pitt this year. But the day will come when you go
to Cameron Indoor Stadium, a place you played and coached alongside Mike
Krzyzewski. Do you have any idea what that will be like to come back as the
head coach of Pitt?  
COACH CAPEL: Not really. I've tried to concentrate on the present and
concentrate on the moment we're in right now and worry about our team and our
program and trying to build and trying to get better and in doing that
understanding how we have to fight each day and we have to cherish each day.  
  
Look, I love my alma mater. I always will. I have an incredible deal of
respect and love for the man that I played for. All of us that played there
were incredibly lucky and fortunate that he's still there. And so it's
something that bonds all of us.  
  
Duke is a special place. Cameron is a very special place. And I know when that
time comes, I'm sure it will be emotional. I'm positive of that. But it's not
something I've given a lot of thought to.  
  
My focus has been right now on our program and what we have to do to build
this thing the right way and to build it with a great foundation that's
sustainable for a very, very long time.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open the floor up for questions, please. So as we have reached
the end of a very long day, coach, I will ask from here. The Tigers last year
advanced to the Sweet 16, the first time since 1997, and finished the season
ranked 20th in the AP, 18th in USA today. What type of springboard has that
been through the off season?  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: I think there's a lot of positive momentum in our program.
Certainly the Sweet 16 run is a big part of that, but I think there's a lot of
other things that have been going on the last couple years to really make us
feel good about what we're doing and where we're going, specifically the new
facility that we're in, Swann, has just been an unbelievable upgrade for us. I
think it's made our players realize that basketball's important at Clemson and
that they have everything they need to be successful. Certainly last year's
run was a lot of fun for our players and just the culmination of a lot of hard
work. I do think that the challenge for this year's team is to continue to
build on that and these two guys are a big part of that.  
  
Q. You guys are at the end of what will presumably be a fantastic career
at Clemson, knowing that this is your last spin around, what thoughts are
going through your mind?  
SHELTON MITCHELL: Really just to enjoy it. Like he said it's our last season,
we want to go out with a bang, really just have fun and just do everything we
can to have another great year.  
  
MARCQUISE REED: Yeah, going off what he said, just enjoy my senior season, try
to do all the right things on and off the court and just make it a fun time.  
  
Q. I was wondering going into the season how you feel about this team as
compared to some of the ones in the past.  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well I'm excited. Any time you're blessed to have a back court
like these guys coming back, experienced players who have been through the
warrants of our league, been in NCAA tournament games, both played extremely
well in difficult environments, and then to have a guy like Elijah Thomas
inside, a guy who is worked as hard as anyone in our league in the last 18
months and has been a real catalyst for our team, especially defensively, to
come back just gives you a lot of confidence. David Skara, another senior.
It's fun and exciting for me to have a veteran group back not only because
they're good players but because they're fun to coach. This is just a really
good group of guys that cares about our program, cares about Clemson, and care
about each other. So that, any time you're around guys like that who are also
very talented as a coach you realize that's special. And that's certainly what
I'm blessed to have this year.  
  
Q. Marcquise, talk about what you see in the young guys, the new guys
that Clemson people in the media can see this year, especially at your
position.  
MARCQUISE REED: We got a lot of new guys, we got a few freshmen that came in,
we got some transfers and then we got the young guys from last year. And all
them bring something different to the table. At the guard spots we got Clyde,
we got John Newman and Hunter Tyson on the wings and all those guys bring
toughness to our program, Hunter can shoot the 3, John Newman, athletic guard,
a wing that can defend, come off ball screens, make shots. And Clyde has
definitely up his game from last year, he's running the offense great at the
point guard position, showing he can score and lead, rebound and doing all the
little things.  
  
Q. Shelton, you finished last season on a pretty much a positive note,
you were on fire there for a bit. As you put the goals in place yourself for
this year, and you've probably already played those goals through your head
several times, what is it beyond the points per game that you feel like that
you want to contribute this year?  
SHELTON MITCHELL: I feel like I just want to be more of a leader, be more of a
vocal leader. Like he said, last year we had seniors that were very vocal and
outgoing that helped the team at all times. And I think besides the points and
everything like that, that's very important, just to be more of a vocal
leader, someone that guys can look up to during the game, ask questions, just
stuff like that.  
  
Q. We hear a lot of players say that they want to be a leader. How do
you as a coaching staff, how do you convey what leadership means? Obviously
it's by example, but as a teacher how do you teach leadership?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Just a variety of avenues. Certainly I think you talk to them
about it, find out what they think it means to them, where they have seen it,
examples that they have seen in their lives. And then you talk about how, we
talk a little bit about how leadership doesn't discriminate in our program.
You don't naturally have to be a captain or the senior on a team to be a good
leader. You can lead in a variety of ways. What we try to talk about a little
bit is just you have to lead with your personality. It doesn't change who you
are. Some guys who get older try to become somebody they're not and that's not
what we want, we want you to lead out of your personality and these guys do a
great job of that. These guys, Elijah, are probably the three leaders in our
program right now, they're all very different. Elijah is much more vocal and
demonstrative and energetic. 'Quise is kind of a quiet guy, goes about his
business, really very competitive, so when he says something guys listen
because they understand the competitive fire that burns in him. And then a guy
like Shelton is just kind of the guy who keeps our team calm. I think he's a
guy who understands the needs of others very well, he's very bright. And so I
think they do a good job of leading to their personalities, which is something
we talk about in our program a lot.  
  
Q. When you look at the course of your career who have been your biggest
influences style list particularly philosophically, that kind of stuff?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well I've had a lot. Certainly my dad in terms of just how you
do things. He was a high school coach and just raising me the right way to do
things the right way. I think that is where I got a lot of my belief and how I
live my life and what we do. In terms of basketball it started probably the
greatest influence on me was my college coach, Royce Waltman, who I played for
at DePaul University. He was assistant for Coach Knight. He was very
instrumental in my development as a player and as a young coach and I asked
him a lot of things when I was a young coach. I was very fortunate to work for
Jerry Wainwright at UNC Wilmington for eight years. I learned a lot about
program building and all that is entailed in running a really good program and
kind of trying to build a program from scratch. So he was very helpful to me
in that area. And then just a lot of other folks in the business throughout
the course of my career that I've leaned on piece by piece on certain
situations.  
  
Q. Marcquise, in walking around this building today this is obviously
where you're going to play the tournament in March, in walking the building
how much more real does the season feel? Does this allow you some context for
what it is that you're striving for?  
MARCQUISE REED: Yeah, for sure. We're going to be playing here for the ACC
tournament, it's also a great location for us, we're going to have some fans
come down here. Also it brings back memories to playing here my freshman year
in the tournament, so that's all good things for us heading into the season.  
  
Q. Shelton, same question for you.  
SHELTON MITCHELL: Definitely. Not only for the tournament just to show that
the season's almost here. We have been waiting all off season, going against
each other in the summer, practices, and workouts and really just finally
being able to play against somebody else and just enjoy the season.  
  
Q. Someone asked a question earlier today and I thought it was a very
good question, what type of team will you be bringing here in March?  
BRAD BROWNELL: That's hard to say right now. I think we're all still a work in
progress in October. I like our team a lot. If we're playing well it's because
we're defending at a high level and playing with great energy and passion and
togetherness. That's kind of the feeling that we had late last year throughout
most of last season really, started early as we developed our identity in
November and December of last year with some great wins on the road. And then
we were able to overcome the injury of Donte Grantham, a really talented
senior last year, and tweak a few things and play at a high level to finish
the season. I was really proud of our guys with that. But this is a new team,
with new leadership, and we do have a lot of positive experiences to draw on,
but our identity is still a little bit yet to be figured out.  
  
Q. Do you have to walk out of here with a trophy to call it a successful
season?  
BRAD BROWNELL: No, not necessarily. There's certainly lots of games out there
notice ACC and hopefully beyond. We obviously want to come here and play
extremely well in Charlotte, it would be important to us, we hope to bring a
lot of fans and want to do something that hasn't been done in our school in a
long time, which is play deep into the tournament. So we want to do that.  
  
Q. Do you feel like there's any one player in particular who is ready to
take a big step this year?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Oh, I don't know. I mean Aamir Simms is a logical guy from the
standpoint of he started a little bit at the end of last year, he'll have a
great opportunity to start this year. I think he's put in tremendous amount of
work, really improved his shooting. Hopefully just feels like the game is
slowed down a bit and adjusted for him. He's a likely candidate. Maybe David
Skara is another guy that even though he's a senior and played some last year
we hope that he's going to take a step and show some development. He's had a
good fall for us, he's, he really always helps us defensively, sometimes he's
one of those guys that he can't always be measured by his pure stats because
he does so many other things, his versatility, his ability to play multiple
positions, guard point guards, power forward, you don't always appreciate just
his basic stats, but I think he's a guy that could take a big step forward as
well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Clemson, thank you. Good luck.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Coach, your last several teams have been quite experienced. This year
you have two returning starters and I'm counting five freshmen on the roster.
How will you approach this season differently? How will you approach the
season?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, it is different for us. There's no question about it. I'm
the guy who made up the phrase when guys get jobs, I tell them get old and
stay old. And we've lived by that. But it's a little different rotation this
year.  
  
It certainly starts with these two guys to my right and left setting the tone.
But now we have five freshmen and a transfer and four of the freshmen and the
transfer will all be part of it. And it's kind of exciting new territory for
me to watch them grow strategically we went on a foreign tour this summer. So
we had extra reps and the ten extra practices that were so important for this
particular team.  
  
The new faces that we do have fit who we are. There's some shot makers in that
group. Scoring for us last year was a little bit tricky at times especially
when a Colson and a Farrell was down. I think we can stretch the floor again
that way. I can't say enough about the job these two guys have done as leaders
because it's more heavy lifting when you have five freshmen and a transfer
that you're breaking in.  
  
So I think it's a group -- we were talking on the way over here, we're going
to be so different when we come back to this building in four months as a
team. It's interesting to think who will be -- and I have to remember it's new
for me.  
  
I don't have as many old guys and veterans. I'll have to be patient as we grow
them.  
  
Q. Mike, you were among the first to advocate for a 20-game league
schedule. Are you similarly in favor of opening the season with conference
games as the ACC will do in '19-'20?  
COACH BREY: Those are the other two points that the other coaches in the
league are mad at me about. I may have told you here, in my first league
meeting, we kind of started talking about how to get more bids in this league,
because we had just come from the Big East, Boeheim and Jamie Dixon, it was
our first meeting. And what do you guys -- we were the first league to go from
16 to 18 league games. Have we ever thought about, what about 20 league games?
I thought it got us more bids when we went to 16 and 18. And they almost ran
me out of the room down there in Jacksonville.  
  
I think, again, it's good for us. It has to happen as we have the ACC Network
coming online. I think it strengthens everybody's schedule. And you have no
choice if you go to 20 league games and that's a good thing for more bids for
our league.  
  
See, the philosophy of this league, I think, when I got back here -- in the
Big East, the philosophy was how many bids can we get. The philosophy was here
how do we protect the 1 seeds. How are the 1 seeds protected? And I really
think that's changed in the last couple of years where our league has looked
and said we're more about getting nine, ten, how do we get more bids.  
  
I thought that was a philosophical change. I think opening -- I think the best
conference in America opening the season next year is a no-brainer. I think
it's exciting. I would say it was split in the room when it came up. It needed
to gain some momentum in Jacksonville two years ago. But I think it's a no-
brainer to come right out of the gate with the ACC playing basketball and
helping the network out, having programming right out of the gate.  
  
I don't know if it's an ever-year thing but I think for next year I love it. I
love the idea.  
  
Q. There seems to be a split among coaches. We've had some coaches say,
as the trial in New York City has gone on, that they're not aware of that
world and it's not something that they really -- they think has been
overstated. Yet coaches like Coach Boyle from Colorado saying, no, it's not
overstated. Just wondering where you stand in the whole situation?  
COACH BREY: No, I think it's a black cloud over our game. It's a little bit of
a black eye on the profession. At times, I think we've all been kind of
painted, coaches, that is, with a broad brush by fans. And it's unfortunate
and a little unfair.  
  
My philosophy has been, when I got to Notre Dame, stay really clean and stay
really competitive. And I'm really proud that we've been able to do that
through my 19 years.  
  
But this is an aspect of the basketball world. It's always kind of been out
there a little bit. We've had this underworld. I hope in five years, with some
of the changes coming, we're not going to see it right away, can we be in a
better place?  
  
I think we will be. There's a lot of movement. There's a lot of good people
thinking on how to fix some things. Again, it's not happening in a year and
it's not happening in two years. But I think in five years we're going to look
and say: Boy, those were some decisions we made to help some things. Right now
burn the whole thing down. Let's get it all out. Let's take our medicine. And
if it has to get a little worse before it gets better publicly, we've just got
to take it like a man.  
  
Q. Mike, Chris Mack coming over from the Big East this year as someone
who made that same transition, Big East to ACC, do you think there's a little
bit of an adjustment period there, and how do you think Louisville will play
differently?  
COACH BREY: I don't think it will be for Chris. I think Louisville hit a grand
slam hiring Chris Mack. And I'm excited that our league has another great
coach.  
  
You know, it helps our league to have another great coach. He is tried and
tested and experienced. And he will hit the ground running like he has in
recruiting already.  
  
Q. T.J. and Rex, you had the experience last year playing without Matt
and Bonzie; in Bonzie's case, a really long time. How did that experience
prepare you for the roles you'll have this year, and how do you see your role
expanding this year?  
T.J. GIBBS: Yeah, it was always tough to lose a guy like Bonz and lose another
great player like Matt. But it gave us a lot of stuff to work with. And kind
of made not only me and Rex but guys like Elijah Burns and Nik time to
readjust and play in atmospheres we wouldn't have been able to last year,
whether it was going and starting pretty much a fresh group in Cameron to
having to play in tough games like Miami at home.  
  
Just giving us that experience has been great for this year's team and
something we can propel and use for this season.  
  
REX PFLUEGER: He hit it right on the head right there, honestly. It's one of
those scenarios it's really unfortunate during the time of it, but I think our
team really grew from it and it was really important, like he said, for the
guys that did have to step up in those roles during the time to really find
themselves in those pressurized situations and fight through all that turmoil
that we had to. And it really helped T.J. and I for this year come together
and of course with Elijah Burns as the team captains.  
  
And I just see a lot of positives out of that scenario now. Obviously not
during the time. But during this whole offseason I think we've really grown as
leaders and we're excited to get going.  
  
Q. What's it like playing for a coach like Mike Brey?  
REX PFLUEGER: He's a great guy, he'll let me do that, you see right there. One
of the best people to have in your corner at all times. A person you can go to
and talk to about anything basketball, off-the-court stuff, anything. And he
really gives you the confidence to play your game. And it's one of those
systems, too, that you mature and you learn how to get better.  
  
And I think T.J. and I have really worked together, worked well together. And
now we're playing with all these young guys, and Coach gives us a lot of
opportunity to lead and have our voices heard by these young guys.  
  
So he helps us develop into those leaders by giving us the opportunity to do
so.  
  
T.J. GIBBS: That's a great point. And the biggest thing is it's more so off
the court than it is on the court just being the guy I know I can go to and
talk to about anything. He's always right there in my corner. I know that
he'll give it to me straight, as it is. He always tells me like a man.  
  
If I have a bad game I'm doing something wrong, I count on Coach to tell me
I'm doing something wrong. It's always fun to be around him and always have
his personality. It brings out the best in us. And just knowing that you can't
really ever do anything wrong besides touch his hair. Touch his hair.  
  
Q. Coach --  
COACH BREY: What hair?  
  
Q. Mike, you referenced the changes that are coming in the next five or
so years. Do you think the NBA and the G League initiative will gain much
traction with the so-called elite players?  
COACH BREY: It's hard to say, David. I'm talking to other coaches, is the new
rule -- will it be four, five young men interested in that? Could it be 30? I
don't know.  
  
I look at it more big picture, instead of -- and there's been a lot of
criticism of the rule or hey, that's a good thing.  
  
The one thing I would say, and this is the big picture down the road. The NBA
did react to the Rice Commission with this. I'm not sure it's completely
right. But we do have some cooperation here with them listening a little bit
to some of the things the Rice Commission presented and the NABC, the coaches
association, had a lot of input in Rice Commission suggestions.  
  
So I almost look at it as I don't know if it's the right thing, but at least
we're breaking some ground here. And I do know for a fact that the NBA is
proud that -- with this particular ruling. Again, I'm not sure about big
picture. We've reacted to the Rice Commission. They're very proud that they
did. This is kind of new territory where maybe we've got some chemistry on
this thing that down the road a couple years really helps the game and the
culture.  
  
Q. Going back to the trial, you mentioned having to kind of swallow some
medicine in order to get better. When you said that, did you mean specifically
in terms of possible NCAA sanctions, kind of take what comes? Do you think
there should be a criminal conviction in the trial this week?  
COACH BREY: I don't know if I really have an opinion on the criminalality part
of it. I think it's more of the NCAA violation medicine and the public
relations hit that college basketball is taking and coaches are taking a
little bit as a whole.  
  
We're going to have to just take it. And my feeling is let's get it all out. I
know we have some other trials coming. Let's air it all out and see if -- down
the road we've moved this thing.  
  
But certainly there's some NCAA issues here. There's no question about that.
And the ball will be in their court to see how they rule -- as far as the
breaking the law I don't know, I'm not an expert on that. But we do have some
-- we've had some -- I think you've got to be an amateur, right? Got to be an
amateur, as much as the amateurism -- don't you have to be an amateur. We've
got some guys that aren't amateurs, let's handle that.  
  
Q. Rex, I noticed the fanny pack. What's up with that? And what's in
it?  
REX PFLUEGER: You don't think it's swaggy?  
  
Q. Very much swaggy. What's the deal?  
REX PFLUEGER: It's mostly a style, honestly, trying to bring it back, a little
Wayne's World in it, too, me and him have been in cahoots, and mostly I have
something I can put my glasses in there, my headphones, my little Air Pods and
lip balm, but mostly a fashion statement. Appreciate you noticing.  
  
Q. Going back to the trial and stuff, have there been players that
you've recruited through the years that you felt you didn't get because
another program broke the rules to get them?  
COACH BREY: I don't know if I would go that far. But I do know there are ones
where you had a bad vibe and you walked away and just said this one doesn't
feel right. And there's some red flags and you just don't keep going down that
road.  
  
Q. Your coach, in his 23 seasons, has won 20 games or more 17 times,
including 15 times at Notre Dame. And he's done that in two of the most
difficult, best leagues in the country. As players, what's your perspective on
how he's been so successful at Notre Dame?  
T.J. GIBBS: First off, I mean that speaks volumes on his coaching and what he
can do. And it's all about him in a way. And he recruits guys who, like Rex,
just know how to play basketball and he always puts us in the right position.  
  
I trust Coach no matter what we're going through, whether we're losing seven
or we're on a five-game winning streak he'll always put us in the right
position. And just knowing that he trusts in us, the biggest part of that,
too, to say, hey, look, I see this. Oh, really, I didn't see that. And next
thing you know it leads to us hitting a shot or something. It's always a great
plan knowing that I can look to him on the sideline and he'll be, like, right
over there. And it's a great feeling to have.  
  
And I trust him with everything in me. And I know that he's doing a great job.
And just going to keep leading this team.  
  
REX PFLUEGER: T.J. is right. Coach does a great job, doesn't say a lot. He
lets the players do a lot of the talking. But when he says something he's
always right. You can see everything in his halftime speeches and the critical
moments going down to the end of the games, he always says the right things.  
  
And I think it's a testament to his basketball knowledge, to go on about the
winning seasons I think it's just because he does a great job cultivating his
culture that he's really grown in Notre Dame with the players that he
recruits, like T.J. said, and also just the attitude and maturity that he
wants us to have on and off the court. He always says you're not only
representing yourself, but you're representing your school, your team and your
family. And he really does a great job reiterating that every single year.  
  
COACH BREY: Okay, you guys are starting. (Laughter). You'll start.  
  
Q. You spent a very anxious Selection Sunday in March, to say the least.
What were your thoughts with the demise of the RPI and now the influx of what
we're calling the net?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, well, I'm still trying to figure it out a little bit. I take
my hat off to the committee and the NCAA that we're modernizing it some.
There's no question about it. And you talk about Selection Sunday. And T.J.,
to be on the board after losing seven in a row, it speaks to the strength of
our league that you can always recover in our league and still get a chance to
get there.  
  
But I like it. We had a general presentation -- I'm on the NABC board and
Danny Gavitt and some people talked about it. And some new stuff, some new
territory.  
  
I guess I don't pay attention to the numbers as much as I'm blessed to be in
this -- the blessing and the curse is the ACC. So the good news is -- the bad
news is, God you play in the ACC. The good news is you play in the ACC. And
the good news is there's always a resumé win around the corner. And if you can
get that record into 9-9 range and 10-8 you're getting in this thing now,
we're getting nine bids. We almost got 10.  
  
So when you're in a league like that, and those of us that were in the Big
East, we lived it before we came. It has that feel. You say, okay, you mean if
I get to the top half of this league I get to eighth or ninth, I'm in?  
  
That keeps you from going off the rocker in the summer. You stay a little
saner in the summer when you think of it in that context.  
  
We lose seven straight and we make a run and we beat Virginia Tech up there
and I still can't believe -- we were in the bracket until Davidson knocked us
out an hour before selection -- that's the power of the ACC and the strength
of the schedule overall and everything.  
  
So there's a good thing about being in this league where you have power in
your schedule and you can play your way to the bubble.  
  
I think we won at Boston College and my line was: If you squint real hard you
can see the bubble. And I was kind of doing that to just talk everybody into
it. A month later we were. I was like I can't believe it but we may get in
this thing.  
  
It was disappointing to get so close and not make it. But again I love the
fact nine bids, close to ten bids, we're into that territory now. And I think
that was always the goal when we came over from the Big East in those initial
meetings, how do we -- you know for a fact when the ACC got three or four bids
and was looking up at Providence and we were getting ten, they were flat-out
pissed. You guys know it, every league was like how is that all happening? And
now everyone's pissed at us, which is a good thing. Let's keep getting nine or
ten.  
  
Q. How do you see the league this year in terms of how strong it will be
and the teams that are the ones to chase?  
COACH BREY: Well, there's no question. I've got so much respect for Virginia
and North Carolina and what they have coming back and to right out of the
gate, and Virginia Tech, those. Duke is really gifted. There's a lot of young
faces, a lot of new guys.  
  
After you get through those couple, then there's a lot of people you can throw
in there four to ten, to 11. And we want to get into that four to nine range
and see if we can snag a bid. And I think that's, again, the great thing about
the league, you can play your way into that position with the strength of it.
But the unbalanced schedule makes it interesting with not everybody plays the
same. And sometimes that breaks right for you and sometimes that breaks you.
You know?  
  
But as you remember, the Big East was the first league to come up with that
unbalanced schedule back when they had the mini conference, it was Syracuse,
Georgetown, Connecticut. Syracuse, Pittsburgh, Connecticut and Notre Dame, we
all repeated each other. We were the first to kind of do that. We went 9-7
twice in that mini conference era and didn't get a bid. And there were some
teams in our league that went 13-3 but I don't know if the committee really
knew strength of league schedule back then, because it was new.  
  
Now everybody has got an unbalanced one. So the committee I think is trained.
But, again, get to the top -- with the team I have, is can we fight to that
top half? Can we get to that top half? You get to that top half, you're
getting in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Tyus Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34258)

### [Frank Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34259)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak to what these two men have meant to you and
their expected contributions this season?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, last year we ended up with two guards. And that's never
happened to me. And I don't know if it's ever happened in college basketball
where you have just two guards the whole last part of the year where they had
to play 40 minutes a game and really saved the season.  
  
There would have been zero chance if either one of them had gotten hurt in any
way shape or form. But I thought the way they played under the conditions that
they had to deal with and playing three games a week and playing 40 minutes a
night, and then getting -- playing well at the end of the year, getting in the
tournament, then having to play three games in six, seven days, really, was
incredible what they did on both ends of the court. They were really good
defensively.  
  
I think Frank led the league in steals. And they just were tremendous
defensively and offensively. I can't say enough about all that they've done
for us last year and what I believe they'll do this year.  
  
Frank's been out a little while. We think he'll be back around the first of
November. And we hope that he'll be able to go pretty quickly after that. But
it's great to have two veteran guys back that have been as consistent and been
as good as these two guys have. It's very unusual in college basketball. I'm
really thrilled to have them both back.  
  
Q. You went through a year, two, three seasons ago, where you weren't as
long in the front line as you like to be. Looking at the back end of your zone
last year looked like the arms again got longer. How much more comfortable are
you as a coach to have 7'2 " Chukwu, Dolezaj, 6'10", and Oshae Brissett at
6'8".  
COACH BOEHEIM: Length is good no matter what defense you play. Whether you
play man-to-man or zone it's good to be long, big. But our defense got better
and better last year. Have every reason to believe it will be as good this
year. I think we'll play faster this year.  
  
Whenever you play faster it creates more possessions and obviously you're
going to give up more points if you're giving them more possessions. But
that's the way we like to play. But to have that kind of size is good for any
defense. It's good for ours.  
  
I think just as important or more important is Frank and Tyus, their size at
the guard spot, is really helpful in our defense. We can get away with a
little bit smaller guys in the front line in some cases but it really helps
our defense to have length at the guard spot.  
  
And Frank and Tyus are two of the better defensive players that we've had.  
  
Q. Tyus, your freshman year you averaged 11 points per game. Last year
19 points per game. In a system like Syracuse, is it reasonable to think that
your scoring average would jump another eight points like it did between your
freshman and sophomore year? Where do you think your point totals might top
out?  
TYUS BATTLE: I mean, I haven't really thought about much of my point totals at
all. To go up eight extra points that would be pretty impressive, but
unlikely.  
  
I'm just going out this year just trying to play my game, get me teammates
involved. But also stay aggressive and I think good things will happen if I do
those things.  
  
Q. Following up Coach's point about length in the back court, Frank led
the league in steals; Tyus, you weren't too far behind, you had 54. With the
defense that you play, what are the opportunities to get steals?  
TYUS BATTLE: I mean, like Coach said, we're both 6'6" up top. And that's rare
to see both your point guard and your 2 guard being that tall, that long, that
athletic.  
  
And that just makes it tough to score on us. We can jump passing lanes. It's
really tough to get 3-point looks up. And our goal is just to make things
difficult. If we do those things where we're going to be successful.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: Playing for Coach Boeheim, scoring the ball, getting up and down
is a point of emphasis. To do that you've got to get the ball. And I've been
screamed at a little bit for some gambles but that's what we want to do. We
want to play passing lane, make it tough on offenses and kind of have guys
overthink.  
  
Q. Frank, you're a senior now. How did that happen?  
FRANK HOWARD: That's a good question nowadays. But I just have been working
hard every year trying to get better. And with the help of my teammates and
coaching staff, they made it a lot easier for me, especially over the last
two, three years. And I just used the grow up I had, especially the first two
years, to incorporate it in my game now.  
  
Q. Frank, I talked to you earlier about you graduating, what you wanted
to do after life with Syracuse. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, on
what you're going to graduate with and what you want to do moving forward?  
FRANK HOWARD: I have a child and family -- I will have a child and families
degree. I just wanted to use that to incorporate with helping back with my
community and also later down the line with Coach. And I love the game of
basketball. I want to stay in it. And some day be like Coach one day.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: You don't want to be like that. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, interesting question came up in an earlier session as we think
about the floor behind you. What type of team do you think you'll have as you
come back here in March?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think we've got, with so many veterans back, hopefully it
will be a pretty good reflection of what we finished with last year, with a
little more depth, and some guys that can help us, I think, shoot the ball,
especially from the perimeter has gotten better.  
  
I just think the extra depth gives you an opportunity to run more, play at a
little faster pace. But the experience you get -- and when you're successful,
sometimes if you have four or five guys back and you didn't win, it's maybe
not that good a thing.  
  
But these guys were very successful at the end of the year. They know what it
takes to be successful in the league and in the tournament. And all that
experience is going to be positive for us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak to the development of 20 games next year and
maybe talk about scheduling? I remember when you first joined the league you
had some very interesting comments, which I think most of us chuckled at.
You're like, how did I end up having to play road games back to back to back
against Carolina, Duke and Virginia. There was a lot of giggling. Has
scheduling settled down for you in Syracuse where you're more comfortable with
the tour of duty, if you will?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think for us it's been difficult in the Big East when you had
to go Connecticut, Georgetown, St. John's. And it's just as difficult in the
ACC with some of the games you can get.  
  
They're all really tough now. It doesn't matter too much about the three. Any
road games are going to be difficult. But the 20 games -- I've never been a
big fan of going to 20. But it is what the league decided to do and that's
what we're going to do.  
  
It probably eliminates a non-conference game or two that you would challenge
yourself at in terms of playing somebody that would be at a comparable level.
But it's the same for everybody. The early games. I've never been a big fan of
playing early conference games. I like to get built up to it. But it's what
we're all going to do. And we played really good, tough games early before.
And that's what we'll have with this.  
  
But when you're in a great league, you're going to have tough trips, tough
games. That's what it's about. And if you have a good team or you have the
potential to be a good team, that's going to help you get there.  
  
Q. On page 18 of this year's media guide there's a young man by the name
of Buddy Boeheim on the roster. What's the experience been like for you
coaching him in a different arena, if you will?  
COACH BOEHEIM: He's a good player. He's worked hard. He's fun to coach because
he works at the game. He loves to play. He always has. There's obviously some
challenges. You want to see your son do well. But my job's to win games. And
we're going to play the guys that are going to help us win the games.  
  
If he can do that, that would be great. I'd be happy. And I think his mother
would be a lot happier.  
  
Q. Tyus, obviously it's one game at a time. That's always been the case.
But as you look at opening up the season, are there things that you feel like
you want to accomplish early to set the tone for the season?  
TYUS BATTLE: I mean, different from last year, Frank and I we were the only
two players that had that basketball experience going into last year. But this
season we have all five starters back. We all have the taste of the
tournament. We should all have that college experience under our belt.  
  
So I'm looking to start off right just from the door and we should all be
ready to play, ready to compete. And I'm really excited about the season.  
  
Q. Preseason voting is always a challenge. They want us to do it. And I
haven't voted yet. I'm looking for advice. You guys on the podium, any of you,
who do you see as the top teams in the league, besides Syracuse, of course?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, obviously you've got Virginia. They won the league.
They're really good. Got a lot of guys back. Duke has got the best freshman
class in the country and two or three top picks probably in this year's draft.
Carolina is very good. A lot of guys. Virginia Tech's got a lot of guys back.  
  
There's a lot of really good teams and you can name those and you are still
going to leave somebody else that's pretty good too. So the league's tough.
It's always been tough. And we're going to get seven, eight, nine teams in the
tournament most years.  
  
And so you have to navigate through that league. And last year we did get
better at the end. But it was a struggle all year for us in the league. I
think we finished ninth or tenth and still good enough to get to the Sweet 16
out of this league. So it's very competitive and it's going to make you
better.  
  
TYUS BATTLE: Like Coach said, I believe the ACC is one of the best leagues in
the country. Have to be ready to play every single night. I think it just
makes us a better team in the long run.  
  
Virginia is always good. Duke is always good. North Carolina is always good.
Great players, great coaches. So it just makes us a better team at the end of
the day.  
  
Q. Frank, going back to the idea that you're a senior and you got to be
a senior fairly quickly because time does go by. When you look back at your
Syracuse career, what do you think your biggest takeaway from your experience
with Coach Boeheim will be? What's the lesson? What do you think will carry
with you, do you think?  
FRANK HOWARD: That's a good question. But just the whole experience. This is
something else down there -- when you think about it, it's kind of a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity to get here to this stage on this team and to be
coached by this guy right here.  
  
So, you know, I appreciate every moment. And in the beginning it was a little
tough to understand those bumpy roads and those times to grow it was a little
hard being young. You want to play. You want to help your team. You want to do
well.  
  
But I think those times have prepared me not only just for a good basketball
career after this but a good life.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think with Frank's case it's very important to see how you
work through things, how you have to struggle sometimes to overcome what's in
front of you. And to be able to go through that, and I think last year Frank
was one of the very best point guards in the league and played well in the
tournament, is poised as soon, as we get him back on the court, to have a
great year. And it's great to see that kind of development from your players.
It's really one of the best parts of coaching.  
  
Q. Coach, this will be your 43rd year. And I ask it with a smile, but
you've seen a lot. Have you seen it all yet?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You've never seen it all. There's something around the corner
all the time. In terms of coaching, it's the same every year, you get a group
of kids and you try to get them to be the best they can be and get them to
play together and have success. You want each team to have success, to be able
to do something special. And every year you start out with that opportunity.  
  
And last year, as much of a struggle as it was, it was probably as rewarding
as any year for what these two guys helped this team accomplish last year. And
that's what coaching's all about, really.  
  
Q. We asked this question earlier of another coach, when you look at
your preconference schedule, those out-of-conference games as the season
starts, how do you schedule -- what are you looking for as you are trying to
build the schedule getting ready for league play?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, what we try to do is we try to play in a good tournament.
We're in New York with Connecticut, Oregon, Iowa. So we try to get that kind
of a tournament every year. We're playing, trying to play couple games like
we've played Georgetown for a few years now.  
  
And then we try to find the best games we can find. We know we have the Big
Ten game with Ohio State. But we try to find teams that are really good.
Buffalo, Northeastern, Old Dominion, are all favored to do well, win their
conference or do well in their conference.  
  
I think last year the Buffalo game probably was one of the things that got us
in the tournament, the win against Buffalo, they ended up being a Top 25 team,
stage -- Tier 1, whatever it's called, win.  
  
But it also challenges our players. We're playing St. Bonaventure again. They
beat us last year. So we're trying to play as many challenging games as we can
to help our strength of schedule but also to help our team get better. You
can't go out there against those teams and just show up. You've got to play.
You've got to play really good basketball. It's just as tough as playing a
league game.  
  
Those schools come in with the opportunity to make their season if they can
beat us. So those are the games we try to look for in the non-conference part
of our schedule and I think it's what helped us get in the tournament last
year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Jack Salt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33162)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Now that you have so many big men and so many guards --  
COACH TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I want to let Jack bring it up and we're going to
propose a 15-second shot clock. I think that should be the next rule change. I
mentioned that at the round table. Absolutely.  
  
No, I think every year, you just try to find ways that are unique to your team
that give you a chance to be successful, and we do have some big guys in all
seriousness.  
  
Jack runs the floor very hard, and some guys that can run the floor -- so
probably more opportunistic. If I sit here in front of you and say, hey, we're
going to try to run on every make and be like a Carolina and be like some of
the teams in our league that, wouldn't be accurate. But always opportunistic.  
  
It's always about decision-making. Good shot selection and decision-making. If
you push and there's something good that's there, so be it, but if not, it's a
feel. Sometimes you need to work the ball and do it. But those baskets, if you
can get some off of turnovers or big guys running, are important.  
  
It's hard to believe it's ten years, but you have asked that question every
year, so thanks for asking it again. Good job, Frank.  
  
Q. Coach, and Jack, your opinion, as well. You look at some of the new
players coming in, specifically Braxton, now that he has eligibility, Jay Huff
and Kihei Clark, how have they progressed defensively from where you like to
have people when they see more playing time on the court, and Jack, how have
you been able to help some of the big men develop defensively now that Isaiah
is gone and you have to pick up more of the slack?  
JACK SALT: Isaiah was a guy I looked up to and tried to learn as much as I
could.  
  
So over the time I was with him, was trying to learn and watch film with him
and I'm just trying to pass that knowledge on to the younger guys. Braxton
coming in here, his first year here, it's tough to get acclimated straightaway
and he's been trying really hard. Jay, I've been trying to give him advice as
much as possible. So those are two guys in my position that I try to help out
as much as I can.  
  
COACH TONY BENNETT: I think Jack -- Isaiah from the front court players, and
overall, was really a vocal leader defensively and held the guys accountable.
I think that's going to be a great opportunity and challenge for Jack to not
let that slide.  
  
We still have work as a whole group defensively to keep working and improving,
and that's just a process. That's not easy. But I think Jack's voice and his
heart and mind for it will be a real important piece for our defense.  
  
Those other guys that you mentioned, the newer guys or younger guys, it's a
process. We kind of do -- the younger players, we've had our older players, we
have a little exercise we do. But they always say: I can remember when I first
got here, and feeling a little overwhelmed at times. You know, the challenges
of being either a first-year in our program or new, and everybody kind of has
it and how challenging that is.  
  
So the ability to just encourage them, but make it hard for them and challenge
them, and not -- not give any wiggle room, but not destroy them in terms of
what you're trying to get defensively because that has been a very important
aspect for us.  
  
Q. Kyle, presumably it's the first time you've walked into this building
since March. How much do you keep with you what happened in last season, and
how much do you try to pack it away?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I think for me, it's never forgetting it, but definitely
trying to move past it to where I'm not hanging my head on it. I think it's
taken me a little bit longer than some of the other guys, but that's just
because I'm an emotional kid and I'm real passionate about things. That cut me
real deep.  
  
But Coach said something last night when we were meeting with him and Jack,
and he said that, you know, courage is not the absence of fear; it's moving
forward in the face of fear, and I think that's something that I'm going to
hold onto for the rest of my life. I think one of the greatest things and I
didn't wanted to be here so bad was because it was in the same arena. I think
this is the best way for me to face my demons.  
  
Q. For Kyle, seems to me that last year against VCU, you demonstrated a
sequence of moves, and it's almost like somebody opening a new Swiss Army
knife. All of a sudden it was the dribble-hesitation jumpshot, the dribble
penetration pass, the dribble-spin-around, almost falling out-of-bounds, wave
to the fans, sell popcorn, make a three. What have you worked on between that
time to make your game even better this year?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I'm a big proponent on expanding my game in all areas. I'm
known for my, you know, jumpshot, and I still try to make that as consistent
as possible and Coach stays on me about that.  
  
Just trying to stay aggressive and make sure that I'm working on all areas,
whether it's creating off the dribble for somebody else or for myself,
defensively, anything. Just always trying to hold myself accountable and get a
little bit better each day.  
  
Q. When you look at your teammate in Kyle, he doubled his point
production from his freshman year to a sophomore year, and not thinking that
he's going to double it this year to 28 points. There is an elevation in his
game. What do you see as the experience, the elder statesmen of this group,
what do you see about Kyle's game that you like?  
JACK SALT: Like you said he's all been a good shooter but he's worked on that
and worked on taking it to the basket strong. He's good at finding people.
He's just a great teammate to play with and just the ability for him to be
able to knock down the outside shot, and now he's added to be able to take it
strong into the lane, and whether it's a float, dish or a strong take to the
rim, he's really worked on that.  
  
Q. Your defense has been very constant through the years. Last year was
one of your best offensive seasons. How much more difficult is it to defeat
the style that Virginia plays, when the ball is going in?  
COACH TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think that's the case with anybody. But if we can
always be solid and start with the defensive end of the floor and make people
earn to score against us, and then, you know, you accompany that with good
offense and versatile offense, that's when we are at our best and we've had
our best games, best years.  
  
But there are always times where our offense can come and go, and it's: Can
your defense be constant. That can sometimes keep you in games and win you
games when your offense doesn't show up.  
  
Neither of them are easy to perfect. But I like the versatility of this year's
team offensively, and I think there's some good things there that hopefully
will show this year and that will show the diversity of the team and just
different looks.  
  
Q. I have two questions if that's okay. First for Jack. Talking about
some of your fellow post players, how would you compare and contrast your game
with their games?  
JACK SALT: Jay and Mamadi are both good shooters. They shoot from the outside.
I prefer playing on the inside, but they can both also play on the inside. I
think Mamadi is really athletic. When he's making strong moves he's really
hard to guard on the post, and Jay can stretch the four out as a 5-man, which
has been tough to guard in practice. But I think we all work pretty hard.
Still a lot of room to grow on the defensive end, but I think it's a good
group of guys.  
  
Q. We heard Coach talk about Braxton's experience and how he'll affect
this offense. We saw in the scrimmage he was really fluid and looked like a
good distributor. How do you think his presence will affect the offense this
season?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I think he has a really good feel for the game. I played with
him and against him in AAU and on the circuit and at camp, so I saw this
firsthand. I think he's a very good passer, actually. Sometimes he
predetermines things before he does them, but he's really active on the
rebounds, and offensive rebounds, also. He's a strong kid. He's actually
pretty athletic. I think once he completely buys into it defensively, he can
be a nightmare.  
  
Q. With Devin graduated, Ty is going to pick up a lot more of the main
point guard role. What do you like about his game and how he's developed and
do you think he'll end up passing you the ball more now?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, sorry. Caught me off guard. He's probably the best leader that
I've -- one of the best leaders in terms of vocalizing and communication.
Sometimes he likes to talk a lot and doesn't really say much, but he's, you
know, tremendous to be in the backcourt with. You know, we can finish each
other's sentences when we're on the court together and I think that's big that
we have that chemistry.  
  
You know, he's probably one of the best point guards in the country.  
  
Q. How does the defense use the skills of Jack and Diakite, and
conversely, how does it help the overall effectiveness of the defense to have
players with their defensive skills?  
COACH TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think size. You know, Jack is so willing to come
across and help and he's so physical. Physicality is important defensively,
especially same with Mamadi. Whether it's blocking a shot or whether there's a
breakdown on the perimeter, they can clean up a lot of stuff, but just their
willingness, their willingness to stay down, to work, to understand how
valuable that is for us; that they learn from guys like Isaiah that Isaiah
learned from Akil and so forth. I think those guys are pretty clear in the
value of it and how important it is and how continuous they have to be.  
  
So when you have size and length -- and I know the game a lot of times is four
guards now or four out, but Mamadi has that mobility. It's important but
Jack's physicality, offensively and defensively, is a significant factor in
our effectiveness on D.  
  
Q. Charlotte has a bit of another meeting in that you lost Ron Sanchez
to lead the department or lead the program for them what's it going to being
like to look down the bench and not see his face there?  
COACH TONY BENNETT: Yeah, Ron is a dear friend. Couldn't be happier for him to
have this position at UNC Charlotte. But we have a great staff and there's all
been continuity in our staff and we've added. I moved Orlando Vandross and
added Kyle Getter. So our staff is very strong.  
  
But Ron, to me, was a great coach. He actually was at Indiana when my sister
was the head women's coach and he was with me all those years at Washington
State for the last 15 years or whatever it's been.  
  
So you're losing a friend, someone that understands things. So that's the part
I'll miss the most but it was time for him, and he had turned down some other
jobs, but I couldn't be happier for him. I think he's going to do some good
things. It will take him time, but he's a special one for sure, and will be
missed.  
  
Q. I remember distinctly during your first season at Virginia, you kept
your smile on your face. You kept speaking positively. And now you've come
with the program so far. You look at the number of wins, it's astronomical --
I can't even read; the font's too small. But averaging basically 30 wins over
the last five years. How do you keep the program steady now and moving forward
and how do you reset expectations every year and how do you keep your staff
together, almost intact from the beginning?  
COACH TONY BENNETT: I just think I've been fortunate to recruit players that
are -- I don't know if sneaky good is the right word, but they are better than
people realize. They are really good players and they develop and they work
and they love the game and they love to play together, and they embrace the
fact that, you know, we're Virginia and we're still trying to knock on that
door and do something as special as we can.  
  
I don't think we assume anything, I don't. I read a letter that actually was
sent to Bobby Knight way back after he had a tough loss in the tournament they
had an undefeated year. Claire B. wrote him a letter. Someone sent it to me.
And it was the idea of being strengthened by the very blow that cut you down,
but the premise of it was: We're going to run to the starting line.  
  
This is a new team this year. This is a different team. So many people want to
say, well, okay, you've got to get back, you've got to vindicate yourself or
validate that, you know, what happened -- no. This is about us running to the
starting line of the season and taking it absolutely as far as we can possibly
go, and it's about growing from last year's unbelievable success and growing
from last year's very humbling loss, and using it to help us respond and be
better.  
  
That's the reality of why this team -- great coaches. Great assistant coaches.
Probably an okay head coach. But your staff makes you look really good, I'll
be honest. Players that are very good. They are so much better than people
give them credit for, and they develop. And then a willingness to know, you've
got to go get it. It's we don't think we are better than we are. We don't
think we're worse than we are. We just show up and try to be as good as we can
and use the experiences that have happened.  
  
It was such a unique year last year, and we've talked about that and we know
that's going to be in our face how that ended. But it was historic in terms of
the success that was taken from it.  
  
So taking that, but realizing, these guys, we're united in what we're
pursuing. That's one of our things we're talking about, being united in our
pursuit and going after it. Whether we get it or not, that remains to be seen,
but we'll go after it with everything we have, not assuming anything.  
  
I think that's been one of the keys to why this program has gone that far, and
I'm no dummy. I know it's also very good fortune and a blessing. It's a good
gift that's come my way in success and in failure, but it's not from my own
doing. I understand that. It's been a gift, and that's how I choose to look at
it.  
  
Q. When you do come back to this building in March, what team will you
be bringing back with you after four and a half months of play?  
KYLE GUY: I think we're going to be a very tenacious group this year, and I
think that the open dialogue that we've had as a team and coaching staff, that
Coach Bennett has not made us do but allowed us to do, has made us a closer
group and just better overall because we know we can trust each other.  
  
We know we've been vulnerable and now we can really move past and get to March
again which is the ultimate goal and just play our best and leave everything
on the floor. I think that's all we can do.  
  
Q. Virginia, more than any other school, has had the upper hand in the
last five years in the ACC, certainly having a dominant season last year but
you've not translated the same success in the ACC to the n AAA. Curious your
thoughts as to why that is?  
COACH TONY BENNETT: Yeah, we've been to an Elite 8, a Sweet 16. We usually
advance past the first round the years we've been in it and obviously we had
the loss.  
  
There's been some success, and I'm not trying to say -- I would never take
that away from what these guys have done, but the excitement, the beauty of
the NCAA Tournament is the one-and-done setting and so much is about how
you're playing. Of course match-ups help and all those things come into play.  
  
That's the goal to, have a great regular season and be fortunate enough to
qualify for the NCAA Tournament and then take it as far as you can. I think
it's number of factors and we've had chances.  
  
Again, here we sit, so we get another opportunity to start this year to run to
this starting line, not the finish line. But some really good teams we've
played and again, the beauty of the tournament.

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas - 81, West Virginia - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the champions of the Big 12 conference,
the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Self. Student-athletes are Devonte' Graham and
Malik Newman. Coach, congratulations on your victory today and the
championship.  
  
BILL SELF: Well, thank you. It was obviously a fabulous college basketball
game. Both teams were really good offensively against two good defensive teams
today. They got control of the game in the first half and we made a run, and
they got control of it in the second half and we made a run. That was the
difference. When they had a chance to probably distance themselves we made a
lot of great plays to get right back in it and we played about flawless for
the most part down the stretch.  
  
Really proud of our team. It's been kind of an up and down week for us,
obviously for a couple of reasons. But I thought the guys competed as well as
they've competed all year long and played with as much freedom as they have
all year long, too.  
  
Q. Devonte', was that the best half of basketball you played this
season?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Maybe. Once they went on a run in the the second half Coach
called a timeout and we got locked back in and started making plays and just
competing. It was just fun. Fun to be out there.  
  
Q. Jevon Carter had said it's difficult for them to -- or it was
difficult for them to press you like they did in the second half when you were
making shots like you did. When did you sense that you were going to be able
to handle whatever pressure they threw at you and you were in the zone?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: I don't know exactly when, but we knew if we handled the
press we would get some easy buckets and Konate did a good job of coming over
and blocking shots. But we like to run. We like to shoot threes. Just ball
movement, attacking the paint, trying to get in and make plays for others and
thankfully we were able to make shots tonight.  
  
MALIK NEWMAN: Coach always said when a team is pressuring us, go fast break.
We just tried to play fast, and like Devonte' said, we were able to make
shots. So they had to fall back and they couldn't press us as much and we had
to run our offense and it worked.  
  
Q. Guys, typically that press they have wears other teams down. This is
the third time this year that you guys have worn them down. What's that say
about your conditioning and overall also what's it say about what you guys
have got going on that you're able to do that?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: I think for the most part we're pretty good conditioning. We
play four guards and the weave thing that we do, we run that a lot and it's
actually a lot of running and gets us tired in practice. So when we come to
games we're not that tired. But playing back-to-back-to-back games, I knew
their press wouldn't be as good as it was on the first day. So as long as we
were breaking it and getting through traps I knew we had a good chance of
wearing them down.  
  
MALIK NEWMAN: Basically Devonte' summed it up, but I'm just thankful for our
training staff. They did a great job of recovering, making sure that I had my
legs all the time. So I mean, credit to Coach Self for the offense that we run
to help us get in shape, but also credit to the training staff.  
  
Q. Devonte', could you comment on Silvio's ascendency and his
improvement and what it means for your team to have him giving you quality
minutes like that?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: It's huge. We knew we wouldn't have Udoka and Mitch and him
would have to step up and he's coming into it and finding a rhythm and finding
it at the right time. Everybody is happy for him, because he's been
struggling. It's hard to come in in the middle of the season straight out of
high school and get all this stuff thrown at you, all the plays, how fast we
play. It's not like high school. So he did a great job of just sticking with
it, coming into practice every day, learning the plays and it's finally paying
off.  
  
Q. Devonte', I don't think I've every seen anybody remove an item of
clothing during a play and then continue to score. I wonder, like, was that
thing just annoying you? What was happening there?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: No, actually he pulled it off, he was pulling my arm and it
came down. So it was just like, my sleeve was right here. So I just threw it
off and just kept playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, guys. Congratulations again on the victory. Good
luck next week. Questions for Coach Self now?  
  
Q. Bill, not necessarily about the game, but the league is set to get a
bunch of teams in the tournament, whether it's 7, 8 or 9. How important is it
for the league to do well in the tournament? Do you think that's been a point
that people have made that knocked the league down in the past, good regular
season RPI, not as much in the tournament?  
BILL SELF: I think it is important. I think our league has played out this
year to probably be as tough as it's ever been and three of the last four
years I think we were number one, thought of, in the RPI and usually that
should translate to more success in the postseason.  
  
So I think it is important. I don't think our league is top heavy. I think our
league is really middle heavy. I mean, there's no poor teams and whenever you
went to your conference tournament with nine teams out of ten, 90% of the
teams all can make a legitimate case for being an at-large team, I think that
speaks volumes to the depth of it.  
  
But even with that being said, we gotta go play and play well because the
teams in our league are really good. But we're like all the other teams.
There's not as many dominant teams across America, so once you get into the
tournament they're going to be coin-flip games. We need to close those games
out.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the importance or the advantage of having
a team on the uptick at this point in the year?  
BILL SELF: Well, you know, I'm not sure that we've been on a serious uptick
until today. We were bad last Saturday. We were better on Thursday. We were
bad yesterday and then of course today we were terrific. That's as well as we
played maybe all year long. So I think it should give us confidence moving
forward. The best thing that can happen for our team right now is to get some
rest, but to try to somewhat bottle the energy and how well we played together
today. You're not always going to make shots like that and then to get Udoka
back healthy. With Silvio's emergence and you can't bank on 16 and 10 every
day, but he and Udoka and Mitch that's a totally different look than what we
had three weeks ago from a depth standpoint. Hopefully that will be the case
that we can have all three of those guys.  
  
Q. Bill, I know you told us a couple nights ago you weren't going to
sleep very well with some of the things that were going on. After the way
Silvio played how much easier are you going to rest tonight?  
BILL SELF: Yeah, well, we'll rest. We may enjoy it a little bit before we
rest. We needed something like this. But you can have a good performance and
not win. You can still get good things from a game if you compete hard and
certainly if this game had not gone our way I would have been really proud of
our team because we were a better team today than we have been here of late.
But, yeah, we'll rest better and I'm happy for all our guys, without question.  
  
I think this definitely validates what happened during the regular season.
Nobody can say that Kansas caught a break or was lucky this year. We were able
to validate winning by two games by winning this, but tomorrow at noon it
doesn't matter anymore. We will regroup and hopefully have fresh minds and
fresh legs going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, playing alongside the Big 12 Player of the Year, Malik comes
out and wins Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. Can you comment on his
performance and what that means to this team?  
BILL SELF: He was great. It should give him a ton of confidence. He really
labored in Stillwater and has had good plays for us this year, but hasn't had
a breakout moment like this. So I'm really happy for him. He has had a great
attitude. He works hard. He's really starting to understand exactly how he
needs to play in order for him to have total confidence and freedom, and I
think he's buying into that better than he has all year long.  
  
It's amazing to me when you care about the right things and you defend, and,
you know, try to do things the way that you're supposed to do it to help your
teammates you shoot the ball better. I think that was certainly the cause for
all his success this weekend. He was great.  
  
Q. As much as any coach I've heard you always separate whether you made
shots or missed shots from we played well or didn't. You said this is as good
as you played all year. You obviously made a ton of shots. What besides the
shots makes you feel that?  
BILL SELF: We went against pressure for forty minutes and turned it over three
times in the second half when it counted the most. We're not going to be a
great rebounding team, folks. But I thought we competed on the glass harder. I
thought if you look at the box score we played seven guys and all seven
contributed in a very positive way. I thought we played right even when we
missed shots.  
  
So to me that's what I think playing well is. You can miss the same shots we
made today. That doesn't mean you played bad. That means you didn't make plays
or make shots. So I can look at this game, I think, before I watch it, but
especially after I watch it I guarantee I will be able to say even if we
hadn't made shots we still would have played right and we don't always do
that.  
  
Q. There's been some sentiment in here by a few coaches that they will
be happy to get out of the league because it's been so tough this year. Do you
feel that truer than ever at this time?  
BILL SELF: I do feel it's time for everybody to go play somebody else. You
know, now, we run quite a few sets. The sets don't work. Everybody knows your
stuff. We don't run as much now that Udoka is out because half our stuff was
trying to get him the ball. But playing against somebody where they're be not
as comfortable with you, maybe can allow you sometimes to look better. But on
the flip-side, they can look better, too. I do think playing against the same
grind night-in and night-out, it's going to be a grind in the NCAA tournament.
But we're tired of each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Good luck next week.

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Daxter Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34950)

### [Jevon Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30568)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas - 81, West Virginia - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined now by the Mountaineers of West Virginia,
Coach Bob Huggins, and student-athletes are Jevon Carter and Daxter Miles.  
  
Q. Dax, how did you see things just kind of get in the way for you over
the last six minutes of the game, when they went on their run? What happened
with Kansas making their run at the end of the game? How did you see them
doing it and what did you guys not do?  
DAXTER MILES: They made shots.  
  
Q. For either one of you, can you talk about Kansas without Azubuike.
What was the approach to attacking them without as Azubuike today?  
JEVON CARTER: Same as it always is. They just did a real good job of knocking
down shots. Every shot they put up went in and when we went cold they kept
hitting and that's when they went out and got the lead.  
  
Q. For either of you, looked like y'all pressed a lot in the second
half. How effective do you feel like your pressure defense was?  
JEVON CARTER: Um, it was okay. We've done better. It's just hard to press a
team when they're making shots. Like no matter what we did on defense they
made tough shots.  
  
Q. Jevon, you've been in this environment. You know what it's like
playing in a title game in front of a partisan crowd. Did you need to clue
your younger guys in on how they would have to deal with this environment
today?  
JEVON CARTER: Yeah, it was the championship. We had to come to play. I feel
like we did a good job. When it came down to it we didn't make shots and they
did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Congratulations on a great season and good
luck next week. Thank you for coming. Questions for Coach Huggins?  
  
Q. Bob, the league is set to get a bunch of teams, whatever it is into
the tournament. How important do you think NCAA tournament success is to the
reputation of the league and how important will it be to the Big 12?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think in that that's all that you hear about, see, read,
whatever, for a month. It's pretty important.  
  
Q. There has been a reputation by some that the league over the years
has underperformed a little bit. Do you have a response to that? Do you agree
with that?  
BOB HUGGINS: I've never heard that, so I don't think it has. I haven't really
looked at it that close to be honest with you.  
  
Q. What Jevon said, they made shots. You guys didn't. It's pretty simple
analysis. Is that the way you see it? I guess that's what most games come down
to, right?  
BOB HUGGINS: They shot 72% the second half. They shot 56 for the game. They
shot 56 from 3. They're going to beat everybody when they do that. They were
contested shots. We didn't give them wide-open shots. They were contested.
They made 'em.  
  
I think probably J.C. and Dax got a little bit tired, because of the way we
play and the fact that they've played a lot of minutes in the first two games.
It just didn't seem like they had legs at the end, but that's, you know,
that's to be expected, I think.  
  
We just couldn't get -- they did a good job with the rescreen on the ball
screen and you have to help a little bit whenever a guy gets loose, and we
tried to help a little bit and still get back, which I thought we did a pretty
good job of recovering. The last three or four shots they made from the corner
were contested shots.  
  
Q. Bob, you had them on the ropes at some point in the last three or
four games at some point in those games. What is it about them that allows
them to come back and what is it about you guys that you haven't been able to
finish the deal?  
BOB HUGGINS: It's nothing about us. They've got a lot of guys that can make
shots. I mean, let's be honest, all those guys out there--if they weren't
McDonald's All-Americans it's because they're from another country, you know?
So they've got good players. They've got good players and the guy can coach.
He's a Hall of Fame coach. We've got great kids who just play their tails off
that aren't as skilled, quite frankly. But we're able to compete because of
their character and because of how hard they play and because of the fact that
they're good people.  
  
Q. De Sousa, 8 for 8, 10 rebounds. How big of an impact did he have on
the game?  
BOB HUGGINS: They made shots, Wendell, so you're gonna get spread. When you
make shots like that you're gonna get spread and we got spread and then all of
the sudden now you're chasing them. Then with we tried to double the ball
screen then you double the ball screen you've got two guys chasing and if
y'all haven't figured it out, Devonte' Graham is pretty good!  
  
If we ran in and helped they kicked it to the corner and made threes, and if
we didn't run in and help they threw it to him. We made some mistakes early on
with them. They got some baskets early on. We didn't do a very good job of
doing what we were supposed to do. But that's basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, moving forward and moving out of this league schedule and
taking on teams that are more unfamiliar, and this team likes to compete. How
do you feel about this team as it moves forward?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we've beaten the No. 1 seed earlier in the year. We've had,
what did we have, 11 wins or something like that in the hardest league in the
country. I think we'll be okay. We've just got to, you know, you can't miss
shots. We just missed shots. We missed a couple of lay-ins. We can't do that.
We're not good enough to overcome that. We don't surround the line with all
those guys that can make shots. We've got guys that quite frankly when they
make one we all stand up and cheer because we're shocked as hell.  
  
Like I said, we're able to compete because they compete their butts off. They
played hard. We have to play a different style to be able to compete, which is
very taxing.  
  
But if we went back and played half-court with them, we would get beat by 20.
And we've had chances, you know? And you guys know the history, man. I don't
have -- I can't go into that and I don't need to go into that. It's not like
we haven't had chances. We've had chances.  
  
Q. Keeping with the theme of looking ahead, is it fair to say this looks
like a year, feels like a year where we could have some surprises in the
tournament, some unexpected teams advancing to the Final Four?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think Bill would say this: They have to make shots, but
the majority of the time they do. When they struggle they don't make shots.
You know?  
  
They're very dependent on spreading you and making shots. So, yeah, I mean, if
they miss shots, yeah, they could get beat. I tell our guys all the time, you
know, if you're going to advance to the NCAA tournament you've got to make
open shots. You can't miss open shots, because you don't get very many.
Everybody is playing hard. Everybody knows you're one loss and you're out, so
you gotta make open shots. We had open shots, didn't make 'em. They had
contested shots and made 'em. They're going to win. If they can do that for
three weeks, they could win a National Championship. But if they have one game
where those don't go in, it's going to be a struggle, just like it is for
everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas - 83, Kansas State - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined now by Kansas State, Coach Bruce Weber and two
student-athletes, Makol Mawien and Xavier Sneed. Coach, we will look to you
first for opening statement on tonight's game.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously, you don't have your first team All-Conference guy. You
knew it was going to be tough but we talked about this is an opportunity.
We've been through it before. Kam went down. The guys came together. Cartier
stepped up. Other guys stepped up, and we had a great season. Now Dean is out.
We felt it was best for him. He wanted to play. We felt it was best for him
not to play and hope we have him healthy next week.  
  
You can't plan for Barry going down on the first play. And he got poked in the
eye and had very little vision. He wanted to play. He kept saying, I'm good
and I held up how many fingers and he didn't know. So there was no way we
could put him in. But I thought obviously these guys stepped up. We knew we
could go to Mak without their big guy. He rose up and played well. Xavier did
some really good things, 5 assists, got it into Mak, 12 points, went to the
hoop, made some plays, I thought other guys, Amaad Wainwright stepped up, Mike
McGuirl got an opportunity, took advantage of it. We pushed them, got it to 2.
Xavier got the rebound and the shuffle and casual and they get the steal and
go to 4 and then we have a couple of bad possessions. I thought the one was a
travel when they got the three, and that pushed it back to double digits
pretty quick and now you're chasing them.  
  
But they didn't quit the whole time. I'm proud of them. We have a great group.
They've been great since the beginning. They've had some adversity, and, you
know, they've had courage all the way through. So you appreciate that and
obviously we came here to win to try to get to the finals. We gave it a go. We
it didn't have enough and they made some plays. Newman is playing at a high
level. I thought we played pretty good D in stretches and then we would have
mental mistakes at times and some switches and some reads and they got some
easy ones out of it.  
  
Q. Can you guys describe how hard it was to see Barry go down and have
that physical reaction and how you try to move past that and get back in the
game?  
XAVIER SNEED: It was definitely hard seeing one of your brothers go down, but
like Coach said, we all knew we had to rally back together and help him try to
get the win.  
  
MAKOL MAWIEN: Piggyback on what X said, it's tough when one of your main
contributors goes down with injury and we had to step up and just step up and
play hard.  
  
Q. For both players, in what ways do you feel like yesterday's game and
tonight helped prepare you for the national tournament? What do you feel like
you can take from your performance here?  
XAVIER SNEED: Definitely tonight without being with two of our All-Conference
players, just showing that everybody else on the team, we got a lot of good
rotations and got a lot of fight in those guys and hope we can do some damage
in the tournament.  
  
MAKOL MAWIEN: Definitely. I think just the competition, experience, really.  
  
Q. Xavier, can you talk about Mak's game tonight? Is that something
you've seen from him in practice? He's had some big games, but 29 from the
floor. How well did he play?  
XAVIER SNEED: Definitely seen it in practice before, knowing Udoka was out
before, attacking on the inside was a big thing for us, and Mak showed up
today and big kudos to him and he's made some big plays that he has been doing
all year for us and he just showed up today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, thank you for coming and good luck next week.
Questions for Coach Weber?  
  
Q. Not exactly how you wanted to find out what else you had but what are
your thoughts on the contributions from Mike McGuirl? Kam has probably had the
most minutes since he's been back?  
BRUCE WEBER: We had to scramble as a staff last night trying to decide if Dean
doesn't play what do you. Then you had different people in there. Everything
we have run all year has been through Dean. I was panicked with the coaches.
We take Dean out for one minute and what do we do. So we kinda came up with
five, six, seven different schemes, you know, if he wouldn't go and then at
shootaround when it didn't look like Dean would go, we worked them today. We
had a long shootaround. It was probably too long, just trying to prepare
quickly and we had to do it not only defensively for their stuff, but trying
to figure out what to score. We ran some of the same stuff we ran for Dean
with post-ups and Xavier is a good post feeder. Mak is, you know, he's had a
great tournament. He's played well. I've told him all along, you know, his
time is to come. I knew he could score and obviously it's a help, you know. I
think you had one injury with Kam and Cartier had the opportunity and he
stepped up and now you have another injuries other guys stepped up.  
  
Mike McGuirl, I said all along he was the surprise of our summer. He had some
injuries himself. I really feel bad for him because he made the decision to
come out of redshirt. But, you know, hasn't got the minutes that I would like
him to get and I know he wants. But every time he's gone in there he plays
hard for us, 4 points, no turnovers, did some nice things. Kam is still trying
to figure it out and 1 for 9 is not going to get it, but I think this is good
for him to get extra minutes. I thought Amaad was good, gave us good, quality
minutes. All the guys than we want in there gave us something. So as you learn
a little bit more about your team and a little more confidence if you have
foul trouble or whatever comes down the road.  
  
Q. Bruce, when Barry went down he went down in such a way it wasn't
like, oh, he's going to be out. It looked like something devastating. How hard
is it for players and keeping them composed and the challenge to you, you made
all the adjustments without Dean coming and a minute 17 in that's thrown
out.  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously, it's hard and I went down there. I was grossed out
what I saw on Barry when I saw what happened. I thought he got poked, but you
get close to him and it was a little scary. Hopefully he's okay. You can't
plan for that, you know, and knowing this game means so much to Barry. His
family flew in today. He said, "Coach, I'm glad we won because my family was
coming in today." And then they don't even get to see him play. You gotta give
our guys credit, you keep battling, make adjustments. We got the ball to Mak.
We thought Udoka Azubuike could score inside and we did and a few mental
mistakes after we pushed it to 2. We could never get over the hump.  
  
Again, we got a great group. I'm proud of them. I thought we defended well at
times, but once in a while some mistakes and some of that is you got guys in
different spots that haven't guarded some of the actions and that and they
made mistakes. Obviously, Kansas is good, No. 1 seed. We just played TCU and
they're a six seed, 20th RPI, played them to the wire in an overtime game. Now
you play Kansas, No. 1 seed.  
  
So it was a great opportunity for our guys to learn and keep growing as a team
and hopefully, you know, we got some good things left to get everyone healthy
and play at a high level next week.  
  
Q. Bruce, as of right now do you expect to have Barry and Dean for the
tournament?  
BRUCE WEBER: I would say yes right now. Again, they have an ophthalmologist
looked at Barry quickly. They're doing some tests on him. His eye was damaged,
hopefully not too severe that he can't come back. Dean, you know, again, we
just thought, he wanted to play, we could have played him. But, man, you know,
it goes sour and now we don't have him next week and we didn't feel it was
worth the chance to do that.  
  
So just hope and pray for the best. That's all we can do with both those guys.
I hope we get 'em both back, but we showed without 'em we're still a pretty
good ball club.  
  
Q. Kind of keeping in the national tournament vein, Bruce, yesterday you
talked about how you felt like the win over TCU basically secured you a spot
in the national tournament. What influence do you feel like the team's
performance yesterday and then tonight will have in terms of regional seeding
if any?  
BRUCE WEBER: I hope we're in. We finished fourth in the best conference. We
finished in the Final Four of the tournament. You swept quite a few teams,
and, again, we gotta see. I hope it is. We came back tonight and I just looked
at my phone briefly I had 40, 50 texts, people saying unbelievable effort by
your kids and with all the situations you still competed with one of the best
teams in the country. I think we had a good showing. We've had, you know, a
good league showing, some good wins and I think we have a good team. We've
worked hard. I told them after this is what you work for, to get this
opportunity and hopefully we get that opportunity and make a go of it next
week.  
  
Q. All the road guys Missouri has played with, maximum effort today,
next-man-up mentality. Can that be continued when the two main guys come back,
you think?  
BRUCE WEBER: I hope it gives those guys a little more confidence. Obviously,
we've talked about it. I think I mentioned to you guys a couple times we've
put some plays in for Mak because he's gained confidence and he's scoring,
even facing up, doing stuff out on the court, you know. I hope Kam can be a
little more solid for us. Mike McGuirl, I'm not afraid. He guards. He's got
some bounce. Amaad got confidence tonight. Got to be in his hometown, play
well. I think it all helps. You get a gut check game, get a foul trouble,
something like that. These guys have been through it, a very tough tournament,
a very tough league and hopefully it prepared them for what's coming up next
week.  
  
Q. You lose by 16, but you mentioned the pride you had and the effort.
What was the message to your team as you went into the locker room after this
one?  
BRUCE WEBER: I'm proud of the effort. They didn't quit. We cut it to 2, made
it a game. Very easily could have laid down. It's one thing with Dean and
another thing with Barry, but even Coach Korn mentioned it, there are no moral
victories. We came here to win. We did compete and that was my big message
today. They were hanging their heads. When we said Dean is not going to play
after shootaround they were hanging their heads. They had chapel, and even the
guy that does our chapel mentioned, man, their spirit is down. I grabbed them.
I never talked to them at pregame. I grabbed them and I said we've been
through this before. You've stepped up, and they stepped up. Never could have
anticipated that you wouldn't have Barry for what did he play, 1 minute,
maybe?  
  
You know, again, we came here to win the whole thing so you're disappointed.
But you also have to move forward and hopefully be ready for next week.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Malik Newman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34885)

### [Devonte' Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29906)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas - 83, Kansas State - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Self, and
he brought two student-athletes, Devonte' Graham and Malik Newman. Coach, we
will call on you first for your thoughts.  
  
BILL SELF: Well, I thought that it was unfortunate for K-State and certainly
with Barry to go down and Dean not being able to play, so we would not want
that at any time. With that being said, I thought K-State played hard. I
thought they played smarter than us. Certainly their big kid, Mawien, was the
best player in the game, without question. We were fortunate enough to make
plays to get the W and we will look forward to getting a good night's rest and
playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Devonte', you guys opened the Big 12 with the loss of Udoka and now
here you are two wins in and headed to the championship. What's been the key
for you guys during this two-game stretch?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Just playing confident. We know we don't got the inside
presence. We've been talking about driving the ball, trying to get to the
lane, trying to play faster, and just trying to execute.  
  
Q. For Devonte' and Malik, just going back to what you said about
playing with confidence, in what ways did you see evidence of that in the
second half when K-State made a 2-point game, 3-point game and you were able
to pull away again?  
MALIK NEWMAN: We know that basketball is a game of runs. Those guys, they did
a great job of going on a run but we was able to withstand the storm and we
just had confidence in one another that we were going to get stops, make
rebounds and make plays for each other.  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Like he said, it's a game of runs, and at this time of year
we have played each other three times. They know our plays, we know their
plays. So every time we called out a play they knew what was coming. So it was
about players making plays, so when they went on a run we knew we had to step
up and make shots.  
  
Q. For either of you, when you knew Dean was not going to play and Barry
caught a hand in the eye or something, did you feel like you relaxed a little
bit at that point and then maybe K-State was able to get back in the run the
second half?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: I think so, maybe a little bit. I felt like we came out. We
was good and when Barry went down. I feel like we took our foot off the gas a
little bit knowing that our best two players had got hurt, unfortunately, and
that's something we can't do. We need to be better than that and play hard no
matter who is in the game.  
  
MALIK NEWMAN: Basically what he said, we can't relax no matter who is on the
court and that's something we did. Devonte' was right.  
  
Q. Devonte', this time of year not only tomorrow but next week as well,
what can you take from some of the other Kansas point guards, whether it's
Frank, playing with him last year or some of the other guys you've talked to
about the key to taking your team deep into the tournament?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Just staying aggressive, leading, talking, doing all those
little things, you know, making sure guys' heads are right and focused. Not
thinking about nothing else but playing basketball and winning.  
  
Q. Just talk about 3-point shooting, you had 7 threes in the first half,
11 for the game. Obviously you were getting some spacing and Malik you were
getting a lot of open looks throughout the whole game. Spacing, how important
was that?  
MALIK NEWMAN: I mean, it's very important. Because we had four perimeter guys
that can go get a shot, or they can make a shot. It's important that we get
those guys the opportunity to drive and things like that and I think that's
what opened up the 3-point lane was just driving and being aggressive.  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Just like he said, we always talk about spacing and driving
and driving to pass, mainly. Once you drive, the defense has to react and
either help or you're going to get a wide-open layup. We spot up and just be
ready to shoot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congratulations. We will see you tomorrow night in the
championship game. Questions for Coach Self?  
  
Q. Bill, it seemed like they really tried to go at the rim a lot
offensively, pretty much the whole game. Do you assume that people are going
to challenge you guys until Udoka gets back?  
BILL SELF: I think they'll probably challenge us even when he gets back, but
certainly there was no resistance at all with Mitch and Silvio guarding
Mawien. I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly because he was by far the best
player in the game, and he whipped us. We usually don't trap the post. We
haven't had to with Udoka. We will trap anybody else on the post with the
5-man, but we usually haven't trapped with the 5-man. So that would be
something we hadn't practiced much. We did it the second half to try to get
him to thinking and we had a decent possession one time.  
  
But really disappointed in how the perimeter players allowed the easy entry
passes, but more so with our big guys. Just got caught dead behind and
absolutely gave no resistance, you know, to him, making basically uncontested
layups.  
  
Q. Bill, what quality to you like best about your team, and what keeps
you up nights?  
BILL SELF: I could tell you right now, if I sleep two hours tonight it will be
more than what I probably think I should after how we played tonight.  
  
But I do like the fact that the guys are somewhat resilient. Usually when bad
things happen they can find some way to have some great possessions or
whatever, just like last night we were down 10 to Okie State. Tonight they cut
it to two or three. They cut it to two and we made some plays after that.
There's a lot of things to like, but certainly when you're that small and, you
know, K-State was that small tonight, too. But when you're that small and you
have to play scrappier and smarter and tougher, it can be frustrating
sometimes because we play to our skill set rather than actually getting after
people.  
  
I think that's -- and you can say with Svi and Malik that's okay and maybe
Devonte', but Lagerald and Marcus have to be guys that are tenacious and we're
just not right now. We need to get better at that. That's what keeps me up.  
  
Q. When this K-State team is at full strength with Dean and Barry, where
do they rank with amongst the teams K-State has had with Coach Weber here?  
BILL SELF: I would say right at the best. I can't remember if they were his
teams or Frank's teams, was Jacob ever with Bruce? He wasn't? But they've had
some really nice teams that were really solid. All his teams are.  
  
But, you know, when we shared the league with them, I can't remember all the
personnel, but that was a team that didn't beat themselves at all. This team
has those same qualities. I think Dean Wade is terrific. I think he's a pro,
and Barry Brown, if he didn't make first team he had to be sixth or seventh in
the voting to make first team. So they have two players on their team that are
as good as any team that has two players in our league and I like their team
and they'll give anybody problems in the NCAA if they were just healthy.
Unfortunately they're not and it's unfortunate that we're not. But hopefully
we can have some miraculous recoveries in the next four or five days.  
  
Q. What Devonte' said at this point in time you're going to play
somebody for the third time tomorrow. The fact that they know your plays and
you guys know their plays. In a game like that is it what he said that it's
just kinda coming down to players making plays?  
BILL SELF: I think it always is. I think the second time you play a team in
conference play, I think it's more players than plays. In a conference
tournament like this when you get, you know, 30 minutes to prepare, I think
sometimes your stuff can work, especially if you haven't played 'em for a
while. We haven't played K-State since January 29th. So us going over their
stuff and them going over our stuff you can't do that in 30 minutes or an hour
max when you do a walk-through and know it well, because you practiced during
a season if you play Tuesday and then Saturday, at least Thursday and Friday
you're guarding their actions and stuff like that. So I think in the
postseason sometimes it can be a little bit of an advantage, but Devonte', if
he's the one who answered is right, it's time for players to make plays. When
you get in the NCAA tournament, maybe your plays work better, but in
conference play this late it's players making plays more than plays.  
  
Q. One of the guys who is doing commentary on another tournament said
whoever comes out of the late game is going to care about this a lot more than
Kansas because they've won their championship, they've got bigger fish to try.
Do you think your kids -- it's not that big of a deal tomorrow?  
BILL SELF: No, no! If you play you might as well win! That's how everybody
looks at it. I get a kick out of people saying that they'll go through the
motions or whatever. Now, I do think teams with edges have advantages over
teams that don't have an edge, so we have to create that edge going into
tomorrow. Just because you don't create that edge doesn't mean you care less.
It's because you didn't get yourself as mentally ready to play.  
  
I'm excited to see how our guys react to playing tomorrow because we won two
games with Udoka and I think it would mean an awful lot to our players to be
able to win three without Udoka. But we gotta play a lot better than we did
tonight and that's no disrespect to K-State and they were so shorthanded we
didn't take advantage of that opportunity like we should have.  
  
Q. Coach, you had it at 13 at halftime and all of the sudden K-State has
got it down to 2 or 4 in the second half. What's going through your mind and
what are you telling your guys?  
BILL SELF: I thought they played better than us, but I also thought a lot of
it was self-inflict because I didn't think our energy level was very good.
Obviously we couldn't guard the big kid, and offensively we didn't play very
smart. So when they've got it down to 2 or 4, and team falls are 7 to 1 that's
a coin flip game. But what we did do we got some stops. A big play was the
shot clock violation. It may not have seemed like a big play, but that was a
big play. And they got it -- whatever it got to, it went from, like, 4 to 11
like that and then we were able to keep them at a distance.  
  
So that's what I was talking about, even though we didn't play well, we played
well in the most important possessions to be able to keep 'em at distance.  
  
Q. Bill, you were talking about players making plays this time of year.
How does Devonte' compare to other lead guards you've had in the past? How is
he different? How is he the same? What kind of chance does he give you to make
a deep run in March?  
BILL SELF: I think Devonte' gives us a good chance, but he needs Malik and
Lagerald and Svi to help him. Devonte' is not like Frank that puts his head
down and drives it, although he's getting better at that. Devonte' is a pick
your poison kind of guy, if they back off he'll shoot it, he won't try to
drive it. But he's not the guy that we can say give him the ball and let him
go score. So he's one of the best leaders if not the best leader that we've
every had and good guards give you a chance to win this time of year and I
love him, I think he's a terrific player and he's had a terrific year. But
he's got to play smarter than what he has in the first two games and hopefully
we will see the real Devonte' tomorrow night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Daxter Miles, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33231)

### [Jevon Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30568)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 66, Texas Tech - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Mountaineers of West Virginia, Coach
Bob Huggins and his two student-athletes are Jevon Carter and Daxter Miles,
Junior.  
  
Q. Jevon, the match-up with Devonte' and you guys going up against each
other point guard to point guard?  
JEVON CARTER: It ain't about that. It is West Virginia versus Kansas tomorrow.
It is five guys on that court at one time. I hate when y'all try to make it a
one-on-one match-up. It's never about that. It's 5 guys out there on the floor
at a time. It's West Virginia against Kansas.  
  
Q. Since both of you are seniors, this is your third straight title
game. What does this mean it for each of you for this to be your last shot at
it?  
JEVON CARTER: It means a lot. We want to go out with a bang. It's our last
year. If we win tomorrow, we can hang a banner. It's everything we dreamed of.
We're going to give it our all tomorrow night and we're going to see what
happens.  
  
DAXTER MILES, JR.: It means everything at this point. Just gotta be ready to
play.  
  
Q. Jevon, having said what you did about it not being a one-on-one
match-up, you guys went five-on-five against them in Lawrence a few weeks ago
and had a disappointing result. Any motivation from that that carries into
tomorrow?  
JEVON CARTER: I guess you could say that. It's championship. That's all the
motivation we need. It's another game, another win we can get. That's all the
motivation we need. It's not about what happened in the past; it's about
tomorrow. We're going to do our best. We're going to come to fight and we're
going to see what happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Congratulations on your victory. Questions for
Coach Huggins?  
  
Q. You got another shot at Kansas. What can your team do differently to
get a different result?  
BOB HUGGINS: Score more points than them. I don't know. We have played pretty
well. They have played pretty well. It's been two pretty well-played games. I
don't know. Make another shot, maybe, get a free throw, something.  
  
Q. You guys didn't get as many steals as you usually do but were able to
get offense going in the second half. Does it seem like the team has been more
comfortable being able to get out of half-court and not relying as much on the
turnovers that you guys rely on?  
BOB HUGGINS: When you play three games in three days it's hard to play the way
we play three days like that, but it's also hard for them to play against it.
We just backed it off because we wanted to guard in the half-court and try to
make 'em run some clock. Not put them at the foul line.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Justin Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14408)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 66, Texas Tech - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Red Raiders of Texas Tech and
Coach Chris Beard and his student-athlete is Justin Gray. Coach, your thoughts
on tonight's game?  
  
CHRIS BEARD: I just want to congratulate West Virginia on a good, hard-fought
win. You know, we got a lot of respect for Coach Huggins and their staff. From
our standpoint, we felt like it was an ugly game. But West Virginia makes you
play ugly with their toughness and physicality and the way they throw the ball
inside. So give them the credit.  
  
It's a disappointing loss for us because it's a weird stat sheet. We make more
field goals, we outrebound them, we have a low turnover game against their
press on a one-day prep, but we don't win the game. So two things come to
mind, free throw line got us tonight. But that's basketball. Nobody shoots
more free throws in practice or individual workouts than we do. So you win
some, you loose some with that.  
  
But certainly disappear pointing. And then letting their best two guards,
Daxter Miles and Jevon Carter get loose for that many three shots. There has
to be some defensive mistakes there that we have to own. So, again,
congratulation West Virginia on a good game. I feel like in a lot of ways we
ran out of time. We really didn't get beat, so hopefully we will be on the
better end of this in the national tournament.  
  
Q. Justin, you guys feel like there's an opportunity to reset a bit here
after the way the season has wound down? Now you're going to stop playing
these teams from your conference at least for a couple games?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Yeah, definitely a reset, learn from our mistakes, watch film,
correct our mistakes, just become better. Obviously, it didn't end the way we
wanted it to, made a lot of mistakes throughout the game, but played good
enough to win, just didn't execute up with one or two things from the scouting
report.  
  
But in the tournament every team is legitimate and every team is wanting to
win the National Championship. So it's not like we're going to be like we're
going to look down on a team because they're not from the 12, but every team
has an opportunity to win and a chance to win on any given day. So we just got
to make sure we're locked in and get ready for whoever we face.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Justin, thank you for coming. Good luck next week in the NCAA
Tournament. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Chris, a lot of great guards in this league. You've got some. The
guard match-up tomorrow with Carter and Devonte' and when you have guys like
that what that means for this time of year?  
CHRIS BEARD: I think in a lot of ways college basketball is a guards game. If
you get a big they can play special and consistent you've got a really good
team. That's why a lot of teams in the Big 12 separate certainly. Tonight's
game I thought we played well enough to win, but you've got to give West
Virginia credit, Miles and Carter, they shoot like that they'll walk to the
Sweet 16. When you make those 3-point shots with Konate and those guys inside.
I think tomorrow's game will be another test to that, Graham versus Carter,
two of the best guards in college basketball.  
  
Q. With some of the injuries you had this year, how do you think the
selection committee will view your resume?  
CHRIS BEARD: I don't know. I try to control what I control. I know this: One
year ago we were at this tournament and our season was over. Tonight it's not.
We've earned the right to play in the NCAA tournament. I think we've earned
the right to have a good seed. We play in the toughest conference in the
country and we've really competed with a couple games left we were in the race
for the regular season championship and tonight we're in the semifinals of the
tournament. So I think our team speaks for itself, but I'm not in that room
making those decisions.  
  
Q. I meant in terms of seeding, not if you're getting in or not, but in
terms of seeding with the some of the injuries you've had?  
CHRIS BEARD: When you finish second place in the Big 12, you're good enough to
win a National Championship.  
  
Q. Coach, you know this isn't the outcome you wanted, but what did you
see from Zhaire and Culver that they went out and played against some of the
toughest competition and did really well?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, basically they have played so many minutes this year.
They're not freshmen anymore. They're two experienced players with a lot of
basketball under them. I've been really impressed with the way they haven't
hit a wall. A lot of great freshmen around the country. You play at this kind
of level and these kinds of minutes, but these two guys have persevered. You
gotta give our strength coach John Reilly a lot of that credit, our coaching
staff, those two guys, their high school coaches. These guys came in to play
college basketball, but I've been impressed with those guys all year long
mostly because of the consistency and they really haven't hit a wall. They're
so excited to be playing in March. It's like the first day of practice are for
those young guys.  
  
Q. Coach, tough loss, but I guess the two shots that you got with Keenan
obviously getting the shot at the end and then often Niem Stevenson with the
half-court shot I know it was more difficult. But are those the two things
that you were looking at what you were talking about things that could have
happened?  
CHRIS BEARD: That's what keeps coaches up at night. Do you call timeout? Do
you not? Things like that. But what I've always believed in my career it's a
players' game and if we've got good players on the court I'm going to let them
decide the game. You worry about calling a timeout against a Coach Huggins
team? Can you get the ball back in? Will he put different players in? We've
won a lot of games letting the players make the plays.  
  
But certainly those are the things that will keep me up tonight. We were
trying to call a timeout. It fell out of bounds. I don't know if they didn't
hear it or what, but that's just basketball.  
  
Q. Injuries kind of knocked you guys off your stride a little bit. Do
you feel like you're back on track at the right time of year?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, we're as healthy as we can be. You know, you take the hand
that's dealt to you. No excuses or no complaints. It's so great to have Zach
Smith out there after all the adversity. Keenan is trying as hard as he
possibly can and we look forward to some days rest here. And hopefully we will
be as strong as we possibly can in the first round of the tournament. It's a
good question. I respect it. I think we're really going to benefit from a few
days rest here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck next week.

### [Xavier Sneed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34871)

### [Barry Brown Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34873)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State - 66, TCU - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Kansas State Wildcats, Coach Bruce
Weber and three student-athletes, Barry Brown, Makol Mawien and Xavier Sneed.
Coach, congratulations on your victory today.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you. Really proud of our guys, happy for them. From the
beginning I told them before the game since practice when we got back and got
going in the spring through the summer and through the fall, they worked their
tails off. They've had great leadership, you know. They've done everything
we've asked. They're very, very coachable. Probably raised my voice, you know,
other than yelling play hard and all that stuff, you know. But getting after
'em a couple times all year. They're a great group. We got down 7. We didn't
have much emotion. Cartier made a couple of good plays for us, got energy
going. Kam went in and made a play and Mak was very good, a lot of big plays.  
  
Obviously we probably should have fouled on the three at the end. We had 'em
in the -- but it's in that chaotic state where you're running back, and, you
know, they made a great play. You gotta give them credit, but we came back.
Very rarely when teams make a big shot like that do you come back with the
emotional and energy that we had in the overtime period that we found to win.
Barry obviously made the big play at the end. We gave him the ball and he had
a chance to make the play and he came up big for us and made the basket.  
  
Excited! Hopefully solidifies our chance to be in the NCAA tournament. Now
they gotta want more, get to the finals and see what happens. But you've got
to come back and win tomorrow night, obviously.  
  
Q. Barry, could you just take us through the big play that Coach talked
about where you drove for the game-winning layup?  
BARRY BROWN Jr.: He drew up a screen with Mak and we knew that the possession
before, I think, in regulation they switched with Brodziansky and we were
hoping maybe they would switch again a little bit. But they didn't. They did a
regular ball defense and I hesitated and tried to attack the basket because in
regulation I settled for a jump shot. So I wanted to attack the basket, and I
was able to get fouled and knock the shot down.  
  
Q. For all of you, when that basket goes in and they rule it's good. How
tough was it to get -- that's like a punch to the gut. What was your attitude
and how did you get going again to take control in the overtime?  
BARRY BROWN Jr.: It was tough for us, but nothing we have never been through
before. We play overtime all the time in practice and it was something we were
ready for.  
  
We knew that they were going to come with their best and I think they came out
with a score right in the first possession or a foul or something, but we
rallied through, weathered the storm and had some key stops down the stretch
and made some big baskets.  
  
MAKOL MAWIEN: Yeah, it was a tough shot and played through it. I just thought
I would keep my energy up and motivate the team and keep energy up and try to
be vocal a little bit. I knew as long as they energized us that would be a
good position to win overtime.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: Piggybacking what Barry said, we go through situations every day
in practice and I felt like Coach put us in a great position to be ready for
that moment when it came.  
  
Q. Barry, you and Dean have got a lot of attention this season for your
all big performances, but Mak and X had big games today. Talk about how they
helped carry you guys to this win?  
BARRY BROWN Jr.: Last game I found out the stat when Mak is 10 or plus points
that we are untreated, so for him to have 16 points, almost a double-double,
16 points, 9 boards, 3 blocks. That's tough in anyone's book in any league,
and he was tough today and we need him throughout the rest of the season,
throughout March. Xavier had great defense, some great stops. Kenrich had some
tough shots, but for the most part X was in his bubble, getting rebounds,
stills, talking, assists. They were great today.  
  
Q. Barry, TCU is one of the higher scoring teams in the nation and you
guys have held them under 70 points every time you played. What is it about
your match-up that you guys defend them so well?  
BARRY BROWN Jr.: We have great team defense and some great individual
defenders. We all take on that challenge to stop when they do. They do a lot
of ball screen action and a lot of post-ups, and credit to our guys we fought
for over forty minutes to limit their opportunities to have some. They have
some wide-open shots and stuff, but for the most part we were there in the
bubble contesting. It paid off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, congratulations. Good luck tomorrow. Questions for
Coach Weber?  
  
Q. You either play a team that swept you or a team that you swept that
is really hot right now. Do you have any preference?  
BRUCE WEBER: We just have to watch and see. Obviously Kansas is down one
player, Oklahoma State swept them, so we have to see. We gotta come ready to
play. Either one, we've just gotta be ready. I think if we shoot for one team
now it's a little bit of a mental letdown. We just get ready. We've gotta be
ready. This is about us and gutting it out, being mentally tough and doing the
things we do.  
  
I should have talked about our defense, not only holding them in the 60s, but
it's overtime and held them in the 50s. Mak was important in that and Barry's
match-up with Alex Robinson and we emphasized Williams and Xavier, because his
improvement in the last three years has been amazing. So our defense has been
consistent. That's got to be the thing that's there if you're going to have a
chance to win tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about when Barry and Dean didn't have their best games
today, but you had several other players step up. Talk about that, how
important that is?  
BRUCE WEBER: When we've been our best -- we've had great balance, you get guys
in double figures, four of them, you share the baseball, assists. Both teams
are playing their hearts out and you're playing them a third time. Last year
our Baylor game was a hard-fought game. The West Virginia was a hard-fought
game. I don't know if people appreciate that double round robin and having
1-10 where anybody can beat anybody on a given night.  
  
So the balance is important, Mak, in fact, John Underwood from the Big 12 said
that 14 has come a long way. Mak has slowly and surely become more of an
offensive threat, he's rebounding. He is playing hard. He understands it. I
thought Cartier did a couple of good things. We were struggling. He got a
couple baskets for us when we needed it and Xavier had a big one in overtime
because they jump off you. You have a letdown. They make the first bucket.
Xavier makes a pull-up in the paint. So we had good balance, even the bench,
Levi gets 6 points, 3 rebounds, Mawdo goes in and gets a basket. Kam struggled
a little bit, but he's still trying to work his way back. But balance is
definitely a key for our team.  
  
Q. Bruce, for the rest of the day what's the plan? Will you guys go back
out there and watch the KU-Oklahoma State game?  
BRUCE WEBER: A lot of them have family here. They don't get their family. Our
guys are from such long distance, obviously, except Dean. So we told them they
have the 30 minutes media. Go out and see their family for 15 minutes. They
want to go back. They're hungry. The game is on TV. They can watch it there.
Their families can come and enjoy time with them and be around them. Then we
will go to dinner and start our planning at that time, the scouting. The
coaches obviously will scout and get the game plan together. We've got the
scouting reports from both the last times we've played them. It was a little
longer than obviously than TCU, but they've got to relax and enjoy the
opportunity, the special environment. Kansas City does a great job, great
venue, great crowd. Big 12 does a great job with the tournament.  
  
Q. Do you have a preference in terms of who you play? You guys except
Oklahoma State in the regular season and KU would give you a chance to move up
seedingwise?  
BRUCE WEBER: We've got to worry about ourselves and getting ready. Oklahoma
State has played us as well as anybody of late, to beat Kansas the way they
have done is amazing. Last night they played at a high level, and Kansas is,
you know, they're going to be a No. 1 seed. So they got us twice. Once we had
a shot at the end, the other one they kind of kicked our butt. But, you know,
we just gotta worry about ourselves, getting ready to play with some emotion
and energy.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you weren't in the tournament for sure until the last
minute and you said that helped you because at present kept everybody's mind
focused. First thing you said was if this doesn't get us in, I don't know what
will, are you afraid there will be a letdown, we got what we needed?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't think so. We came here to win the tournament and do
something no one has done in K-State history and they have that mindset. Do
something special. I would be surprised and disappointed if we didn't have a
great effort, make every shot, I don't know. But they will come and fight
tomorrow night I promise you that.  
  
Q. Coach, back to your defense, you guys don't play the dramatic
defense, obvious defense like West Virginia. It's much more subtle but so
effective. How do you describe your defensive style?  
BRUCE WEBER: I went recruiting yesterday afternoon and sat with one of our
former players Dee Brown from Illinois, and he said, Coach, it's nothing like
it used to be because Dee would press full court and we would trap and all
that stuff. But the game has changed. I said, Dee, how many people ball
screened at that time? And that's all TCU does. They go out and ball screen.
It's 5 on 4, and we had to change things. Even from the last time we played
TCU they got us on a bunch of back doors. We talked about being compact. I
think it's good, solid scouting reports. We got guys that care about defense
which is not always the case in this day and age. Barry from day one wanted to
be a defender. We've gotten Xavier to believe in it. Mak, I said he's one of
the best ball screen defenders in the country, and Dean has great read of
things. It's solid.  
  
Making them earn things. They did get a bunch in the paint especially in the
first half, I think 22 points. But we did a better job. We've tweaked. We've
changed. You have to. Coach Keady told me years ago, if you're not flexible in
this game you are not going to last long because you have to change as the
game changes. I have to fight Coach Lowery all the time because he wants to do
it the old way sometimes. But we have adjusted. We've done what we used to do
and a little bit of new stuff and got guys to believe into it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

### [Jacob Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34897)

### [Matt Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34898)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Texas Tech - 73, Texas - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Texas Longhorns, Coach Shaka Smart, his
two student-athletes are Matt Coleman and Jacob Young. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game?  
  
SHAKA SMART: We're extremely disappointed that we came up short. Texas Tech
deserves a lot of credit. They battled. They made some big shots throughout
the game. But certainly in the second half they made shots down the stretch
when they needed to. These two guys really, really fought and battled, I
thought when we had five gaze on the floor who played with aware your spirit,
I thought we played pretty well, but that was not for forty minutes and to
beat a team like Texas Tech, I say a 40-minute game, and you've got to have
five guys out there connected around one cause. So very, very disappointed.
But obviously we have more basketball left to play.  
  
Q. Jacob, are you now the secret weapon for Texas and what got into you
tonight? Career high?  
JACOB YOUNG: I don't see it like that. I see it as my teammates pushing me up
to be who I am and do what I do, and that's what they know me for is making
shots and being a fighter. That's basically it. I couldn't do it without my
teammates.  
  
Q. Jacob, with all due respect to what your teammates were doing, did
you feel like you were in a zone out there when all of the sudden you hit your
first six threes, things like that, what's the feeling like for you as a
shooter?  
JACOB YOUNG: Felt just like practice. I got in my zone and never got out of
it. I told myself I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and just keep trying
to fight for my teammates and everybody on the staff.  
  
Q. Matt, you guys got off to a poor start again shootingwise. How
demoralizing was that for the team and how much does that take out of you guys
trying to fight back all game long?  
MATT COLEMAN: As a point guard you have to stay level headed and continue to
support your teammates to take those shots because they're open, shooting with
confidence. I don't want them to stop shooting it, because I know they can
make it at a high level. The biggest thing is not getting frustrated, letting
that bother you on the other end of the floor, the defensive end. We did get
to a rough start, but as the game got on we got more comfortable and shots
started to fall in our favor.  
  
Q. Matt, as far as the future what do you feel like you guys took out of
this game? You were looking at a sense of urgency and maybe in a play-in game,
but do you feel like you got what you came for?  
MATT COLEMAN: At all, we left a lot on the table. Coming into Kansas City it
was a tournament we felt like we could win, so I feel like we came up short.
Our focus was Big 12 championship, this was my first year playing in it. It
was an unbelievable experience and a great opportunity and I looked at it as a
gift. But we did come up short and my main focus was winning because I felt
like as a team, as a group we could win this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, thank you. Questions for Coach Smart?  
  
Q. Shaka, how do you feel about your team? Do you feel comfortable where
you guys are going into Sunday?  
SHAKA SMART: We just lost a tight game, so we never feel great after a loss. I
think Texas Tech deserves a lot of credit, but there's a lot of things we will
look at when we watch that tape and we'll say, if we would have done this a
little better or this a little harder or been a little more connected in this
area, we would have won. After a game that's where your focus is.  
  
In terms of Sunday, we have had a really good year, a ton of ups and downs in
terms of adversity we've been hit with, I think our guys have responded with
great resolve, great togetherness, great fight. I think when you come out of
this league, obviously you go through the fire and we have and we've got a ton
of great experience and a ton of great wins. I think we put ourselves in good
position, as I've said all along when I get asked. I'm not on the committee,
but certainly the way that we've played over the last couple of weeks, you
know, we look like an NCAA tournament team.  
  
Q. Shaka, how do you think Mo played tonight and take us through the
process.  
SHAKA SMART: I thought Mo played well. It was back and forth whether he was
going to be able to play and then he went through a workout today, went pretty
well. So the athletic trainer told me he could play 10 minutes. So, you know,
it's tough as a coach because 10 minutes, it's a 40-minute game. He's a really
good player. So put him in. In the first half he had 7 points in 7 minutes, 4
rebounds. Played really well. The second half we put him in again. He was
helping our team. I thought he brought good spirit, but the athletic trainer
said maybe a couple more minutes but that's about it. So he ended up playing
14. I thought he played really well. Obviously the way he played we would have
loved to have had him for 29, 30 minutes. But the sports medicine department
at UT does a great job, and they decided the best thing for him right now is
to come in and play the minutes that he played. So hopefully he can grow from
that and be able to play more next time.  
  
Q. Shaka, Jacob told us it felt like practice for him out there. How
often have you seen that version of Jacob in practice that we saw on display
tonight?  
SHAKA SMART: He does that all the time in practice. That was the guy we
recruited a couple years ago. It's funny because when we lost last year up
here it was our last game, and a couple media members said, hey, is he a Big
12 player because he had struggled his freshman year and he was tonight!
Pretty damn good Big 12 player tonight. He has that in him. The challenge for
him is playing with poise and being calm and collected when things get
frantic, and I thought tonight he did that. He took a real step. He still has
a lot of growth to make, but really, you know, he's got a warrior spirit about
him. He's extremely competitive. I told the guys in the locker room. I said,
if our whole team had the competitive spirit that he had in that game we're in
here feeling really good about ourselves. Pleased with that. Effort from him
and hopefully something we can build on.  
  
Q. I think you had four starters with 10 points and you mentioned if
everybody else played with the same competitive spirit. The fact that you
didn't play that well but you were competitive, what did you take from that?
Do you feel like maybe Kerwin Roach kind of tired out a little bit?  
SHAKA SMART: I got to get to the bottom of why he wasn't himself, because he
wasn't. The reality for us is when we've played well, particularly since we
lost Andrew, we've gotten contributions from pretty much everyone that goes
out on the floor. They haven't played perfect but the formula for us in the
big wins we've had in the Big 12 has been we've had really everyone go in and
give us solid time. In some of our games everyone has gone in and played
really well. Without sounding like it's oversimplified that goes a long ways
toward your team playing well. Tonight J.Y. was terrific. I thought Matt was
really good. Mo gave us good minutes in the time that he could play. I thought
we had some other guys that struggled. Obviously those guys want to win. We've
got to help them have a clear mind for doing what goes into winning. Our two
juniors tonight, those are our oldest guys, we need to help them be better.
End of the day that's on me and them. That's what it is is figuring out a way
for those guys to be the best version of themselves because they weren't
tonight.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you're hoping that Mo could play 29, 30 minutes.
Do you have a sense that he might be able to get to that level next week or is
it wait and see?  
SHAKA SMART: I don't know. This toe saga has been very, very interesting and
you know, Mo wants to play. He was mad at me. Every time I took him out of the
game he was mad at me. I said, Mo, what if you play 25 minutes and then you
get hurt and then the trainer says to me you were supposed to play him 10
minutes. On the flip side, we're trying to win the game. So I would have loved
to have had him out there longer. We were in this position one time before
with another player and it's a tough spot. Literally during the game he's
negotiating to play more. The trainer is negotiating for him to play less.  
  
But, yeah, we're hopeful. He couldn't -- when we played last week he couldn't
come close to playing, so he's come a long way. Yesterday he wasn't quite
there. Today, obviously, he was well enough to score 10 points in 14 minutes.
So hopefully he can get some more rest over the next couple of days and
hopefully that thing is feeling better and we can get him out there for as
much time as he wants to play and we want him to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much. Good luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Sviatoslav
Mykhailiuk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27889)

### [Malik Newman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34885)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas - 82, Oklahoma State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Coach Self and the Kansas Jayhawks, his
two student-athletes with us are Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Malik Newman.
Coach, congratulations on your victory.  
  
BILL SELF: Thank you. It was hard fought and obviously getting behind 10 early
isn't what we had hoped for. We couldn't guard 'em early, but then when the
game settled in, Malik got on a role and basically carried us offensively the
first half and we played better defensively the second half and made some time
and plays.  
  
Q. Malik, how much do you think today's performance not just by
yourself, but by the team in general was fueled by, as Coach put it, the beat
down that you got by Oklahoma State the other day in Stillwater?  
MALIK NEWMAN: I mean, it had a lot to do with it. We wanted to come out and be
aggressive and play tough because the last two times we haven't played tough
against those guys, so we wanted to come out, execute the game plan and be
tough.  
  
Q. For both players, we spent in the media the first two-thirds of the
season talking about what this team couldn't do. What is this performance
tonight, missing your big horse inside, what does it say about what you guys
can do moving forward?  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: I would say we just showed that we can play without
Udoka, and we can win and he is a force for us whenever we want to and he can
score, but right now he can't play and it's a little bit different team. We
drove a lot more and we shot a little bit more threes and just a little bit
different to play. We play a little bit faster and I would say a little bit
more scrappy on defense, but it just changed us a little bit.  
  
MALIK NEWMAN: Just to piggyback on what Svi said, the big fella, he's a key
part to our team, but without him, like Svi said, we can play a little faster
and be a little scrappier and the guards, we are able to dictate the offense a
little bit more instead of trying to play through the big fella a lot more.  
  
Q. Malik, career high for you today. Just talk about your confidence
level coming into this game and then as the game unfolded. Did your confidence
grow?  
MALIK NEWMAN: Yeah, I had high confidence coming into the game. Coach has been
emphasizing that the goal is to win games in the postseason. I know I have to
be good as well as the other guards so I just wanted to come out, have a lot
of confidence in myself, be aggressive and once I saw my first couple shots go
in, my confidence did actually grow a little bit more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Svi and Malik, congratulations on your victory. Questions
for Coach Self?  
  
Q. Bill, knowing Oklahoma State rebounds like they can, like they did
last night, knowing that you're missing Udoka down low, how did you mitigate
that? They only outrebounded you guys 36-33. How do you mitigate that?  
BILL SELF: I don't think we rebounded the ball that well. I thought we did a
much better job of blocking out today even though they had a couple of -- like
Cameron McGriff got a nasty dunk to start and I think when he got hurt he
missed a dunk on a follow. But other than that we blocked out good until the
last six or seven minutes, and we don't go after the ball with two hands like
men do a lot of times. So we've got to improve there.  
  
But they're physical and they crash, you know, with four spots as well as
anybody we played all year. So we were better even though I won't be too giddy
about it, I think tables show we can definitely rebound better than what we
did.  
  
Q. You are up 1 at halftime, one guy's got 20. You've got a lot of guys
capable of doing that, did you just need somebody to do that today?  
BILL SELF: We've got guys capable, but we haven't -- other than Devonté we
haven't had anybody do that recently. Svi has shown he can do it. Malik has
had some good games, Lagerald hasn't scored the ball in the last couple of
months like he was early in the season. So even though we got four guys that
can get 20 or 25 any night we haven't shown that we've got four guys here of
late. Malik putting us on his back was huge.  
  
To be down 10 early when they just kicked us last week and they were making
everything it seems like and we're struggling. To have him put us on his back
and get us to halftime with a 1-point lead and in the second half we just kind
of pieced it together but that was big for us. Going forward without Udoka,
especially, we're going to have to have some perimeter player play great,
maybe two to play great to give us the best chance.  
  
Q. Bill, thoughts on what the selection committee should do with your
Alma Mater?  
BILL SELF: Well, I'm biased, because they played us better than anybody has
all year, twice, and I think they're without question a tournament team. I
look he at the things the pundits but up there, the blind resumes, whatever,
surely how you have played down the stretch and those sorts of things matter.
In our league if you go 6-4 down the stretch you've played well considering
all ten games are monster games. So I don't think there is any doubt Mike and
his team deserve to be in and I would be very disappointed if they're not.  
  
Q. It seemed like the first couple months of the season every time we
did a press conference it was about what this team didn't have, what they
couldn't do, what they needed to do. Have they shown us all something down the
stretch here the way they ran way in the league and played shorthanded
today?  
BILL SELF: Yeah, I think playing today, one, the sample size is too small with
just today, with Udoka, we're going to have to play well tomorrow without him
and if we're fortunate enough to win, Sunday, but for one day, yeah, we got 14
and 14 out of our other two bigs, which was a positive.  
  
This team is easy to nitpick with because when we're good it's magnified in
ways because we can shoot and move the ball. When we're bad it's magnified in
ways because we don't do the things in grind-it-out games that a lot of teams
do.  
  
So I think it's fair to say that this team leaves you wanting more sometimes,
but to your point, in this league to win the league by two games, they're
probably not saying that about Texas Tech and West Virginia. They're probably
saying that was a great year and sometimes I think we get spoiled on what our
expectations are.  
  
But I'm real proud of them. I think they've competed hard for the most part,
but the reason there is frustration is because I think the things we visibly
see are things that we can control that we be don't do better at and we've
still got to tighten up a lot of stuff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll let you go. Thank you.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Esa Ahmad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30821)

### [Daxter Miles, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33231)

### [Jevon Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30568)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 78, Baylor - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Mountaineers from West Virginia,
Coach Bob Huggins, three student-athletes, Jevon Carter, Daxter Miles, Jr.,
and Esa Ahmad. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Guys, the half-court shot, what kind of momentum did that give you
into the second half?  
JEVON CARTER: It gives us a little bit of momentum. They had a put-back dunk.
A dunk can change the game. I guess that 3-pointer just killed them right
there with it. That's a big momentum changer. It was big for us going into
halftime. We came out and played with the same energy from the first half.  
  
Q. Guys, what exactly does it do for you guys when Dax is hitting threes
like he did tonight?  
ESA AHMAD: It's big, you know. We got a lot of threats out there on the
perimeter, Jevon, Beetle and Dax, once he gets hot you've seen what he can do.
That was big for us.  
  
JEVON CARTER: Same thing he said, when Dax is hitting it makes the game much
easier for everybody else because he's an unbelievable scorer and when he get
hot there ain't no stopping him.  
  
DAXTER MILES, JR.: My teammates was finding me, and I was just trying to find
the gap.  
  
Q. Esa, I was wondering about what you thought your responsibility was
when Sags sat down, what you thought you needed to do to help the team.  
ESA AHMAD: Sags is a big presence in there. He rebounds the ball, and I wanted
to be aggressive on the glass and put a body on their big man. You know, just
trying to be a presence down there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, congratulations and look forward to seeing you
tomorrow. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering about the press and how effective that was and
what you thought the key to that was tonight?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, it's accumulative affect and we had one stretch where I
think we got the ball three times in a row and that's when we kind of were
able to open the game up a little bit and that's what we hope it does for us.
It's going to be interesting on Sunday with basically four teams from the Big
12 on the bubble. What do you make of the decision the committee has
differentiating between the team you just played and three other teams that
are going to be on the bubble as well?  
  
BOB HUGGINS: Why are they on the bubble? I don't understand why we would have
four on the bubble. We have been all year long, the best conference in the
country. When you play in this league and you play everybody twice it's not
like -- we're not one of those leagues where they play the best team like once
every three years, you know?  
  
We play everybody twice. Familiarity, this league has great coaching, not
good, but great coaching and we've got really good players. So I don't
understand that. You put any of those other people in here that are so-called
"bubble teams" and see what they do playing 18 games in this league.  
  
Q. Looks like Esa has hit a groove the last four or five games. What
does it do for you guys differently when he's scoring and rebounding like he's
been over the last two or three weeks?  
BOB HUGGINS: Gives us another threat and he's a guy who can -- he can score
inside and outside, and we really need him to rebound. Baylor outrebounded us
the first two games even though we were fortunate enough to win, but they
outrebounded us and that was a big emphasis this week was to make sure that we
rebounded the ball and it was a big emphasis to Esa. But he was better in the
press. He gets three steals. I thought he played really, really well. And he
was the guy who I think when we struggled a little bit against the zone to
start with he was the guy who we were really trying to throw the ball to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Manu Lecomte](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33229)

### [Terry Maston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33169)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 78, Baylor - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Coach Scott Drew and the Baylor Bears
to the interview room. The two student-athletes are Manu Lecomte and Terry
Maston. Coach, we will look to you for an opening comment.  
  
SCOTT DREW: I thought West Virginia did a great job. They caused us 22
turnovers, and I thought Jevon's three at the end of the half took away the
momentum from Tristan's dunk, and now it gets to 6 points and Miles hit some
big threes today, 5 from 6 for threes and they were deep and late in the shot
clock. When you get down double digits against West Virginia it's hard to come
back.  
  
There are certain teams we match-up better with. West Virginia is one of them
that we're not -- we're glad if we never have to play them again this year.  
  
Q. Guys, I wonder if you could describe the cumulative affect of facing
that press for forty minutes? I know they turned you over 22 times, which was
a season worst, but just describe what it's like to have to go against that
for forty minutes.  
MANU LECOMTE: It's a great press. It's a great team. They turned us over 22
times. The coaches put up a great game plan and I know we've made a lot of
mistakes, but I'm proud of my guys that we fought until the end.  
  
TERRY MASTON: I think fatigue and frustration sets in especially when you
start to turn it over a lot. But like Manu said, I'm glad we kept battling to
the end and we just have to take care of the ball next time and just work a
little harder in practice. That's about it.  
  
Q. Manu, you guys cut the lead to 2 early in the second half and then
Miles hits three straight threes. How difficult was that to maybe come back
from that?  
MANU LECOMTE: It was tough because he got hot and we should have done a better
job us guards of closing out to him and taking it away. But, again, it came
off of turnovers, so it's the same thing. We've just got to take care of the
ball better.  
  
Q. Terry, you guys got out to an 18-9 lead, looked like you had chances
to expand that. How difficult was it not to stretch it out?  
TERRY MASTON: It was very difficult. We try not to dwell on it because we had
to play in the now. We couldn't worry about the lead that we had kinda blown.
We just tried to keep going and stay positive and we got a couple of traverse,
they got some great momentum, couple of fast break dunks and they just played
good overall.  
  
Q. Selection Sunday, 5:00, I guess. Do you guys feel like you guys have
done enough? Are you going to be a little nervous?  
MANU LECOMTE: I think we're good enough, but it doesn't matter now. We've just
got to wait and see.  
  
TERRY MASTON: Same, pretty much just waiting and seeing.  
  
Q. Guys, how different are they when Esa Ahmad is playing like he did? I
know he had 21 points. He was effective in the late run in the first half and
then also early in the second. What does he do to make them different?  
TERRY MASTON: I think he just plays hard. He's a great scorer. He has wide
hands on defense in their press and he plays with a lot of energy, especially
with a guy that's 6-8 moving around with those guards out there like Jevon
Carter and Daxter Miles. That's just a great part of his game.  
  
MANU LECOMTE: I think he's a very good player, gave us trouble in our zone,
catching the high post and stuff. Again, the coaches put up a great game plan
defensively, and we tried but he's a very good player, like TJ said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Good luck next week. Questions for Coach Drew?  
  
Q. Coach, what is the feeling like for you and the staff now that --
you've said as long as you're playing you're good well now you're not playing
anymore, it's out of your hands. What's the feeling like?  
SCOTT DREW: The positive part of things are we are playing the No. 1 RPI
conference in the country. We were the seed. Ten of our losses were to ranked
teams most in the nation. Zero losses in quadrant 3 or 4. So we don't have any
bad losses, and we're the fifth best team according to KenPom on the Big 12,
and it's a great conference, a great league. There are certain teams that you
match-up better with, and others that you don't. West Virginia we knew was a
tough match-up. We actually completely changed our game plan from Game 2 to
this one, and I thought early on it worked. In the last 8 minutes in the game
in the first half, you get to 18 points and then all of the sudden you're
stuck. I think the fatigue and that press wears on you.  
  
When they got momentum going into half, I think if we could have finished with
Tristan's dunk, one-possession game, it's a lot different. So when you're
playing them you don't need them hitting half-court shots. They're good enough
without that.  
  
Q. Scott, what did y'all do early to get that 9-point lead?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, our defense was really good early on, especially. They were
22%, 4 for 18 and then all of the sudden our traverse allowed them to not have
to face our defense and when they started scoring then we had to face their
press.  
  
When we were getting stops, then we could get out in transition, not have to
face the press. When they scored they set up and that wasn't good for us.  
  
Q. You said you changed up the game plan. What were y'all trying to do
to beat the press? Trying different things?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, we played in space in the half-court early on, and as far as
the press break, the first time we played them we used three guys the entire
time, second time we used three for the first half, switched to just two up
and that was more effective. So we started the game with two up and that
worked fairly well until the 8-minute mark when -- and when you're not
scoring, it does tend to affect you defensively and everywhere else. I think
that was unfortunate for us.  
  
So, again, their pressure -- at some point you're going to make a mistake and
if you're not scoring on the other end, getting high-risk/high-reward stuff it
makes it tough. When we turned it over and they scored, then you get down in
double digits, that's a tall feat.  
  
Again, if we could go back and start the game right there from 8-minute mark
when we're up and play it again, I would love to do it. I don't think Coach
Huggins will, though.  
  
Q. Huggins was pretty eloquent when he thought there were no bubble
teams in this conference. He thinks everybody should make it. How are these
next 72 hours going to be for you as you sit and ponder as far as what your
team's chances are may be in the next week or so?  
SCOTT DREW: I like his answer. Coaches tend to worry, though. At the end of
the day if I was on the committee I agree with him and what he said, but we're
not on the committee, and hopefully again the things they have asked us to do,
play good teams, play good schedules, not have bad losses. When you play
top-25 teams you rack up losses. In this league you do.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you've seen this league in a lot of different
seasons and each season is different. If you had to play a tour guide this
year of what has made it exceptional, I wonder what you would highlight?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, first of all, you look at the tournaments we all won in the
nonconference. It's hard to win tournaments, and we had a lot of teams win
tournaments in the nonconference. Normally every other game you're facing a
great player or two great players and in this league it starts with point
guards, and to me it's never been better top to bottom with point guards. If
you have great point guards you've got a chance to win any game.  
  
Then you look at shot blockers. It's the best the league has every been with
shot blockers and then you fill it in with everything else and you're like,
this is really a tough league.  
  
I don't know how many NBA players we'll have, but I know we have a lot of
really, really good players in this league that when you game plan you're
like, that's a problem. That's why I think we're all so successful in the
nonconference in our tournaments.  
  
If we could go back -- everyone has injuries and you've got to deal with them,
but, I mean, we were undefeated when TJ was healthy. We lost him and I wish we
would have had him in a couple of those nonconference games. When he's rolling
we're really good and it gives us another weapon confined of like with West
Virginia. Esa Ahmad was tremendous tonight, but when he first came back I
thought it took time for him to get acclimated. He was a looked a little
heavy, a little slow. Right now he's playing like he was last year and because
of that I think their team is better now than they were in the beginning of
the year because he's such a weapon for them, really knows how to operate
their defense.  
  
Offensively he can score and he can score inside, he can score outside. So,
again, I think every one of the Big 12 coaches are excited to face somebody
different. Especially one thing in coaching that's tough. We all talk about
talent and teams and leadership, but there is something to be said about
confidence and swag and when you're losing games, adversity hits you and when
you're in a great league you have more adversity than if you're playing in a
league where you get two or three losses. So every coach and every team is
dealing with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we will let you go and good luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Kenrich Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32824)

### [Alex Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32825)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State - 66, TCU - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome TCU, Coach Jamie Dixon and his two student-athletes,
Alex Robinson and Kenrich Williams. Coach?  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Good one for them. Obviously two really tight games, about as
tight as you can have it, two NCAA tournament teams playing in March. So
obviously a great game for a Big 12 tournament. You look at the numbers, about
as even as you can have. Rebound numbers are the same and field goal
percentage the same and they got to the free throw line, you can see the
difference there. We played good. I thought we could have played better. I'm
proud of our guys. We played hard. I don't know that we finished it off as
good as we had. We had a good lead and just didn't get it done down the
stretch. I'm disappointed to have that lead and let it get away from us, but
we know why it did and we're going to learn from it and get better for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our two student-athletes are Alex Robinson and Kenrich
Williams.  
  
Q. Alex, what did you see coming down court at the end of regulation you
were able to find Desmond for the game-tying 3-pointer?  
ALEX ROBINSON: Everybody collapsed on me and I saw Kenrich and Desmond over
there and the guy was closing out on Kenrich, so I skipped it through the
corner to Desmond.  
  
Q. Alex, the free throws at the end it looked like you looked to the
bench. Was that maybe to get your form down? What kind of advice were you
trying to get at that point right before you stepped to the line and then just
moving on from that. What's the process of trying to get over that and look
ahead?  
ALEX ROBINSON: I think the whistle blew or something like that. So I was just
seeing what we were going to do, or if Coach was going to call something or
anything like that. Looking forward. Just gotta move on and continue to work
and get better and learn from the situation.  
  
Q. Describe K-State's defense. They seemed to be in your face at all
times and they hold you down below 70 points all three times you played?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: They do a good job of just pressuring the ball, denying
sometimes. Sometimes they're in the gap. They're a good defensive team and
that's a good reason why.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Like Kenrich said, they're a sound defensive team. They're
always in gaps and things like that and communicating on defense.  
  
Q. Just trying to defend them in the post how difficult was that today?
Mak had a pretty good game for Kansas State and I think he tied his career
high and he's a mismatch problem. They haven't had that kind of presence in
the paint. Talk about how he adds something to their offense and defense.  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: He does a good job of getting in open spots, getting easy
dump-offs, getting himself open. Defensively he's long. Plays good defense.  
  
Q. Was his mismatch a problem for you though?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: No, he wasn't.  
  
Q. For both of you, I'm wondering how big of a swing of emotion is it to
go from the euphoria of tying the game and going to overtime and then to lose
so narrowly in the quarter finals of the tournament?  
ALEX ROBINSON: Well, I mean, it just didn't go our way. We've got to keep
fighting and looking forward and get ready for the tournament now.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys both had great games. What do you take
from your performances today and how do you take what you learned today into
wherever you play next in the postseason?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Well, it's going to be like this for the rest of the year,
for the rest of the games left. We know it's lose or go home so we're going to
go out and play hard. Just do what Coach says, offensively and defensively.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Like Kenrich said, get back in the gym and get ready for the
tournament and focus on the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you for coming. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You mentioned that you figured out what didn't work down the stretch,
why you guys weren't able to keep the lead. What can you pinpoint there?  
JAMIE DIXON: Couple shots we took and turnovers. Bad shots we look at as
turnovers, and they got to the line. They got to the foul line. We couldn't
let them get more free throws than they got and they got more than we got. So
I think those are the things that stood out.  
  
Q. What are the next few days like for you as you plan for Selection
Sunday?  
JAMIE DIXON: You get a day off tomorrow and prepare. Everybody is in the same
thing. Somebody is going to lose tomorrow. Three more will lose today. So one
day off, another day off. It's not a big difference. So you prepare, you get
ready, and we've played guys a lot of minutes. So in some ways that can be
productive, and we'll try to get better. We will watch some film because we
had a 9-point lead and we let the thing get away and we've done that a few
times, especially on the road and call it what you will, but we've done that.
We did it in the last game against Tech, too, as well. We continue to put
people at the line when they have trouble scoring against us, and that was the
case here again. Call it what you will, but they're getting more free throws
than us and eventually that's a bad thing.  
  
Q. When you've had so many of these kind of games, is there a growth
process or scar tissue or is there both?  
JAMIE DIXON: I mean, you know, we've gotta find ways -- we've had an
interesting season because our wins have been blowouts, we've beat ten people
by double digits and we've lost games on the road, couple home ones early,
nothing recently and this is semi neutral or whatever you want to call it,
but, you know, I go back to the same things, it's the free throw hurting us,
today was turnovers. We have been high on turnovers. We were leading the
conference in lowest turnovers, lowest in the country, and that's been hurting
us now. And ultimately our defense has not been what I wanted it to be. It's
improved and it's much better, but it's still not where it needs to be to
finish things off when you're struggling to get some. I look at our numbers.
We shot 46%, you know, it's only 14 turnovers. We were way up on the rebounds,
but it turned the other way in the second half. They were more physical than
us, way more physical. That was clear, evident. Their philosophy, what they
did to Vlad was clear. We knew it was coming, but clearly more physical than
us, especially in the second half.  
  
Q. Building off that, if you ask a Lehman they may not list Kansas City
as one of the better defensive teams in the league, but they clearly are. What
do they do that gives you so much trouble?  
JAMIE DIXON: We beat them by 10 the other day, so we shot a good percentage in
that one. Really the turnovers, I guess. We shot 47%. That's low for us, but
not that low. Most people will take that, and we had some foul trouble and
there were some situations, and I think we had too many turnovers. But I don't
know that they caused them. We've got to finish plays in transition, and I
don't know that that's their defense that caused that. Usually it's
transition, but we make the free throws. They don't make the free throws.
You're asking different questions, and that's what it got down to and we can't
get beat at the free throw line. When we've lost we've got beat at the free
throw line. It's that simple.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about how Vladimir played and going into the tournament
and double figures, your leading scorer?  
JAMIE DIXON: We wanted to get him more touches. They were obviously fronting
the post. We knew it was coming. They were physical with him. They threw two
bodies, sometimes three at him and that's the thing.  
  
He's gotta get to the line more than four times, considering what they were
doing. But he made some nice passes I thought out of the post. Obviously he
was 5 for 9, made the free throws down the stretch, so he did miss one. So we
have got to continue to get the ball into him. He's a hard match-up especially
with our shooting, because you've got to guard our shooters, and he has been
passing so well out of the post.  
  
Q. He took one 3 today. Did K-State do anything to keep him from getting
the shot? He shot 57% or something.  
JAMIE DIXON: I don't think he's shooting that high, with all respect. He was
0-2. They were both good looks. They didn't go down. He's a good player, and
were you talking about Vlad? Yeah, he got a couple good looks and they didn't
go down. We shot a good percentage, 7 for 17, 41%. People will take that, 3
for 17, 3 for 15, it comes down to free throws, down the stretch free throws.
They got more and made more.  
  
Q. As you await Sunday, how do you think the committee will view you and
the rest of the league and what are your thoughts on the quadrant system?  
JAMIE DIXON: It's going to play out here and we'll see. We'll see how the
other teams around us do. We'll drop in the RPI we think. But you never know
how the other teams around you are. But we were 20, 19 today. We put ourselves
in good position. We feel we should have won these two games down the stretch,
but we didn't. It's two of the same things, shot selection a little bit late
when we had the leads and foul line. Gotta get to the foul line, gotta make
more free throws. So we gotta get more free throws than our opponent. That's a
big goal for us.  
  
As far as the league, it's the best. I never thought it would be possible to
get nine teams in the NCAA tournament, but we're giving it as good of a shot
as you possibly can. So it will be a great boost for our conference to get
eight, nine, whatever it may be in. It's remarkable. What we did in
nonconference was remarkable, and I've been in good conferences. But top to
bottom this provides the greatest challenge. It's a great conference, and I
think people are recognizing it more and more. Obviously, we don't cover the
biggest of cities in the east and west. But I think people are really getting
a good idea of how good this conference is. But now we've got to go do it in
the NCAA tournament. We can say it and say it, but then you gotta do something
about it.  
  
Q. What are you thoughts on the quadrant system?  
JAMIE DIXON: Quadrant system? Let's see what happens first. Just talking about
it, a lot of talk and speculation. But it's really the same thing. Just a
little different look and things. But with the quadrant you've still gotta
pick a metric to use, and so, you know, they're picking the RPI. Depending
what they're going to use. So there is still which one are you going to use or
how are you going to use them or how many? A lot of things factor in. I know
guys like to talk about their indicators and their eye test, but the numbers
are about as objective as you can get. We've done real well in that as far as
our program, but certainly the Big 12.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Mike Boynton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34243)

### [Cameron McGriff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32861)

### [Kendall Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34846)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas - 82, Oklahoma State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Oklahoma State, Coach Mike Boynton.
Student-athletes are Cameron McGriff and Kendall Smith. Coach, your thoughts
on today's game?  
  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thanks for being here. Obviously, tough day at the office for us
in terms of shooting the basketball. Wasn't our best offensive day
specifically in the second half and looking at 0 for 10 from the three is hard
to win in the game especially now if you don't make any.  
  
But we played against a No. 1 seed and those teams are usually projected to
get to the Final Four as far as I understand how that goes. Beat that team
twice. I'm proud of the guys and the effort they showed for the last 29, 30
hours, played two games and looking forward to seeing what's next for us.  
  
Q. Kendall, I would like to get your assessment as this tournament ends
today, Coach said you came here yesterday to win the Big 12 tournament. But as
it ends today, what are your thoughts about the NCAA tournament and where you
guys deserve to be?  
KENDALL SMITH: I definitely think we're a tournament team. I think we've
proven that all season long. We won a lot of big games on the road, and we won
games at home when it counted. If you look at that and especially look at
where they projected us to be in the beginning of the season and everything
that we fought through and especially to see the kind of basketball that we're
playing right now I definitely believe we should get in.  
  
Q. Kendall, you go almost eight minutes there in the second half without
scoring. From your standpoint, what went wrong there?  
KENDALL SMITH: I don't know exactly what it was. Pretty sure we'll watch film
and figure it out. Like Coach said, they're a No. 1 seed in the tournament. So
they're a really good basketball team and they were locked in defensively.  
  
Q. Cameron, I wanted to get your take on Sima's first half. He was
exposing them in the post, the weakness that they had, the player they were
missing, and how that went way in the second half?  
CAMERON McGRIFF: I feel like he did great. He brought us great minutes in the
first half, and I really couldn't comment on the second half. As a team we may
have gotten stagnant offensively, but it's not his fault.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you for coming. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, your thoughts on Sunday?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Obviously, I think we've done what we're supposed to do. We play
in the best league in America, without question. If people can get over the
fact that they didn't think we would be any good in October, with all that was
going on in our program and open their eyes and watch what we've done and the
team that played the last two days and the last couple of weeks. Really over
the course of the season we have done some really good work and I don't think
it's a question of whether we deserve to play in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. How much was fatigue a factor today in your defensive performance?
Kansas got a lot of open shots first and second half. You had to play eighteen
hours earlier. How much was fatigue a factor?  
MIKE BOYNTON: I'm not going to say it didn't matter. We did just play and we
played a really emotionally driven game. It was a big game for us, but we knew
that coming in. We also put ourselves in that position to have to play in that
scenario, and Kansas earned the right to have the extra day of rest by winning
the league.  
  
It certainly factored in, but at the end of the day Kansas just played better
than we did for forty minutes today. They were really good. As good as they've
been in probably a long time, at least from what I've been able to watch, both
offensively. And they were as aggressive defensively as I've seen for a long
time, too. So credit to Coach Self and his kids for getting locked in and
ready to play against us in what will be the second time in less than a week.  
  
Q. What can you tell us about the game plan with them missing Azubuike
inside? Going in, seemed a big first half. Looked like Mitchell was trying to
get it going early in the second half?  
MIKE BOYNTON: We tried to make a conscious effort to attack them in there. We
know that without Azubuike they don't have as much shot-blocking presence. We
feel comfortable with the bigs we have that can score in there. But we needed
to have some other contributions from our other guys especially once you get
down and they make a run it's hard to get keeping twos when they're getting
threes. And they shot the ball really well today.  
  
Q. What do you think of the new quadrant system and how do you think
some of the wins you have can help you some Sunday?  
MIKE BOYNTON: If that's what truly matters, if that's the reason they created
it, to evaluate how you do against the best teams, teams that will essentially
be playing in the tournament, then, again, it's not a question. We won at
Kansas, at West Virginia and at Iowa State, and I'm not sure the last time
anybody in our league did that all in one year. We also beat Texas Tech, who
will be probably be a top 3 or 4 seed. We beat Florida State who is certainly
going to be in the tournament. And beyond that, the losses we have, there is
nobody who is not going to be in the dance that we lost to.  
  
So sometimes I think people try to bring arbitrary numbers into the equation
to justify, again, back in October they weren't supposed to be any good. So
let's figure out how they can still not be any good even though we watched
them play and they were pretty good. So let's talk about the nonconference
strength of schedule.  
  
Well, we scheduled a game against Pittsburgh two years ago when they were a
top-25 team every year, and then they had the worst year in the history of
their program. That is bad luck and I don't think they will ever have a bad of
season ever again. We played a Charlotte team who is usually in the top 150.
They fired their coach three games after we played them. They fired their
coach. So those are things outside of your control that when we scheduled
those games it was within mind that those are quality opponents that you're
going to play and all of the sudden they turn into "bad games," "bad
scheduling." Since when has Pittsburgh been a bad game to schedule? First time
ever! We just happened to play them this year.  
  
If you just look at our team, watch us play. We have beaten the best teams
that we've played all year and that should count for something.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how everyone had to get over the fact they
thought you were going to be bad early in the season. Why do you think that is
and is part of it because the Big 12 is so good you got overshadowed a little
bit?  
MIKE BOYNTON: No, let's be realistic. We had a guy who came into our program
after it was down for a couple of years who was essentially going to be the
guy to save the program and resurrect it, and we had some good success with
some really good players last year, and he left and they hired me and nobody
in this room knew who I was. That's the truth. So you've got a program that
looks like it's unstable, and you've got a guy who has never been a head coach
before, coaching it. No way they're going to be good. No way they can win
eight games in the Big 12. If they can finish 11th, they will do that. As
opposed to, we finished with the 6th best record in the best league in
America. And so instead of accepting that as truth because that's what
happened, we say, well, they played Pittsburgh who lost every game in the ACC.
Well, it's never going to happen again. So, again, it's confirmation bias in
some ways that people just can't accept what they see because then it
invalidates what they said a long time ago.  
  
Humility, it's okay. We can be wrong every now and then. Our team competed
really well. We dismissed two guys mid-year. We went the next game and beat a
top-20 team on the road. NCAA tournament teams do that, figure out a way to go
have success even with all the distractions, and we had a lot of them. There
was a little investigation going on. We happened to be part of that. Our kids
could have easily -- they had every reason in the world not to compete the way
they did. It goes to show the character of the people in that locker room, and
I'm really proud to be their coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we will let you go. Thank you very much.

### [Keenan Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30662)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Texas Tech - 73, Texas - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the Red Raiders of Texas Tech, Coach Beard
and his student-athletes, Tommy Hamilton and Keenan Evans. Coach,
congratulations on your victory.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Thanks, just really proud and happy for our players. It was one
year ago we sat at this table and we said we were going to do everything we
could in the next 364 days to put ourselves in a better position and we've
done that. I think you've got to give our players all the credit, including
these two guys to my right, two of our five seniors that have really, you
know, had a special season. We just don't want it to end. We want to keep
playing. I want to keep coaching these guys and I want to coach 'em two more
times in Kansas City and six times in the NCAA tournament.  
  
We have a lot of respect for Texas. They're a tough team. They've overcome a
lot of adversity this year with the injuries and I have a lot of respect for
Shaka. They're an NCAA tournament team in my book and they're a great team
with a great coach. Pleased to win for a lot of reasons and our respect for
Shaka and Texas is at the top of that list.  
  
Q. Keenan, what did the five days of rest do for you this week to help
you get back? How close are you to being at pretty normal condition as far as
where you might have been earlier in the season?  
KEENAN EVANS: It was definitely a big help. Just staying in the training room
with our trainer, Chris Williams. He stayed up there with me and didn't leave
me up there by myself to ice by myself. It was big to sit out a little bit and
rest it and it helped me come ready to play.  
  
Q. Are you almost back do you feel like?  
KEENAN EVANS: I'm getting there, man. I'm getting there.  
  
Q. Tommy, in terms of the aggressiveness you guys had with getting to
the basket. I guess you had a couple of passes to Zhaire. How did that help
you out, getting aggressive and spreading out the floor?  
TOMMY HAMILTON IV: Zhaire is one of my favorite targets. I love when he goes
backdoor and we make those things happen. We came out with a game plan, and we
wanted to attack them and that's what we followed through with.  
  
Q. Keenan, when you guys were up 1, what did Coach tell in you terms of
the huddles after that timeout and what did y'all do that helped y'all get
there?  
KEENAN EVANS: He questioned us and asked us do we want to win? We were in the
same position last year. This is your senior year. You haven't won in the Big
12 tournament. Are y'all going to get stops and rebounds? And we did it.  
  
Q. Keenan, what did you see from Jarrett in those first couple minutes
where he was all over the place, 7 points and 6 rebounds?  
KEENAN EVANS: He was doing it all. He was doing everything we needed him to do
and more. We looked for him to make big shots and he did and we looked for him
to rebound down by Tommy and Norense and getting good box outs, and he did
everything we needed him to do.  
  
Q. Keenan, what's going through your mind when you saw Texas start off
cold 3-16 and 0-9 from the three. Is it tempting to let them keep shooting
from so far out?  
KEENAN EVANS: No, we didn't want to give them horse shots. We wanted to
contest all of them and we wanted to convert on the offensive end while they
weren't making shots, and we knew they weren't going to shoot like that all
night. So we tried to take advantage while we could.  
  
Q. Keenan, Coach talked about putting this team in a better position
than a year ago when you were at this tournament. How would you sum up the
confidence level of this team to possibly win this tournament?  
KEENAN EVANS: High, high confidence. We got everybody back. We're getting
healthier by the day. We all know what we can do and what we're capable of and
we're trying to play together and play for one another and we know that this
is our last go-round. So we're just trying to make the most of it.  
  
Q. For Tommy and Keenan, Tommy first, when Zhaire made that LeBron play
as he lacks likes to call it, how much of a swing was that for you guys
momentumwise. It seemed like everybody kicked it up on defense?  
TOMMY HAMILTON IV: That's one thing we practice on. I don't know if you saw
me, but I was sprinting back, too.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: You were?  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON IV: Yeah, and that's something we get from Z all the time,
something that makes him special and he has bought into and that's what
separates him from most of the other freshman in the country.  
  
Q. Did you see him running and what was that like when you saw him make
that play?  
KEENAN EVANS: It's great. I remember when he first got here in the summer he
was making those plays. So that's what we expect of him. Jarrett got ahead and
slowed him down for Z and he made that play and it gets us going, energizes
the bench and everybody on the court and kind of stopped them from going on
the run that they were on.  
  
Q. Keenan, just looking back on it, getting this first win in the
conference tournament, what does it mean to y'all? Coach said he was
challenging you to win this game. What was it like to know you met the
challenge he gave you?  
KEENAN EVANS: Feels good. It's still a long road. We got another one tomorrow,
so we've got to not get too high and too low and get on to the next one.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON IV: I'm just happy to be a part of this with these guys, you
know, man. My career never meant that much to me, but, you know, it's kind of
hard to deny it being around them and being in the locker room with them. It's
just fun.  
  
Q. Obviously, Young went off for a lot of the game. What did you guys do
to stop him the last couple three minutes because he didn't score after he hit
a really big hoop?  
KEENAN EVANS: During timeout Coach was like who was going to step up and take
that challenge and I told him I would. So I was trying to get on him and make
it as tough as I could and was trying to make it as hard for him as I could
and stop him from being the high guy.  
  
Q. Keenan, I was curious what was the scouting report on Jacob Young
averaging 5 points a game?  
KEENAN EVANS: We knew he was streaky and could turn into a big-time shooter.
We just lost a couple and slipped up on some stuff and he got hot and he just
kept going. They kept feeding him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you for coming. Congratulations. Questions for
Coach Beard?  
  
Q. Chris, that stretch at the end where Keenan gave you a little
breathing room first with that 18-foot jump shot then the free throws. Was
that the Evans that you have seen all year long up until the injury and how
good was it to see that guy again after the second half against TCU?  
CHRIS BEARD: He's one of the best players I've every coached. I think he's one
of the best in the Big 12 that translates to him being one of the best players
in college basketball. It's not just his talent. It's his courage. He wants to
be in those moments. He wants the ball in those moments and it's been a
maturation process for him. Started playing for Tubby and took a lot of bumps,
helped them get to the NCAA tournament as a sophomore. Last year he was a
leader, All-Conference player, doubled up his numbers and now this year he's
one of the best players in college basketball. Tonight, we've been in these
situations before. He has the ability and the courage to take games over.  
  
Q. You'll either face Baylor or West Virginia two entirely different
styles of game, but you've split with both. Do you have a preference?  
CHRIS BEARD: No, just -- this league is so good, you guys have seen it, every
game has been a 1-possession game in this tournament so far. No, there's a lot
of things that I am looking forward to, but playing against another Big 12
team is not one of them. We have extreme respect for West Virginia and Coach
Huggins, and Baylor and Coach Drew, two teams that are going be in the NCAA
tournament. So I'm not looking forward to playing either one of them, but I'm
looking forward to competing again in this tournament.  
  
Q. First time you guys have made a semifinal since 2005. I wonder if you
could reflect on that accomplishment and also what it might mean for you next
week as a way to prepare for the NCAA.  
CHRIS BEARD: I was here in 2005 working for Coach Knight and we had some
success in this tournament, played a change-up game against Coach Sutton and
Oklahoma State. When you build a program there's going to be a lot of firsts.
You've got to do things that haven't been done before and those are things to
reflect on after the season which we definitely will and right now we are just
trying to stay in the moment. I respect the question. I would give the guys
all the credit. These guys have a chip on their shoulder and they're trying to
do things that have never been done before at Texas Tech. I am really
appreciative and thankful to be a part of the ride with these players.  
  
Q. What would you do as far as preparation for NCAA next week?  
CHRIS BEARD: That's a good question. In your nonconference schedule and your
conference schedule you prepare for everything. In the Big 12 we're fortunate
enough to be part of the Big Monday from time-to-time. So it's just like the
NCAA tournament situation, Thursday, Saturday, Friday, Sunday. These
situations, back-to-backs, we've been here before in our multi-team tournament
at Connecticut. We played Boston College and Northwestern in a similar
situation. We will remind the guys of that. We've prepared for that. There is
nothing that could pop up in March whether in our schedule or in practice, and
it's ultimately our jobs as coaches is to prepare our guys. So even though
tomorrow will be a tough game against a great opponent, in a lot of ways we're
prepared for this back-to-back situation.  
  
Q. Chris, I think Texas had four stars with ten points. I was curious if
you defend them different. Are they a little bit more unorthodox and they're
not that accurate of a shooting team?  
CHRIS BEARD: They're a dangerous team. It starts with their overall talent
level. You've got in my opinion three guys that could get drafted this year.
They're really, really good players. As with all teams we have really good
players, sometimes you can't take the coaching for granted, but I've been
doing this a long time. I don't think I'm better than anybody else, but I
promise you nobody watches more film than me and nobody loves basketball more
than me. Shaka can really coach. A game like today when Jacob goes off that's
not just Jacob, that's Shaka instilling confidence in that guy and he's given
him the ability to take big shots all season long. Today that paid off for
him. Certainly they're a tough team. If you want to stop the said the three-
ball can get you and if you want to stop the three-ball, the inside guys can
post up. I think as they continue to get healthy, and Bamba didn't have his
legs today. We all know he is a much better player than he played today
although he played really good. I think they're a team that can make a real
run in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.

### [Dylan Osetkowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34861)

### [Kerwin Roach II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34862)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Texas - 68, Iowa State - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Coach Shaka Smart, University of Texas.
Student-athletes are Kerwin Roach and Dylan Osetkowski. Coach, call on you for
comment.  
  
SHAKA SMART: I thought our guys showed a lot of fight, and I think we came
into the game really, really wanting to win and that showed at times with our
guys getting a little down when we missed some shots. But they hung in there,
and what won us the game really was the last six minutes of the first half
because I think we were down 10 and then we went into halftime up 3. You have
to give Iowa State credit for the way they fought and battled and they had
nothing to lose, and I think our guys made enough plays.  
  
Q. How is your mouth? What happened and what happened at halftime?  
KERWIN ROACH II: My mouth is pretty good. I was kind of worried because I had
braces for a little while and I thought all that money went to waste and I was
worried about that. But at halftime I went to the back and got it fixed and
they glued it back together. It looked back to normal and I wanted to go back
with my teammates.  
  
Q. What is it like front jammed in there? What is it?  
KERWIN ROACH II: I split it in half. They just glued it back together. That's
it.  
  
Q. Dylan, talk about your night all the way around from the start, you
know, got hot at the end of the first half, went cold again, then got hot
again. Talk about the whole thing?  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: I think I missed my first four or five threes and came into
a media and between Coach Smart, Coach Horn, Coach Morrell, everybody on the
team, Coach Roose, saying, "Just let it fly." I took 12 threes today. Started
out sluggish and Coach drew up a couple of plays to get me the ball inside,
saw the ball go in a few times and felt good from there on out. It was a team
effort today and everybody played great.  
  
Q. Snoop, you said you had dental work before. Had you ever been hit in
the mouth in a basketball game that hard?  
KERWIN ROACH II: Not really and the crazy thing about it is it didn't hurt at
the time. I just felt like wind going through my mouth more than normal. I
looked down and seen a tooth on about the free throw line, and I was like, oh,
snap, my tooth fell out. So I was just worried about that. I went to the
sideline and I was just hoping that I don't bleed that much so I could just
get back in the game.  
  
Q. Both of you, was this the definition of hanging on and doing what it
takes? Obviously, Iowa State had nothing to lose like Coach said and they kept
bringing it pretty good.  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: I wouldn't say it was the definition of nothing to lose. I
would say it was the definition of fighting. We knew it was going to be a
fight for forty minutes tonight and we took it one game at a time. We wanted
to focus on this one and I think the guys did a great job collectively
throughout the game just having the mindset of fighting and focusing on the
next play.  
  
KERWIN ROACH II: Like we said earlier, Iowa State had nothing to lose and they
came out swinging and fighting, and with Lindell Wigginton tried to keep his
team in the game. But we didn't give up. We stayed together and fought.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult it was when Matt Coleman got his
fourth foul and had to leave to the bench for such a long period of time?  
KERWIN ROACH II: It was very difficult especially for our point guard. Like
you seen, he came in and made a huge jump shot for us and we really needed
this. It was difficult because we were already short guys. We lost another guy
to foul trouble and we had to adjust and keep fighting and do what it takes.  
  
Q. I came in as you were discussing your tooth. Did it come completely
out of your mouth or was it just broken?  
KERWIN ROACH II: Split in half.  
  
Q. What did they do at halftime to get it reattached?  
KERWIN ROACH: They basically glued it back together. I used to get braces.
They had like a blue light, really a heat sensor thing and glued it back
together. I still can feel the glue on my teeth kinda sorta.  
  
Q. And they just happened to have a mouth guard? You travel with a mouth
guard?  
KERWIN ROACH II: Yeah, our trainer does a good job of preparing us for
situations like this.  
  
Q. For both of you, Jericho Sims had a big game tonight. Talk about how
he has emerged as a rebounding threat over the last few games?  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: We knew Jericho could rebound the ball. His athleticism
takes over. He has a knack for playing above the rim and grabbing everything
that comes his way. I think he set a tone that was good are us in the first
half, I think before the first media he had five or six rebounds and we wanted
him to continue to crash defensively and offensively and he did a great job.  
  
KERWIN ROACH II: Before the first media, like Dylan said, he had five
offensive rebounds by himself. He's like the most athletic dude in the country
and when Mo went out we was missing that rebounding and getting those extra
possessions and he came in and filled the void. Jericho Sims, whatever we need
him to do he comes in and does it. That's an athletic dude, man.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, congratulations. We will see you tomorrow. Questions
for Coach Smart?  
  
Q. Shaka, why this game plan almost 40 three-pointers when that's not
y'all's strength?  
SHAKA SMART: It's 31. Depending on the way teams were guarding you, guys were
wide open so they were packing their defense into the paint and they were
wide-open shots. We ended up going inside a little bit about midway through
the first half, had some success. They started doubling after that. So you
gotta take what the defense gives you. I tell you, I mean, a lot of those were
really, really good shots for our guys and you could say it's not our
strength, but Dylan hit 7 threes against them couple times ago playing Iowa
State. I think in that game he shot 13.  
  
Jacob Young, Jase Febres, that's kinda the best thing they do, you know?
Without us having Andrew Jones, Eric Davis, Mohamed Bamba, those guys maybe
bring something different to the table. You gotta let guys do the best thing
they can do. I can tell you this, if we told our guys, hey don't shoot anymore
threes, it probably would have been even more difficult to score just because
of the way they were guarding.  
  
Q. When you go through seven overtime games, how much does it prepare
you for March and to survive grind-it-out games like this?  
SHAKA SMART: It helps. We've been in so many close games, as you mentioned,
seven overtime games, a lot of close games that ended in regulation as well.
We told our guys down the stretch in a six minute game if you are solid on
defense, take care of the ball and make your free throws. It gives you a great
chance to win. Our guys did enough of that down the stretch. Obviously we were
far from perfect. The reality is we got some guys in the game at the end right
now that maybe weren't in the game earlier in the year in some of those
situations.  
  
I thought the guys hung in there and showed a good level of fight. We almost
played better and with more aggressiveness when we were down. I definitely
thought there was some hesitancy at times tonight but for our guys to fight
through that and find a way to win was big.  
  
Q. Shaka, the decision to go back to Matt with four fouls when you did,
what went into that and his ability to step up and hit that medium-range jump
shot with 44 to go?  
SHAKA SMART: We were trying to figure out when to put him back in the game
because he picked up that fourth foul early. When he had three fouls and he
went back in we said don't foul! He's a freshman, so sometimes they do bone-
headed things and he fouled on accident. So then he had four fouls, but our
team, everything runs so much more smoothly when he's out there. The
assistants wanted to put him in a little bit earlier, but I waited until about
6 minutes or so and then we took him out on defense a couple of times just
because if it's a close game down the stretch like it was, with one minute
left, we needed someone that could execute our play and make a play like he
did when he hit that jumper.  
  
Q. Shaka, what's the latest on Mo as far as his availability throughout
the tournament and the foul on Kerwin Roach when he went out?  
SHAKA SMART: Mo's status is the same. It's day-to-day. He's getting better and
better. We were hopeful he was going to be able to go tonight. He didn't, but
there is a possibility he will go tomorrow. He's out there shooting and
running.  
  
I think part of it is him kind of figuring out how hard he can push that
thing. But he's close. Obviously we need him out there. He would make a big,
big difference, but we're not going to put him out there when it's not the
right thing for him.  
  
So we have to monitor him, check in on him tomorrow again when he gets his
treatment, see where he's at, get him moving around. Jericho I thought gave us
a big lift. He's still young, figuring things out. He gets down on himself,
believe it or not. He's a perfectionist, so when something doesn't go his way
he gets really, really upset because he feels like he hurt the team. For him
to be able to go get 15 rebounds in a game where he really didn't feel great
about how things were going the whole time says a lot about his growth.  
  
Q. Shaka, winning the ugly thing, in a way is that a benefit because
there never seems to be panic with your team and as you said you're used to
playing so many close games?  
SHAKA SMART: Yeah, you know, I think obviously in any tournament setting you
just want to survive and advance. So whether you win by 1 or by 40 then you
get to lace 'em up the next game. Tonight wasn't our best game, but we were
able to respond to some situations that weren't going our way. And I think as
a team that's something that we've really tried to build on throughout the
year.  
  
The reality is, there's been a couple times we had to kind of reinvent
ourselves in terms of who is out there on the court. I mean, to be honest with
you, at the beginning of the year, first, I don't know, ten games, Jericho
Sims, Dylan Osetkowski, Matt Coleman, Kerwin Roach and Jase Febres or Jacob
Young, those guys just weren't on the court. That just wasn't the group that
was out there.  
  
Those guys all played some, but they had to figure out tonight how to win a
game together when things weren't going great to the point where we didn't
shoot the ball from outside, and they did that. Obviously we have to play
better tomorrow night in order to win. But that's the thing about when you are
in a tournament, you can play better the next game and that's what we've gotta
go do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Lindell Wigginton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34859)

### [Cameron Lard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34860)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Texas - 68, Iowa State - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are joined now by the Cyclones from Iowa State. Coach
Steve Prohm, his student-athletes are Cameron Lard and Lindell Wigginton.
Coach, we will turn to you for an opening comment.  
  
STEVE PROHM: You know, this is always a tough game, when it's the last game,
especially with no postseason in front of us. First off, congratulations to
Texas and Shaka and those guys will hopefully do well tomorrow and going
forward with the NCAAs.  
  
For our guys, I got two young guys here that I hope can be the future of Iowa
State basketball and leave their legacy like a lot of guys before them did. I
hope they understand now what we've got to do to get better and get ready to
get to work because this is obviously a tough year. We've got to learn from it
and then get back to work.  
  
Q. Guys, down the stretch you had a chance to kinda get over the hump.
They made a couple plays late, but what was going through your minds when you
were making the comeback late in the game with the crowd behind you?  
LINDELL WIGGINTON: Really we just gotta try to stay focused. The crowd is
behind us. We've gotta stay poised and in a couple of those moments we turned
the ball over and they scored off our turnovers.  
  
CAMERON LARD: Just bought into what Coach told us to do and executing down the
stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen. Thank you for coming. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, looking at the big picture of the Big 12, you guys not going
to the NCAA tournament. But nine teams still could possibly make it. What are
your thoughts about this tournament with so much balance and so many great
teams?  
STEVE PROHM: Great teams, great coaches, I hope nine go. I think we have the
best league in the country. You never know until Sunday, but I'm pulling for
all nine teams to get in and we need to get back in there next year for sure
because this is a rough feeling here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Kristian Doolittle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34843)

### [Trae Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34844)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Oklahoma State - 71, Oklahoma - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are ready to begin with the Sooners of the University
of Oklahoma, Coach Lon Kruger and his student-athletes are Kristian Doolittle
and Trae Young. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
  
LON KRUGER: Well, a game in which Oklahoma State did a good job, a little push
there midway in the first half, both halves dictated for the most part on the
rebounding side of it. We just didn't do the job we have to do against a good
club in keeping them to one shot. Thought they were more aggressive in the
first half when they popped a little bit of a lead and certainly when we made
the comeback to get it within reach I thought rebounding, again, at that point
was critical. We've got to do a much more physical job on the boards, but
credit O-State and the job Mike has done. They certainly deserved the win.  
  
Q. Kristian, can you address that issue, the rebounding? Because Mike
Boynton came in and said we pride ourselves in playing harder than the
opposition, and you guys were down at halftime some 15 or 16 and in the second
half you came back and didn't gain any ground, actually went further in the
hole in rebounding.  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: They were just bodying us on the boards. We were switching
forward so they would have Cameron McGriff who is a big guy crashing the
boards hard and being able to outjump some of us and the lack of boxing out
was the main key. But we've got to move forward.  
  
Q. Trae, did it feel out of sync defensively tonight, like you guys kind
of took a while to arrive?  
TRAE YOUNG: A little bit. We got back to playing. We played defense the second
half, but you can't wait until the second half to beat a team like OSU.
They're very well-coached. They play really hard. A lot of their points came
off their rebounding. You can't get outrebounded like that and expect to win.
I think that was the main key for tonight.  
  
Q. For Trae, your lob pass to Brady on a fast break which was blown up
by Mitchell Solomon. You guys were on a 14-2 run or 12-2 run at that point and
it had chipped away and made it a 4-point game. They actually went on a run
right after that. Can you describe that play from your perspective and how
that kind of stopped things, the momentum you guys built up there?  
TRAE YOUNG: I mean, I saw his man step up and I tried to throw a lob and I
don't know what happened after that. I don't know if there was contact or
anything like that, but that's been working all year. Brady goes and gets
those and I was surprised he didn't get that without -- I'm surprised he
didn't get that one.  
  
Q. Kristian, can you and Trae talk about the next four days? Most
projections say you're still in the NCAA tournament, but you never know.
What's the waiting game going to be like?  
TRAE YOUNG: Instead of taking care of business we left it in the committee's
hands. I think our resume speaks for itself. I think we had the toughest
schedule in America.  
  
We had to go to Wichita State and play there, USC, a really good team. We
played some Pac-12 teams in Oregon and then we played in the toughest
conference in America. I think our resume speaks for itself. Instead of us
taking care of business we left it in their hands, but we'll see what happens.  
  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: When we get back to Norman we've got to focus in. We won't
know who we are going to be playing until bracket comes out, so just focusing
on ourselves. Just playing hard, building that mindset of we've got to -- it
could be our last game. So just leave it all out on the floor.  
  
Q. Trae, was this one of more physical games that you played?  
TRAE YOUNG: No, I think all my games have been physical. I mean, it's just
been different. I mean, all my games have been physical. I don't know how else
to put it. I think that's the thing, all my past games have been physical.
They're a very physical team. They're very well-coached, like I said. They
pride themselves on playing hard and playing defense, and they did a really
good job tonight and credit to them.  
  
Q. Trae and Kristian, if you both want to address it, the shooting,
that's the other statistic or statistics that jump out besides rebounding.
James and the other guys, just trouble getting the ball in the hole. How
frustrating is that moving forward and what options were you trying to get to
in shooting such a low percentage?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: We made a focus to get to the hole, trying to get to the
free throw line, but it's not necessarily that we were getting fouled. We just
weren't able to finish the easy ones around the rim. We started the game off
shooting threes, but they weren't falling, which we are capable of making. But
it's just not smart to keep shooting threes when they're not going down. So
you've got to do something else to get yourself going. So we just made a focus
to try to get to the hole. We were able to make some, but we weren't able to
make enough to make a difference in the game.  
  
TRAE YOUNG: Like Kristian said, we were playing, shooting a lot of threes
early on in the game. Just weren't making them. Like I said, we were very
capable of doing that and making shots and when they're falling everybody
loves it, but when they're not falling it's not good.  
  
Good for us and good for our team. We're going to continue to play the same
way. We've got to get back to making shots and doing that. You never know.  
  
Q. For Trae, two months ago people were talking about you guys possibly
being a No. 1 seed or in the mix for that and now it's in the hands of the
committee. Is it kind of surreal that you guys are in this position
considering where you were not that long ago?  
TRAE YOUNG: I mean, I didn't expect to be in this position by my means. It's a
lot different. I didn't expect us to be in that position. I obviously expected
us to keep winning and hopefully have a chance to get a 1 seed or 2 seed or up
in that range. But our body of work speaks for itself and I think we have a
good shot of getting in just because of our resume and all of that. We'll have
to see. Hopefully we'll get in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thanks for
coming. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Follow-up on the blow-up of the lob, the fast break lob from Mitchell
Solomon. Did you sense anything at that point? That looked like a potential
turning point in the game. You had such a good run going?  
LON KRUGER: We had a good run going, cut into the lead and had the momentum
and didn't finish that play, and as it turns out as you look back on it
O-state then went on a run but then why did they back out. There plays that
are going to change the momentum and that's one we didn't finish.  
  
Q. Kind of along the lines of what I asked Trae, Lon, is it surreal that
you guys have gone a different direction here down the stretch considering how
well you were playing in January?  
LON KRUGER: It's very disappointing. Obviously a very good stretch early,
nonconference, early conference and then in February we just didn't play well
at all. Actually played better the last couple weeks, better defensively,
still not the way we need to play as well as we need to play, but, yeah, it's
disappointing for sure.  
  
Q. Lon, they had six players instead of three. How tough is it to defend
a team that can do that? That has that kind of depth?  
LON KRUGER: They've got a lot of guys that make shots. Again, they're playing
well. They're doing a good job. Always the more guys that can make shots the
more difficult it is to defend as a group.  
  
I thought, again, decent job on the first attempt, but we can't give them that
many second opportunities. Can't give any team let alone good teams that many
second shots.  
  
Q. Mike Boynton was talking earlier about they like to pride themselves
on not being outworked or outworking the opponent. With the rebounding
disparity, the offensive rebounding disparity, their sense of desperation like
the only chance of continuing the season is to win here and win tomorrow and
on and on. Do you feel like they played harder than you? Is that a fair
characterization?  
LON KRUGER: Anytime you get whipped on the boards like that. Certainly they
were more aggressive. The stats speak for themselves in that way, for sure.  
  
Q. Lon, very similar to that, in the locker room a couple of your guys
mentioned lacking fight tonight maybe over the past month or so. Would you
agree with that? If so, how do you manage that in March?  
LON KRUGER: For sure. We've got to improve. Clearly rebounding is about
competing and fighting, and yeah, we're not pleased with the job there at all.  
  
Q. Do you feel comfortable on Sunday going into Sunday, you guys are
going to be in the tournament?  
LON KRUGER: Well, it's irrelevant, you know. We didn't take care of our
business here, so we don't have any say in that at this point. But, again,
when you look at the nonconference schedule and the number of quality wins,
you know, that's what the committee will do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Mike Boynton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34243)

### [Mitchell Solomon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34845)

### [Kendall Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34846)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Oklahoma State - 71, Oklahoma - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Cowboys of Oklahoma State, Coach Mike
Boynton and his two student-athletes, Kendall Smith and Mitchell Solomon.
Coach, we will call on you for an opening statement. Congratulations.  
  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thank you. Thank you all for being here. I'm really proud of
obviously the way our guys competed.  
  
We tried to make a conscious effort to be the hardest playing team for forty
minutes today, and I feel like we accomplished that. I think it shows up most
notably on the stat sheet on the rebounding. Proud of these guys. They fought
a lot of noise all season and for us to be playing as well as we are this time
of year shows their character and not just good kids, we got a good team.  
  
Q. Kendall, you played in conference tournaments before but nothing like
this. Talk about what it was like to sit down twice, once with four fouls and
once fouling out, how frustrating that had to be for you?  
KENDALL SMITH: Definitely. They put on a phenomenal event, and in terms of
fouls I wanted to play. But the main thing for me is to remain a great
teammate. That's one thing Coach Mike told me. After my fifth foul, he said be
a great teammate and those things mean more to me than sometimes being on the
court.  
  
Q. Mitchell, you guys had pretty good control of the game and they get
hot from outside, go on a 14-2 run, they have a fast break from Trae Young to
Brady Manek, and it ended their run. It speaks to what the coach was talking
about, the hardest playing team, the effort that you put into that one play
that turned the game around. Can you describe what you saw and how that
changed the game?  
MITCHELL SOLOMON: It's not necessarily one guy. If I don't have a team to help
me then I can't do what I do. But that particular play, I mean, they had a
fast break. So I knew I had to, like, put a stop to it. I know Trae likes to
throw lobs, so bated, jabbed, played fundamental 2-on-1 defense and was able
to get a hand on it and found Kendall down court.  
  
Q. For any of you, you were successful with Trae driving to the hoop
today. I just wondered if there was any different defensive mindset going in
or anything tactically that you did differently than you did that first game
because you got him frustrated and fairly ineffective.  
MITCHELL SOLOMON: We just try to play as hard as we can. There are different
scheming things that we can do, but as long as we're playing hard together and
playing well on the defensive end we're capable of doing anything.  
  
Q. Mike, anything tactically?  
MIKE BOYNTON: With a guy like that he's a tremendous player and will continue
to have a great basketball career. You try to make him as inefficient as
possible and I think we accomplished that. It was a team effort like Mitchell
said defensively, had a lot of bodies that he was running into in there and
tried to make him see traffic as much as possible.  
  
Q. Kendall, how were you so physical on Trae without sending him to the
free throw line because that's something a lot of players have struggled with
this year?  
KENDALL SMITH: Just tried to stay fundamentally sound on defense. But when I
have four other guys that are competing their butts off just as hard as I am,
it makes it a lot easier. It was a full-team effort and we sent different
looks at them and stuck to our fundamentals defensively.  
  
Q. Kendall, this season didn't look so great at one point in the year.
You guys have turned it around. What do you point to?  
KENDALL SMITH: I think it's a credit to the 14 guys that we have in the locker
room. We've got guys that every day we're pulling for each other and we push
each other. We got a phenomenal coaching staff that believes in us, so when
you got good people surrounding you, no matter the ups and downs that you go
through, as long as you stay true to our values we will be fine and we knew
that.  
  
Q. Mitchell, what did you think for Cam's performance? He seemed to be a
spark for you guys emotionally when you really needed it?  
MITCHELL SOLOMON: Cam played great today. He is always a little guy kind of
like me. He prides himself on playing hard and getting the loose balls,
getting rebounds when we need him. He was definitely a spark and important to
our team's success today.  
  
Q. Kendall, how important was it for you guys to get back in transition
defense?  
KENDALL SMITH: Extremely important. That's one thing that Coach Mike preached.
Told us it was going to be a game about transition defense, so our last couple
days in practice we really worked on that and I think guys are really locked
in. We really wanted to win tonight. Came in with the right mindset and the
right attitude.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, what level of desperation did you feel like having to win this
game tonight meant?  
MIKE BOYNTON: None. I don't operate that way and for people who have been
around me, you know, I just control the things I can control. The only thing I
was worried about for the last three days since we played on Saturday was
getting my team ready to play today.  
  
I know that if I can get those guys focused on a few things and they can come
out and play hard and execute, we can win. You don't have to be desperate when
you have success, you win and you let the rest of it tell its own story.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to beat a team three times in one season especially
a team like Kansas. What are your thoughts knowing they're up next with one
day?  
MIKE BOYNTON: I don't know. I don't buy into that either. What would make it
harder to beat somebody three times versus one? They're a really good team to
beat, ever! So tomorrow's game will have no bearing on what the other two
games were like. Between now and I guess about eighteen hours from now we've
got to refresh our bodies and our minds and come out and try to be the
hardest-playing team. It's who we are. It won't come into our minds third time
around versus the first.  
  
Q. Mike, do you feel like you guys have done enough to be an NCAA
tournament team now?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Yeah, I've said this since opening of the season, I think --
I've been with these guys since June, I've watched them work and grow and
develop and become a better team over the course of the season. We've
obviously played our best basketball in the last two and a half weeks. Not
that that she had mean more than the rest of the season, but I don't feel like
we played poorly at any point in the year.  
  
Obviously we have some losses, but they're all to teams that are by
everybody's estimation going to be in the field. Got a lot of high-quality
wins on the road away from home, and we play in the toughest league in America
and now we have nine wins against that competition. We'll see.  
  
Q. I wanted I wanted to follow up on, you said you haven't been worried
about the NCAA tournament or getting that message across to those guys or
qualifying, you've been worrying about that one game. What's the motivation,
because it's March? We're in the tournament time. You've been here as an
assistant coach and as a player. We're tournament time now, how do you get
guys motivated if it's not hey we have to win to get to the tournament?  
MIKE BOYNTON: I don't know if you have to have a mindset of getting to the
tournament to come out and play hard. We have to be who we are every day. We
came here to win the big tournament and we'll worry about whatever is next
week when next week comes. I know that we can only win the tournament if we
won today. We couldn't win the tournament today. We had to beat Oklahoma today
and now we've got to change our mind from Oklahoma and the team with
tremendously dynamic point guard who dominates the ball a lot to a team that
has a lot of different weapons and we have to figure out how to combat that
somehow.  
  
Q. It's not ideal to have your point guard foul out, but is it nice that
he did play limited minutes with the more games on the horizon?  
MIKE BOYNTON: I don't know. I wasn't worried about it, I may have sat him too
long to be honest and he got stiff and couldn't move as well on that defensive
play, because he was telling me for about 3 minutes that he could play with 4
and he lasted about 8 seconds out there.  
  
Those things happen. I have great confidence in Brandon Averette to come in
and in a different way have an affect on our team and have success out there.  
  
Q. Talk about the absence of Azubuike in tomorrow's game?  
MIKE BOYNTON: I don't know what you're talking.  
  
Q. He was ruled out with a strain of his left MCL?  
MIKE BOYNTON: News to me. I don't know when that was announced or determined,
but I guess I will need to think about that. Obviously changes their team.
He's a big factor in there for them, but those guys have a lot of really good
players. The thing they do best is shoot the 3-point shot and he doesn't make
any. Obviously we have a different approach it if we don't have to worry about
doubling a guy like that in the post, but you have to contend probably now
with a fifth guy in there who can shoot threes.  
  
Q. Mike, when you took Kendall out with his fourth foul, you guys -- I
don't know how long he sat, 3, 4 minutes, 16-point lead went down to 6. When
he fouled out you didn't evaporate like that. You extended the lead. What was
different when Brandon came in for the second stretch?  
MIKE BOYNTON: The thing that we got away from in the second half and early on
and midway through was our defense took a step back, we didn't have the same
level of intensity and they got some good looks from 3 and you can't do that.
Brady Manek got one on the right side, and McGusty may have gotten one on the
left side and we needed to refocus our defense in order to be able to close
out the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we will see you tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Weber, welcome. Your opening thoughts?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Morning, everybody. Obviously this is a time where all coaches
are excited. We're about halfway through our practices, get third days of
practice and I think we're at number 17 and the guys are anxiously awaiting
getting into games.  
  
I know we've seen the exhibition games started, scrimmages started, but as a
coach this is an important time of the year and you're building your
foundation of your team which I think is going to last through the season.  
  
You're always excited at this time, but for us probably a little more fun for
us because we have a lot of veterans back. We have some experienced seniors in
Barry Brown, Dean Wade and Kamau Stokes who have started since their freshmen
year, you have the experience factor and the leadership of shows guys,
probably as good of leaders as I've ever coached and they're all good workers,
which helps us. Then we have, I don't know, what -- basically the whole team
back and many of them started on a team that went to the Elite Eight.  
  
It's exciting, but every team is different. We're going through the learning
process, figuring out, you know, each role and who the other guys are going to
be. We will see what happens, but it's a fun time of the year and we're
excited, looking forward to hopefully an exciting season for K-State
basketball.  
  
Q. Bruce, the Big 12 announced the scheduling agreement that's going to
start with the Big East next season. What do you think about that? I guess the
Big 12 is going to have both the SEC Challenge and this and I know you have
had trouble with non-conference scheduling. Can you wrap all that up in some
comments?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think it's great for the league. When Jeff Jackson came on and
John Underwood left the league, retired, we're going to miss John, but that's
one of the things that Jeff asked, what do you need help with and scheduling
was one of the definite things, especially with the bigger leagues, the mega
leagues going to 20 games, which means, you know, RPI is kind of going out.
But you're still going to have some type of scheduling mechanism and strength
of schedule will be there.  
  
We can't expand. We already play everyone twice which the other leagues don't
do which makes it tough for us and we have to find another vehicle to get a
tough game. Get the SEC game, you hope you have a home game one year and have
the Big East game on the road and it rotates the next year. We will see if
that works out. It gets us to 20 games and gives us an opportunity to match
what the mega leagues are doing with the 20-game schedule. I know our
scheduling is hard. Fans want teams to come to Manhattan. It's not easy for us
to do.  
  
This will definitely help us get a positive home game into non-conference for
our fans and for our team.  
  
Q. Multiple schools in this league have been connected to the FBI
investigation and trial in New York and I'm curious if you have any concerns
about a level playing field in this league as a result?  
BRUCE WEBER: I'm not sure about just the league. It's nationwide. Obviously
there have been some issues and I guess for me it's sad for the business. At
the same time, it's like anything else, if there is a problem, hopefully we
can get it fixed. Our game is special. I've been involved in it forty years.
It's been my life, and I'm proud to be involved with it. I can't worry about
what other people do. I just worry about what we do. We try to do it right and
I think we got good players. We've got good kids. So we've got an opportunity
to be successful and that's what we're really focused on.  
  
At the same time, the game is important to me and I want things corrected if
it can be and hopefully it will be in the future.  
  
Q. With the ups and downs of your time in Manhattan, Bruce, right now
seems like your popularity is at an all-time high with the fan base. What's it
like to see that change so rapidly in the way that it has?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't worry about it as much as you guys do, probably. I just
worry about our kids and being prepared and ready to play. There is always
people that don't like you. Judd told me many times when you get a job 99% of
the people like you and 10% don't and each year it's going to go down and it's
going to get tougher and tougher. I always think of Judd when you have
negative things happen. As a coach if you worry about every negative fan and
every media person you're not going to be able to coach.  
  
I just worry about coaching. Everybody says how do you deal with it. Very
rarely does somebody come up to me in the grocery store and say, God, you suck
as a coach. No one does! Those people are the faceless opinion guys that, you
know, continually say stuff but they don't ever do it to somebody's face.  
  
I've thought it's always been positive for me at Manhattan. We've got great
fans. Obviously they're excited about our team. We've got an older group that
made a nice run. It's always fun when people like you. It's human nature. But
at the same time I just worry about helping the players do their best.  
  
Q. Bruce, when you had your Media Day in Manhattan a few weeks back you
made a comment about how you were surprised that Kansas State wasn't getting
more preseason respect, but now that you see you're second in the poll here in
the conference and 12 overall does your opinion change?  
BRUCE WEBER: It doesn't matter. At the same time I kind of laugh. My whole
point then was we have everyone back and we went to the Elite Eight and we
went to the Elite Eight without supposedly the preseason Player of the Year in
the Big 12.  
  
Why shouldn't we be in the top-10 or whatever? It is what it is and we can't
worry about it. We've got to worry about our play and getting ready for our
opening game.  
  
We've got good players. Just a little disappointed. Dean was, if you think
about it, he was the only underclassman on the First Team All-Big 12 last year
and Barry was second team. So two underclassman in an unbelievable league,
probably the toughest league I've been a part of. To me I don't think they've
gotten as much national recognition as they should because they're two of the
best underclassmen in the best league in the country. So why aren't you
getting that publicity?  
  
I don't think they care. They're just driven to be good players and that's
important for me, how hard they work and how they're getting our team ready.  
  
Q. You mentioned Dean Wade obviously preseason Player of the Year. Can
you describe for me what Dean has meant to this program and what his legacy
could be by the time he leaves Kansas State?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think the legacy will be if we have a successful season. That's
anything. People remember if you win. Obviously he wasn't part of the Elite
Eight run which I feel horrible about, and I think it was a driving force for
him coming back and if there was indecision of putting his name in last year
with the injury that he wanted to be part of that.  
  
But I appreciate his development and you watched him freshman year, he had
some nice moments but he had a lot of tough moments and fans were on him. Each
year he's gotten better. His confidence last year in the Big 12 I thought was
at an all-time high. I laugh, Bomba, when they interviewed him at the combine,
they asked him who was the toughest player you played against and he said Dean
Wade, and you ask coaches who was the toughest player to defend is and they
say Dean Wade. He's a tough player, but he's also a great human being. Just a
good representative of K-State so you're proud of him in a lot of ways. Barry,
Dean and Kam have a chance to leave a nice legacy. What they did for our
program. We had to throw them into the fire as freshmen and they took their
lumps and we have a chance now to be hopefully one of the top teams in the
country.  
  
Q. You talked about Dean Wade a little bit and the national recognition,
but when you see a player like him be named the Preseason Big 12 Player of the
Year and not get a single vote for the AP for being an All-American, how does
that make you feel as a coach?  
BRUCE WEBER: That goes back to the question. Somebody is not watching or
paying attention but I think a little bit of it is he didn't get to be part of
that run so people nationally didn't get to see him. It bothered me a little
bit. I'm sure it doesn't bother Dean at all because I don't think he pays
attention to that. But I guess going back to the previous question, that was
my question. I'm not sure how can that be?  
  
But all he can do is have great senior year. That's the most important thing,
same with Barry and Kam. They just want our team to be successful. They lived
through run last year and saw how much fun it was and how much exposure you
got and I know they want to have a nice season and leave a nice legacy for
K-State basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the University of Texas coach, Shaka
Smart. Coach?  
  
SHAKA SMART: Great to be here in Kansas City, excited about having Matt
Coleman, Dylan Osetkowski and Kerwin Roach here on his birthday with me. It's
always great to have some experienced players to come with you to Media Day.
Excited about those guys. Our guys have worked extremely hard in practice. We
have not scrimmaged against anyone else yet so we're looking forward to doing
that soon, getting to test ourselves against somebody in a different uniform.  
  
For us, this month, it's been about consolidating good habits and trying to
gain consistency and doing things that go into winning, whether it's on
offense or defense. We have five new guys that when they first started
practice knew nothing about college basketball and are slowly but surely
learning. They've got a long way to go.  
  
Thankfully we've got guys that have been around in the Big 12 for a while and
can teach them the ropes. I like our blends of returning guys and new guys and
our job now is to put them together and go win a lot of games.  
  
Q. Shaka, obviously Andrew Jones has been one of the better stories in
college basketball, his comeback. What's it been like to watch his progress
and with the toe injury what are the realistic chances that we might see him
back on the court this season?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, first of all, his progress is as you mentioned, one of the
best things that's happened in recent memory. He's come so far from early
January when he was first diagnosed and he had to immediately go to the
hospital and it seemed like just a matter of days and he was losing weight,
had to get on treatment right away. His attitude throughout has been
phenomenal. He's a fighter. He's got a great level of toughness about him.
He's been through a lot of challenging days, challenging times as has his
family and they're as strong as anyone I've been around.  
  
He fought his way all the way back to coming back to being a full-time student
at the University of Texas and being a student-athlete who has been competing
with our guys in workouts and practices and lifting weights. As you mentioned
a few weeks ago he broke his toe which was a temporary setback. Thankfully
it's not something that will have him out for too long. We're hopeful by the
end of the week that he will be back on the court being able to play and do
some things in practice. Probably won't be able to go fully live by the end of
the week but hopefully very soon.  
  
In terms of him playing this year, our number one goal all along has been to
help him get back to full strength. We knew that was going to take time. He
literally got done with his treatment in the summer in late August and then a
week later enrolled as a full-time student-athlete. It's only been a couple of
months, really, since he's been back in school and has been training full-time
with us.  
  
But he's done a really good job. He's gained a lot of strength back and gained
some of his explosiveness back. He'll be the first to tell you he's not all
the way where he was physically as a player yet, but the guy's work ethic is
phenomenal and I certainly wouldn't put it past him to be able to work his way
back to where he was as a player. So we're just going to see what makes the
most sense for him and for our team.  
  
Obviously when we go out there for games at all times with all of our players
we want to put them and our team in a position to be successful but overall
we're just super excited to have him back.  
  
Q. With Dylan Osetkowski, he stepped up for your squad offensively and
defensively this last season. What have you seen as far as his development
this off-season and what are you looking from him for an on-court leader this
season?  
SHAKA SMART: The biggest thing with Dylan as opposed to last year is he has a
year under his belt playing at Texas and playing in the Big 12. I think that's
incredibly valuable for someone that was last year really feeling his way
around as someone who sat out the year before and who transferred from Tulane
previous to that. He's done a terrific job in the off-season on his game and
his body. He's been diligent about his diet and his exercise. All of our guys
don't necessarily have the exact same regimen. He's on a very, very different
approach in terms of strength and conditioning compared to other guys. For
instance, he was up at 6:30 this morning on the bike in the hotel just getting
his workout in to make sure his training load is where it needs to be. He's
been very mature about that. The good thing for him is that he's been through
it before. He's made a lot of progress. He knows some of the twists and turns
that are coming and I think he can be a terrific leader first and foremost by
example, and secondly vocally with his teammates because the guys really,
really respect him.  
  
Q. The preseason poll, Kansas number one, K-State two, you guys tied for
fourth. Anything about that surprises you?  
SHAKA SMART: No. Did you want me to elaborate on that?  
  
Q. Just the fact that Kansas again number 1 and K-State up to number two
and you guys tied for fourth.  
SHAKA SMART: K-State went to the Elite Eight last year and had a terrific team
and has almost everybody back so it makes a lot of sense. I think in a lot of
conferences they might get picked first, but Kansas has won the Big 12 so many
years in a row that it sure makes sense to pick them. Plus, when you look at
who they have back and who they recruited, a lot of people are picking them
number 1 in the country let alone the Big 12.  
  
As for the rest of the league I think there's a ton of great teams in our
conference; it's not much different than previous years. The one thing about
the Big 12 that's different is every program has had a lot of success at
different times, even in the last three years. Every team has been in the NCAA
tournament, every team other than Kansas and West Virginia has not been in the
NCAA tournament at least once in the last three years. So there is a lot of
parity and a lot of people that beat up on each other in our conference. That
preseason poll. I know it's a big deal right now but it doesn't matter. Once
the games start because it's going to be decided on the court.  
  
Q. They announced today they are extending the Big 12 Tournament here in
Kansas City until 2024. What do you think about that? Do you like that?  
SHAKA SMART: I think it's a great location for the Big 12 with all things
considered, when you factor in the venue, the way that the folks in Kansas
City embrace this conference tournament, the professionalism with which this
tournament is treated. Obviously, you have some very, very passionate fan
bases that are tremendously actively close so that impacts attendance. So I
think when you factor all those things in, it makes a lot of sense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to have a special presentation by Men's Basketball
Officials Coordinator, Curtis Shaw. He will explain the new rules and take
questions from the floor. Curtis?  
  
CURTIS SHAW: Great, thank you. It's always nice to take a few minutes and talk
about the focus of the coming season. The directions come from the Men's
Basketball Rules Committee as well as the NCAA bosses, so I want y'all to
understand them. There are a few strange things this year. There are two words
that really came up in the Rules Committee this year. They want deception and
danger taken out of the game, so they have designed some rules and
interpretations to try to help with player safety and to keep players from
trying to learn to do the deceptive plays.  
  
Coaches talk about how great and hard of a league it is, from a refereeing
standpoint, but our staff is the best in the country, 8 of the 10 guys that
work the Final Four all work games in the Big 12. I think that is exemplary of
what we do in the league, in that it is very difficult to referee. Let's get
started on what we are looking at. We've got clips that will help us out. One
of the main focuses is on screens, seems like all our offenses are on high-
ball screens, pick and rolls, etc... So we have had to focus on making screens
legal. We've put in the rules where the defense can't touch, get physical, so
we can't allow the offense to do illegal plays on top of that. Here are some
examples of screens that we are focused on and here are the type of plays that
we want out of the game and when y'all are doing media work, you can say
that's a point of emphasis. We gotta get this cleaned up. The first one is
pretty easy, guy uses his butt and sets a back screen, picks the guy off,
leaves a wide-open 3 pointer. We're focused on moving screens, in order to set
a legal screen you must be stationery. You don't necessarily have to face him
but you have to be stationery. You then can't use an "unnatural" movement such
as sticking your butt out to have a screen. Okay?  
  
Another example play that’s coming in, kids running up the baseline going up
court big guy with the elbow setting a screen. Another play we have to be
stationery on because it leads to a wide open 3-point shot. So major focus is
to get legal plays on screens. A real point of emphasis this year is the wide
screen.  
  
By rule you can set a screen with the inside of your foot even with the
outside of your shoulders, like I'm standing now. When you get wide like this
kid does you're now illegal. Even if the defender runs into your chest and
doesn't hit the extended wide foot you're considered to be in an illegal
position and are employing to get called for an illegal screen. As I talk to
our teams and coaches I stress to the players to get a strong base, but you
can't get outside your framework.  
  
The dribble hand-off is a huge part of our game. We did a good job with it
last year. A guideline that we are now teaching with and what I've told our
coaches and players is once you hand the ball off you're considered a
screener; therefore, you must either come to a stop or totally avoid the
defensive player on your own. You don't become a cutter until, as a guideline,
now. It's not written in the rule book this way, but as a guideline until
you've taken three full steps after handing it off. Now you're considered a
cutter. Then if you run into people it may be chucking the cutter. It may be
incidental. But before that point you cannot run into a cutter who is going
over or under trying to chase the ball handler.  
  
Here is a great example of the pick and roll. We have questions all the time.
You will hear the TV announcer saying “I don't understand, he's just rolling
down the lane”, but in this example, he goes to set a screen. However, the
defensive player never makes contact with the screener. He stops to go
underneath the screen before any contact. So in this case, the kid who is
trying to set a screen becomes a roller and it's a moving screen. Right now
the defender goes under, he rolls down the lane line and picks him off. That's
an illegal screen.  
  
The next play will help show us the difference on why it's now legal to roll.
In this case the guy sets a screen, the defender actually runs into him. Once
he runs into him, the screening part is over, he now becomes a cutter. So he
now can make contact, roll down the lane line. If he picks him off, he's not
illegal. So the guideline we tell referees, and again what I tell our coaches
and players, is a lot of times it's the ball handler's fault. He doesn't let
the screener do his job, but in order to have a screen and roll there has to
be contact with the screener and then he can roll and pick him off. If there
is no contact he can't roll and pick him off.  
  
Here is an example of what we talked about after a pass or a hand-off in
taking the steps. In this example, the kid throws the pass. He then takes
three full steps down the lane line, the defensive player in red cuts in front
of him. Now he's no longer a ball handler, he's a cutter and this should have
been called an illegal screen on the team in red because he slides over and
impedes his ability to cut. Again, using that three-step guideline he became a
cutter.  
  
Here is an example where he becomes a cutter. However, he then changes
direction back into the defensive player. So right here he passes it off three
steps, but then he plants that left foot and hops to the right, so he's now
made himself a screener again.  
  
I wanted to show these two different plays to show how complex it is and
referees have to make this judgment in fast motion. We're pretty good in slow-
motion film, but he has to decide, does he make a legitimate cut or plant and
move into the pass of the defender who is trying to go over which leads to a
wide open 3-point shot?  
  
The other part of it is that we had coaches that were starting to teach that
if you see a screener coming to set a screen, speed up and run through him. He
will get an illegal screen because he never got there and got set. As I said
before, one of the key words for the Rules Committee was danger. This is
considered a dangerous play. So we've now put in a new rule where if a guy
sets an illegal screen in which he is clearly still moving on this play but
you can see the defender speeds up and blow him up, we say. In a case like
this we are going to have a double foul. It's not only a foul for an illegal
screen, it's also a foul on the kid in black for excessively contacting the
screener.  
  
This could even be a flagrant one foul if you consider the contact to be
extreme. All right? So coaches, if you're going to run an illegal screen don't
try to be the tough guy and blow him up.  
  
Probably the most controversial thing you're going to see all year are these
plays, the hook and hold. Most of this came down because of what happened to
the kid from Purdue in the NCAA tournament. They put in a severe penalty. In
this case, 10 white comes from behind, he hooks the guy underneath and then he
wants to act like he's the one who got hooked. That's the deception part they
want out of the game. In this case, because of the way he hooked him, this is
a flagrant foul. This is not just a common foul. This is a flagrant one foul
due to the fact that he's trying to deceive by initiating the hook, okay?  
  
There are times on rebounds you may both go up and your arms get hooked
together and as long as you untangle you're fine, but in a play like this
where he seeks out, hooks under and then acts like he got held, we now have to
have a flagrant one foul.  
  
This is the play that we all saw all year long, big kid from Purdue, comes
down, kid in front hooks him, throws him backwards, he ends up shattering his
elbow, he's out of the NCAA tournament and the Rules Committee felt this had
to be addressed. In a case where you hook a kid and put him in a dangerous
situation by throwing him backwards, pulling him down, whatever, it's now a
flagrant two foul. You're automatically ejected from the basketball dame.
Severe? Absolutely. But this is big in the NBA. They want them to learn how to
hook, hold and fake. Our Rules Committee does not want this to occur. We're
going to put in a severe rule that hopefully stops that.  
  
Here is another example where a kid hooks and holds. You can see the kid in
black. He gets beat, grabs him by the arm and pulls him down. Even though he
didn't go all the way to the floor, because he put him in a potentially
dangerous situation where he could have face planted, this is a flagrant two
foul. He will be ejected for this. They want it out of the game. So as media,
you're watching the game, you see this and say “I don't understand why he got
thrown out, he didn't fall down?”, the risk of serious danger is why they
stopped that.  
  
That's what we've got to focus on for this year. That's an example of the
controversy that's going to occur on the hook and hold plays. Because of the
hook and the hold play, they also put in a rule about protective equipment.
We've always had it as if it was deemed to be dangerous, they can't wear it.
Our rule book says it's the referee's decision only and the NCAA and their
medical staff said if you put a half inch of rebounding foam on stuff, he
could possibly play. However, if the referee deems that the cast under there
is still too hard, it could hit a guy in the head and cause a concussion
protocol, it might have a piece of metal on there, it's solely the referee's
decision whether the kid can play or not. The team doctor or trainer can't say
it's okay, because if a kid gets hurt it's solely on the referee. So you might
see a kid come in on Tuesday and play and on Saturday he can't play. It's a
bad rule, it's bad that the medical staff doesn't make the decision, the
referee is liable, but it is what it is. So if we have injured players that
try to play and all of the sudden they can't play one night and you have
questions, that's the reason. Any questions I can help with?  
  
Q. It is my understanding that the NCAA they see that and they do not
want that a part of the game? Even though the NBA believes it helps spacing
and game flow and all that?  
CURTIS SHAW: You've got to remember the NBA is different than college
basketball. They play 82 games and they're trying to sell 15,000 tickets at
$100 apiece. They're a business. Their rules and interpretations may differ
from our, where we have student-athletes that we're trying to prevent danger
and injury. So our Rules Committee wants our rules to address that. We do not
want deception or that type of showmanship or that potential risk for danger.
So we do have different interpretations based on the difference in games.  
  
Thanks, everybody. We look forward to a great season.

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome coach Bill Self from Kansas. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BILL SELF: I know you guys want to talk basketball with me, but before we can
get to that I just want to let you know that due to the trial in New York
being ongoing, I will refrain from any comment that is directly related to the
trial, due to the fact that there has been a mandate given to me and certainly
I will honor that. I will say in relationship to that, though, at 9:30,
approximately, this morning, we issued a press release saying that we would
hold Silvio De Sousa from competition based on recent developments within the
trial in the last couple of weeks and we will wait for an eligibility review
to be done jointly by our university and the NCAA, and the timetable on that
is unknown due to obviously the ongoing trial and also when all parties can
actually complete that review.  
  
So with that being said, I would be open to talk about our season. I know that
I'm very excited obviously to get a chance to coach a bunch of talented guys
that are pretty well thought of at least from a preseason expectation
standpoint and probably deservedly so. We've got a lot more depth than what
we've had in the past few years, certainly we're much bigger, and we have some
talented guards that are still freshmen. But they are talented and certainly
with the three guys sitting out last year, I think that can kinda help fill
the void of our lack of experience in the backcourt.  
  
It's going to be an exciting year for our basketball team and our program, and
certainly one that we're very much looking forward to playing and competing
in, in what will once again be as good of a league as we have in college
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, regarding Silvio, is this something to do that came out in the
trial, the possible professional Spanish contract or is this an NCAA thing
with money that was spent? Can you tell us either way?  
BILL SELF: I'm not going to go into details, but Silvio was declared eligible
last year by the NCAA. So that should answer your question right there. So
this was from recent developments that took place within the trial.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how you were honored to be the number 1
again, but K-State is right there. Do you like the way 1-2 is for the state of
Kansas in that preseason poll although it means nothing by the end of the
year?  
BILL SELF: You're right, it means nothing. But I do think it speaks to the
level of play that our state has, not only within our league, but nationally.
And you could throw Wichita State in recent years when they have been picked
so high in their respective league and had such great teams, but I think we
have a chance to be pretty good. I know K-State has a chance to be very good,
having had an opportunity to coach against those guys three times last year
and certainly seeing their players develop within their program and the
experience that they possess. I certainly can't see a reason why they're not
only a Big 12 contender, they're a national contender, also.  
  
Q. I know what your answer is going to be but I have to ask it anyway.
They extended the tournament here in Kansas City to 2024, it was announced
today. Other teams talk about how it's a great tournament, but there are sure
a lot of fans for one team. Your thoughts on keeping it here in town and the
women joining in?  
BILL SELF: I don't know all the details about anything other than what you
just said about extending the contract through '24. The only thing I can say
is it's my favorite neutral court that we've ever played on. So naturally
K-State and ourselves can benefit from the crowd base because obviously more
local, but props to Kansas City. They have made this event very important and
part of the fabric of what Kansas City is doing through the sports commission
and it is an important part of Kansas City and the things that go on within
it. I think that Kansas City deserves a pat on the back for how important and
how much they put into the tournament and getting it back again.  
  
Q. Can you just tell us a little bit about how Dedric has developed in
his year under you without playing and heading into his first real season at
Kansas?  
BILL SELF: I didn't see him play a lot in high school. He was a highly-
recruited youngster, but I didn't see him play a lot. I saw him play some in
his two years at Memphis. I talked to other coaches in the league about him,
and that was the fact that they thought he was a ridiculously high IQ and
skilled big guy and that the game was kind of in slow motion to him. After
coaching him now for a little over a year, that is an accurate assessment.
He's gotten better. His body has improved. He's actually more athletic, but
the thing that separates him from most is his ability to see the game
differently than the way most people see it. He doesn't see one pass ahead, he
sees two. He is the best passer we've had since I've been the coach at Kansas,
so I'm really excited about that and I think that bodes well for the
combination of him and Udoka together, because Udoka is going to play closer
to the basket when he's in the game and Dedric can be as good as anybody we've
had getting the ball to him, also.  
  
Q. I'm curious about your thoughts as Dean Wade as a recruit and if you
ever envisioned him getting to this level?  
BILL SELF: You know, that's a good question. We obviously knew of Dean. His
high school coach works our basketball camp two weeks every summer for the
last 20 years and certainly every year since I've been at KU. We knew he was
well drilled and certainly a talent and I wouldn't say that his success and
his progress has surprised me at all. I would say that when you have a guy
that is that size, that explosive, and can shoot, that tells me he's got a
chance, but obviously through development and they've done a great job with
him, through development and through the opportunities that he's had. He's one
of the premiere players, not just in our league, he's one of the premiere
players in the country.  
  
Q. Going off of Jackson's point about Dedric Lawson's progression over
the last year under you, it's been widely discussed that it's a fresh look to
the roster so far this year, but do you think that it's almost undervalued how
the Lawsons and Charlie Moore were able to spend that year with you and while
it's a fresh look they have been around the locker room?  
BILL SELF: That's an advantage to take transfers and have them sit out a year.
You knew you would have big turnover because now we're playing with
experienced guys instead of freshmen that we would have recruited for those
spots, which are sophomores by now. They're still young, and certainly
Charlie, even though he played one year at Cal, he's still young. KJ and
Dedric a little older, but I think the reason for the optimism within our
program as much as anything else is because of the unknown of the three guys
that are sitting out. They're nice players. They're going to be good players,
all those things, but we're still a long ways away from being a team that can
play to its ranking, trust me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck this season. Thanks.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Iowa State Coach, Steve Prohm. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thank for having me. Great to be here. Already really ready to
get started on the new year, excited for where our guys are at, Media Day
means the season is right around the corner with scrimmages and exhibitions
and obviously our first game in a couple weeks. I think we have made a lot of
strides in the things we had to do to get better to put ourselves back on the
map to get back to the NCAA tournament. I think we have worked on building our
team with our chemistry, our depth, sharing the basketball and decision
making. Very pleased with where we are right now. Long way to go, but I'm
excited about the opportunities that this team presents.  
  
Q. Cameron Lard is obviously a guy a lot of people are wondering about.
What's his status and how prepared is he to play mentally and physically?  
STEVE PROHM: You know, Cameron is a separate situation. But in regards to
Cameron, it's been public. My first and foremost as a head coach is to invest
in these kids to get them better, socially, spiritually, academically and
athletically. That's my mission as a coach. Cameron has got some situations
that he's got to get better in, with his daily habits and in a lot of areas.  
  
The one thing I'm happy about is he's made a lot of strides from the day he
got on campus to where he's at right now. But like he knows and I know, there
will be some disciplinary measures that I've got to hand down once our season
starts and at that time, you know, I'll talk about that further. Right now
he's making good strides, but he's got a little ways to go.  
  
Q. You're familiar with Dean Wade Preseason Player of the Year for the
Big 12. I'm doing a story on him and I was curious about the strides that I've
been able to see him make in his career and the growth that he made last
year?  
STEVE PROHM: I've seen him for really this is my fourth year, it will be his
senior year and you can go back and watching him go against Niang as a
freshman when he was an upperclassman as a senior and the strides he's made in
his leadership role and his skill level. He's a tough, tough match up for us
and he probably would have played at the next level this year. He could
probably answer that better than me. He brings skill, versatility. You've got
to decide how you want to pick and roll and how you want to guard him in the
spot. He's one of the guys at the 4 spot or the 5. Wherever they play him,
that's had a lot of success over the last several years. It's fun to watch
guys when they stay for their senior year. But to see his strides offensively,
he's been terrific and that's why he's the Preseason Player of the Year and
why they're picked second in the league. But they've got more than him as
well, but he's been terrific in his growth.  
  
Q. With Lindell, what was the process when he thought about turning pro
and how do you help him navigate what his best option was?  
STEVE PROHM: This is the first year. I've had a couple of kids in that
situation, in that position, could have left, could have stayed, a couple
stayed, one left. This is the first time going through the process where the
rules had changed to where you could have the paid workouts and be able to
come back to school.  
  
It's a little different navigating that. He's got an unbelievable support
system back home. His father was great through the process. Lindell was great.
I think the best thing that that process taught all of us, I think we got
closer. Though you go through some bumps along the process, throughout the
spring and summer, I think right now our relationship is as good as it's ever
been. I think he understands, hey, here is the three things you've got to get
better in: decision making, can you make others better and can you defend
multiple positions? If you can do that, sky is the limit for you. Once we have
a great season this year and then play for Iowa State. That's my message to
him. Scouts have been there. We have had several scouts there already, and I
think everybody noticed how we are sharing the ball better this year, and he's
not thinking score, score, score. He's taking the best option on the
opportunities, whether that's shot, whether that's a pass. I think he's in a
really good place. I think it was really good for him. What I've learned
through that process is how to deal with the players and their families a
little bit better because nothing is ever perfect. When he came back it was
like, let's start from square one and go from here. It was really great. I'm
really excited about what he can do. Back home somebody asked me who the most
surprising player is right now, and I mentioned Lindell. And it's because he's
doing the things we need him to do and I think it's because he has an
opportunity to have a special year.  
  
Q. Staying with Lindell, he obviously took the league by storm, coming
on as a freshman and impressing a lot of people. As someone who recruited him,
what were your thoughts on his freshman performance? Did it come as a surprise
just how impressive he was?  
STEVE PROHM: I don't know if it came as a surprise, just being honest. You
want to recruit some guys that can come in and impact your program like that
especially with the turnover that we had, losing Morris and Burton and Long
and Thomas and all those guys that we had that year in 2017. There is one stat
only him and Kevin Durant shot 40% from three and averaged over 16 points as
freshmen. So he had a tremendous freshman campaign, but as a team we weren't
good enough and that's been my message to him is let's do that and let's have
a special year as a team and I think he will get the recognition he deserves
because he's made a lot of great strides.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your non-conference schedule?
The Maui Invitational presents an interesting challenge.  
STEVE PROHM: Right away we've got Missouri at home, not skipping over we open
up with Alabama State, but we've got Missouri at home, obviously that's
unfortunate for Porter, what he's going through now, you hate to see that with
any team or any kid, especially a 19, 20 year old kid. But we've got Missouri
at home and Arizona opening up in Maui. It is the first year Chaminade is not
in the tournament so we have Gonzaga and Illinois on our side and the other
side is Duke. San Diego State, Auburn and Xavier. We have Iowa on the road and
Ole Miss on the road and our conference schedule down the road, but our non-
conference is going to test us. It's going to test us early and it's going to
test us often. But there are a lot of opportunities to get resume-building
wins and get us back into the national recognition where we need to be.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We wish you the best of luck for
the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Lon Kruger from Oklahoma. Coach,
welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
LON KRUGER: Thank you, good to be here. As always it's a great time of the
year. Those early weeks of practice probably the most enjoyable time of the
year because everyone is motivated for all the right reasons and not concerned
about playing time, they're not concerned about anything that's been written
or printed. They're concerned about getting better every day in practice and
competing in a very healthy way.  
  
We've got a really good group in that respect. We've got six seniors which is
great. In the college game they've been through a lot of minutes. They know
what lies ahead. They know how tough the challenge is. They're working hard
and to this point, knock on wood, nothing major injury-wise. We have had a few
practices missed with a stiff back or hamstring tug but nothing major at this
point. We played a scrimmage last weekend. We got an exhibition game a week
from tomorrow against Pittsburgh State and then the year is upon us.  
  
Big 12 is of course going to be the best conference in the country, great
balance. Kansas continues to set the bar, Kansas State returns a veteran
group, so it should be another interesting and great conference race. With
that, any questions?  
  
Q. Coach, recently Tex Winter passed away. I wondered if you had
thoughts on the historic K-State coach?  
LON KRUGER: Anyone with affiliation with Kansas State had a tremendous
appreciation of Coach Winter. He represents all that was good in the game. He
was a basketball junky, cared about nothing as it related to basketball but
helping his guys work, get better, addressing details. Just a terrific
individual. Yeah, he lived in Manhattan for the last many years and highly
respected, highly regarded, much appreciated, just a terrific guy.  
  
Q. Coach, it was just announced today the Big 12 Tournament is extended
here in Kansas City through 2024. Do you like that idea? What's your
experience when you come here for the Big 12 Tournament?  
LON KRUGER: It's a great tournament. Obviously there are going to be schools
that have a crowd advantage but I think to pass on what the tournament has
become just for that is -- would not be smart. I think it's great to have it
here. The sponsorships, the crowd, the atmosphere is as good as any conference
tournament in the country so absolutely it's a great place to have it and
happy to hear the news.  
  
Q. Brady Manek obviously was a pretty big piece of your team last season
as a freshman. Did it shock you to see him come on the scene that quick and
what is the biggest challenge for him coming into this year to match or take a
step further on what he did last season as a freshman?  
LON KRUGER: It was a little bit of a surprise. Maybe not much was known or
expected of Brady as a freshman and he really came on and shot the ball with
great confidence. We were on the foreign tour the summer of his freshman year
and we were kind of shocked when we played those games that he stepped up and
made shots and wasn't nervous about it at all.  
  
So that gave us a little bit of a clue as to what he was going to do going
forward and he's gotten 15, 20 pounds heavy since he arrived on campus, and
he's bigger and stronger because of the greater bulk, playing with confidence
and doing a good job. Last year he was thought of as a stand-still shooter,
starting to put the ball on the floor, starting to post-up, always been a good
rebounder, blocked shots more than expected. So he's got a bright future,
great player.  
  
Q. Losing Trey on the dynamic that he had, and you lost Buddy Hield a
few years ago. How do you find players that replicate that or bringing someone
into your program that can take it to the next level like those guys did?  
LON KRUGER: I don't know that you find one player to do that, this group is
going to do it as a group, I don't know that anyone is going to lead in
scoring and assists as Trae did, but this group is motivated and they are
showing they can get good results and these six seniors are hungry to step out
and stay on different roles and that's probably the biggest question about our
group is who assumes what roles and who assumes what minutes and that's going
to be determined by their play and the results they get. We need someone to
step out and provide security and take that position every night and I don't
know that one person is going to do that but we have three or four that
collectively can give us that type of play.  
  
Q. Curious about Dean Wade, Preseason Player of the Year. What kind of
competitor, what kind of talent skill does he have?  
LON KRUGER: Deserving of that preseason expectation. Terrific player. To see
his game progress as it has from his freshman year it's kind of been storybook
really, because each year he's added to his game and Coach does a great job
with player development. He represents the best case scenario, if you would,
just a terrific all-around player, defensively and offensively, he scores in a
lot of different ways, impacts the game in a lot of different ways,
outstanding player, very deserving.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck.

DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we would like to introduce Coach Huggins from West
Virginia. Your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BOB HUGGINS: We gotta get healthy. We're a little beat up right now. When you
take Sagaba Konate out of practice and Bolden out of practice it hurts your
practice considerably and those two guys haven't gone for quite a while so we
just gotta get healthy.  
  
Q. Bob, multiple teams in this league have been connected to this FBI
investigation and allegations associated with that. What's your reaction to
that? What, if any, concerns do you have about a level playing field in this
league and in college basketball as a whole?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, my first thought is, I keep hearing about the state of our
game. The state of our game is really pretty good. If, in fact, which I don't
think has been proven yet any of those things happened. They shouldn't have
happened, but you're talking about, what, four or five schools at the most?
There are 361 Division I schools and I don't know how many Division II and
Division III schools. ESPN would take those numbers, if you have three or four
guys straight off the reservation you wouldn't say ESPN is falling apart. You
would say that people had some problems. With the current state of our game, I
don't think it's ever been better than what it is now.  
  
If it's not the most watched sport in America, I'm not sure what is. I mean,
you guys have six games a night, so I think the state of our game is fine. If
things happened, we all know they shouldn't have happened, but that doesn't
affect the state of our game and the way people go about doing their business.  
  
Q. How impressed have you been with Jamie Dixon and his ability to turn
TCU around in two years?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I knew he would because he was 70 miles up the road from us
for a long time and we played twice a year. Jamie is a heck of a coach. He's a
heck of a coach. His guys play really hard. They play the right way. We have
league meetings and you sit there and there are ten of us in there and this
league is so hard it's never the same ten guys here the next year, because
somebody’s gotta lose. I have no doubt when I'm sitting there looking over at
Jamie. You look at the guys in our league and the coaching in this league, is
incredible. I think Jamie just moves it up another notch, if that's possible.  
  
Q. If your guys get healthy, will your style of play defensively change?
Are you going to press a lot? Have you been able to figure out whether you're
going to be able to do it?  
BOB HUGGINS: We're going to try to do it for not more than forty minutes. I
think we have to. I think that's kind of what we've recruited to do. We have
the best shot blocker in the country, in the back of it, which helps
considerably.  
  
It's a matter of reputation. Our problem has been, I think yesterday was our
18th practice, I believe, that we haven't had a full complement of guys in any
of those 18 practices. That makes it difficult.  
  
You're coaching the guys that are there, obviously, but then you've gotta turn
around and reteach everything again for those guys that weren't there. It
would be like trying to coach you guys. You sit over there and watch, you
don't know what the hell is going on. But you sit over there and watch. It's
kind of like our guys, they sit over there and watch and they don't know
what's going on.  
  
Q. When you sat down with Konate in the off-season, when you picked
apart guys and want them to get better. When you told him that in order to be
great you need to do X or Y, what are the things you told him to really work
on and take his game to the next level?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, what I'm told by all the NBA guys is they need their four
man to be able to switch because they're switching everything now. If you are
going to switch they're going to put you in a ball screen with the guard. So
you have to be able to get the guard in front of you. Nobody is saying you've
got to stop them all the time. Nobody stops anybody all the time in that
league, but you've got to be able to keep them in front of you.  
  
We talked to Sags about being able to do more defensively on the perimeter on
a one-on-one basis. That's the first thing.  
  
I think the other thing is you've got to be able to make open shots. He
doesn't necessarily have to make threes. He can and he's worked hard at it,
but he's got to be a consistent shooter from 17, 18 feet because you've got to
be able to drag your guy away from the basket. You don't have to shoot a three
to be able to drag 'em away from the basket. If you shoot 17, 18-footers,
you're going to drag 'em away from the basket. That's pretty much what I was
told, so I just kind of conveyed that to him.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you're one of the few guys that have coached in both
the Big 12 and the Big East and I wondered about that challenge series coming
up next year, what does that bring to both leagues? Do you have any preference
or place you want to revisit in the Big East?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, the Big East isn't the Big East that we knew. They still
have some people, but it's not the Big East that we once knew. It's fun to go
to New York. I like going to New York and playing and then leave and go home.
I like playing there. Generally speaking, the crowd in the Garden is very
knowledgeable. They're great basketball people, so I enjoy that a lot. For us,
it's good because that's one less time change, that's one less trip. We can
fly to virtually anywhere in the Big East in an hour. So that helps us.  
  
Q. You talk about Konate, what's going on with him in terms of injury
and will it affect him the start of the season?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't think it will affect him at all. We're just being
careful. It would be nice to have him out there so the other guys get used to
him, but we can sit him for another week and he'll be fine. It's just
precautionary.  
  
Q. Coach, Esa Ahmad back for his senior year, how much higher is his
ceiling than what we have seen from him?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think a great deal. When you watch, Esa's not a big jumper.
He's not exceptionally quick or fast but he really knows how to play. His best
games are really when he plays without the ball because he understands how to
use screens. He understands how to take advantage of defensive people breaking
down. He's got those huge, huge hands. So he doesn't fumble balls. He can
rebound the ball out of his area because he's got huge hands.  
  
It's amazing. When Billy Hahn was with me, you ever see the big ball that
Baylor fits through the rim? He bounced one to Esa and he was standing there
holding it with one hand talking to us. That's big hands. His greatest
attribute is knowledge. He really does understand how to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your comments. Good luck this season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Baylor coach, Scott Drew. Coach, welcome
and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
SCOTT DREW: It's been a good first couple of weeks for us. Our SID David Kaye
said, I got good news for you. And I said what is it? He says, we've
researched it and in the Power Five conferences you have the fewest returning
lettermen of anybody and I know you like to win so at least you're winning
that.  
  
We're a younger team. We've been in the last few years able to have veteran
leadership and stay old. This year we're back to teaching. The good news is
when you have this many new guys you see a lot of improvement and other days
you come home and thank goodness for Advil.  
  
As far as returning players we have three returning lettermen, King McClure, a
senior, is somebody that whenever a coach has a senior that loves the school
as much as the staff does, you know you're in good shape. He's been a great
teammate and leader during his time at Baylor and is doing a great job with
the young guys.  
  
We have Tristan Clark who was our second most efficient player in offense in
Big 12 play using KenPom stats, so we need him to progress and continue to
have a great year for us.  
  
Mark Vital is the third returning lettermen and he was 8th in rebound inning
Big 12 play so those are the guys that have to do a good job of leading.  
  
Jake Lindsey is helping us coach right now as he rehabs and he says he would
obviously much rather play because this coaching stuff is harder than he
thought.  
  
As far as Big 12 play, what makes the Big 12 Conference isn't one or two or
three good teams, it's top to bottom and trying to make sure all our younger
guys understand the importance of each and every possession.  
  
Last year in our 18 Big 12 games, 11 of them were in the last five minutes two
possessions or less. So everything they do on the court is important. We play
a challenging non-conference schedule again, previous to last year. We had the
number one strength of schedule for the four years before that, using ESPN's
RPI numbers and this year we challenged ourselves against in the non-
conference as you can see with the teams that we face. Hopefully that will get
us ready for what we will face in Big 12 play. That's all I got!  
  
Q. Scott, roster turnover is nothing new in this sport but for you guys
this year it's out of the norm. Maybe the Readers Digest version of why y'all
are in this predicament and would you be gobbling Advil if you didn't have
Mason?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, the reason we're in this predicament, you had some guys
leave early and some guys transfer and that's common with everybody in college
basketball. With us it hit it more this year than any other year that we've
had.  
  
As far as -- there's always good news, too, and with the grad transfers
bringing in someone like Makai Mason. He scored 31 points and upset us in the
NCAA tournament. We didn't have to explain who he was or what he could do,
they saw it all firsthand. Why we recruited him wasn't just because of our
game, it was because of what he had done that whole year and when he played
SMU-Duke-USC he was efficient in our game. He's somebody who when he is
healthy he is a very good leader and player and he needs to be healthy for us.
Second of all, we need to keep getting that rust off from not playing very
much in the last two years.  
  
As far as with, again, I think every coach would rather be older and more
experienced. The trick nowadays is trying to get to that point and it's a lot
harder than it used to be.  
  
Q. Coach, with the addition of Makai Mason coming on, he has missed the
past two seasons due to injury. What have you seen so far in terms of
rehabbing and what do you expect he can bring to your program this year?  
SCOTT DREW: Makai is one of those guys that when we recruited him the Yale
coaching staff told us he went to a dance and he was on a scooter and he left
the dance early and got 500 shots up. He is a guy who lives in the gym. He
will be rehabbing in and around the gym for four or five hours. The big thing
as a coaching staff is making sure he's not doing too much.  
  
That's tough for us because you love guys that are in the gym and wanting to
get better. He's one of those guys when he's in the gym he's working on his
craft, he's not wasting time. Protecting him and working with our trainers
first and foremost as far as with him practicing, we've limited a lot of reps
that he gets and we've given him extra days off and tried to make sure. We
have given his extra days off. We're careful and smart with that. At the same
time when he's been healthy and fresh, he's been very effective and when you.  
  
As a coach, if you're going to have experience you want it in the backcourt
and him being a fifth year guy and King McClure being a fourth year guy that
does give you experience in the backcourt.  
  
Hopefully we can keep him healthy and when he's been fresh he obviously is
fundamentally sound, makes it easier on the coaching part for us. He knows
what plays to make. At the same time, it's good having a lot of length and
athleticism that you have in Big 12 practices because that allows you to
adjust and get ready for what you're going to face during the year as well.  
  
Q. How is Matthew Mayer come in as a recruit? Has he been adjusting
pretty well to the system? Has he made an impact on your team so far?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, Matt is somebody that can really score. He can get a shot
off, which is a skill in itself. As most freshmen when they come in, the
biggest adjustment as every coach will tell you is making sure they understand
the shot selection and making sure that they understand the importance of the
defensive educational background and every possession from the standpoint. In
high school a lot of guys shot when they wanted and defensively had to not be
too aggressive because they had to stay on the court and couldn't get in foul
trouble. Those are always your bigger adjustments for freshmen, making sure
they fit in with other talented players around them. He's doing that and he's
growing from that.  
  
As far as the defensive end, like all our freshmen, he's improving. As far as
talent level, he's somebody that definitely is going to help us this season
and in the future. He's someone that has NBA talent.  
  
Q. Coach, thanks and good luck for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Jamie Dixon from TCU. Coach your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Thank you. It's great to be here as part of Media Day and what we
think is the best conference in the season and we've proven that.  
  
Excited about the season. We have a relatively young group with five returning
guys that have played a lot of minutes, scored a lot of points and done a lot
of things with those guys. But the other eight are all brand new, haven't
played any college basketball.  
  
It's an interesting make-up of a team. Obviously Jaylen Fisher is not playing
right now, not practicing, but he's starting to do a little bit more going
forward here. So we anticipate him being ready for the start of the season but
obviously not having gone through a lot of practice time with us as far as
five-on-five. Then Lat Mayen who redshirted for us, those are our two guys and
injury situations, you have Kouat and JD Miller, two guys that play the same
position so usually one of them on the floor. So those three guys are the
three guys that have played college basketball for us and the other eight
we're getting them ready. I think it's been a challenge for us, something we
knew was going to be in the cards for us and something we would be working on
and we're trying to take advantage of all 30 practices going forward. We are
at number 19 here now as we get ready for our November 7th game.  
  
As far as looking forward to the conference and the non-conference, excited
about our schedule, excited about the Big 12 SEC Challenge, opportunity to go
play in Diamond Head in that classic. A lot of great things for us ahead, but,
again, I just can't believe that this conference has become what it is so
quickly in basketball, whether it be the ratings on TV, whether it be the
rankings, as far as RPI and the strength of the conference overall. It has far
exceeded everybody's expectations which is a not a great thing for the
coaches, but certainly exciting and challenging for the fans. We're excited to
be a part of the best conference in the country.  
  
Q. Jaylen Fisher, with the multiple injuries he's had, are you all going
to ease him back?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, I was just talking about him. The timing of his injuries
have been interesting because it's not like we've ever had to rush him back to
get back in the middle of a season. He has always had an extended recovery
time, more than what would normally be done. Yes, he's had numerous injuries,
one in high school. Since he's been with us, they've been season-ending
injuries. So it's not like we've had to rush him back for a game in any
situation.  
  
After last year's surgery we had another issue this summer and obviously we
have kept him out a prolonged period of time. In no way has there ever been a
reason why we had to get him back by a certain time. It's always been extended
recovery time and we've just ran into some, well, he's ran into some really
bad luck. That's been unfortunate for him. He goes so hard. If somebody walked
into our practice and we're doing 5-on-5, somebody would say this kid plays
100% and played injury free for the whole year. But I never seen a guy work so
hard as everybody has seen him play so hard during games.  
  
It's been a real challenge, but I'm just amazed at how he's handled it and how
his energy is. Anybody that's had an injury when they're trying to play, it
can be devastating. Physically, as well as mentally, but he's handled his
energy, his enthusiasm, his involvement, camaraderie with the team has been
amazing. Whether you see him on the bench or in practice, so it can wear on a
kid. Somehow he's managed. Again, I can say it can wear on a kid, I don't
think I've seen anything like this, I don't think anybody has, and I think
he's ready for the start of the year and we will look forward to getting him
-- be a little bit of time getting him there as we did last year with game
experience because nothing prepares you for it. But I think he's going to
somehow pull it off again.  
  
Q. Obviously the Big 12 announced the Big East Challenge and you
mentioned the SEC Challenge. How big is that and how excited are you as a
former Big East coach with that alliance?  
JAMIE DIXON: There is a personal factor in there, there is no question.  
  
I think it's tremendous. I like the Big East. I like the challenge with the
SEC first off, I think it's great, I think it's unique. I didn't know quite
how to handle it being in the conference schedule but I think it's been good.
I know it's really what our conference wants. I think the coaches have come
around to seeing the value of it as well and I thought ESPN did a great job
with it as far as making it the big day, the event of that Saturday during
conference play. So I think it's been tremendous.  
  
I think given the situation with the 20 conference games that I think pretty
much every conference is going to go to eventually, I thought the Big East
opportunity was something we needed to look at. I think I joke about it
because I mentioned -- I thought I mentioned that a year ago, two years ago,
really, when I first heard the talks, and I kind of thought it fell on deaf
ears, but it seems like it's gotten -- it's going to be a great thing for us.  
  
I love the ten teams, it's another conference that's going to be in a similar
situation that needs to probably find two games to make up for the other 20
that the other Power Five conferences have and you put the Big East in there,
because they're the next one. I think it's great. Obviously for me I was
thinking about who we would play and there are seven teams that were in the
Big East when Pitt was there and we remember the Big East and there is a lot
of history between those seven teams and even the other ones, Butler, there is
a history there, too, as well, Xavier, we had a great Sweet 16, Elite Eight
game so there is history there as well. With all of those teams. Personally,
it's going to be I think even more exciting for me.  
  
I think just having those two games, home and home situations already built
into our schedule while a challenge, we are not going to spend time having to
find that game. I think it's a great thing, a great opportunity for us, and
the only concern I guess is the timing of it, where we're going to fit it into
the schedule. That's my concern, to make it as big of an event as the Big 12
SEC Challenge. I think that's important and how we go forward whether it's on
one day one weekend, two, three days, during the middle of the week.  
  
But I think making it an "event" rather than just games would be great.  
  
Q. I was curious with your roster, the experience, the lack thereafter
that you addressed. But you're looking at, how do you assess the talent you
have on that roster and the coaching challenge of blending the new guys with
the people you have coming back?  
JAMIE DIXON: I think the biggest thing that stood out for us in our program,
we've always been low turnover teams, right now we're turning it over a little
too much, I think everybody is probably in the season in practices, but I
think we have a talented group but a young group for obvious reasons. You
can't hide from the fact -- I hate to use the word "young" but we have eight
guys that haven't played college basketball. We had four guys that were in our
program but they didn't practice as much as I would have liked them to,
whether it be an injury or one kid came at semester.  
  
I like that we have gotten bigger and more athletic. My intention, my thoughts
going in we would be deeper with this roster, just not having as many guys
sitting out but with the injuries it slowed us down a little bit. I think
eventually we're going to have great depth and like I said, good size, good
length, good athleticism, all those things, but as far as running games in
college basketball and being a part of that and doing the things necessary to
win games, we haven't had a lot of experience doing that and those eight guys
specifically and you keep Jaylen out of the equation, but put 'em all in there
and give them some time and minutes, I think we can be pretty good across the
board. I'm looking forward to having a team very deep and athletic at the same
time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Mike Boynton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34243)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Mike Boynton from Oklahoma State. Coach?  
  
MIKE BOYNTON: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being here. We're excited
about basketball, it's October 24th. Any coach who tells you otherwise, you
should check his health. But at the same time I should be back in Stillwater
focusing on my team considering that the votes we got probably qualify for
11th or 12th, but there are only 10 teams. So we look forward to the challenge
and we are excited about getting started.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What's this roller coaster been like for you going from a 21-win team
to this year losing those key seniors and rebuilding?  
MIKE BOYNTON: This has probably been the easiest part of this roller coaster
for me. As you probably remember a year ago I sat here there was a lot of
uncertainty about the program and its direction and certainly my ability to do
the job at this position. But we were fortunate, we had some really good
upperclassmen, surrounded by a great staff who all helped me kind of keep the
ship above sea and moving in the right direction.  
  
Now we have had some transition. Not only did we lose four guys who would have
been very strong contributors, but we had two late transfers from our team,
guys who probably could have helped a lot this year. That's okay, I don't
begrudge those kids at all, I wish them well. At the same time we're into a
new role now in our program and there is excitement in Stillwater now about
basketball and what the program can be again as it once was under Coach
Sutton. We're excited about the opportunity to build it again and reinvigorate
our fan base and they are excited about coming back into GIA and it's a fairly
young team. We feel like we have good enough talent that as long as those kids
keep working hard, which they have since June they will continue to get
better. I don't know what that looks like as far as wins and losses but we
feel good about the direction we're headed.  
  
Q. Coach, whether they were impactful at the top of the stat sheet or
lower. The amount of players that you did lose from last season is obviously a
big one and noteworthy. How do you adjust to having such a different looking
roster and the completely different overhaul of faces on your roster this
season?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thanks for the question. I think it's part of our industry right
now. There is a lot of turnover everywhere and it looks different at every
school. For us we haven't had a bunch of one-and-done's come through but there
have been a couple of kids leave for graduation which we always want but also
guys wondering if they could find a better situation for themselves
personally. I wish those kids well. I don't hold kids from being able to
transfer if they want to or block them from a certain school. At the end of
the day we provide an education and an opportunity for these kids to grow. So
when they want to leave the program we wish them well but the guys that are in
our program are the guys we really do focus on and we've got a group of mostly
freshmen who we feel really good about, what they can become. They're not
there yet.  
  
We've got a couple of guys who haven't played yet but have been in our program
that we feel can make big-time contributions to us. I know that's not a lot of
outside expectations as there weren't last year, but the work that our guys
have put in and continue to do, you know, starting in June, we went on a
foreign trip. We feel like we're a step ahead of what we possibly could have
been otherwise and we look forward to getting out there and competing.  
  
We go out there and try to play hard like everybody else, we will be 0-0 when
we tip off our first game and it will be how we perform at the end of the day.
I feel confident in our staff and our ability to get these kids better. As
they continue to get better, the results will take care of themselves.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you. Good luck on the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Bob Bowlsby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14164)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning everyone. We would like to welcome you to the Big
12 Basketball Media Day. Without further ado, I would like to introduce the
Commissioner of the Big 12, Mr. Bob Bowlsby.  
  
BOB BOWLSBY: Good morning, welcome all. We're all, I think, probably still a
little bit in football mode, but it's time to start thinking about basketball
as well.  
  
We had a terrific year in 2017-18. The Big 12 was ranked first in RPI and
first in strength of schedule, and we had 90% of our teams in the postseason
including seven in the NCAA Tournament. We also had four teams in the Sweet 16
and Kansas in the Final Four.  
  
In the last three years we've had 70% of our teams that have been in the Sweet
16. I think what we have always said is we have tremendous balance in the
league, but we also had an almost 80% win percentage in the non-conference
schedule, so we're competing up and down the ranks in the Big 12 Conference
season, but we're also competing very well against the nation's best.  
  
In fact, it was the 16th week of the season last year before we had a team in
the conference that fell below 500. So those are all pretty remarkable
statistics, I think, and we really feel like this year will be another year
that is remarkably competitive.  
  
Obviously we're committed to playing the full double round robin, but we also
know that we need to work hard to strengthen our non-conference schedule.
We've had good success with the Big 12 SEC challenge and we expect to continue
that for the foreseeable future.  
  
We're also announcing today that we have created a scheduling alliance with
the Big East and that will start in the 2019-2020 season. We will coordinate
on sites around the SEC Challenge and this is going to be earlier in the year.
It's likely to be late November, early December, all ten teams from each
league will participate and we will have five home sites and five road sites
which is a little bit of an interesting coordination challenge, because as you
may know, the Big East has their games on Fox and that family of networks and
our games are on ESPN and that family of networks.  
  
So we will be coordinating on sites, opponents and telecasts, but it ought to
be a very good thing for both leagues.  
  
I want to thank Val Ackerman and Stu Jackson from the Big East, John Underwood
and Jeff Jackson from our conference for putting it together. I think it will
be a great series.  
  
It's a four-year agreement and there again, like the Big 12/SEC challenge we
sort of see it as an ongoing activity, but time will tell on that.  
  
Right now we have four games scheduled for next year, KU-Villanova, Texas-
Providence, Oklahoma-Creighton, and Kansas State-Marquette.  
  
We will go about scheduling the others as we can get them scheduled. We also
are announcing an extension of our agreement with Kansas City. We are
currently scheduled to be here through 2020 and we will be extending that
agreement through '24. As you know, we also, beginning next year, in 19-20
season we will be playing our women's tournament here in Kansas City. It has
been here before, obviously, and there have been 17 men's championships here.
This year's will be the 18th, 11 of them at the Sprint Center, of course we
were at Kemper Arena before that and the women's tournament will be in
Memorial Coliseum and the team here in Kansas City, Kathy Nelson and Brenda
Tinnen and all the folks with the Kansas City sports organization and the
Sprint Center have done a great job for us.  
  
Interestingly enough for us we don't have much debate at this point about the
site of our tournament. I think our men's tournament has been the best in the
country. This is a wonderful venue at which to host it. The area around the
venue has gotten better and better every year.  
  
The Power and Light district has been a big enhancement in the last 10 or 11
years and it keeps getting better and better.  
  
We're excited to be here through 2024 and we're excited to have both
tournaments combined and operating at the same time in the same city. We think
there is real synergy there and if I could ask Kathy and Brenda to come up
here and join me, they're actually -- Kathy is sporting a new t-shirt. I'm not
sure she is making a huge fashion statement, but it's a good way to welcome it
in. I'm not planning to take any questions from the podium, but I will be here
all morning if you need to touch base with me. I will be happy to be here.
Thank you. These two have an awful lot to do with why we continue to be
excited about Kansas City. There is always lots of competition in this space.
There are lots of cities that would like to have this. I think most of them
understand it's going to be very difficult to compete against Kansas City and
that's because they've set the bar so high. Thank you, both of you for your
good work. Thank you to the city leadership for their good work and we
couldn't be more excited to be here for the next foreseeable future through
'24.  
  
BOB BOWLSBY: We do love that, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2018

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Texas Tech coach, Chris Beard. Coach, your
opening statement?  
  
CHRIS BEARD: I just kind of echo what Coach Weber had to say, exciting time of
year for all of us involved in college basketball. Our team is working really
hard. It's a group I'm looking forward to coaching and it's a group that I
think could have a great season if things come together. Happy to answer any
questions.  
  
Q. What's the ongoing message to the guys you have back this year and
the newcomers coming in about how you take what you did last year in that
special season and take it beyond or continue to play at that level?  
CHRIS BEARD: For us, it's year three building the program. The first year we
really wanted to lay the foundation and try to become part of the fight. I
will always be appreciative of that first team led by five special seniors. We
created a culture that first year and we were competitive. Last year the
second year we thought we were good enough to compete and ultimately win and
we wanted to finish. We won a lot of close games last year, resulted in us
making it to the Elite Eight which is a special run. Five guys graduating,
four guys under professional contracts now.  
  
This third year what we're trying to do is become consistent. We want to make
sure that last year's success doesn't define us as a program. We want to be
part of the fight again. It's easy to talk about and difficult to do
especially in the big bevel but that's the challenge in front of us and,
again, I have been pleased with our players.  
  
I think we embraced last season, no one can take that from us, but we don't
spend too much time talking about it. Each team is different, each season is
different. It's a different journey, led by four special seniors this year. I
think this team will make its own mark on college basketball.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously when a guy like Matt Mooney goes from a different
league to this league. What sort of role do you expect him to play for this
team?  
CHRIS BEARD: Matt is special, simply stated he is a Big 12 player. He did
about all he could do at the mid-major level, played in a lot of high-quality
games against high-major schools, had some good games against Big 12 schools.
He is about as dedicated of a player I've ever been around. He's special. He
takes his craft serious on a day-to-day basis. He could have gone anywhere in
the country his graduate year in college basketball. Personally I take a lot
of responsibility and I appreciate Matt trusting his senior year to our
program and we put him in every situation we can to be successful and he's
returning the favor. He's doing everything he can to help us be successful
that we started the last two years. There is nobody I would rather coach than
Matt. I have a lot of confidence in him. He's a great teammate. He has all the
intangibles. I think he's a pro.  
  
Q. You are one of the few guys who has had a lot of success everywhere
you've been in a short period of time. What's been the key element in what's
been the one thing that's been consistent?  
CHRIS BEARD: Above all really good players. This coaching thing is a little
overrated. I'm the same coach last year that I was years ago, but we had three
NBA players and we make a nice run in college basketball and if it wasn't for
a couple of injuries I think we would have competed for the championship in
this league, that's just my opinion, not disrespecting the other schools.  
  
I have been fortunate and we've had good players everywhere we've been, this
is a players game and also a great coaching staff. This year is no different.
Every guy of on our staff is a future head coach. It has never been about me.
It has been about great staff and great players. We do have a process we
believe in. We believe in playing defense. We believe in sharing the ball and
having balance on offense. We believe in respecting the game and playing it
the right way. This year's team we're off to a great start. We're a work in
progress. We have a long ways to go. We've practiced 20 times. We have 10 left
before our opener November 6th at 6:30, but I like this team that we're about
to have.  
  
Q. How have you seen Jarrett embrace more of the spotlight? Last year
you mentioned him wanting to be that guy that takes the pressure off. How have
you seen him in his second season?  
CHRIS BEARD: I'm on the record proudly and confidently. Jarrett Culver has a
chance to be one of the best players in college basketball. Others have seen
that too. He's starting to get attention, which I like for our players. I
think Jarrett would be the first to tell you that these things wouldn't have
happened if we wouldn't have had the great NCAA Tournament, Elite Eight run
last year.  
  
The great thing about Culver are the things that most people don't know.
Everybody sees the length and the athleticism, the talent. But what I see is
the love of the game. Culver is old school in a lot of ways. He loves
basketball. He's in there every day. He's also a student of the game. As a
young player he watches more film than any guy I've ever coached. He goes
above and beyond. Believe it or not I have a daughter in an Ivy League school,
but I can't speak. Culver goes above and beyond what's asked of him in the
film room, popular guy in the locker room, Culver is special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Mikal Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30876)

### [Jalen Brunson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30875)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 76, Providence - 66 (OT)  
  
COACH WRIGHT: What an incredible college basketball game -- atmosphere at the
Garden, we just feel so lucky to be a part of it.  
  
Congratulations to Providence on an incredible season. And just what a tough
team, man. Either team could have won that obviously overtime game. We just,
hey, we had a great player pick up a loose ball and shoot a 3. It's obviously
not great offense or anything.  
  
Providence defensively was unbelievable. Just a really gutty performance. I'm
proud of our leadership. These two guys and Phil Booth, that was the
difference for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. No win is easy, but after a couple of games that were a little bit
easier than this one is not necessarily the worst kind of thing that you like
to see your team go through heading into next week.  
COACH WRIGHT: Exactly right. You don't want it that way when you start the
game. You hope -- and when you get a little lead, you want to create
separation. But when it's over, you just know how much this does for your
team's mental toughness.  
  
And if you get into tough games in the tournament, you know you've been
through that recently. And it is good for us.  
  
Q. Jalen, you missed a one-and-one prior about two minutes left in the
game. How were you able to have the composure to come back late in the game,
hit two free throws to force the game to go into overtime?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I approached every free throw the same, make or miss. Just
concentrate and focus on the basket and myself. My teammates always have
confidence in me. That's pretty much it. Approach it the same way.  
  
Q. Did it feel like in some ways it's sort of old and new sort of merged
on this floor today? It was such a crazy, throwback kind of game. You got Ed
Cooley with his pants split, all kinds of crazy atmosphere. Did it feel like
the old storied Big East games coming to life in the new Big East?  
COACH WRIGHT: I'm glad you said it. I didn't want to sound corny, saying it as
a coach. But it really is, man. The atmosphere, you know, sold out. You can
hear it from the beginning.  
  
The tough physical play. You don't see that as much in college basketball.
Just the crazy plays. Just guys battling, great athletes. Coaches that know
each other really well. It was old-school Big East and -- old-school Big East
in 2018.  
  
Q. Jalen and Mikal did most of the scoring; your other guys combined for
20 points. Could you talk about their contribution tonight, especially Eric
and Omari?  
COACH WRIGHT: Those are two I was going to start with. Eric got so many extra
possessions for us. He was credited with six offensive rebounds but there was
a number that he tipped free that we came up with. I think it had a big
difference in the game.  
  
And Omari defensively, I think Ed's one of the best coaches in the country. He
gets you into mismatches and he runs all his screening action until he gets a
mismatch. And they were going after Omari. There were a number of possessions
he was on Cartwright, the worst possible matchup for us, and he did a great
job. Really proud of him.  
  
Q. Mikal, before the game starts, you and Jalen, you guys almost
shoulder tackle each other in the preparation. When you're coming out in the
pregame introductions, everyone's hitting you. Is that sort of an embodiment
of the physical play you guys look for and the type of team that you are?  
MIKAL BRIDGES: In the beginning, I just thought me and JB, we just made up
before the game just bumping into each other. But, yeah, like Coach actually
had to tell me when I go through that little tunnel with my teammates, when I
get hit around don't smile. So I had to kind of change that throughout the
season. (Laughter) but just showing toughness and that's just who we are.  
  
Q. I know it sounds cliché, but was there any one point in the game when
you just kind of looked around and just kind of took everything in, whether
from the crowd going back and forth, to just the play on the court being so
physical? Was there any one moment or was it kind of spread out throughout the
game?  
COACH WRIGHT: It always hits me when the game starts and you're standing out
there on the line looking at the other team lined up and the colors are out
there. You had a great National Anthem. You can just hear the crowd yelling
during the National Anthem. That's when it hits me.  
  
Once the game starts, believe it or not, I can't appreciate it. But when it's
over you have that feeling. You have that feeling that you were in that
atmosphere that was incredible.  
  
Q. Ed also said that these three straight overtime games that his team
played showed him that his team was ready for bigger and better things
possibly in the tournament. How does a deep run like this prepare a team for
the NCAA?  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, sometimes when you -- it's happened to us -- when you're
playing really well and you play through this tournament and win, not easily
but you don't have these kind of games, that's three games. And maybe had a
couple before that, that's five.  
  
Get into the NCAA Tournament, you get a good seed, maybe your first round game
is like that. Then bang you get hit in that second round, you're in a battle.
It's been a long time since you've played a game like that.  
  
So when you get it here, and I know exactly what Ed's saying, I feel the same
way. When you get it here, if you get it in the first or second round of the
NCAA Tournament you just did it a few days ago; you're very comfortable in
that situation.  
  
Q. When did you realize that Ed Cooley split his pants and what did you
think -- (laughter)?  
COACH WRIGHT: I didn't know until -- Val Ackerman told me after the game when
we were up on the stage. So I never knew it. I didn't see it.  
  
Q. What did you think of the towel?  
COACH WRIGHT: I didn't even notice it. I didn't know. I never look at the
other coach. I really don't. Because I love Ed Cooley. So I don't want to --
God knows what he's doing down there. I don't want to see anything crazy. I
never saw it. I never saw anything. I have no idea. I'll watch the video,
though, (laughter).  
  
Q. You talk about old and new at the Big East. What about for your
program? What does it mean to have guys like Randy Foye and Kyle Lowry on the
bench and on the court after the game?  
COACH WRIGHT: Don't make me cry, man. That means the world to me. Those guys,
Baker Dunleavy, he's a coach, he's a coach but he played on those teams with
Kyle and Randy, and that got us going.  
  
And I can't remember -- I don't think -- we didn't win a Big East Tournament,
did we, with those guys? I don't -- I can't remember who played with who
anymore.  
  
But I know they got us going. And I know we played some great battles in here.
And I wanted them to be up there a part of it, and I wanted our young guys to
see how much pride they take in them and following them.  
  
I'm up there and Kyle is telling them how good Mikal is, and Randy Foye is
telling me how good Jalen is; how he's going to do in the NBA. To hear it from
those guys means a lot.  
  
Q. Put in the same circumstances, knowing your taste for clothing, what
would you do? Would you pull a towel and be an Ed Cooley?  
COACH WRIGHT: What did he do exactly?  
  
Q. He grabbed a towel and put it here.  
COACH WRIGHT: I don't know what I would do, man. I think I would try -- I
think I would try to fake like it didn't happen and hold my coat over it, I
think. Thank God I haven't had that yet.  
  
Q. Mikal, the play in overtime where Jalen gets the ball knocked away
and it kind of bounced right to you and you hit the 3. Seemed like you kind of
did it in one motion. Could you just take us through the play and just the
instinct taking over there?  
MIKAL BRIDGES: I saw JB driving and I was trying to move off the ball and fill
behind him. I guess he lost the ball and I saw it, and I was just aggressive
and just catch and shoot, simple.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask in terms of the quality of Providence's defense,
you played a team that gave up 68 points, 70 points and then held you guys to
60 in regulation. Talk about what it brought out of your team in terms of
going into the next stage?  
COACH WRIGHT: You're exactly right. Their length, their length is daunting.
And Ed, as I said, I think he's one of the best coaches in the country.  
  
He's always got a great game plan. And we know each other so well. So they're
as prepared for us as anybody. So I think in the tournament, when you play
bigger, longer teams, that's what the game's going to be like. And I think
it's going to prepare us well.  
  
Q. Can you discuss winning the Big East title three out of four years?  
COACH WRIGHT: I haven't got to think about that yet. You know, it's just one
year at a time. Sometime in the summer you look back at that.  
  
Like right now, I'm so proud of these guys -- we didn't win the regular
season. And we were picked preseason. And we knew we had a good enough team to
do it. Xavier is just a great team. They had a better season than us, flat
out. But we kept getting better.  
  
We don't have any seniors. Like these guys are juniors with Phil Booth. And
they just kept getting better throughout the year.  
  
And these two were so unselfish. They've gotten all kinds of individual awards
in the most unselfish ways. That's what we want our program to be about.  
  
They're going to be held up in our program forever because they've got
individual accomplishments and they never tried to.  
  
Q. A lot of people talk about Jalen's lack of emotion or whatever you
call it, but what does that do for you in late-game situations like tonight?
Is it one less thing you have to worry about keeping your leader cool, one
less thing you have to worry about on court? How does it affect you?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. It keeps our team -- honestly, he's the most mature
person in the program, including me. And a lot of times during games he's
grabbing me and saying, attitude, Coach, attitude.  
  
Chris Mack had the greatest line. He said, if you pull down the skin on his
face there would be wires behind it. He's like -- he's so focused on the game.
He's on another level. He really is. And it's what makes him great.  
  
And we had a question, you missed a foul shot that would get to other people.
Everybody on our team knows that's not affecting him.  
  
And all our players have great respect for him and confidence because of all
throughout the game because of the way he conducts himself. Every day. Every
day in practice when I get on him and every game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2018

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 76, Providence - 66 (OT)  
  
COACH COOLEY: There's a lot in my head right now. I feel for our young men. I
thought we played great. I thought we played tough. I thought we played
together.  
  
I thought we had a great game plan coming in. You know, they got out to a
couple of quick starts to start the half, but we weathered both storms.  
  
What beat us today was little things, not the big picture. Rebound the ball,
game over. It's really that simple. Their offensive rebounds in a critical
part of the game, I think they had four offensive rebounds in five
possessions. If you just get one of those, one of those four, you win the
game.  
  
Overtime, you know, they had a lot of players on the floor. I thought we got a
little rattled in overtime. Just speechless on that, but I've got to give my
team a lot of credit. And more importantly, Villanova is a great team.
Brunson, Bridges, two high-, high-level players. The other guys played off --
they carried their team today. They more than carried their team today and
made some tough, tough shots. Bridges two 3s both came off of offensive
rebounds in overtime. Foul at the end of the game, offensive rebound.  
  
We just weren't fortunate to pick it up. But credit them. They did a great
job. Congratulations to them. What I told the team in the locker room is
cherish this moment.  
  
If you would have told me back in September that we'd be playing in this game
with the ball to win a postseason championship, I would have signed up for it.
We got the shot we wanted in regulation.  
  
I wanted the ball in Kyron's hands. Wanted to try to bring two to the ball. It
worked for us all game. We just weren't fortunate to get the last shot. But
I'm proud of our players.  
  
I'm really, really sad for our players because I thought we did enough to win
the game in regulation. But little things got us. And hopefully we'll learn
from it for next week's tournament.  
  
Q. Could you talk about going to Drew to put him on Brunson and just
your thought behind that and how you thought he played? Seemed like that kind
of turned the game a little bit.  
COACH COOLEY: Again, I coach on gut. I trust Drew. He's been in some high-
level games. A year ago, couple years before he was hurt. I thought his size
was a little bit bigger than Makai. I thought his overall awareness of what we
do as a basketball team being a junior, new, and I thought it would work. We
just came up a little bit short.  
  
But I'm really proud of Drew and he was ready for the moment because he didn't
play the whole game.  
  
Q. Much of the offensive rebounds that you're talking about, it just
seemed like they were bouncing off the baskets and finding their way to
Villanova's hands --  
COACH COOLEY: They found their way because they're really good players and
they went after the ball. But I don't think we checked out the way we're
supposed to, the way we practiced. We practice blocking out all the time.
Sometimes a 50/50 ball is going to get to you.  
  
But a couple of ones we should have had. We should have had. You are one stop
away from the other coach being in this seat right now feeling as bad as I do.  
  
I hope I do a better job for my team next time to try to get them over the
hump. Because it's sad, looking at those kids there. I feel for them kids
right now. It's tough watching them like that. But that's part of growing up,
too. Hopefully learn from it.  
  
Q. You said that you would have signed up for this in September or when
the season started, making it. What were your expectations starting and how
did your team sort of grow or get better through the season?  
COACH COOLEY: Well, the expectation is always to become a great, great group,
be connected, on and off the floor, build chemistry. We start with that. Start
by giving accountability and discipline.  
  
And then you talk about who are we? We had some seniors. Right now I'm
thinking of Emmitt Holt who is not at the game. He's recovering.  
  
That was a big, big, big, big blow to us, a major blow to us. And we were able
to withstand that. We were able to withstand early injuries. We were able to
withstand late sicknesses. The entire team went through the flu and pneumonia,
bronchitis. And every team around the country weathered a storm similar to it.  
  
But when talking about Providence we had to weather all that to get to this
point. So when you look at how we developed over the year we had some
inconsistent play and played well at the right time. But again we just weren't
fortunate to win this game.  
  
Q. At the risk of being personal, the towel you were fashioning, I
assume there was a sartorial mishap?  
COACH COOLEY: When I sat down I felt the great breeze in the crack. (Laughter)
my pants ripped.  
  
Q. To that point, the intensity of this game and the way it was, I think
there's a lot of people questioned a lot of things with college basketball
this season. What does this kind of game say about the caliber of what this
sport can be?  
COACH COOLEY: You know what, this has been a rough year for college basketball
with respect to everything that's going on and the culture of it. And I think
some of the national attention that's been on the negative today accentuated
the positive.  
  
We have a great game. It's unfortunate that there's some things that don't go,
people are not doing the right thing. That's to be decided by someone other
than us.  
  
But there's some great players. There's some great coaches that have changed
lives of hundreds and thousands of young men and women, and we shouldn't be
painted in a bad light because there's a few bad apples. Don't let those few
bad apples destroy the bunch of the goodness of this game, and more
importantly how it changes lives.  
  
At the end of the day we're not going to win every game, but we have to make
sure we win the battle making sure we help these kids grow up.  
  
Q. I couldn't help but notice several times during the game you had the
brightest smile on your face, like, this is really fun. I mean, what was it
like coaching in this game?  
COACH COOLEY: My man, this is something you dream about when you're a kid --
as a player first and then when you grow up, say what do you want to do.  
  
The coaching side is unbelievable. The atmosphere in here, I'm really, really
fortunate to work for Providence College and try to help that program win a
national championship. And we're trying to get there little by little.  
  
But if you can't enjoy this moment, win or lose, on that stage, on this day,
Saturday night, you got a problem. So we all should be smiling, because we're
all very, very fortunate.  
  
Q. What did the last two nights teach you about your team looking ahead
to the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH COOLEY: We just played two No. 1 seeds back to back in overtime. That
told me my team matured at the right time. It told me my team is gritty. It
told me our team is tough, resilient, passionate, really good leadership.  
  
I saw Kyron grow up more. I saw Diallo grow up. I saw Nate Watson grow up. I
saw some guys come together at the right time and hopefully next week we can
continue to play that way.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of a group who went through a lot of inconsistencies,
of which you wrote about, right? I hope you write about how consistent we are
right now, bro.  
  
Q. You spoke about the leadership that you saw in terms of growth,
especially with Kyron and Diallo in these last three games, OTs. What did you
see from them in terms of leadership that really brought the best out of
everyone else in the group?  
COACH COOLEY: I think part of that -- and I think your question is great --
you know what brought that out? The atmosphere of the Big East Tournament, the
energy in this building, the fans, the National Anthem. If you can't get
excited listening to the last two National Anthems. The energy brought, I
think, our team together. And that's what our league is all about.  
  
It's a tough league, man, really, really tough league. And somebody had to
lose, and unfortunately the Friars were on that side.  
  
Q. Ed, the sport has a lot of especially during conference tournament
times loud players with gimmicks or people who draw a lot of attention, but
for Jalen Brunson to have his fourth 31-point game and be as kind of quiet and
stoic as he is, does he deserve as much attention as any player in college
basketball?  
COACH COOLEY: I know Jalen really, really well. I've spent a couple months
with him. We won a couple of gold medals together. I said this from the
beginning, the best player in college basketball was the MVP of this
tournament.  
  
He's terrific. He guards. He makes big, big, big shots, big shots. And he
plays on the best team in the country.  
  
He's deserving of everything because he's a great young man. I've seen his
character from his gratitude and appreciation. I've seen him compete. He's
very friendly to my family. Texts my son, my daughter, texts me. We compete
against each other. I'm really proud of him.  
  
And I hope he goes on to do some great things in his life, because he's an
incredible ambassador not just for Villanova but for the Big East.  
  
Q. When you guys started the overtime, were you surprised at all with
how you guys came out, given the sense you played two overtime games here
already and won them? You would think you would have been more comfortable as
a veteran team?  
COACH COOLEY: Played a great team. And again we didn't get a couple of
bounces. I thought we had a couple of early looks that just didn't go in. We
didn't shoot the ball from 3 particularly well in this tournament at all. What
did we make, six today and then we made 14 in three games.  
  
It's hard to stretch any -- defensively I thought we did a good job in
regulation. I don't know what the score was in regulation. But I mean we
defended really, really well in this tournament. We defended really well in
this tournament against the three, quote/unquote, best offensive teams in the
league.  
  
I give our defense a lot of credit. We just couldn't make -- we had how many
open shots we missed. You're the writers, you tell me. We had wide open shots.
We just didn't make them.  
  
Q. The second 3 by Bridges, I think there's like maybe two or three
seconds on the shot clock, Brunson has the ball tipped away and it goes right
to Bridges and he steps into a 3. Is that just kind of typical of Villanova?
They get maybe a little luck and they just make the most of it?  
COACH COOLEY: You create your own luck. He's a great player. Great player. He
lived in the moment. Just like our players.  
  
Those kids live for this moment. And he had his moment. So I don't think it's
luck. I've seen him make 100 of those 3s at the top of the key.  
  
But if we get the rebound, they can't even get the shot. That was one of the
3s that came off of another offensive rebound. Then they juiced the clock late
and he made the play. Same with us, we made some plays similar, but it just
wasn't a 3.  
  
Q. There's a couple 3s that Bridges made in the overtime period that
really seemed to stifle your momentum. Overall just coming into the game and
having experienced it, the toughest part about trying to guard Mikal Bridges
overall?  
COACH COOLEY: I thought we did a hell of a job guarding. You're not going to
shut teams out. You can't throw no-hitters in basketball. You're not going to
shut anybody out.  
  
We played great defensively. So it wasn't about Bridges. They just made some
timely plays. And the overtime, I think they had two 3s back to back, I
believe.  
  
I thought we defended great. I don't know what our percentages were, but you
hold a team like that in the 60s in regulation, come on. I think, was it
60-60? I don't have my glasses. I can't see. 63s. I don't know what it was in
overtime.  
  
But you hold a high-level offensive team like that, come on, man. I'm pretty
sure some of you are surprised the game was played the way it was, because
everybody thought the Friars were going to come in here and lay down. No way,
man. That team got fight. They've got passion and we believe. So it's not what
he did. The ball found that basket at an inopportune time for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Phil Booth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34930)

### [Mikal Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30876)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 87, Butler - 68  
  
COACH WRIGHT: That was one of our best defensive performances. We played well.
They're a really good offensive team.  
  
And they still shot 48 percent and we thought we played really well
defensively but the first half, the start defensively I think was the
difference for us.  
  
Q. Last night you said that you start off slowly from the outside so you
went inside. Was it the opposite tonight because you hit so many shots early
you really were able to bounce things out?  
COACH WRIGHT: When Mikal hit that first shot, that's not what we were looking
for right there. But he does have the freedom.  
  
And that just kind of set a great tone. Win the tap, throw it up, he hits a 3,
that's a nice way to start. I thought it gave everybody confidence.  
  
Q. You had balanced scoring, all five of your starters go with more than
ten points. How big is that with Providence coming up tomorrow?  
COACH WRIGHT: It's very important. That's really the key to our team is the
balance, when we have balance. Providence is always really tough on us
defensively. They really grind. They play an incredible second half
defensively tonight.  
  
So it's a different kind of defense. Butler has also played us tough also. But
Providence has the length and athleticism that can really bother you and take
away your 3-point shooting.  
  
Q. That 19-0 run, have you ever seen anything like that recently or at
all?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, Creighton did that to us, remember, at the Wells Fargo
Center? Wasn't it something like that?  
  
Q. I thought you blocked that one out.  
COACH WRIGHT: That's what it reminded me of. I think it was something like
that, right, 17 or something.  
  
Q. Just the way you guys proceeded on offense, one possession after the
other and building that lead and building confidence, I imagine?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. And it really came off our defense. Like the first
play was the tap, but after that it was defensive stops, getting out in
transition before the defense got set. It wasn't -- they weren't fast breaks,
but they were kind of secondary offenses after the initial rush so they didn't
get set. They're a really good half court defensive team. And that definitely
gave us great defenses.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow's game, will you look to speed the tempo up
knowing they're coming off of back-to-back overtime games?  
COACH WRIGHT: No, we'll be more concerned with what we do really. We wouldn't
change what we do for that reason. I think they've got veteran players. I
think -- they've got decent depth. I think they'll be fine that way.  
  
We're more concerned with how good Cartwright is, how well Lindsey shoots the
ball, Bullock and how to defend them. And they do a great job defending on us.
We have to be able to score on them.  
  
Q. You had a bit of a rough stretch in February. The calendar changes
and you have three big wins, including two in the Big East Tournament. What is
it about the team's mentality when the calendar changes, and how important is
it to have four upperclassmen in the starting lineup for this time period?  
COACH WRIGHT: I don't think it's the calendar. I think this year has been a
unique year where we just had crazy injuries, and a couple of them were to
some young guys that didn't hurt us a lot. But it did affect how we played.
And then when we lost Phil, that hurt us and we had to change how we played a
little bit.  
  
Now that we've got everybody back, we're back kind of playing how we did
before the injuries. So it's just a weird year that way. But it's kind of
interesting now. I think we feel we're a new team rather than a team that's
kind of stale at the end of the year.  
  
Phil is kind of excited, (indiscernible) to be back, and Eric Paschall missed
some games. The young freshmen are more seasoned. So it's just a different
kind of year for us.  
  
Q. I was wondering if the players sensed that Butler's players were
getting frustrated as -- especially during that first half run and especially
their stars Baldwin and Martin?  
MIKAL BALDWIN: They did get upset. They're mentally strong and that's how
their coach and that's what the program is. And they stayed throughout and
they kept battling throughout the whole game.  
  
And we had some slip-ups and we got on each other. Coach got on us. And we had
to keep playing our way and stop backing up.  
  
Q. Mikal, yesterday you got off to a good start in terms of shooting and
you continued it tonight. Could you speak to the rhythm you're in in terms of
how you're playing with the offense and how you're finding your shots?  
MIKAL BRIDGES: Just my teammates finding me, moving without the ball, just
being aggressive. My teammates, my first shot, JB found me in the beginning.
So my teammates behind me and I'm just being aggressive.  
  
Q. Mikal, so you started off the game strong, first five points really
set the tone for the run of the game as a whole. Was that something you
thought about in the pregame, shooting more free than usual or was it just
sort of how the game came to you?  
MIKAL BRIDGES: My coaches and teammates told me to be aggressive and having
that aggressive mindset in the beginning helped me out, helped the team out.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned a little bit about the defense yesterday. But
Butler shot 48 percent. What do you think you need to do to get better before
the next game?  
COACH WRIGHT: I actually thought -- that's the funny thing about -- our league
is the number one offensive efficient, offensively efficient league in the
country. This is a hard league to defend in. So even though they shot 48
percent I thought they played pretty well. I thought we eliminate their 3s,
did a good job on Martin and Baldwin and even still they shot 48 percent.
That's just our league.  
  
It might have been one of our best defensive efforts. So we've got to play
that way tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Phil, what was it like to be on the court for a 19-0 run at the start
of the game? And as for your own offense, were you trying to be more
aggressive tonight as well?  
PHIL BOOTH: I didn't even notice the score was 19-0. I saw them call timeout,
I looked up and I noticed what it was. But we were just playing, trying to get
stops and kept going and just played defense. But no, I wasn't trying to be
more aggressive, just playing the way we play, try to play the right way. Make
the right plays on both ends of the floor was kind of what I was looking to
do.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Kerem Kanter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34918)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 75, Xavier - 72  
  
COACH MACK: Certainly a tough game. It feels like it's a game that shoulda,
coulda, woulda. Give them credit. They hung in there and didn't deliver the
knockout punch that was needed. But also recognize that we're playing a very
senior-laden team in Providence.  
  
It's disappointing, because I feel like we had the game, and you know, we've
been so awfully good in close games, but tonight we just left a few plays out
there that had we made we'd be sitting here getting ready for the winner of
Butler-Villanova. But we didn't. That's what happens sometimes in the game of
basketball.  
  
Q. Done with the Big East season now completely. You have another
tournament to look forward to next week. What was your message to the guys
regarding that after the game?  
COACH MACK: Just that. Sort of hard to say that in the moment. Guys are sort
of reflective of what just transpired.  
  
So we'll worry about where we go, who we play and all that stuff in a couple
of days when some of the feelings of what we just dealt with in the locker
room are sort of gone.  
  
Q. You had them down by 14. What changes did they make to be able to
make that comeback?  
COACH MACK: Well, they didn't quit, not that we expected them to. Felt like
they just turned us over a few times.  
  
We didn't have an extraordinary amount of turnovers. I mean, we only had 10
for the game. But there was a crucial stretch where we made a few in a row,
and what is a 17- or 15-point lead becomes single digits. Now the game feels a
little funny.  
  
Told them we missed some shots around the basket, some looks. Providence is a
really good defensive team, though, so to say we missed open shots would be a
discredit to how well they are on the defensive end.  
  
Having said all that, we kept our turnovers low. We certainly didn't shoot
great from the field, but our defense was certainly good enough to win. They
shoot in the low 40s. They shoot in the teens from 3.  
  
But, again, just a couple of plays and we'd have different feelings.  
  
Q. Kerem, you've waited so long to be on a stage like this in the Big
East Tournament. How do you quickly process this loss and kind of get it out
of your system? How tough is that?  
KEREM KANTER: Well, this was one of my goals in the beginning of the season,
when we started our season. Winning this tournament was one of our goals. And
it sucks we're not playing tomorrow, but I'm still glad we've got a lot more
basketball to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned sort of the string of turnovers in the second
half. Was there anything that you thought that they did particularly well
offensively or you didn't do as well as you would have liked to have done
defensively in order to allow them to erase that deficit?  
COACH MACK: I thought Kyron hit some really tough, contested shots. I felt
like over the last few weeks Providence has played a little differently.
They've really posted up mismatches a lot more than they did earlier in the
year. They've always done it, but not to the extent they're doing now. I
thought they just willed some baskets in, just with their toughness. They're a
very versatile team.  
  
Seems like every guy out there is between 6'6" and 6'8" besides Kyron. So it's
a difficult team to match up against. And having said that we limited them to
six offensive rebounds, but just felt like they sort of toughed-in some
baskets.  
  
We haven't gone cold very often this year. And again I go back to crediting
Providence's defense for that. But, again, it's a coin flip in terms of who is
winning and who is losing. And we're on the wrong side of the coin, at least
from my perspective.  
  
Q. Despite everything that happened, you still had that last possession
with a chance to make something happen there. Can you just discuss what the
plan was there on the last possession?  
COACH MACK: They did a good job taking away Trevon on the re-screen. So it's
an end-of-the-game play that we run with usually seven seconds, six seconds or
more. And when Tre came back off the re-screen, they did a really good job and
didn't fall asleep. That didn't leave us many options.  
  
You only have so many last-second plays drawn up. And with no timeouts it was
certainly difficult to draw anything up that you feel comfortable with.  
  
So that's, again, one play of many that didn't go our way, and I don't think
it was a reason that we lost.  
  
Q. The Macura offensive foul was obviously a big play in the game. You
showed some frustration on that call. Could you talk about what you thought
happened there?  
COACH MACK: I mean, I'm really biased. But probably the right call, probably
the right call.  
  
You gotta make a decision on a two-on-one or three-on-one a little bit better.
And hopefully J.P. will the next time. But frustration just being in the
moment. Officials did a really good job. So I don't have any angst against
those guys. Tough call for them to make but probably the right call.  
  
Q. Did you feel that your team was settling for shots or kind of taking
their foot off the gas, especially when you were up so much in the first
half?  
COACH MACK: No. No, I felt like a few of the turnovers disrupted us a bit.
When they went zone, it hurt us for a little bit. And then we started to get a
little bit of rhythm to it. Got a couple of baskets.  
  
When they went zone in the second half, you know, it made our offense chunky
there for two or three possessions. And then, again, a 15-, 17-point lead
dwindled down to single digits. And we did much better over time against the
zone but we needed to sort of be better early on.  
  
But I don't think we were settling for shots, not any different than the shots
that we take through the other 32 games.  
  
Q. Can this kind of game, this kind of situation and everything that the
team went through, I know you played a lot of close games through the season,
is there something that can be good out of this that you'll try to stress or
that the players will learn from going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MACK: I think you always learn or at least you need to in both a win and
a loss. And a lot of times those lessons sink in a little bit clearer, a
little bit deeper when you do lose.  
  
My biggest thing is making sure that the guys in the locker room have won 28
games this year, have won a regular season Big East championship. Fought tooth
and nail and could have been in the finals on any number of plays.  
  
Feel good about themselves coming into NCAA Tournament time. And we'll learn
from this and bounce back. And I'm sure on Sunday when they have the seven-
hour Selection Show we'll feel a lot better.  
  
Q. Speaking of the tournament, with the way you guys lost tonight,
what's the one thing you would want your team to take with them in the next
few days off before the tournament starts?  
COACH MACK: Just that feeling, the finality of it. That's what good
competitors do. They remember that feeling. So we've just got to be better the
next time out and survive and advance.  
  
Q. You've announced your presence in this conference quite well by
(indiscernible) to the semifinals in the first five years. One trip to the
final. Is that the toughest hurdle, from semifinal to final?  
COACH MACK: It's been for us. But some other programs, there's a tougher
hurdle. I don't know. I told the guys maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Three
games in three days is really difficult. But having said that we still would
have preferred to play in the finals. But I don't know if that's a tougher
hurdle. I'm not going to necessarily worry about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 87, Butler - 68  
  
COACH JORDAN: Start off by saying that's a heck of a basketball team that we
just played. A lot of credit goes to them for coming out with the level of
intensity that they did. Obviously they made a ton of shots.  
  
But I'm extremely proud of our group for just responding. After the first big
run it was even after that. If you spot a team like that 16, 19 points, it's
going to be really tough to dig out of that. But as we talk about in the
locker room, circumstances don't define you as much as how you respond to the
circumstances.  
  
So I thought our guys continued to fight the entire way. We found some smooth
air at a certain point and cut into the lead a bit and they responded.
Sometimes you have to give the other team credit, shake their hands. If they
play like that they'll be playing for a long time in March.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. We know this isn't the first time this season that Butler has fallen
behind early. Do you see any kind of common thread that causes that to happen
to the Bulldogs so often?  
COACH JORDAN: I don't know. We've gotten off to good starts at different
games, and sometimes, I think tonight had a lot more to do with them coming
out and they didn't miss. We weren't as solid as we had been.  
  
When we had to rotate they made an extra pass, which is what Villanova does.
They made the shots. Sometimes you need them to miss a couple of shots to give
you some life or give you a chance to get back in it.  
  
Q. You spoke about how this was more or less about what they did. In
terms of the comeback last night, do you feel like the team was more
emotionally spent coming into this game, that that maybe affected the
execution going forward offensively?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I thought -- we thought we tried to plan it out as best we
could from last night. Obviously that was -- you had to fight to come back and
win in a thriller. And try to get these guys as rested and recovered as
possible along with refreshing ourselves on Villanova and coming up with a
game plan, which didn't prove to be a very good one.  
  
I thought they did a good job of denying Ke the basketball. Obviously he's a
big part of our offense. They took him away many times and wouldn't let him
catch it.  
  
We had some cuts that were open and they crowded us and we couldn't see them
at all times. And so, like I said, a lot more to do with them and we didn't
respond, timely responses.  
  
When you're playing like that defensively everything has to be on time. When
they're cutting, the pass has got to be there. If Tyler sets a screen and
rolls and he's open, it has to be there now because they rotate really well.  
  
Q. Kelan, you had had some good games against Villanova in the regular
season. What did they do differently defensively against you to frustrate you
and get you out of rhythm?  
KELAN MARTIN: It wasn't frustration. It was just they denied me, every player
they had just denied me the ball. I was just trying to get open every time. I
mean hats off to them; they had a great game plan for me. And sometimes you
just can't beat it. And, I mean, just things like that happen.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously things are looking good ahead of Selection Sunday,
and this is a great Nova team that you guys played. But how do you build off
of a loss like this ahead of March?  
COACH JORDAN: That's a great question. I think you look at the guys in the
locker room and look at our two senior leaders and I have a lot of faith in
this group.  
  
Told them in the locker room, I love this group, what we've become. I think
it's a group of fighters. That's what will define us for the rest of time.
Team 120 chapter of Butler basketball history is they're a group of fighters;
we've been down, we've come back, we've won and continued to fight. We
continue to fight tonight. And our fight wasn't enough for these guys.  
  
And so we'll get into Selection Sunday, get into the tournament. We'll be
excited. These two will be one of three classes to do that for four straight
years and we'll fight. We'll see where we go and who we're going to battle
with.  
  
Q. The toughest part about defending a team like Villanova that at times
can put as many as four 3-point shooters on the floor at the same time.  
COACH JORDAN: Seemed like six. And they don't miss. That is what makes them a
very difficult challenge is they have a shooter at every position. But they
also can post at every position, so they can invert and bring their big guy
away from the basket. They're posting Jalen. He's probably their best post
player, and Brunson.  
  
And it makes it a challenge because your guards have to play post defense. And
at the point when you over help or try to commit, the ball moves quickly and
now you're in rotations.  
  
They're the most fundamentally sound team that we face. They shot fake if you
jump. The next thing you know the guy's in the paint and rotate, and they move
it to the next guy. They're unselfish. When they're shooting at that clip you
kind of have to outscore them. We didn't score enough early to stay in it.  
  
Q. You've gone up against Mikal Bridges three times this season. Talk
about having to account for him on both sides of the ball this season?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, he scored in like two seconds. They tipped it, passed it
and he shot it in. That lets you know a little bit of their mentality and his
mentality.  
  
He's a tough man. He's so long defensively, we tried to get him on a couple of
backdoors, he deflected it. They put him on the front of the three-quarter
press and it slows you down. It's hard to get up the court, and you have a
flow to what you're doing.  
  
So both sides of it, he presents a real challenge just matching with him on
one end but disrupting your flow offensively on the other. And he recovers so
well defensively with his length.  
  
So he's a really, really good player, obviously a lottery pick. It's been a
good challenge and good battle for these guys to go up against him.  
  
Q. Tyler and Kelan, you guys have had some great things happen in recent
days. You've had some downs. What's your sense of the team's state of mind
heading into the NCAA Tournament?  
KELAN MARTIN: Staying in the moment. Now is win or go home. We talked about it
in the locker room just now. We'll be fine. We've got something to play for.
And it wasn't like we didn't have nothing to play for tonight, but I mean now
it's do or die, win or go home. So staying in the moment, staying within
ourselves and just compete and just outsmarting teams.  
  
TYLER WIDEMAN: Just take it one possession at a time. Every possession
matters. Like he said, it's win or go home. And just trying to live in the
moment, play each possession and take it one game at a time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 75, Xavier - 72  
  
COACH COOLEY: What a game, what an atmosphere, what a league. Didn't come out
playing the way we wanted to play. I was really proud of our young kids in the
second half. We made a really bold move we haven't done before because we had
to change the rhythm of the game.  
  
We know we're playing against arguably the best team in the country that's
been playing really, really well, has great seniors, really well-coached. And
I'm really proud of the players who stepped up to the challenge, especially in
the second half.  
  
I didn't think we had any rhythm in the first half. Offensively, defensively
we had a lot of breakdowns, but the game is long. I kept telling the players a
lot of game left, gonna try to get a couple of stops, get lucky with a couple
of open shots. We missed as many open shots as we've missed in a long time.  
  
They didn't shoot the ball particularly well that they normally do, in
particular Bluiett and Macura. They're front line guys in our league. That's a
great team. We just happened to have the ball last and make a couple of plays.
The game could have gone either way. We're fortunate to move on.  
  
But what a win for Providence College and the character of the young men. I'm
proud of them. We played a great team and we're fortunate to move on. We're
looking forward to whoever the winner of the next game is to prepare and --
but these young men, all of them, they played their hearts out and left it out
there.  
  
What an atmosphere here in Madison Square Garden. Electric. I've got the
goosebumps still from the energy in this building.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Macura had two plays, one in overtime, one in regulation, with you
guys getting those stops. How big was that for you guys to be able to make
it?  
COACH COOLEY: Like I said, he's been in the league a long time. He's a great
player. I mean, we had to get stops. The game was very, very physical.  
  
The charge, we had a couple of charges that were key. Kyron does a great job
selling it, giving up his body, being very, very selfless. And those were two
big stops for us and it helped us win.  
  
Q. You were down by 14. What did you have to say or did you say anything
to be able to try and keep everybody's spirit up at that point?  
COACH COOLEY: We went in and we talked about -- in our business you have to
have real conversation with these young men; you can't sugarcoat anything.
We're at Madison Square Garden. We're in the semifinals. There's so many
people that would love to be in this building at this time. Why are we so
hesitant to play? Play.  
  
And a big move we made was putting Makai in the game to give us another ball
handler, another slasher, a really good defender. And I thought that was the
big change for us because it gave us a different rhythm and different
momentum. But I had a lot of words to say at halftime, because you lose and
you go home.  
  
Q. You mentioned how proud you were of the young guys. Part of the
second half run, there was so much between Nate and Cartwright, the young and
the old. Can you just talk about maybe how proud you are of the lessons that
have been passed down?  
COACH COOLEY: Absolutely. One thing you learning about our freshmen, they've
made a lot of mistakes but they've grown and matured. Nate is a wrecking ball
in there. And the more confident he is, the more he's learning. We love him.
We hope he's with us forever.  
  
He was big time today. Wow. He's going to play in this building some day. He
was great today. He was unbelievable. And I thought his energy, his spirit,
his length, his girth, but that's today. He's got to play tomorrow, too. Nate,
you heard that, right?  
  
Q. Kyron, when you guys are, I think you were down actually 17 at one
point, what are you guys saying to yourself? I know what Coach said he said to
you, but what do you guys say to yourself about getting yourselves back into
this?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: We're out there on the court, and it's just how close we are
as a unit. We had a lot of times out there, Coach is not out there with us the
whole time, but we had a moment where we had to hold each other accountable.  
  
It's something that we didn't do early on in the year. But when we needed it
most, we did. We picked on some people, we started yelling at each other. But
we didn't take it personal and that was a big thing for us.  
  
We knew we had to pick each other up at the same time and bring that
intensity. And I think that helped us tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously Trevon Bluiett did not have his best game tonight, but
could you talk about what he's meant to that team and this league? And also I
saw you and Coach Willard had a nice moment after the game. What did Kevin say
to you?  
COACH COOLEY: Bluiett, I think he's one of the best scorers in college
basketball. He can beat you in a lot of different ways. He has a really quick
trigger. They do a great job freeing up for shots. You gotta be on high alert
with him.  
  
He's been a great joy to coach against and joy to watch grow. He's done some
unbelievable jobs for Xavier and I'm pretty sure they're going to miss him,
but they've got a lot of basketball ahead of him.  
  
As far as the conversation with Kevin and I, we just talked about how hard
these jobs are. But we talked about the excitement that's in this building,
and all of the skepticism when we relaunched our league, and God bless the Big
East. Again divine providence, brother, believe.  
  
Q. Did you see something in Kyron's eyes in the second half? Seemed like
in the last ten minutes of the second half in overtime he was going to do
whatever it took to win that game. And have you seen that before this year?
Just talk about what he was about in that second half.  
COACH COOLEY: I got two really young freshmen up here dying right now.  
  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I'll talk about it. When we came out started the half had a
little conversation with Makai and I told him I needed him to help me because
I didn't have it going in that first half.  
  
Without his driving to the basket and making plays early in the half, I
wouldn't have been able to do what I was able to do at the end. And I think he
really helped me out a lot out there tonight.  
  
Q. Kyron, the dunk, the jumper and the free throws in overtime there,
what comes over you in these moments? That's two nights in a row that you've
kind of taken over. What comes over you in those kinds of moments?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I don't know. The dunk. The dunk, I'm speechless. I don't
know what happened out there. It just happened.  
  
The jumper was just being aggressive, making a play. I created a little bit of
space and seniors have to step up to the moment and help the team. And I
thought I did that tonight. And I'm going to try to do that tomorrow night and
hopefully try to will my team to a championship.  
  
Q. You were getting dominated on the boards for the first two-thirds of
the game, and then over that course of that run Xavier was basically one-and-
done down the court every time. What changed that got your team to just clean
the glass?  
COACH COOLEY: Conversation in the huddles, talking about manning up. They're
one of the best rebounding teams and again they outrebounded us for a period
of time. But I thought we got timely -- we had a very aggressive conversation
in the huddle about growing up and living in the moment.  
  
And I thought our pressure defense was pretty good with respect to our half
court, pressuring them into some really, really tough shots. But the
personality of the group changed just on thought, you know, think about it and
execute.  
  
Q. Kyron, the charge that you took, Macura kind of coming at the rim
like that, was that the only play you think you probably could have made
there?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: No, we work on that drill all the time three on two, two on
one. And when I saw -- it might have been Goodin running on the side -- we do
that drill all the time. You've got to make that person have a little bit of
thought.  
  
So I jabbed at him and I kind of backed up to Goodin at first just to try to
make him think a little bit to make a decision. And I saw when he got ready to
leave his feet that I was in a position to take a charge, and that's something
I do often. Just trying to help the team.  
  
Q. Did the wins in the regular season over Xavier and Villanova give
your guys any extra swagger coming into this tournament?  
COACH COOLEY: No, not at all. I mean, you prepare to win. I said no, you're
prepared to win. They're great teams. We have some seniors as well. Kyron has
been through a lot of games over four years. Jalen has been in a lot of games.
Rodney has been in a lot of games.  
  
I hope our team is born with swag. Not so much just winning games, but winning
the game of life. You gotta walk through life like you own it, but be humble
and always be selfless. You know what I mean? That's what we teach our
players. But swag we're built for that, we're built for the moment. That's
just real.  
  
Q. Makai, I wanted to give you a chance to talk. When did you find out
you were going to play in the second half and what was that conversation like
with Kyron?  
MAKAI ASHTON-LANGFORD: I found out right -- he came in, Coach Ed Cooley came
in, right after halftime and just called my name. And he said get Kalif, our
center, and that's when I found out. The conversation with Kyron was he was
just telling me we need a spark, we need a spark on defense and offense.  
  
There was the game before, when we played them before, I came in gave the team
a little bit of spark, so that gave me a little momentum coming into this
game.  
  
Q. The last time you won this tournament you obviously had a big-time
guard who carried you to the title?  
COACH COOLEY: We still have a big-time guard.  
  
Q. Has he reminded you of that performance through two great games?  
COACH COOLEY: Great question, both Kyron and Bryson are different, but they're
-- he's stepping up to the moment. Actually it's a great question. I didn't
even think of that. And I'll reflect on that. But he's playing at that level.
Great, great question, seriously. But he won a championship. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Along with skill and Xs and Os and all that, what you guys are
talking about, this attitude and kind of collecting one another in a huddle,
does a team come back from 17 down to look one another in the eye and say man
up?  
COACH COOLEY: Absolutely. Great question again. I think that's when you talk
about having real conversations. You can't sugar foot stuff. When you're
trying to get these young men to go from 18 to 22 and get them to graduate,
you've got to have some real conversations with them. And part of that is
we're being soft. We're not playing together. We're not communicating.  
  
If we're going to advance and we have to move quicker. We have to do something
special. And the huddles have been very, very talkative and the coaches aren't
talking, the players are.  
  
When you get your players to talk, you're probably going to have some success
over the course of the season.  
  
Q. You touched on it earlier, but you talked about the atmosphere in
this building. What was the atmosphere like tonight? What was the building in
general mean to this conference?  
COACH COOLEY: I feel we're at the Dunkin' Donuts Center once again. I'm really
appreciative to all the fans that come out to this great tournament -- our
fans, Xavier's fans, Butler.  
  
The place is electric. I hope it's electric tomorrow. As far as the Providence
College fans, I couldn't be more appreciative of them to come out to support
our young men. Hopefully they do again tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Mikal Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30876)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 94, Marquette - 70  
  
COACH WRIGHT: Good effort. I'm really proud of our guys. I think early in the
game Marquette, I think they showed they played last night. They were a little
sharper than us early.  
  
We hung in there. I think the leadership of Jalen and Mikal just kept
everybody together. And then I think toward the middle of the second half I
think you saw the effects of Marquette playing last night. Then they got -- I
think we wore them down a little bit. It's tough to come back.  
  
And then I thought we played well. Just great leadership by these two, our
captains. I'm so happy they're on our side.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Jay, you shot well when you played Gonzaga in the Garden. Tonight
shot really well from 3 again. What is it about the building?  
COACH WRIGHT: I'm glad we do shoot it well in this building. I love this
building, but I don't help the shots. But thank God they do, because when you
play in this building they're always big games. So I think the guys do get
excited about playing here and we did shoot it well tonight. Thank God for
that.  
  
Q. Markus Howard had 16 in the first half and only seven in the second
half. Did you have any kind of game plan to slow him down or was it just good
effort by the guys?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think it was a combination, good effort. I thought we just
gave them too much space in the first half. I thought our guys just did a
great job in the second half. I thought they might have got a little worn
down. Last night was a tough, physical game for them, and I just thought they
got a little worn down. We were able to stay fresh as -- the latter part of
the second half, especially him and Rowsey.  
  
Q. Mikal, you have a philosophy of shoot them up, sleep in the streets.
What does that phrase mean to you guys?  
MIKAL BRIDGES: It means if you keep missing, if you're open keep shooting the
ball. We all have confidence in ourselves and missing shots don't really
affect us. So that's what we mean -- just keep shooting no matter what
happens.  
  
Q. You did shoot it well overall but not very well at the beginning as
you suggested. You had a timeout in there where you came back out and seemed
like you were determined to get to the inside, maybe get some fouls,
reestablish some fundamentals, is that what happened in that timeout?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, exactly. As I said, they played here last night. Rowsey
got hot last night. They looked really comfortable. They looked loose,
comfortable and they were making shots and we didn't. We didn't look loose, we
didn't look comfortable.  
  
We just said, let's get some movement and try to get to the rim and get some
easy baskets. I thought Mikal did a great job of that early. Eric Paschall
did, too.  
  
Q. How important is it for you guys to get points in offensive
transition especially after getting a quick turnover or working a team down in
the shot clock?  
COACH WRIGHT: Defenses are getting so good, especially in this league, that
when you get in their half court sets it's hard. It's hard to score. These
coaches and I think in our league are as prepared as anybody in this country.
So when you get a stop and the defense isn't set, it's really your best
opportunity to score.  
  
Q. Jalen, you guys have thoughts of really big things. But you always,
you guys always pour everything you can into this tournament, the Big East
Tournament. What does this mean to you?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I think every game here means a lot to us. Every game we play
like it's our last. We try not to take things for granted. We just focus on
one game at a time. So every game we play is a big game for us no matter who
we're playing, no matter what the opponent's record is or anything like that.
We just go out there play it like it's our last.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) special about this year, this tournament. What's
special about this tournament?  
JALEN BRUNSON: There's great tradition, great history in this arena. This
tournament has a lot of great memories. I mean, it's always a battle whenever
you're in a game here. So it's really special to play here.  
  
Q. Same question you were asked after the last game, but you're alone on
the career wins list with 414. Bigger things ahead, I know, but what does that
mean to you? And did you hear from Al's grandson after Saturday?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think I talked with Mark with Al's grandson, Mark Jackson. And
I'm mostly proud to be the coach of Villanova, honestly. The wins and
everything don't matter. I know I'll look back on it later.  
  
Makes me thank God for my wife because I'm out of my mind. If not for her, I
wouldn't have made it this far. My wife Patty is here. Thank God for her. And
then we'll think about all that later.  
  
I'm really excited that we're starting to get better defensively. That's
really what's in front of my mind right now. I really am. I'm just most
thankful to be the coach of Villanova. I feel like I've got the best job in
the country.  
  
Q. In the first ten minutes of the game all the scoring came from
Brunson and Bridges, and then after that you were able to get secondary guys
going. Do you attribute that more to Marquette wearing down, getting fatigued
or was there something specific you adjusted to start getting your other guys
going?  
COACH WRIGHT: Jalen and Mikal are our leaders. They know, to start the game,
they've got to get us going. And then after that with those two, their
experience allows them to just read how the defense is playing them.  
  
So they stay aggressive. Then they start finding their teammates and the team
adjusts and starts taking them away and then they find their teammates. I
think that's what happened in the first half of this game.  
  
Q. You always say you always learn from your previous experiences. What
can you take away from your games against Butler and Seton Hall this year?  
COACH WRIGHT: Both of them beat us obviously. Both of them are very, very
physical. I think we learned from both of those games, we have to be a little
tougher.  
  
And this game right here, this is going to be a battle. This is going to be a
physical battle because I think both of them are two of the most physical
teams in our league.  
  
Q. Chris Mack said earlier today it's just a strong statement for the
league that you're even being considered for two No. 1 seeds in the NCAA. And
he said he didn't know how that's going to work out. I know you don't know
that yet. But could you just share your thoughts on that, is there a big
statement being made here by the league this year and this weekend?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think so. I've said this a million times. You're sick of me
saying this, but I'm an old school Big East guy. I grew up with it; I love it.
And I was crushed when it broke up.  
  
I don't think I could've ever envisioned it was this big. If we all remember
-- it's never going to be the same. That was just a special time. But if you
think about it, what we all used to get so excited about was Georgetown would
be playing St. John's in here. They'd be 1, 2 -- 2, 3. Syracuse would be in
here, 2, 3.  
  
Well, we're doing the same thing now in the Big East. You've got Seton Hall is
in the Top 25. Butler is in the Top 25. Villanova and Xavier are playing 2-3.
Even earlier in the year we played some 1-4 games. That's what we used to all
love about the old Big East.  
  
I think what's unique about the league now is Butler could be in that
position. Seton Hall could be in that position. Creighton can be in that
position, has been. All these teams could be the Xavier/Villanovas. And it
wasn't that way in the old Big East. We have to admit that. This is pretty
cool. I'm excited where this league is right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

### [Markus Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32862)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 94, Marquette - 70  
  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously take our hats off to Villanova. There's a
reason why they have been as good as any team in the United States. And
tonight we ran into them at their best. They were terrific and we couldn't
match it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You switched to zone in the second half for a little bit. Villanova
starting shooting 3s. Was it breakdowns in defensive scheme or are they just a
hot-shooting team?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Boy, they can really shoot. But they started the second
half, they scored five of six of the first possessions in man. So we wanted to
try something else. And then they went five of six in zone.  
  
So it's a credit to their offensive power and their ability to shoot. We had a
hard time containing them off the dribble. And then when we tried to switch it
up they got 3-point shots. And I mean, they shot the eyes out of the ball.  
  
Q. I know it's early, but do you think your team has done enough
throughout the season to make the tournament on Sunday? And what will the next
three days be like for you and your team?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I believe we're an NCAA Tournament team. But that's not
something I get to decide on. I think our team has had a really good year,
especially considering our youth, and I think we've had a really good year.
And I think our team is capable of winning games in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But that's for somebody else to decide. We have to use the next three days to
get better. I mean, we still have season left. So we need to get better and
we'll try to approach it that way.  
  
Q. Markus, you left the game late in the second half for what looked
like a shoulder injury or something like that. What happened on that play how
are you feeling now?  
MARKUS HOWARD: I was coming off a down screen, and I collided with one of
their players. Right when I heard a pop I knew it was something I hadn't
experienced before. I wanted to be sure to get checked out by our athletic
trainer. Right now it's pretty sore, but I'll just follow whatever they tell
me to do.  
  
Q. So you guys start out pretty well. You're able to play Villanova on
par, but in the second half you guys fell apart, obviously. How much do you
think fatigue factored in when whereas Nova didn't have to play?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think fatigue was part of it. But you have to be
tougher than that. And again my hat's off to Villanova. I thought there was
some fatigue in what was going on, but it was mostly Villanova playing really
well.  
  
MARKUS HOWARD: To go off that, too. In March, we have to find ways to win. I
mean, a lot of teams are going to be going through the same stuff we are. We
can't let it affect us. The coaches did a great team scouting. Us as a team,
we have to execute better and have to play with that competitive edge on a
night-in-night-out basis, no matter how we're feeling, what the circumstances
are. We just have to bring it each and every night and tonight I don't think
we did that to the best of our ability.  
  
Q. The strengths on this league, seven of the 10 teams with 19 wins or
above. Just overall, you may have two No. 1 seeds or a 1 and 2 seed with
Xavier and Villanova?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think the Big East is the best conference in the
country. We had 70 percent of our teams in the tournament last year. And this
year the league's a lot better. I mean, that's saying something.  
  
Last year it was brutal. And 70 percent of our teams got in the NCAA
Tournament. The league's better this year. I mean, you're talking about we
played Xavier twice and Villanova three times.  
  
I mean, both those teams have a great chance to win a national championship.
And the quote/unquote, middle of the pack, I put it up against any other
conference in the country. And the fact that we don't get to have unbalanced
schedules and you have to play everybody in a home and away makes it -- I
think it's the best conference in the country. And I hope other people would
view it that way as well.  
  
Q. Markus, you didn't have a shot in the second half yesterday against
DePaul. You came out aggressively today. What was your mindset to start the
game today?  
MARKUS HOWARD: It was just move on to the next. I mean, I can't really focus
on one game and what happened in the last game. I have to come out aggressive
and do what I can for my team.  
  
I knew that's what I had to do today and I just tried to do that from the
jump. But there were certain spurts where you need to let the game come to me.
But just when the team's as hot as they were, it's kind of hard to get in a
flow like that. But great credit to them, like Coach said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Marvin Clark II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34865)

### [Justin Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34842)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 88, St. John's - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for St. John's, please.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously it's a tough loss today. But I'm wondering how hard
is it, coming off only playing 14 hours ago against Georgetown, how hard is it
to come in and play a team like Xavier?  
COACH MULLIN: They're a tough team to play against under any conditions. They
just are a really good team through and through. Got great guards. They're
physical.  
  
The turnaround is what it is. It's scheduled out and that's what you get for
coming in ninth.  
  
Q. You were able to win yesterday; unfortunately not today. What do you
take out of the Big East Tournament going forward?  
MARVIN CLARK II: Like Coach said that's what you get for being ninth. Biggest
thing I take from it try to finish in the top 5, try to be a top 5 seed so you
get a better break. But it's our league. It's a good league, great league.
We've known that throughout the year.  
  
JUSTIN SIMON: Basically what Marvin said. It's been one of the best leagues in
the country. Hopefully next year we'll try to finish in the top 5, go from
there.  
  
Q. I understand it's just been a few minutes since the loss but can you
look back at this season? There seemed to be some real lows and some real
highs. How do you sort of assess the entire season?  
COACH MULLIN: I really haven't assessed the whole season, but, yeah, you're
right on, we got off to a good start. Had a horrendous January and I thought
we played pretty well the last 10 games. So up and down, inconsistent for
different reasons, different circumstances.  
  
But these two guys here and the guys that played the bulk of the minutes, I
thought they did a good job handling different things that were thrown at
them, just absorbing it, being accountable and just kind of moving on.  
  
Q. Any momentum, anything that you take from the last part of the season
here? You started to play better, it seemed.  
COACH MULLIN: I think it's clear when we played unselfishly, played together,
we're a pretty good ball club. And when we didn't, we struggled. A lot of
times we had some close games that didn't go our way, but I thought we fought
through that and to finish up the way we did I thought was impressive after
having that tough stretch in January.  
  
Q. With what you guys showed in February, with what you have coming back
and what you have coming in, does next year kind of have to be like your
breakthrough year to finally, to get into the NCAA? You've had gradual
improvement. Now next year looks like you could have some depth, you could
have some more size. Do you kind of look at next year as the time to break
through?  
COACH MULLIN: Believe it or not I haven't really looked that far ahead yet.
I'm sure you'll put that timeline on me, so I'll be looking forward to that.
(Laughter.) And we'll see who does come back. But to me the most important
thing is going to be another good work in the summer. We had a great
offseason; I think that's what propelled us to the good start.  
  
So that's probably, to me that's the next part of the development is the
summer offseason program. These guys will lead that and we'll get a good
summer we should improve.  
  
Q. Marvin and Justin, if there's any lessons that you guys learned this
season, what were they?  
MARVIN CLARK II: I would say you know how you handle distractions, how you
handle distractions and how you go about every day on and off the floor. I
think that's one of the biggest things. Like Coach said, consistency.  
  
We have reasons within our team, within our program that were kind of
distractions to our team. But the biggest thing, it's just what Coach has
instilled in us is how we bounce back. And I think having that 11-game stretch
of losing, losing, losing, losing, I think most people would have cowered and
tucked their tail and ran. I'm proud of our team for fighting back and making,
salvaging something out of the season.  
  
And I think that's just goes from what Coach has instilled in us and what he's
talked to us about night in night out.  
  
Q. Marvin and Justin, after the first half it was a back and forth, good
pace of the game. What adjustments do you think Xavier made in the second half
to kind of open up the lead?  
JUSTIN SIMON: I'm not sure what adjustments they made, but they definitely
stepped up their defense. I thought they guarded us well and they got out and
ran. And they were scoring the ball. And it was hard to stop them when they
were going.  
  
MARVIN CLARK II: Made shots, spread us out. Trevon Bluiett is a tremendous --
great scorer. He made a lot of shots, made a lot of big plays for them and
extended the lead for them.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of Shamorie Ponds, have you advised him or will you
advise him in terms of going in and maybe testing the waters in a couple of
camps this offseason? And what do you think of his chances of coming back?  
COACH MULLIN: I haven't advised him as of yet. I think the setup for the kids
now is perfect. They can get out, get all the information, transparently,
gather all the information and make a smart decision.  
  
I guess there's a lot of people out there that have opinions, but there's only
30 people that matter, it's the 30 GMs in the NBA. Whether it be Twitter or
Facebook or all the stuff you follow, the only people that matter are the 30
men that run the NBA teams. And he'll get his input, like every player in
college can, get transparent information and make a smart decision.  
  
Q. Did you feel they ran up the score in the last minute or so, and what
did you see in terms of the bit of scuffle in postgame?  
COACH MULLIN: I didn't see anything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Marcus Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27910)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Providence -72, Creighton - 68 (OT)  
  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I felt coming into this game that it was going to be kind of
a rock fight. It usually is when we play Providence, and today certainly fit
into that category.  
  
You know, they went small. Our metric said they do it about 20, 22 percent of
the time on the year. Probably wasn't anticipating 90 percent of the time
today.  
  
And I thought our guys adjusted to it pretty well. We had some lineups out
there that have not been out there together all season. And we just kind of
had to figure it out.  
  
And as I told the team, there's some things in the game you can control. You
can control your execution. Can't always control whether the shot goes in. And
we executed some stuff great. Marcus got a great look at a 3 when we were down
two in overtime.  
  
Obviously Mitch got a wide-open look at the end to tie it. And we missed some
free throws from guys that normally make them that are good foul shooters.  
  
So obviously they bullied us a little bit right at the end of regulation with
a couple of offensive rebounds that turned out to, end up being the difference
in the game. But we were really small out there at that point.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Alpha was a big matchup problem out in the second match against
Providence and today with Ronnie a little kind of coming back and Mitch having
to play the 4, how did you go about kind of trying to at least limit that as
much as possible?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Well, we were trying to shrink the floor a little, at least
make the driving lanes difficult. And at times we did a good job at that. At
times we were a little bit late with our post front or a little late with the
help, I think we got beat over the top one time for a layup.  
  
He's a hard matchup. Hard matchup for anybody, especially hard matchup for us
when we're forced to play five guards. Somebody has to guard Bullock. And
obviously you don't ever want to let Cartwright get going, because when
Cartwright gets going, they win. Period.  
  
That's why when they made the change in the starting lineup, we went Taz on
Cartwright and moved Marcus around and late, when we put Khyri on Bullock,
Marcus did a great job on Cartwright. So defensively they thought 36 percent
for the game. So we played well enough defensively to win.  
  
Q. Could you go a little bit deeper in that, with five guards, obviously
you might be giving up some size inside --  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Might be?  
  
Q. Yeah. (Laughter). How did you work through that decision. Why did you
feel the need to go five guards?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: They really started to attack that matchup. They were driving
Jake or Toby, kind of whoever was in there. And I didn't feel like we were --
the first half we got enough out of Jake on the offensive end to roll the dice
on the defensive end.  
  
Second half, they did a better job on some of their switches and some of their
help. It was almost like we were trying too hard to get him a touch down
there. As a result we turned it over a couple times.  
  
I thought Davion was doing good things. I thought Ty-Shon made some great
reads. We decided to go small so we could switch more stuff. If you're leaving
Toby and Jake out there, obviously you're not switching the screen and putting
them on Cartwright. So our options were limited if we stayed with that lineup.  
  
Q. Marcus and Coach, the final couple of minutes, and especially,
Marcus, the final try at the buzzer in regulation, can you go back through
those last minute or two; you scored every point I think for Creighton, and
also what you were trying to do on that last shot.  
MARCUS FOSTER: Yeah, Coach has been telling us all week just keep driving, get
in the paint, set our feet, and we could get what we wanted.  
  
I was just focusing on getting in the paint, trying to hesitate them a little
bit, just to get them off so they could rise on my shot and get the easy
layup. The last play is something that I always work on. And I was doing too
much, trying to dribble too much into my shot. But I was looking for the step-
back 3 like I always do and I just lost it and we ended up going overtime.  
  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Marcus made some really good plays to get us to that point.
And if you take a timeout, you run the risk of them being able to keep the
ball out of your best player's hands. When we're coming down with nine seconds
left and the ball is in our best player's hands, that's about as comfortable
as I can get in that situation.  
  
He's made a lot of great plays during the course of the season and, frankly,
during the course of his career in those situations.  
  
Just a fluke deal. He lost the ball. Diallo is a good defender. But he didn't
get a hand on it or anything. Marcus just lost it. And, like I said, sometimes
that happens.  
  
Q. Did either of you guys say anything to Mitch after the game. It
seemed like he was, obviously, pretty -- understandably -- down about missing
that shot?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: All you can control is your preparation. I work in the same
building where we practice. So I know how much time this guy spends in there
working on those situations. And I know how much time Mitch spends in there.
Usually because the music he plays is a little different than everybody
else's, so I know it's him, him or Tyler Clement.  
  
So they're in there, working at it, preparing themselves for that moment. As
long as you can look at yourself in the mirror and say: You know what, I
prepared myself, I just missed it.  
  
And I'm confident, I think Marcus would agree with me, that we're very
comfortable with Mitch taking that shot in that situation. It was a great
read. And we got the shot we wanted. We just missed it.  
  
Q. Since you mentioned the music, what kind of music does he listen
to?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: His has a little bit more country flare to it maybe than what
Marcus listens to. (Laughter). I actually enjoy Mitch's playlist a little bit
more than Marcus'.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Kaiser Gates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33247)

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 88, St. John's - 60  
  
COACH MACK: Coming into the game we have a ton of respect for St. John's
knowing that in both contests this year it was nip and tuck. They could have
beaten us at Cintas, they could have beaten us at Carnesecca. I know it got
the attention of our guys. And they've got some threatened players.  
  
And I'm sure the quick turnaround for those guys didn't help. I thought in the
first and second half we defended our tails off. I thought we really locked
in, tried to keep Shamorie out of the lanes as best we could, had really good
backside coverage on whoever was rolling for St. John's.  
  
And offensively I thought we did a really good job. We had five turnovers at
half. We just missed a normal amount of shots around the basket. And told
those guys, hey, can't control sometimes when shots go in, but what you can
control is your effort on the offensive glass. When we got a couple to pop in
the second half on the offensive end it kept up our defensive intensity,
that's where we gained the separation.  
  
Not easy to beat St. John's on their home floor. But we did. And hopefully
we'll be ready to go tomorrow night against the winner, Creighton or
Providence.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, the game was pretty much in hand at that point, but was it
frustrating to see some of your players hoisting 3-pointers with such a big
lead, not using much of the clock or errant passes not using much of the clock
up in the final minutes?  
COACH MACK: We want to certainly get the most out of possessions. But I think
I have a very experienced group, guys for the most part make the right
decision.  
  
And if you're going to press, you essentially get a free press if you're not
willing to attack. And I think it wasn't a seven-point lead; it was a 15-,
16-point lead, and we're going to keep our foot on the gas pedal.  
  
And Tre, on the one in front of our bench, it was right on. He looked at me,
Coach, we'll get good ones next time down the floor. And so I don't have any
bad feeling about how we executed down the stretch.  
  
Q. What was the key to taking Shamorie out of the game as you guys did
until pretty much the game was in hand?  
COACH MACK: It's tough, I'll be honest, he'll make some contested shots that
can zap your confidence defensively at times.  
  
But he missed some of those. We made him use the ball screen rather than
reject it. And, again, I think our guys on the backside did a really good job
of limiting his options, roll man, skip pass.  
  
But it starts with really good communication from our 5 man so they know the
ball screen is coming and which direction and try to corral them as best we
could. And I thought our guys did a terrific job of that today.  
  
Q. Trevon, you've gotten a lot of attention on a national level this
year, but how motivated are you to prove that you're one of the best in the
country on this stage and in the weeks ahead?  
TREVON BLUIETT: You know, necessarily prove -- I don't think I'm really trying
to prove something. It's just my confidence is how I feel. I feel like who I
am is who I am, and a lot of things is coming down here and trying to win one
goal and that's just trying to win the Big East championship. And that's just
me playing my hardest for my team, making sacrifices for my team.  
  
And if my work for my team comes out and says, hey, Trevon has proven himself,
so be it. But not necessarily trying to prove myself, just trying to come down
here and win games.  
  
Q. Points off turnovers, one of the strengths of the St. John's team,
you guys held them to two points in that part of the game. What went into that
aspect for you guys, stopping them from scoring?  
TREVON BLUIETT: I think we were locked in. We knew that Justin Simon and
Shamorie Ponds used a lot of ball screens and they're the ones to make a lot
of plays. And I think our guards did a good job executing, taking them out of
their game a little bit, staying in tune to the game plan, knowing what we're
supposed to do on ball screens and kind of taking them out of the game a
little bit, kind of worked for us.  
  
Q. Just what happened in that postgame handshake right there?  
COACH MACK: I'm not going to throw anybody under the bus. Couple of guys
didn't want to shake hands. But it was quickly squelched. Let's concentrate
and worry about the game.  
  
Q. For the players, just how much of the focus is coming here proving
you're not only the best team in the Big East, that you can beat Villanova and
can do it when it really matters the most?  
KAISER GATES: I didn't hear the beginning of the question.  
  
Q. How much is it coming here the focus to beat Villanova when it
matters the most in the --  
KAISER GATES: Our focus really isn't on Villanova right now. We've got to take
it one game at a time. Right now we focus on winning the next game.  
  
Q. Could you talk, Macura played a great all-around game. Talk about his
passing, seems to not only make the right pass but hitting people right in the
shooting pocket constantly.  
COACH MACK: J.P., I got asked this when I was asked the question about him not
being on the first- or second-team all-league, and again it's a terrific
league. There are some great plays; it's no slight if you don't make an all-
conference team.  
  
But I think so many of the things that he does very well don't necessarily
resonate or show in the box scores.  
  
Certainly he might get an assist but again is the guy shooting in his shooting
pocket or is he catching it at his toes? He also makes those plays where he
just seems to maybe deflect the pass that one of his teammates gets credit for
the steal, but he was the guy that was sort of the instigator in that. He does
a lot of things whether it's set screens, plays multiple positions as do a lot
of our guys.  
  
He's got win-first/J.P. second, and he's not alone. We've got a lot of players
like that in the locker room, all of them.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously knowing there's a lot of postseason left to play,
but is the success you've had at Xavier this year with the record in the first
regular season title, is that kind of the hilltop for you just being able to
reach that level at Xavier especially being a Xavier guy?  
COACH MACK: I don't look at it as my success. I don't. We can run some really
good plays. And if Tre goes 0-for-11, those plays don't look really good.  
  
If Kaiser doesn't have great energy to go to the glass, get some offensive
rebounds, we all don't look very good.  
  
What I love about our team is the connectivity we have, the togetherness that
we play with, and we're playing some really, really good teams.  
  
So the mountaintop, the mountaintop for us was winning the Big East regular
season championship. And now we've got hopefully some more mountains to climb.  
  
Q. Coach, how much focus goes into developing a game plan knowing you're
up against a team that played 19 hours earlier and rotating your players in
and trying to run as much against them to make fatigue a factor in a game?  
COACH MACK: I didn't tell it to these guys, because I didn't want to put any
negativity in their heads. I felt -- I know you're on it. I know if there's
any team in the conference that didn't necessarily, weren't necessarily going
to get tired it would probably be St. John's. All those guys play 36, 37
minutes.  
  
They're athletic. They're not -- sorry, Matt -- they're not huffing and
puffing up and down like Stainbrook like a couple of years ago; Bluiett as a
freshman.  
  
(Laughter).  
  
But we knew -- it's hard because we didn't know who we were playing. The guy
that had the scout for my staff didn't come over and watch the game because we
felt by the time he would get back to the hotel, get ready to present it, it
would be 11:30. What advantage is that? We had it live scouted by another
assistant.  
  
But St. John's for us is simple in the fact that take care of the ball, which
we didn't do really well the first two games. I think we had, what, seven
turnovers today. To do that on their floor, that was the biggest thing of
keeping them out of transition with our turnovers and tough shots. And we did
that. And I think that's one of the reasons the outcome is what it was.  
  
Q. How do you feel about Trevon's shooting today?  
COACH MACK: I liked it. (Laughter) I like it almost every night.  
  
Q. I know there's a lot of basketball left to be played, but there's a
chance we could get two 1 seeds out of this league. Considering where it
started from, people questioning whether it could last, what does it say about
how talented this league can possibly be?  
COACH MACK: Says a lot. We had 70 percent of our league making the NCAA
Tournament a year ago. So often they talk about how many teams get in. Well,
we have a smaller pool of teams, and this year's been a dogfight. We certainly
came on the right end of a couple of one-possession games.  
  
But I'm not smart enough and haven't been in this position enough to know 1
seed, 2 seed. I think these guys are always cognizant of the fact when we were
an 11 seed it added an extra 1 and it didn't matter a year ago.  
  
We've got to go out there and play with desperation and want the game more,
and hopefully we continue that ride here as we play on in March.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 72, Creighton - 68 (OT)  
  
COACH COOLEY: There's a reason I brought all the seniors here. Alpha played
well. This senior class has been an amazing group for us to coach, to see
these young men grow up, up and down year with some injuries and more
importantly our health. But I thought that was a great team win.  
  
You can't say enough about the Big East, you really can't, and the competitive
nature of our game. The spirit that's always in this building, great, great
atmosphere. It's a credit to Val and what she's doing with our league.  
  
But today was a win that I thought our players went out and earned. We made a
lot of mistakes but I thought we were good when we needed to be.  
  
Coach McDermott does an unbelievable job. They had a wide open shot to tie the
game. But today divine Providence was on our side. It really was. And that
word is engrained in my soul; divine Providence goes a long way.  
  
And I couldn't be more proud of these guys. They made timely plays, timely
shots and free throws across the board. I thought the entire team played well.
But we have our four seniors here for a reason.  
  
This is going to be the first time in history of Providence College that a
recruited class goes to four consecutive tournaments, and I can't be more
proud of this group for doing so, which is really, really hard to do given
where we took this program from to where we're trying to go. It's a credit to
what these young men have done.  
  
I'm proud of them. They'll all be college graduates. And at the end as much as
we want to win my job is to build them up as men and make sure they're
educated so many of you out there that own your companies can hire them. So
they've got a free interview right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You missed a lot of free throws through the second half -- second
half one-on-ones and two-shot fouls. Then overtime you started making free
throws. Talk about timely shots. How did the guys respond to the pressure?  
COACH COOLEY: You know, I mean, they're older guys. We've missed some free
throws. I think we made the ones we had to make. As much as we want to make
all of them it's part of the game. You encourage them to make the next one.
You don't beat them up for missing.  
  
Today -- I was the free throw coach, so I'll penalize myself -- but we made
enough to win the game. Hopefully tomorrow against a really talented Xavier
team we're better.  
  
Q. Creighton only attempted nine 3s in the second half. What did you do
defensively to maybe limit some of their open looks limit, limit some of the
chances they normally would have taken from that area?  
COACH COOLEY: Since the launch of our great league, I think we've played
Creighton more than anybody. We're used to the style of play each other. Very
competitive games, all of our games are very competitive especially in this
wonderful building.  
  
High alert. We both scout really well. And if you take away their 3s and make
it tough 2s you're going to position yourself to have an opportunity to win,
because I think they have one of the most explosive scores in college
basketball in Foster.  
  
Q. You've talked to us several times about the atmosphere out there.
Today it was almost like you were either playing in Omaha or Providence. What
does that feel like? If any of the guys want to talk about on a Thursday
afternoon, quarterfinals. It was really something out there.  
COACH COOLEY: I'll let them answer first because I'd like to answer that.  
  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Playing in the Garden, play here a lot. It's like, feels
like our second home sometimes. We got a lot of great alumni who come out, a
lot of great fans, a lot of students here from the New York area.  
  
They always come out. They support us. They're really loud out there and we
feed off their energy. They're a part of the team, just like we are. We're on
the court but they also helped us to get that win.  
  
Q. What was your defensive idea was both at the end of regulation and
that Ballock shot, you could have chose to foul there?  
COACH COOLEY: We talked about it. We talked about it several times. 8.8
seconds left, the length of the court, do we want to foul. At first I wanted
to, and then the players told me no. And sometimes you gotta listen to the
players. They play a game. We see the game.  
  
They got open, whether it was miscommunication, we didn't switch the right
way. At the end of the day they missed a shot. They got a great look, wide
open look, maybe the look they wanted, but again divine Providence.  
  
Q. Alpha, can you talk about the last run in regulation? Foster lost the
ball.  
ALPHA DIALLO: It was tie game.  
  
COACH COOLEY: We're slow, not dumb.  
  
ALPHA DIALLO: I tried to stay in front of him. Tried to contest the shot, if
he was to pull up or don't allow him to get an easy drive right to the basket.  
  
COACH COOLEY: I do want to reflect on the question you had with respect to
Omaha and Providence. I think it's a credit to the Big East. Again, I go back
to where we came from and where we're trying to go, all the naysayers saying
the old Big East.  
  
Our Big East is as dominant as any conference in the country. And I think the
product on the floor, when people come out to support us -- the fan base
coming from Omaha, coming from Butler, coming from Ohio -- tells you the brand
and the product that's on the floor and people are excited to see it. And I
think it's a credit to the leadership of the conference.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned that you made the NCAA Tournament four straight years
now. Coming in on the bubble, is that a motivation to kind of control your own
destiny?  
COACH COOLEY: Whose bubble?  
  
Q. I guess you didn't feel like you had any pressure, the added pressure
then to make the tournament.  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I'll take that one. We never were thinking about that coming
in here. It's our senior class. These guys up here, it's our last chance to
play in this building like this. And we just want to play hard and leave it
all on the floor. Our goal at the beginning of the year, we say it every year,
is just to get to the tournament and try to win every day.  
  
You gotta focus on the data that's at hand. You can't look past anybody
because everybody in this league is so great. And we did that today. We're
looking forward to getting back on that court tomorrow.  
  
Q. Alpha, for you to have the second half that you did and force
overtime, being from New York and from this area, what does that mean for you
to help your team get to the tournament, like Coach said, doing it in this
building? Must be special to you.  
ALPHA DIALLO: It's very special because I have family and everyone, they come
down to support. And they all -- they make it up to Providence some games, but
when I'm home they're always here. So it was great to play in front of that
crowd and my family was there. So it was also good.  
  
Q. Rodney and Alpha, Creighton is a team that doesn't foul a lot, but
you really forced them to foul; I think you played more physical. Was that
part of the mentality? What did you guys try to do to get inside and attack
their defense?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: Coach emphasized earlier during the week in practice to tell
us just to post these guys up. We had a lot of mismatches, and we ran a lot of
plays for us to get the balls in the post and play off the post.  
  
We knew a few guys would get double teamed, he told us, and we just made a
play out of that. And we happened to get them in foul trouble.  
  
Q. There's nothing like playing at Madison Square Garden. And it's
obvious that you have the fans on your side. Do you feel that's an advantage
to you against a very strong Xavier team tomorrow?  
JALEN LINDSEY: Yeah, definitely. Like Kyron said before we played here many,
many times, so we have a great feel of the court. And obviously being so close
to home, from Providence, we have a bunch of fans and alumni who actually
moved to New York and come to see us play. We have fans who travel across the
country to watch us and stuff like that.  
  
We're playing against a really, really good team in Xavier, and I think it is
an advantage, but I think it's more of how we play than just the crowd.  
  
Q. Xavier shoots a very high -- they're one of the best free-throw
shooting teams in the country, where you guys were shooting in the 60s today,
which means that -- the question, though, is let me go back to the 8.8 seconds
and you made the decision you took it on your backs to not foul in that
situation. It's a double bonus, and you foul and how many free throws do they
get? They're getting from any point on the court. Was the team, like, bone-on-
bone kind of thing, we're going to win this? Is that correct from you guys?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: When you step on the court playing for Coach Cooley he
instills a lot of confidence in us. And we came to each other in the huddle
before we saw Coach, and we looked in each other's eyes and it was, like,
we've got to get this stop, we're going to get that stop.  
  
We had that look in our face. As soon as Coach asked us, we all knew at the
same time we wanted to say no. And we just wanted to gut it out and we were
going to leave it all out on the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Khadeen Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30570)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Butler - 75, Seton Hall - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Take us through what you saw in the final defensive sequence, and why
wasn't Angel in the game at that time?  
COACH WILLARD: They've run the same play against us at home, on the road. They
were just going to bring Wideman up and crack 'em. So Mike being a better
pick-and-roll defender was on Wideman to try to stop Baldwin. Baldwin was just
having his way with the pick-and-roll. So I thought Mike did a good job of
challenging it late, and Wideman did a great job following it, tipping it.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts on Desi Rodriguez's ability to play? I know
he did it with the injured ankle. I saw you guys using him off the ball a lot,
gave you a lot of energy in terms of backdoor cuts. What were your thoughts on
how he played today?  
COACH WILLARD: I thought Desi and Ish for two guys really battling injuries
worked hard over the last two weeks to try to get themselves in position to be
able to play.  
  
I knew Desi would probably only be able to play in the first half, because
sitting at halftime, his foot was going to get cold. I thought both guys gave
us a really good lift, especially Ish in the first half, the way he shot the
basketball.  
  
Q. General thoughts on how hard fought that game was and what kind of
motivation can this kind of game give guys you heading into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH WILLARD: That's what I told the team. I said guys you have two teams
that know each other, two teams that play extremely hard. Both teams made some
great plays. All the players, I thought, played -- I thought that was a
typical Big East Tournament game.  
  
I'm going to look at the positive side for it. And that's the first time we're
going to have a chance to get some rest going into the NCAA Tournament. We're
going to take the rest. We're going to use it to practice and get a little
sharper on some things that we've been doing well at.  
  
But you've got to give them credit: I think both teams made some great plays
and they made the last one.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you saw they were running a lot of the similar
plays that you saw them run earlier in the season, but did you see any kind of
evolution in Coach LaVall's coaching style? You saw him evolve over the three
times you saw him three times you saw him over the season in his first year on
the job?  
COACH WILLARD: I think LaVall has done a remarkable job coming into the
situation he came under, getting the job late.  
  
I think he's really doing a good job of utilizing Martin, Wideman and Kamar
Baldwin. That's one thing I've noticed from the first time we played to them
to now was how much more they've gotten involved in the offense and they've
been the focal point.  
  
But I think LaVall has -- the league is lucky to have him. Obviously Butler is
lucky to have him. And he's done a phenomenal job.  
  
Q. Khadeen, after you guys went up 14 in the first half, did you notice
anything different? Was it more what they did than maybe you guys not doing
the same thing? What do you think changed after that big lead?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I'm not sure what changed. It's just that they went on
their run. We had our runs and they just had the last run. But I think we
still continued to try to play defense. Baldwin was hot tonight. So it was
hard to stop him.  
  
I mean, last game Martin was hot. And today it was Baldwin was hot. So it was
kind of tough to stop them. But at the end of the day they made the last play
that counted.  
  
Q. You mentioned this briefly, Kevin, but what did you see from Desi and
Ish today as far as where they are at now, where they have to get to in the
next week?  
COACH WILLARD: I'm much more bullish on Ish where he is. Just because Ish is
used to playing with injuries. He's had them his whole career. So he's used to
playing with them. He understands what the pain is.  
  
Desi is a different story. This is the first time Desi ever has been hurt in
his career. So he's having a hard time understanding what the pain is and what
he can fight through.  
  
But I think, again, having three or four more days off, rest, I feel good
about both of them about going into Thursday or Friday.  
  
I think by the time Thursday or Friday comes, it will be three full weeks for
Desi, getting those guys back healthy. And the way the young guys are playing,
I like where we're at.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Butler - 75, Seton Hall - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment.  
  
COACH JORDAN: That's a heck of a way to finish the night in Madison Square
Garden. This is an unbelievable venue, unbelievable time of year, Big East
Tournament in Madison Square. My first time around and that was just an epic
ending to a great day of Big East basketball.  
  
I'm proud of our guys, just extremely proud. We talked about embracing the
battle. Obviously Seton Hall is very, very talented. Really good basketball
team and well coached and they've beaten us twice.  
  
We knew what it was going to take. It wasn't a game of perfect but we didn't
hang our heads when things didn't go our way. We were down and we just fought
back and battled back. And we've seen that out of this group before. We know
we had it in us and it was great to see it come out at this moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. First win for Butler in the tournament. It's a big one and the
question for you is off the top, what does that mean? It's your first win as
well, of course, being Butler's first year --  
COACH JORDAN: More important, these two guys next to me, that was a big goal
of theirs was to get a win in the Big East Tournament before they get out of
here. And so poetic justice that big cat right here gets the big tip-in to get
it done.  
  
It's not necessarily about me. It was this team hadn't been to the Big East
Tournament before. That was the other teams. So these guys had set their minds
to do something as a group and you knew it was going to take a togetherness
and a toughness and we showed that tonight.  
  
Q. How does it feel pretty much to come to Seton Hall's backyard, being
across the river in New Jersey and being able to gut out a tough win?  
COACH JORDAN: Like I said, I'm just proud of our guys. It's interesting having
played them just last weekend, to turn it right around and doing it again.  
  
So obviously our preparation I thought was really good. Guys were engaged.
They saw the mistakes that we made before. Thought we did an unbelievable job
in the post on Delgado. Our big guys fought their tails off and our help side
was really good to protect the paint.  
  
And they've got -- Carrington stepped up made a big play, and Powell stepped
up and made a big play. We know they're capable of that. But they responded
and that stands out in terms of what we're proud of as a staff.  
  
Q. Kamar, you obviously had a fantastic game and you were down seven, I
think, with about six minutes left and went on a 6-0 run to cut it down to
one. How were you able to flip that switch against a tough Seton Hall team?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Just continuing to play our style. Our motto is gritty, not
pretty. We battled; we knew it was going to be a battle the whole game. In the
huddle, we talked amongst each others, the players, (indiscernible) we need to
get stops and get it back, and that's what we did to trim the lead down.  
  
COACH JORDAN: I thought our mindset was what it needed to be. Last game they
beat us points in the paint. Generally when we've won points in the paint
we've won basketball games. We said that a few times. We talked about that in
timeouts and we just had to keep an aggressive mindset, punching it in into
the post. I thought Kam delievered. He was 4-for-4 from the field. And Nate
did a good job driving it. Kamar was downhill, making good decisions. That's
where we had to play. It wasn't falling from 3, like normal, so we just had to
keep attacking the paint.  
  
Q. Kelan, we talked earlier, last week you talked about how you didn't
want to go winless in your career at the Garden. Can you put it in
perspective, getting on the board in the Big East Tournament, going to the
semifinals?  
KELAN MARTIN: I think we just stuck to the game plan, the scouting report, and
we just did a good job on Delgado, not letting him get easy touches. And we
just played within ourselves offensively.  
  
We didn't make shots, but we attacked the basket and you're going to have
games like that, just a grind-it-out game. And now we're just moving on to the
next game.  
  
Q. The two guys involved in the last play, there was a miss and rebound.
Could you walk us through what you saw on the play.  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Cat came up and set a screen, and I was just trying to get to
the basket because the big -- I was able to get there. I wasn't able to
finish. Then Cat, like we always say, the bigs just finish rolling, and that's
what he did and put it back in for the win.  
  
TYLER WIDEMAN: Yeah, pretty much what he said. (Laughter).  
  
Q. On that final play, you let the guys run it down the court with 11
seconds left. You didn't call a timeout. Can you just discuss the trust you
have in them to execute when the game is on the line?  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I thought the St. John's game, I blew it by calling
timeout. Obviously when you spend a lot of time together, we've been through
some battles. We've come back from worse than this. Think about Ohio State and
Georgetown earlier in our season. So that builds a trust in those moments.  
  
And they didn't have timeouts. So the big thing was I didn't want them to be
able to set their defense. We had time at the line. Paul came in and made sure
he communicated what we were running to everybody.  
  
And so we got ourselves organized without having to use the timeout and
letting them get set and try to take something away.  
  
Q. Kamar, there were several points in the game where it looked like you
almost refused to leave Madison Square Garden until you guys won. But what was
your thought as soon as you missed that second free throw and you saw Seton
Hall with the second layup?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Just to get a stop. I take pride on the defensive end. Even
though I missed it, I knew we were going to get a stop and that we were going
to win the game, because that's the work we put in day in, day out.  
  
Q. This is in terms of how you guys were able to really crash the boards
in the second half. What were some things you saw in terms of at halftime that
you emphasized to your team to get the extra opportunities in the close
game?  
COACH JORDAN: Great question. We talked about that exactly at halftime where
Key was in the paint and Kamar was in the paint, and they were bringing
rotating defenders with them. When we played against them we've gotten to the
glass on the offensive end.  
  
Cat was averaging about three a game, Sean McDermott about three and Sean, he
got four tonight, and obviously Cat got the big one late. That was part of the
conversation at halftime was we're not shooting it great, so we need to go get
some extras. And so guys started going harder and going harder and going in
there fearlessly. Obviously that's what they do is rebound the basketball. You
know it's going to be a fight to go get them but our guys fought.  
  
Q. LaVall, what was it that Butler was doing schematically different in
the second half, Seton Hall shot 65 percent the first half, 29 percent in the
second. Sometimes shots dropping is a matter of chance, but that's a pretty
pronounced difference?  
COACH JORDAN: I don't know if it was a scheme. It was more will. It was more
will than strategy. We let them get -- the first half, obviously, Sanogo, he
hit two 3s, part of the plan was to stay off of him and he made us pay. And
give them credit for stepping up.  
  
But then we had to fight better in the post. Our help side had to be better.
That was part of the game plan all along. We had a will about us in the second
half to do it.  
  
Then it came down to rebounding. They got one or two where we didn't go get
the 50/50 balls and the long ones. But that's what it came down to at the end
was getting them off the glass and us getting to the glass.  
  
Q. Coming in at .500 in the regular season, was getting yourself off the
bubble extra motivation for this game?  
COACH JORDAN: No, I think beating Seton Hall. And there's motivation for these
guys to get a win here in Madison Square finally. But I think the biggest
thing was we had been right there with them. At our place we had them down 11
and they came back and got us.  
  
At their place it was a battle back and forth late and they got us again. And
so these guys did not want the same taste in their mouth walking out of here
playing against the same team again. That's difficult to do. And we just had
to find a way to do it.  
  
Q. Do you think this secures an NCAA Tournament spot?  
COACH JORDAN: I think there's one way to definitely secure an NCAA Tournament
spot. We're playing in the semifinals tomorrow.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Andrew Rowsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32863)

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Marquette - 72, DePaul - 69  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach and Andrew?  
  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: It's a great win for our team and our program. Really
proud of our guys. We fought through a lot of adversity. Our guys showed great
toughness. Obviously there's a lot of game pressure on us.  
  
We have tremendous respect for DePaul. Their length in all three games,
especially the last two, has presented a lot of problems for us offensively.
But our guys found a way to win and that's what this time of year is about.  
  
So we're very proud of the win. It was a great game for us and we feel great
about advancing in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to get your thoughts about how you're able to
emphasize execution, especially with DePaul tying the game at 61, and you were
able to push it, get a quick 5-0 run. What was your thinking out of that
timeout to try to emphasize execution?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: A tremendous amount of game pressure on us at that point.
We were fortunate to have a guy like Andrew who doesn't feel game pressure.
He's a fearless player. And he made obviously huge plays when we needed it the
most.  
  
Q. 25 personal fouls after two games of doing a pretty good job of
avoiding them. Is there anything about DePaul that leads to more foul calls or
do you think the refs are just calling it tight tonight?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think the Big East has the best officials in the
country, and that's all we're both going to say about that.  
  
Q. In the conference format you've got to play another game tomorrow. Is
it better for you guys to have that kind of quick turnaround?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: There's no better or worse. We're playing tomorrow. And
in March that's what you want to do. And it's clichéd, survive and advance. We
were able to survive and we're advancing.  
  
So whether we play at 9.00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m., the opportunity to play tomorrow
is a gift, and we need to make the most of it without making excuses. We'll do
our best to prepare ourselves against a Villanova team that's as good as any
team in the United States.  
  
Q. What do you feel like you guys have to do differently tomorrow night
to have a shot against Nova?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Against Villanova you have to play a pretty flawless game
in all aspects, offensively, defensively. They present so many challenges on
both ends of the floor. We're going to have to play our best basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, Villanova is known for having their great guard play. You have
a pretty good guard sitting to your right --  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I will tell you he's great too.  
  
Q. No offense intended, but I'm just saying but actually preparing for
them from a strategic standpoint, how do you -- now that you've got this one
under your belt, what's the mindset going into tomorrow's contest?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously we played Villanova twice. So there is some
familiarity. But our only focus coming into the Big East Tournament has been
DePaul. They deserve that respect. I think Dave's done a really good job. If
you look at their season, they are a couple possessions really in every game
from having a much different record.  
  
So our total focus has been on DePaul. Our players are going to try to get
some rest tonight and our staff will be up all night trying to figure out how
to answer the question you just asked me.  
  
Q. On that last play, defensively, were you expecting them to take a 3,
or were you thinking they'd drive to the basket down one?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: We knew it was going to go to Strus. And we didn't
actually execute how we wanted to play. But we were fortunate he missed and he
doesn't often miss those types of shots. The shot he hit before was
incredible. We had a guy draped all over him. Maybe it was better for us not
to have a guy draped all over him on that last shot.  
  
Q. You shot 40 percent from 3. When you look towards tomorrow is that a
key continuing that against Villanova, or is it more about shot making?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?  
  
Q. Is it more about shooting from 3 or is it more about finding space to
shoot, shot making?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think it's probably both. We're going to have to --
we're a good 3-point shooting team. And to beat a team like Villanova we'll
have to shoot really well from 3. When they take that away we have to make
good decisions. I think more than anything it's about good decision-making and
taking what the defense gives you, which against Villanova is not easy to
find.  
  
Q. Andrew, when the game was tied at 61 you scored five straight points.
So often in the last couple games you've been the guy to take the clutch
shots. Do you feel it's because you're a senior and you feel it's the end of
your college career and you're taking that extra responsibility?  
ANDREW ROWSEY: No. It's more of just what the game presents. The game
presented me an open 3 and then it presented me a drive to a pull-up. So I
took what I saw and I made it.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, DePaul shot 50 percent from the field, 33
percent from 3 and 74 percent from the line, but you were able to find a way
to win. Can you just speak up to the character of your team for finding a way
to gut the win out?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah, like I mentioned earlier I thought there was a lot
of game pressure on our team, and a lot of teams would have broken in those
situations. And we were fortunate to show some toughness and make enough plays
to come out with the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Justin Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34842)

### [Shamorie Ponds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32815)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 88, Georgetown - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach, Shamorie or Justin.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Run TMC and you guys had five players in double
digits. Just talk about like sharing the basketball and scoring.  
COACH MULLIN: We practiced -- a lot of our sets have multiple options and it's
up to Justin and Shamorie to make the right reads. They've done a great job of
that all year. Exceptional in the second half. I thought their command of the
reads and the command of their teammates was exceptional and sharing the ball,
being unselfish.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you do differently in this game that you didn't in
the other two games against Georgetown?  
COACH MULLIN: All the games have been really close games and ironically or not
they really shot the three ball against us and they had nine at halftime. I
thought our defense was much better in the second half.  
  
I thought the first half, they got too many open looks, too many walk-in 3s.
No resistance. I thought we were fortunate to be only down 6 at halftime. And
I thought our defense picked up in the second half and offensively we kind of
got moving. And, like I said, Justin and Shamorie really dictated the flow of
the game.  
  
Q. Shamorie, does this kind of have a different feel than it did last
year? You won the Big East opener last year, but it was a close game. You
needed a stop late and you came back the next day at noon and obviously
Villanova took it to you. But does this feel different? Do you feel like maybe
this is a team that can make some noise here?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: I mean, for sure, most definitely. I think except for a couple
of games, each and every game we showed that we can compete with anybody in
the country. Our mindset going into the Big East Tournament was one game at a
time. We know we can do it.  
  
Q. Shamorie what's that TMC hat mean to you?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: I support my coaches. If it's dumb, it's us. So, Run TMC.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, your team held the Hoyas to just shooting
25.8 percent on the floor. What adjustments did you make at halftime?  
COACH MULLIN: I think we really just got more aggressive. I thought Marvin
pressed up on Derrickson more beyond the 3-point line. I thought Tariq put
more pressure on, and Lamar did a good job on Govan. They just were getting
easy looks.  
  
And the other part of that I thought Justin and Shamorie contained the ball
better. They were getting some blow-bys which were opening up those 3-point
shots. They guarded the ball better, kept the guards out of the paint and made
them shoot contested 2s.  
  
At halftime I tried everything -- we played zone and full-court press and we
just weren't playing defense. And they flipped the switch at halftime and did
a much better job.  
  
Q. Chris, yesterday you told us that anything can happen if you just go
ahead and win the first game. I assume that's probably going to be the message
you continue to preach from here until noon tomorrow?  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, I mean I just told them the biggest thing right now is to
get some rest. Eat a good meal. Get some rest. When you're playing a team for
the third time there's less preparation you have to do, everyone knows the
personnel. We know what kind of game either team's going to play. Everyone
knows each other's inside and out personnel, game plans and things like that.  
  
Xavier is one of the most physical teams, I think, in the league offensively
and defensively. We'll get on that a little bit tonight and do a little quick
little film in the morning and be ready to go.  
  
Q. You've been in Patrick's position before obviously in your first year
back at your alma mater. Could you speak to the job he's done with this team,
especially maybe to developing the young guards or the young guys you've seen
this year?  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, Patrick -- look, I've known him for about 30 years or so,
more than that, probably -- but he's the same person he was when I first met
him. And his work ethic, his discipline, that's going to carry over to
anything he does. Obviously he did that as a player. He did it as an assistant
coach in the NBA for many years.  
  
I think he's done a tremendous job in his first year, not only record-wise,
but I think the way they play, the type of team. To me it resembles him,
they're aggressive, unselfish, they work hard and he's very demanding. That's
who he is.  
  
Q. Shamorie, how soon were you able to realize that you would be healthy
enough to play, and how did you feel during the game? Was the ab issue at all
a problem for you?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: Right before the game I was feeling good. It didn't give me no
pain or anything. I wasn't paying no mind to it. I played through it.  
  
Q. Justin, after hitting that beautiful alley-oop and then setting off
with Tariq, did you feel that was the turning point in that second half?  
JUSTIN SIMON: I mean, that definitely gave the team a little spark. We fed off
that and went on a little run. And the second half, like Coach said, we just
stepped up defensively and just got more aggressive and rebounded the ball.  
  
Q. Chris, how much of a difference -- the defense second half to first
half, how much of a difference was it just to have Justin out there the whole
time? You look at his line -- 16 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, four steals
-- seems like he impacts the game so many different ways?  
COACH MULLIN: He has all year. Anytime we want to run Shamorie and Justin in
the thick of it on offense and defense -- yeah, he picked up a quick two
fouls. Definitely had an impact on our first half. Like I said, it was one of
the other reasons I thought we were fortunate to be only down six points at
halftime.  
  
But it's also a tough situation coming off and not playing minutes and not
really getting any rhythm. I thought he and Marvin did a great job. I thought
they struggled in the first half but came out and really played a great second
half.  
  
Q. From the first possession you guys doubled Derrickson pretty hard
down there, tried to run him off the block. Even though he shot the ball well
from 3, was the plan just for him to make it one dimensional and make him a
shooter?  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, both he and Govan, we started off doubling them, and then
it wasn't working too well. We were not aggressive on our rotation. So we went
away from it.  
  
So the first half, like I said, they got whatever they wanted. We kind of went
back to just traditional straight up man-to-man, put the pressure on our guys
to guard their guy and they did so.  
  
Q. What does it mean, to go back to Patrick, does it mean anything
special to you to have beaten him now as a coach for the first time?  
COACH MULLIN: Not really. Like I said, those two games were, you know, just
toss-ups. So not for any -- I don't really look at it as a coaching matchup, I
don't. I know I'd rather coach against him than play against him. It's a lot
easier on my body.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, Chris, what was it like emotionally to see
him across at the other bench? And just did you flashback a little bit to '84
or '85 and when you guys made this league so great?  
COACH MULLIN: Probably the biggest difference is we're friends now, and we
weren't then at all. So we didn't even talk. We'll goof around here and there.
I think we both understand, you try and prepare our guys the best we can and
then give them all the tools that they can have so they can go out and perform
well.  
  
I want my guys to perform well, feel good about their games and win. That's
what I want for them. So we try to do all that out in practice.  
  
When the game starts, yeah, we're going to make adjustments and do some things
in timeouts but the players are going to dictate. We know that better than
anybody, Patrick and I.  
  
The one difference is we'll goof around a little bit. There was no goofing
when I played against him -- I saw today he took his tie off during the game.
I said, what are you doing? He said he was getting hot. So...

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Dave Leitao](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30496)

### [Marin Maric](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34856)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Marquette - 72, DePaul - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Marin Maric with us and Coach. We'll take an opening
statement from Coach.  
  
COACH LEITAO: Anytime in tournament play, as everybody is right now, it's
must-win basketball. And for their own reasons, Marquette needed this game.
And for our own reasons, we needed this game.  
  
And obviously we were a little bit short, as we have been a number of times
this year. So that makes it a little more painful to endure when you know you
have chances to win and you don't.  
  
So they advance and we don't. But proud, extremely proud of our guys. This is
a different atmosphere than when I first came on campus. And we've got to ride
that.  
  
But that being said, from Marin and the other four seniors who have put a lot,
a whole, whole lot into this turnaround that we're in the middle of. And this
understanding of what it takes to be successful and not just in the game of
basketball but in life is really admirable from my standpoint.  
  
With that being said, the game was nip and tuck. We talked at halftime about
our energy. And I thought other than probably Rowsey and a couple of guys here
and there that neither team was putting their best foot forward. We were
making mistakes and we cleaned them up for the most part almost totally in the
second half and put ourselves into position.  
  
And we got stops. We got rebounds. They weren't offensive rebounding anymore.
We got more confidence. We got more energy. Offense was clicking more and put
us in a position to win.  
  
So for that, you've got to be proud of our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The last play, can you just go through what was going through your
mind? Did you want to go for 1 or were you happy with Max's shot?  
COACH LEITAO: Yeah, I mean -- down one, we just needed a basket. And we ran a
stagger to open Max up and then we wanted him to draft, to hopefully create a
vacuum that potentially Eli could go to the basket with.  
  
And the good thing for us when we did draft, they got a little confused on
their communication and left Max wide open. And whether it was a last shot of
the game or with 10 seconds to go or 10 minutes to go, or start of the game,
that's the shot that anybody that's been around us would happily have. We've
seen him knock down anywhere from 25, 30 of those in a row.  
  
So Marin or anybody else would trust Max taking that shot.  
  
Q. Coach, especially in the second half you guys were able to get to the
free-throw line and slow the pace down to your liking in terms of setting up
your defense as well. Is there anything that you saw going into the second
half that was able to put Marin in a position to get to the free-throw line
and really put you guys in a position to put points on the board?  
COACH LEITAO: Yeah, I mean, we mentioned it at halftime. We talked about it
during timeouts. It's the point of our theme is getting paint touches and
getting paint touches.  
  
And we knew that especially our perimeter players had some size advantage. So
if we can go downhill, you know, maybe we weren't going to face as much
resistance. And I thought in the second half especially that we did a much
better job of going downhill.  
  
And especially as the game wore on and late, Max going downhill and Brandon
going downhill and Eli did a really good job of going down and making
decisions. The fact that he had a double-double today was indicative of what
he's done and helped us as a point guard, which is not his actual position.  
  
But, yes, that's something -- along with Marin, just dumping the ball down low
and having him play one-on-one and attacking the glass, all those things that
happened around the basket are good for us.  
  
Q. How instrumental has the new facility, the Wintrust Arena, been or
going forward how instrumental will it be in helping for your program to
actually grow and for y'all to attract talent to come play for DePaul?  
COACH LEITAO: We've been asked that question since we broke ground almost
three years ago. There's been nothing short of monumental in the name that
I've always mentioned as a game changer, because in today's world when you're
dealing with young people you want to make sure that their life is comfortable
and we have an arena that represents comfort to them.  
  
It represents what we need to compete on a day-to-day basis with everybody
else, not just in this league, but everybody in the country.  
  
For us, Chicago is really important. So the location is ideal. And it gives us
an opportunity to show ourselves in a much better light than we ever have
before.  
  
Q. Marin, can you speak to, I know this isn't the result you wanted, but
this season coming in as a transfer, what it's been like playing for Coach,
this program and kind of a new era for them?  
MARIN MARIC: It was real interesting. I'm so happy I came to DePaul because
these guys made me feel like I was here for four years, not just one year.  
  
They took me in like I've been there for a long time. I want to thank all my
teammates, all the coaches, all that believed in me. I started off kind of
slow. They kept sticking to it, keep sticking to it and they keep believing in
me and they keep encouraging me to be what I am now, and I'm extremely
thankful for the opportunity. And that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. On top of that, Coach has talked about this through the season that
Max sort of added, not only a new dimension to this team but just his overall
attitude as well. Who is Max Strus and what are those qualities that come out
in him?  
MARIN MARIC: Max is a workaholic, definitely. Always first two guys in the
gym, always getting shots up, always working to improve his game, always
staying on top. I don't think he made one mistake the whole year, like when we
have curfew or on time or anything. He's just perfect as anybody can be.  
  
Q. Coach, can you describe the bittersweet dynamic between the close
losses but no results? Is it good or bad? And moving forward next year, what
lessons will you teach your team?  
COACH LEITAO: I talked about this a lot. And one of the joys of being around
this group is for people like Marin. Marin, what you see as a basketball
player pales in comparison; he's an intellectual. He's a man that you can have
conversations with about anything. And he's understanding. And I think that's
a great quality, and I think that's what our school produces.  
  
And so part of the results, I always go back to the base. And the base has
been in the locker room with guys like Marin and the rest of the guys that we
have.  
  
There are two parts to a team. And you mentioned results and we're in a
results-based business. But I look at reasons. And so the definition of a win,
when you see it on the ticker at night is sometimes results-based and
sometimes reasons-based. And there's a lot of reasons to be very, very proud
and to be very, very optimistic about not only what we just completed as a
season but as the five seniors move on, what lies ahead.  
  
We build character. We build more toughness. We build sustainability. And
there will come a day very, very soon we'll get some payback on all the games
that we had that were just like today.  
  
And so I look at it a little bit differently than everybody else. And I
understand the business that we're in. As you mentioned, results is what
people judge you by. But with this group, especially, and moving forward, I
judge it on reasons.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Patrick Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17044)

### [Jessie Govan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34840)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. Johns - 88, Georgetown - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach or for Jessie.  
  
Q. After beating them twice in the regular season and losing tonight,
how disappointing is that for you guys?  
COACH EWING: It's very disappointing. But you know, it's hard to beat a good,
quality team as St. John's three straight times. You know, they have a lot of
talent on their team. They're very well-coached. And you have to be able to
play your A game if you want to beat them.  
  
And as you see in the stat sheet, we didn't bring our A game. You know, Jessie
and Marcus, they played, based on their stat sheet, they brought their A game,
but no one else really stepped up. And we need, for us to beat that team,
everyone has to pull their load and we didn't get that done tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jessie's performance today and also throughout the
entire season?  
COACH EWING: He played well, not well enough. He played well. He's getting
better. He still has a lot of work that he has to do on both ends of the
court. He has to continue to run the floor on both ends. He still has to
rebound. He has to become a better shot blocker.  
  
And he has to do a lot more things for us. And I'm going to need him to be,
when he comes back next year for his senior season, he has to be my leader. He
has to start leading. And a leader, you can lead in a lot of different ways.
And he's going to have to choose which way that he wants to lead.  
  
Q. Early in the game it seemed like all your bigs were able to hit their
3s. And it seemed to throw them off a little bit. What did they do to answer
that later on in the game?  
COACH EWING: I'm not sure if it's anything that they did. I think we just got
too happy with it. We got too happy with it. We stuck with it too much.  
  
We need to be able to -- when we're playing our game, we're inside/out. We
post. We shoot our 3s and then our perimeter guys, they're able to hit their
shots also.  
  
And if you look at our guys, you know, Marcus took 11 -- he took, what, 12
shots and 11 of his shots were 3s. And that's not good for us. He has to be
able to be able to score in the post, along with shooting his 3s.  
  
And Jessie, you know, he mixed his up. So when we have it rolling, it's a
mixture. And then our perimeter guys are able to knock down their shots. And
they weren't able to knock their shots down. They were horribly cold.  
  
Q. Was this season a good starting point in your opinion?  
COACH EWING: You know, right now it's hard to reflect on it. I just have a
bitter taste in my mouth right now. So I'm going to take a couple days and
reflect. Depending on what happens, see if we're going to get a chance to
continue to play and then reflect on it and see -- and make that decision. But
right now it's hard to say.  
  
Q. Did you have any overall message for the team after this game that
you wanted them to leave with?  
COACH EWING: We talked. I'll just leave it like that.  
  
Q. So if invited you'd go to the NIT, you'd accept an invitation to the
NIT?  
COACH EWING: Oh, yes. Yes.  
  
Q. Jessie, any reaction or response to what Coach just said about you
coming back and a leader and how you played this year, this game?  
JESSIE GOVAN: Yeah, I mean, I didn't do enough today for us to get the win. I
tried. I tried my hardest, but there's things we could all improve on, myself
included.  
  
So it's going to be a big offseason for all of us trying to come back and
really take the Big East by storm.  
  
Q. What's it been like to be able to work with a player like Jessie and
mentor him and what's his potential going forward?  
COACH EWING: The sky's the limit for him. He's a player that has a lot of
potential. He just has to put in the work to grasp it. He has to put in the
work. He has to work hard every day.  
  
But he has potential. And that's one of the things I've been trying to stress
to him; if he wants to achieve anything in life, he has to work at it, work
hard at trying to achieve that every day.  
  
Q. Jessie, they outscored you in the paint 40-18. What was the trouble
with their bigs?  
JESSIE GOVAN: I don't think it was their bigs. I think we just couldn't stop
the drive. That was a big -- their guards were getting into the paint, and I
wasn't altering enough shots. They were just blowing right by us. It's like
nobody was down there. They were getting wide-open layups pretty much and
and-1s.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Illinois head coach Brad
Underwood. Brad enters his second season at the helm of the Fighting Illini.  
  
Coach, welcome. If you'd like to begin with your opening statement, then we'll
open the floor for questions.  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: First, I'd like to pay respects to a guy that I got to know as
a Kansas State player and coach, a guy that I studied a great deal, a guy that
spent a great amount of time in this city, the passing of Tex Winter, truly
one of the great innovators of the game, one of the creative minds, a guy that
had a tremendous amount of success at every level. So I felt I needed to pay
the respects to a guy I admire a great deal.  
  
I'm excited. This is the youngest team that I've been a part of since I was a
junior college coach and had a team every year of all freshmen. That's
exciting. It's brought a youthful exuberance to our practices. It's a group of
guys that is helping lay a foundation. I feel very, very good about the fact
that what we're doing is laying a tremendous foundation for the future with
this group.  
  
They're talented, yet they're a group that has done nothing but win at
previous levels. A group of freshmen, junior college transfer in Andrés Feliz,
a transfer in Adonis De la Rosa, and that mix with four guys who, albeit
pretty young in terms of playing time and playing experience, have done a
great job in providing leadership for these new guys, establishing our culture
of what we want to be about.  
  
I think we're developing an identity. I think that's something that we strived
very, very hard for. I'm really excited. It's a year that we play the toughest
schedule in the history of Illinois basketball. We have 27, 28 high major
games. Strength of schedule sure won't be a problem for us.  
  
It's about growth for us. That's something that we're getting better at every
day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Obviously you can't change your program completely in a year, but
with the changes that have happened, how does this team more reflect you as a
coach?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think we are becoming -- we talk a lot about being
position-less and versatile. I think the one thing that we have worked very
hard at is we have a lot of different pieces. We have a lot more size on the
perimeter. I think that our skill set is one that I really enjoy. This is a
very, very good passing team. Our basketball IQ, I'm having a lot of fun with
that because it's pretty high. Yet we haven't had all of our pieces in
practice. We've had some minor injuries. Adonis De la Rosa, we get him back.
Seven-footer, he provides a different piece to us.  
  
We're getting there. It's versatile. You'll see us play maybe at different
times three point guards in a lineup. The versatility that I like is there,
and the skill set I'm really positive about.  
  
Q. You mentioned Adonis. Can you talk about what you like about him as a
person, as a player, how you see him fitting in.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, I'll refrain from how I see him fitting in until I
actually see him on the court.  
  
But he's quietly become one of our leaders. I've called him a basketball
savant. I've never been around a young guy that has not participated. He knows
everything that we did last year. He knows every call, he knows every play.
He's got it on his iPad. He's in front of it. He's coaching guys when he's not
practicing. He's a very, very loyal, very committed person to our program.
He's worked extremely hard. He's dropped 30 some pounds since he's been here.  
  
I've been very, very impressed with Adonis to this point.  
  
Q. Obviously you have a really young team. Trent is a young guy, but
what role are you expecting him to have in leadership? What have you seen so
far from him, the steps he's taken from last year?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think one of the hardest challenges is you have a freshman
that has a lot of success, and you're always curious as to how they'll react
to that. The one thing that Trent has done is accepted some of the things that
he didn't do well. He's allowed us to coach him. He's gotten better. There's
no secret, he was a left-hand-dominant player last year. Now he's just as good
going right.  
  
We asked him to step up his leadership role. He has done that. He's a guy that
is all about winning. I think you look at him, not just Trent, but Aaron
Jordan, Kipper Nichols, Da'Monte Williams, those guys have all bought in. Both
feet committed to winning.  
  
Trent's got a big job. He's going to be at the top of everybody's scouting
report. That will be a little different role for him. But he's up to the
challenge. I'm excited for his sophomore year.  
  
Q. Obviously Chicago is loaded with talent. A lot of guys have decided
to go elsewhere. Ayo Dosunmu chose Illinois. What did you do to get him? What
do you think clicked with him? How do you think he'll handle the pressure of
expectations at Illinois?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, he's a different guy. I say that, and you talk about a
committed, dedicated worker, a guy who loves basketball, he's a two-time state
champion, and he's fearless. He's everything that I would have hoped him to be
and more.  
  
Great, great teammate. He's selfless. He knows he's a good basketball, but an
elite passer, great teammate. He always has an encouraging word. He's
developing slowly I think into what we'll see, by some point this year, an
elite leader. He does that just by example and his ability.  
  
I don't worry about where he's from. I think he's just got a great presence
about him. He's great in the locker room. Nothing but a great teammate.  
  
Q. Jim Delany said earlier this morning he doesn't think there's
anything less interesting than bad basketball games in November and December.
How does that fit in your view? How does college basketball continue to try to
grab attention and viewers in the first couple months of season?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think the one thing that playing two conference games in
early December, you've got kind of a lull there in between bowls and goings-on
in the football world. Campus is still alive. What I mean by, that it's still
in session. We're looking at playing two games that have student participation
at both home and on the road.  
  
I think our schedule this year, at least for our fans, is one they should be
excited about with the ACC Challenge, the Gavitt Games, our trip to Maui,
which is an elite field.  
  
I think basketball is in a great place. I think we can continue to grow. Jim
does an unbelievable job in terms of foresight, in terms of thinking ahead
with media, some of these things. We're the first conference to go to 20
games.  
  
The one thing we have in the Big Ten is 42 straight years in leading in
attendance. We're above the curve, for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you so much for your time, coach.  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Maryland head coach Mark
Turgeon. He enters his eighth year with the Terrapins. Maryland has earned
NCAA Tournament berths in three of the last four seasons.  
  
Coach, welcome. We'll begin with your opening statement, then open the floor
for questions.  
  
MARK TURGEON: Obviously we're real excited about this year, it's a special
year in Maryland basketball. It's our hundredth anniversary of basketball. So
we're going to celebrate a lot throughout the season. Going back to Bud
Milliken years, Lefty Driesell years, and Gary Williams and the national
championship in 2002. It should be an exciting year for us, for our fans.
We're going to do it right throughout the season.  
  
With that said, I think we got a tremendous schedule, non-conference schedule,
of course league schedule. I like my team. I think it's a team that our fan
base is going to love. Come out and support us. We're young, but my young guys
are good. We have six freshmen. We have three sophomores, one junior, one
senior. We might be the youngest team I've ever had. But we're talented, fun
to coach, they're working hard. We're excited for the year. Should be a really
a fun team to watch because of their skill set and their length, their ability
to play together.  
  
Looking forward to coaching them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Last year Miles Bridges, when he returned, said it was ridiculous
that NCAA rules prohibited him from spending extra time with Coach Izzo. With
the Rules Committee dominated by bureaucrats and no coaches, would you like to
see coaches included?  
MARK TURGEON: I didn't see his comment, so I don't know what you're talking
about.  
  
With that, I think they are doing some things where they're allowing us to be
around our players more. We had four hours this summer instead of two, which I
thought was terrific. So I hope I'm answering your question correctly.  
  
To be honest with you, it's a long season. It's probably nice to get a break
every now and then from us. But I think they're doing things to try to get us
around our players more and coach them a little bit more.  
  
Q. You have a tough non-conference calendar this year, playing a veteran
Loyola team that went to the Final Four this year. How do you feel about
playing them?  
MARK TURGEON: We're excited. We're going to play that game in Baltimore. We
have two players on our team, Darryl Morsell, Jalen Smith from Baltimore, be
able to get them home, play there. We have a great fan base in the city of
Baltimore. We're looking forward to that.  
  
I go way back with Porter, Missouri Valley days, I was at Wichita State, he
was at Illinois State. He's always been a great coach. It's a great game for
us. We really tried to play a nice non-conference schedule. To add that game
into Baltimore is terrific for us.  
  
Hopefully by then my young team will be experienced. We'll have a few games
under our belt. But we're looking forward to that challenge.  
  
Q. In general, what kind of an impact do you think the trial that's
going on in New York will have on college athletics?  
MARK TURGEON: You know, I think our sport is, to be honest with you, in great
shape. We just talked about Loyola, went to a Final Four. I think we have
great depth throughout college basketball. It continues to grow. I think we
have great coaching in our game.  
  
I think we have some really great teams this year, three, four, five teams
that are terrific teams.  
  
I'd like to think it's not going to have a big impact on our game. Once the
games start, I think it's going to be another terrific year for us. We'll see
how that plays out. I think besides what's going on in those courtrooms, I
think college basketball is in great shape.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
MARK TURGEON: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now at the podium by Minnesota head coach Richard
Pitino. Pitino begins his fifth season at head coach of the Golden Gophers.
Minnesota returns four starters and seven letter winners from last year's
squad.  
  
Coach, we'll begin with your opening statement.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Excited to be here. Big Ten Media Day is always the highlight
of my year, so I'm fired up about them.  
  
Anyone picking up on that (laughter)? Questions.  
  
Q. Talk about the next step for Jordan Murphy and his development. His
senior year, a lot of expectations for him and the program.  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, I think for Jordan, obviously from a team-wise where
he wants to go, obviously NCAA Tournament, back to the top of the Big Ten. But
personally for him, I know he wants to play in the NBA. I told him, I said,
You've got the numbers, you have shown that you can produce at our level, at a
very high level. Now it comes down to, can you show them how hard you play
every single possession, from a rebounding standpoint, be like Kenneth Faried,
every situation that you can do, try to get that rebound. Obviously Dennis
Rodman would be the one you always think about. But just continue to do what
you do.  
  
You are who you are and you've gotten to where you've gotten because you
haven't gotten away from that. Don't get away from what you're really, really
good at.  
  
Q. Asking you about Isaiah, talk about his off-season, what he's worked
on, what you think he might be able to develop and contribute more to this
season.  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, he's been really good. He's grown a lot on the court.
With all freshmen, it's habits. For him, as difficult as all the injuries
were, it thrusted him into meaningful minutes. Now it's just a matter of
terminology, understanding offensively, defensively, never taking a play off,
just understanding the difference between high school and college, AAU and
college.  
  
I think he's had a terrific summer, terrific fall, and he's got a great
opportunity in front of him.  
  
Q. In the last couple years you've had some ups and downs, injuries,
off-the-court things. What have you learned about yourself as a coach, how do
you think these last couple years have helped shape you as you try to level it
off a little bit, consistently stay in the top half of the conference?  
RICHARD PITINO: I'm a lot better when we have a healthy roster as a coach. I
think that at the end of the day when you're building a program, to get
stability, it takes some time. I will think I thought we were there last year.
I thought that my fourth year, being two years ago, was an important year for
us to show progress. Obviously we did that.  
  
I thought last year was going to allow us to really, really build some great
momentum with the new facility, with two really good seasons in a row,
hopefully theoretical.  
  
We can't allow last year to derail that momentum. But for me, I'm 36 years
old. I read something the other day that this is my 15th year of being a coach
in Division I. I'm very, very lucky to be a part of that, be a part of some
really good teams.  
  
But you get better. Experience is something that when you're young, you think
it's irrelevant. It's not irrelevant. You can only learn so much until you
actually do it. So I've had a lot of really good experiences in Minnesota and
hope to build off them.  
  
Q. You added Brock Stull this year, you have Rob Jeter, Akeem a couple
years ago. What do you see from Coach Jeter and Brock this year?  
RICHARD PITINO: Coach Jeter has been great. Obviously he had a really good run
at Milwaukee. Surprised that he was let go. I think a lot of people were. I
got to know him a little bit. He came in and beat us. I had a lot of respect
for him a couple years ago. Everybody beat us. I tell him that all the time,
so don't get too excited.  
  
But he sees the big picture very well. That's what you get when you hire
former head coaches who have done it. He's done it for a long time. He
obviously was an assistant coach under Bo Ryan. He knows how to win in this
league. He knows how to recruit the area. He's a really good person. He's been
a terrific addition to our staff.  
  
As for Brock Stull, he's getting in shape. He was not with us till about
September, early September, because he was doing his academics. It's hard when
a guy is in Milwaukee, you can't work with him. He's probably not over at
Milwaukee every day working out because that staff and that team has probably
moved on. It's going to take some time, like it did with Akeem.  
  
I expect Brock to be ready to go. He's a smart player and he's produced at a
high level.  
  
Q. Not sure if you've been around the league long enough to when it was
16 games, then 18, now to 20. Your thoughts about going to the 20-game
schedule? Those two games replace mid-major games that you would have played
in your own arena where you probably were going to go 2-0, and now it could be
0-2, 1-1. Do you like the idea that you're playing major conference teams?  
RICHARD PITINO: I do like it, yeah. I think it's good for everybody. I think
Commissioner Delany has brought it up a couple times, we've got to figure out
from a college basketball standpoint how to capture our fans in November and
December.  
  
For us, to be able to get quality opponents in your building, it's important
to us early because our fan base loves it. More importantly, though, last year
from studying what the NCAA Tournament was looking at, they're looking at how
many good wins you have. They're not looking at who you lose to. That really
isn't relevant anymore. I mean, certainly we don't want to lose, but if you
can stack up as many quality quad one, quad two wins as you can, it's good for
everybody.  
  
I think it's great. I think a lot of the Power 5 or Power 6 conferences will
go to that. Big East probably can't. For us, I think it's really, really
smart. I think it's a good idea.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Rutgers head coach Steve
Pikiell. He enters his third season as the Scarlet Knights head coach. He has
guided his team to four post-season appearances throughout his coaching
career.  
  
Coach start with an opening statement, then we'll open the floor for
questions.  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: Good morning. Glad to be back. Very excited always to come to
Chicago. It's a great city. Good things are happening at Rutgers. Excited
about my team. Excited about our new practice facility being built. Excited
about our new court. Season tickets are up. Our grade point average is up. Our
recruiting is up. I'm excited about tackling the obstacles this season brings.
Looking forward to a great year. Best league in the country. I say that often.
When the fifth place team plays in a national championship game, shows you
what kind of league this is run by great people. Very excited to be a part of
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Talk about Geo Baker, just his play that translated in the tournament
last year, what you're looking forward from him this year with probably
increased responsibility on the offensive end.  
STEVE PIKIELL: What I'm most excited about, has been the pattern since I took
over the program, is the improvement of our guys from year to year. I think
you saw a little bit of that with Eugene that last year, Issa Thiam. You'll
see an improvement with Geo Baker, his body. Now he's going to be an exclusive
point guard. With the ball in his hands, he really knows how to play. He's got
a little swagger about him. He's showing great signs of being a good leader. I
really like our leadership moving forward here.  
  
I really believe with the newcomers, we signed a really good class, we had two
guys sitting out that I think are going to surprise some people with the
effect they can have on the program. Geo is a leader. On the dean's list. He's
in the gym all the time. When I took over the program two years ago, I wanted
to build a culture of those kind of guys, maybe under-the-radar guys, that
could really play, want to be at Rutgers, want to be part of building a
program.  
  
He's jumped onboard, had a great summer. I think we as a program had a great,
great summer. Guys got better. We have great chemistry right now in the locker
room. He's a big part of that moving forward.  
  
Q. You mentioned in your opening statement about this being the best
league in the country. It's been a long time since the Big Ten won a national
championship. How much is that discussed informally when you're with the other
coaches in the league about what it's going to take to get over the hump in
this league?  
STEVE PIKIELL: Yeah, I mean, I've been in this league and I've been coaching
now 23, 24 years. Night in and night out when I play games in this league, the
Matt Painters, Purdues, John Beileins, Tom Izzos, Fran McCaffery, Hall of
Famers, this league is unbelievable. To win a road game is even harder.  
  
Last year I guess the sentiment was down. The fifth place team in our league
made it to the national championship game. It's an unbelievable league. I'm
not in a lot of those discussions about national championships. Where we are
as a program, continue to grow, have a great game plan, I have a great staff
that has stayed with me. We're trying to just get better as a basketball
program in the best league night in, night out in the country, and terrific
coaches, whether it be Maryland. These guys can flat out coach. There's good
players every year. They have good players in every class. Seniors leave, and
freshmen come in and take the place of those guys. This league just continues
to push itself at a great level.  
  
I really think we're going to be in those conversations again. We'll get back
to Final Fours. It takes a little luck. It takes a good whistle. It takes no
injuries. Last year I thought Purdue had a chance to win the national
championship. The best big guy, I thought in the league, goes down in the NCAA
tournament time. Awful timing. Terrific coached team, terrific experience with
the Player of the Year in the league. Now you lose your inside guy who was
your inside threat.  
  
I mean, timing plays a role in that, and luck. But we keep knocking on that
door. I know coaches in this league are more than ready for that challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Pikiell, thank you very much for your time.  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: Thank you very much.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Purdue head coach Matt
Painter. Matt is entering his 14th season with the Boilermakers, leading them
to 10 NCAA Tournament appearances. This season's Purdue team includes the pre-
season Big Ten Player of the Year Carson Edwards. Coach, if you'd like to
start with an opening statement.  
  
MATT PAINTER: Thank you. Obviously every coach that gets up here, we say the
same things in our opening statements. Everybody has a good summer, so we had
a good summer, too. Everybody is excited about it. We're excited about the
season. After listening to Matt Painter talk, it is different for me this year
than last year. We started four seniors last year, went on a trip to Taiwan,
we got a lot of basketball in. Played 10, 11 real games in the summer. It was
different.  
  
Now we have a very more inexperienced team. Carsen Edwards obviously as a
Second Team All-American last year comes back. Any time you can start a game
and you feel like you have the best player on the floor, it's a good start.  
  
We have some guys that came off the bench for us last year in Ryan Cline, who
I've always considered like a starter for us, but we've been pretty deep in
our backcourt. Matt Haarms and Nojel Eastern, they're going to have to have
bigger roles for this team. We have a lot of new guys to sprinkle in there, a
fifth-year transfer, two redshirt freshmen, three true freshmen that I feel
really good about. I think they're all going to be good players. When they're
going to be good players is obviously the question anytime you have
inexperience, how they gel with those guys I previously mentioned that played
for us last year.  
  
Really looking forward to it. Looking forward to getting started.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference in how you might be coaching Carsen
Edwards, being that the responsibility is a little different? Talk about the
difference in how you approach coaching him with the new team.  
MATT PAINTER: He's a very dynamic player. He's unique from a physical
standpoint. He's kind of got the body and the explosiveness like a Saquon
Barkley. He plays through his offense. I think for guys like that, as you get
older, you get more experience, more responsibility, but you don't change who
you are.  
  
A lot of what he did last year, when he got it going, we couldn't get it to
him enough. But when somebody else got it going, that's kind of the piece
that's tough, when you have that scoring mentality. When Isaac Haas is burying
people by the concession stand, you got to get him the basketball. Dakota
Mathias was a very efficient player. Vince Edwards was a really efficient
player.  
  
Sometimes you go without some touches for two, three minutes. I don't think
that will be the case this year. I think he'll play off the ball, but I think
he'll also play with the ball more. He's kind of been our point guard in
transition, now he'll have more responsibilities there. But I never want to
take away from his ability to score, because I think that's a threat we can
have 40 minutes every single night.  
  
Q. Sasha has been in your program for over a year now. Finally see him
on the court. What has he shown you, what kind of role do you anticipate him
having?  
MATT PAINTER: Sasha is one of those guys that I mentioned, I didn't mention by
name, but he's one of our two redshirt freshmen. We want to keep our skill
level at a very high point. We've had the third best three-point field goal
percentage in the country the past two years. His ability to shoot the
basketball and stretch the defense is probably his best quality. But he's a
competitive kid, knows how to play. I think he's going to be a really good
player for us.  
  
I think he's excited about playing games. I think he's tired of being in our
practices. I think any redshirt would say that. But, no, I'm really looking
forward to coaching him. He was a guy that about four, five years ago, we had
some struggles. We really went to being able to sign guys that understand the
game, that can make threes, make their free throws, not turn the ball over. I
know that's profound, but a lot of times those guys don't get ranked as high
as somebody that can jump over the moon. He'll never be confused with that. He
has good size, he's competitive, and we think he's going to be a good player
for us.  
  
Q. Carsen Edwards, his NBA feedback, what were some of the specific
things he was told to improve on? Going ahead this season, how do you balance
his role on the team to helping the team versus how he can help himself also
grow as an individual?  
MATT PAINTER: I think more than anything, I think this gets lost time
sometimes when you put your name in the draft. We've had a lot of guys in the
last eight, nine years, put their name in and come back.  
  
Swanigan is one that did it and stayed. Everybody else has come back and taken
your feedback. We all get judged on winning. Sometimes those guys come back, I
got to do X, Y and Z to be successful. But the NBA, they want winners, and
they want role players. None of the guys that we've had in, quite frankly,
nobody has really had guys that just leave major college basketball and go be
a starter in the NBA. You've got to be able to adjust to an organization, you
have to be able to play a role. I think with that winning, doing little things
and winning.  
  
His first year, he was a 1:1 assist-to-turnover ratio guy, last year he was
1.6, 1.7:1. Being a 2:1 guy is huge. He has shot some really good numbers last
year in terms of his field goal percentage. I think those can improve. If you
look at them, they're pretty sticky numbers, but I really do. He's that good
of a shooter.  
  
I think you're going to be yourself in terms of when people evaluate you. They
like to see something a little bit different. I think you grow into that as
you push past college I think more than anything, just improving his assist-
turnover ratio, continue to do what he's doing, but now lead us to victory
instead of just being that guy who scored the basketball to help us, as we've
had four seniors. I think that piece of it will really help him as he grows
into a pro.  
  
Q. You described Ryan Cline as like a starter for you. Now he really is
going to be a full-time starter. What does he need to do now in an expanded
role?  
MATT PAINTER: I think he needs to do the same thing he's been doing. He's
going to have more opportunities, more cracks at it, the ball is going to be
in his hands. We put the ball in Dakota Mathias' hands a lot because he was
such a great facilitator. When he didn't have shots, the ball got to where it
needed to be. I think he's going to be that type of player for us.  
  
He can hit difficult shots. He can hit shots off the dribble. He can hit
threes with people on him. So I just think just being a little bit better in
the same role he's played, but he's going to have more opportunity because
he's going to play more minutes. I don't think anything really changes there.  
  
I think it's really hard, I've talked to you about this a lot, is it's really
hard for someone to be confident when they play 18 minutes. I don't think
people that have never played the game really understand that. You get taken
out of the game when you do nothing wrong. People always look at that, Why did
you take him out of the game? I was putting Dakota Mathias or Carsen Edwards
back in. It's just that. Sometimes when you get to a little bit of a crowded
backcourt, it's hard for that next guy to really get a feel.  
  
He has a handful of games here the past two years where he ends up winning the
game for us. But he would have won a lot more games for us with a lot more
opportunity. As a coach, you have to make decisions tooing with certain guys.  
  
I think he's going to be great. I think he's somebody that a lot of people
aren't talking about, but he just plays a great role, and he has a lot of
basketball character. He knows how to play. He comes from a winning program.
He does a lot of little things that helps your team.  
  
Q. Last year Grady played a small but significant role for you guys.
Where do you expect him to improve this year and what kind of role do you
envision for him?  
MATT PAINTER: I think for somebody like him that starts in your program and
doesn't play, is a walk-on, a lot of times when you have guys that are walk-
ons, they physically can't do it. They might be able to shoot the basketball.
He physically can do it. His dad started at power forward for Purdue in the
'80s, brother is tight end for the Bengals. He has, like, that athletic DNA,
6'6", 225, he can mix it up, he can be physical, he can rebound, he can play
the position that he has to play for us. Now he just has to be confident.  
  
He's competing to play at the four for us. He started two games for us last
year in the Big Ten when Vince Edwards went down, did some really good things
for us. But he still had a little nervousness when he got out there. You're
just not sure of yourself. Like I talked about Cline playing 17 minutes.
You're really not sure of yourself when you one game play three minutes, next
10, next five. It's all over the map. He was Vince's backup.  
  
We expect him to go out there and compete and help us win. Sometimes less is
more, especially when you have a guy who shoots the basketball and is a big-
time scorer in Carsen Edwards. Sometimes those guys that play those roles
really increase someone like Carsen Edwards' value. He's getting more cracks
at it, your team has more chemistry.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
MATT PAINTER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Indiana head coach Archie
Miller. Miller enters his second year with the Hoosiers and has led programs
to post-season play five times in his seven years as a head coach.  
  
Coach, we'll begin with an opening statement, then open the floor for
questions.  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Thank you.  
  
It's good to be here kicking off Big Ten Media Day here in Chicago. We're
excited about the start to our season. We have a long way to go obviously to
become a competitive Big Ten team right now. We got a lot of growing up to do.  
  
Our returners have done a really nice job of really accepting responsibility
as they've gone through our system here a year. You can really see some growth
just in terms of how much further along we are than we were a year ago, just
being more comfortable with one another. That's a little bit refreshing.  
  
We're excited. We've had a good start to the season in terms of practices. My
hope is as we keep developing we have a team that has a chance to have some
real depth. There's some real upside as we get older.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. So much hype for Romeo coming in. From day one, what kind of an
impact do you think he can make? Why do you think there is so much hype about
him? Does he really have everything you could expect?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, Romeo, number one, he's a terrific kid. That's the one
thing you're getting a chance to really see why he's so well-regarded in terms
of a teammate and a guy. He's doing everything that we've asked him to do.  
  
There's a lot of hype around him. Obviously being from the state, going to IU,
I think that's going to make it a bigger story than everything. He's always
had a lot of eyes on him. Always been a calm type of guy under pressure. He's
shown that. I think the thing that's been really enjoyable so far about Romeo
is he's just like one of the other guys. He's embraced his teammates. We're
coaching hard. He's being coached. He's asking questions. He knows he's not
perfect. Like a lot of guys, he's a typical freshman here early in his career,
where he's just trying to find his way and learn it.  
  
I think the thing with him is just having the ability to allow him to say,
That's okay, make some mistakes, take the pressure off him that he doesn't
have to be perfect. Tremendous upside, talent, great kid. I think as long as
he stays with it every single day, like every single young player, he's going
to get better and better.  
  
Q. On Zach McRoberts, he earned captaincy as a walk-on. That's very
rare. What did he do to earn that? Can you describe things he does to show
leadership in practice, off the court.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Very few guys that you will have that you have the ability to
coach or play with that you know gives everything he has. You know what I
mean? I really mean that. You know when he's done with a workout, a practice
or a game, there isn't anybody in the locker room, regardless of a trainer,
doctor, strength coach, assistant coach, player, that looks at him and says,
That guy did everything he possibly could today for us.  
  
When you're like that, there's a respect level that comes with it. I think
there's an admiration, he's admired for what he does. The guy never complains.
I think just in the off-season, in talking to him, watching him work, he wants
to get better. He's definitely one of the most, if not the most, trusted guy.
When you're out there on the floor, everyone knows what you're going to get.
He's going to have the team in mind all the time.  
  
It didn't surprise me at all that he was voted by the players as one of the
captains.  
  
Q. When you have this many new faces trying to integrate all those guys,
get that chemistry, how difficult is that task?  
ARCHIE MILLER: It's difficult. We have five true freshmen, one transfer, six,
Race Thompson would mean seven. He was in practice a year ago, but didn't play
with the team as his redshirt year. That's where, in my opinion, the returners
you hope to be returners from a year ago are further ahead than all those
guys. You have at least have that core group that you're really trying to add
to.  
  
The young guys are freshmen. We have five guys out there. You can tell when we
practice who is a freshman at times. I think that's without saying our staff's
objective is to develop our team. As we develop our team, we want to add
pieces to the puzzle that can help our rotation, help us be deeper, bigger on
the perimeter at times.  
  
Also working De'Ron back. De'Ron isn't full go yet, but he's starting to make
his way back to the practice floor. He didn't play basically the entire Big
Ten season. To bring him back is challenging, so to speak. Hopefully we can
move him back into the rotation.  
  
We have a lot of different conversations going on all the time, pre and post
practice. I think the one thing is we've set the bar high for our guys in
terms of competition. They're going to have to earn it every day. I think they
understand that they're going against somebody that wants the same amount of
minutes as them. A lot of it will depend on their development, how fast they
can catch up to speed, so to speak. I feel good about some of the guys from a
year ago being way more comfortable and ahead of those guys now. It's
comforting to know there's some guys that look the part, then adding the other
guys to it. It's going to take time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Miller, thank you so much for your time.  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined at the podium by Nebraska head coach Tim Miles.
Miles is in his seventh season at the helm of the Nebraska program. Nebraska
returns nine letter winners from last year's team, which finished fourth in
the Big Ten standings.  
  
Coach, we'll start with your opening statement, then we'll open the floor for
questions.  
  
TIM MILES: Thank you.  
  
Happy to be here. It's that time of year. We put our suits on, my summer golf
regimen allowed me to stay in the same weight class as last year. A lot of
good news. Last night at dinner, at least three coaches weren't going to win
one game all year, so the Huskers are moving up the notch.  
  
Great to get together in the Big Ten Media Days. We have a nice nucleus coming
back. Should be a lot of fun. Kind of a stiff crowd, so good morning
(laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Miles.  
  
Q. I know you talked about this before, but you were in the situation a
few years ago pre-season top 25. What makes this team more equipped to handle
those expectations? Why are you confident this year will be different than it
was the last time you were in this position?  
TIM MILES: Well, the last group was a good group. We had some things go
monumentally wrong during the season, whether it be injury or illness,
whatever it might be. So I think it's hard to compare the two.  
  
Jim Molinari always told me, comparison is the thief of joy, so maybe you
should pay attention here (laughter).  
  
But at the same time I feel like we're just better equipped. This is a good
group, a group that has I think a high ceiling. When you look at James Palmer
Jr., Isaac Copeland playing better than I have ever seen. Glynn Watson, I
think he realizes where he fits in with this group, after having to carry a
big load for a couple years as a younger player, then fitting in later in
life. Isaiah Roby is getting better and better, too.  
  
Q. James Palmer was named to the All-Conference team. Can you talk a
little bit about his growth, also kind of how he's accepted being the lead guy
for this team.  
TIM MILES: James has been very impressive. As he came from Miami, he's gotten
a lot stronger, his ball skills have improved, his jump shot has improved,
which I think is important, his three-point shooting has to be better this
year.  
  
I think it's just his everyday habits are really, really good. I think that's
what's going to be a lot of fun working with him. One of the smartest players
on the floor that I've coached in a long, long time. He knows everything
that's going on, knows where everybody is supposed to be. You can tell him
something on a counter and in a quick, small amount of time, he picks it up,
executes it just like you've been practicing it all week.  
  
Q. Something you said during a radio interview over the summer, you said
you felt like you have top-four talent. What do you like with this group? What
can get you to the top four in the league?  
TIM MILES: Well, pretty sure we were fourth last year, too. I like this group
because I really think that all of these guys are getting better. So we have
four guys I think anybody in the league would take. That's not always been the
case. We might have one guy here or a guy there. We really have guys that I
think have a lot of talent, can carry a team.  
  
I just like the direction of their work ethic, of their leadership. That's why
I feel so strongly about them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
TIM MILES: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Iowa head coach Fran
McCaffery. Fran is starting his ninth year with the Hawkeyes and has coached
programs to postseason appearances 11 times throughout his coaching career.  
  
Coach, welcome back. We'll begin with your opening statement, open the floor
for questions.  
  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Thank you. It's great to be here.  
  
Real excited about our team.  
  
(Audio disconnection.)  
  
FRAN McCAFFERY: -- my staff did a great job this summer. I think you'll see a
marked improvement.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach McCaffery.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Tyler Cook a little bit. I know on Twitter he
seemed a little upset he wasn't on the All Pre-season Team. What in his
development this year do you think will allow him not to leave any questions
where he belongs among the elite players in the Big Ten?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: The thing about Tyler Cook that's been most impressive to me,
obviously he looked into making the jump, put his name in, went to the
workouts. I thought he was incredibly professional with how he went about
that.  
  
But as we all know, the critical thing is when you come back, to come back
with the right attitude. He has really impressed me from that standpoint. The
first conversation I had with him, he said, Coach, I want to do a better job
leading this team next year. He was only a sophomore last year. He was really
good, our leading scorer, leading rebounder, very impressive.  
  
But I think he recognizes now the jump that he has to make. He has made it, in
my estimation. Off the dribble, he's been phenomenal. Making plays for other
people this summer he's been phenomenal. His assist-turnover ratio throughout
a number of workouts has been spectacular.  
  
He probably should be upset. I always look at those lists and say, Well, yeah,
he probably should be on there, no question in my mind he should be on there.
It's not like you look at that list and say, A particular player is not really
good. That's essentially what this league is. Everybody that's on there is
really good. I think more importantly, where do you end up? Pre-season lists,
pre-season rankings don't mean a thing. We have to play the season.  
  
For him, I think it's more important that he end up as a first-round draft
pick than on any all-conference team.  
  
Q. What sort of ceiling do you see with Isaiah Moss this year?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Isaiah is really talented, very good offensive player. I think
he has the capability of being a really good defensive player. I think from
that standpoint I'd like to see him play both ends. Really good shooter. Has
the ability to score points in bunches. We saw that last year in particular in
the Minnesota game.  
  
But you're talking about a guy who physically is in a really good place, he's
worked really hard. He's a senior. Obviously he's a junior-eligible. He's a
senior. He's been experienced. He's been through this league, which is
absolutely critical as we all know. I think he's got the capability. He made
46 threes last year. That number will go up. He shoots a great percentage.
That will continue. I also think he could be a really good defender.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much for your time.  
  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined at the podium by Michigan State head coach Tom
Izzo. Tom enters his 24th season with the Spartans, earning 20 NCAA Tournament
berths. Last season Michigan State won the Big Ten regular season
championship.  
  
Coach, welcome. If you'd like to start with a statement, we'll open it up for
questions.  
  
TOM IZZO: I'm excited every year, but I guess a little more excited this year
just because I've got what I think is a pretty good team. I think we've got
something that we haven't had in the last couple years. We've got more
experience, maybe not quite as much talent, losing the two lottery picks we
lost. I got good guys and I got three players that have been around a while
now, actually four in McQuaid, Cassius, Nick Ward, Josh Langford, I think I
got three guys that have been through the wars, have started most of their
careers. I think they give us a chance to be good on both ends of the court.  
  
We did something last year that I'm not sure has ever been done in the league,
but definitely here, leading the nation in four categories with defense,
rebounding, blocked shots, yet wasn't quite good enough. We're out to make
amends on that. I love the guys I got, and looking forward to the challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. You are a little bit unique in that you lose three guys, good
players, bring in five, but the chemistry hasn't gone backwards at all, which
you would expect. How much of that is recruiting, getting to know them, how
much was pure luck?  
TOM IZZO: Well, you're right. Some of those guys, other than Aaron Henry, had
been up to our place a lot as sophomores and juniors and seniors. Aaron might
be the most ready to play just because of his body type. He came from one of
the best programs in Indiana, won a championship, so knows how to win.  
  
I think the way that happens is if you're ego-less. One thing Jaren,
especially Miles, has maybe taught this program, you can be great without
being entitled. This day and age, that's not always common. Those guys have
helped. The new guys came in, guys came in, they talked to them, that's all
helped.  
  
I would agree with you, I think our chemistry is really good. I think our new
stars, which would be Cassius, Josh, Nick, do not have big egos. I think it
really helped Nick. I don't say this very often, but it helped him, exploring
the waters is sometimes a problem because kids come back, they don't go
they're kind of half in. He jumped all the way in. He took what they said,
took it to heart, lost weight, probably had the best five months he's ever had
on the face of the earth.  
  
Q. We haven't talked to you since the court hearing in New York. Your
program was brought up in a good light. What is your response to that, to
hearing that? Maybe some vindication with that?  
TOM IZZO: For me, there's no vindication. It's sad what's happened. But the
problem I have is I learned last year that I don't know what's going on with
all that court case stuff out there. I don't know what's going on with each
program. I have enough trouble covering my own program. It seems like if we
pass judgment early, everybody in the world was guilty, now it looks like it
could go a different way.  
  
I think it's sad for college basketball and college sports. I think it's the
nature of the beast in what we dealt with. I don't feel vindicated because you
shouldn't be commended for doing what you're supposed to do, you should be --
and we didn't do anything any different than just about every program that I
know here does it the same way. I take my hat off to all the Big Ten coaches.  
  
Yet it's not healthy for our organization. It's not healthy for college
basketball. It's not healthy for college sports. Hopefully something will come
of it. I'm not just privy to know all the circumstances, so I'm not going to
comment on things that I don't really know enough about and just speculate.  
  
Q. You saw Cassius Winston take over games in conference play, but
struggled in the Syracuse game especially. Do you see him being that closer,
taking that role on this year?  
TOM IZZO: I do. I think Cassius is one of the smartest players. I've been
blessed with the Valentines and Draymonds, who I consider have huge basketball
IQs. If I think this team in general is a little better, I think we have a
better basketball IQ than some teams we've had. But Cassius is right up there
with one of the best we've ever had as far as his basketball IQ. It's just
putting the rest of his game together that's going to be a key.  
  
We all struggled. The coach did a bad job against Syracuse. That wasn't
Cassius. And Syracuse did a great job. So the combination of the two, we had
the third best three-point shooting team that shot 8-36 or something.  
  
I don't look at anything negative with that as far as Cassius. I look at what
he did with his body, continue to build that up, get stronger, get a little
tougher. It's amazing when you look at the stats, he led the Big Ten with
almost 56% three-point shooting in conference play last year. Then we do what
we did in that game...  
  
Maybe it goes by the adage, Live by the three, sometimes die by the three. I
think Cassius does have a chance to be one of the better players in this
league because his skill level, because of his intelligence, and because he's
got now experience.  
  
Q. With the off-season, how did you prepare the new athletes as well as
the veteran athletes? You came off a good season. How did you prepare them to
get ready for this season?  
TOM IZZO: I'm glad you reminded me, we did win 30 games, yet I can't blame the
media or the fans because I felt the same way. When you expect things, they
don't work out that way, it's disappointing.  
  
But I thought in all honesty, this off-season was really important to get Nick
back in the fold after he tested the waters. Thank God that was no work. I
mean, he came back, that day he started working out twice a day. As I said, I
see some guys that end up half in when they come back. That's what most people
warn you about. A guy tests the water and comes back, sometimes he's not all
the way in. Nick was all the way in. That made it easier.  
  
Josh and McQuaid are two guys that they're just grinders. They kind of set the
tone that Miles and Tum Tum left. That's just that constant work ethic. Pretty
soon we started dragging everybody with.  
  
So the off-season, the way the NCAA has done it now, we get more time in the
off-season, I think it's mostly good, a couple bads that you have to make sure
you balance everything. But I thought we had a great summer. It wasn't a
battle cry of, let's make up. We knew we were a good team last year, we knew
we got beat by a good team, we knew we didn't play or shoot well. It wasn't
like we were trying to correct a million things, we were just trying to -- our
battle cry this summer is we got to finish the job now. We finished it in the
Big Ten but we did not finish it in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. A little bit earlier you touched on Cassius Winston, what a great
basketball IQ he has. What about in terms of book smarts, overall
intelligence? I know he got into Harvard, enjoys reading. How would you rank
him among some of the other players you have in terms of overall intelligence,
leadership?  
TOM IZZO: Strange, you're right. He got into Harvard. I mean, I don't have a
lot of guys that do that.  
  
He's been great. He's been great because to his mother, she would rather him
be a great student than a great player. That balance, too, of this day and age
of college sports is refreshing. He's done a great job in the classroom. He's
an accountable kid, raised right.  
  
If I'm working on something with Cassius, it's the sense of urgency to be
great, not just really good. There's three phases, if you ask me: there's
good, great and elite. To win championships and to someday be an NBA Draft
pick, you got to start hitting that elite status. Only the best survive.
Sometimes his unselfishness is something -- I'm trying to get him a little bit
more selfish.  
  
That's a cool quality to have to coach. But you aren't going to get many
better kids than Cassius Winston. I'm just blessed to have him another year.  
  
Q. You've obviously been around long enough, from the 16 game, 18 game,
now 20 games, what is your thought about that? Seems like it's a tradeoff of a
couple of those guaranteed wins you'd have at home.  
TOM IZZO: Well, always as a coach you get mad at Jim Delany because he keeps
moving this thing up, then you see what it does for our league, for TV, for
exposure, and he's brilliant.  
  
It's something that I think we talked about in our meetings. Let's face it,
the only problem is you'd like to have the flexibility to be able to schedule
a bunch of other games non-conference. I think that's part of the fun. That's
what we've done a lot. Probably will still continue to do it. But something
that fans and media should understand, an average conference game is usually
tougher than a very good non-conference game because the conference, they know
each other, you're going to play in front of a rivalry crowd, things like
that.  
  
If you play even the bottom rung of the Big Ten, you play them at their place,
that's an extra game. When we went from 16 to 18, that was two games, it
seemed like four. Now going 18 to 20, we've got a pretty tough non-conference
schedule, starting out with the No. 1 team in the country in Kansas. It's
going to be an interesting challenge.  
  
But I think the madness behind it, it usually works out best for the student-
athletes, for the media, for the fans, and for the players because you play in
the best arenas, you play in the best games, you play in front of the most
people. It gets you the exposure you're looking for. Sometimes for a coach,
it's harder because it is just constantly grinding it. I think most coaches
like it, too. I know I do. I'd rather play good people.  
  
What does an off-day do? Take your wife out to dinner because you're playing a
dog? Once the season starts, that doesn't matter anyway, because she knows
dinner is usually at the end of the year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
TOM IZZO: Thank you.

DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us at the podium is Ohio State head coach Chris
Holtmann. Chris enters his second season with the Buckeyes after advancing to
the NCAA Tournament in his first season in Columbus. His fourth consecutive
season leading a program to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Coach, if you'd like to begin with an opening statement, we'll open the floor
for questions.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN sure, thank you.  
  
Excited to be here. It's a fun time of year. A lot of anticipation. We are
super excited about being here. Thank you all for coming and covering this
event.  
  
I really do feel like our league is poised for a very good year. I think when
you look at the returning players, and when you look at the recruiting
classes, the quality of coaching, I think our league is deep and poised for a
really good year.  
  
As far as we're concerned, I think we've got some questions that need to be
answered. We're in the process of trying to do that. We have a relatively new
team with six new players. We're excited about working with this group. We
understand we do have some questions that we have to answer as a group here.  
  
Like I said, we're in the midst of trying to do that. Excited about it. We
want to get everybody healthy first. We've only had one full day of practice
with every guy due to some bangs and bruises. But excited about moving
forward.  
  
We have a very, very challenging schedule ahead of us. Particularly early with
some true road games that I think are really exciting for our fans, but can be
challenging for a new group.  
  
I'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. As you look at this year, is maybe the most on-the-radar year you've
had as a coach given the success you had last year, attention people are going
to be paying to you now?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: On the radar meaning?  
  
Q. From an outside perspective, is the most you feel people are watching
you, what job you're going to be doing this year?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think the nature of our business is you're being evaluated
on pretty much a game-to-game basis. I don't know that the scrutiny is any
greater now than what it has been in the past. I think people are curious
about how we're going to transition from four really good seniors, important
players, in particular Keita Bates-Diop and Jae'Sean Tate. I do think people
are curious about that, curious about how to implement six new players. So I'm
anxious to see, as our fans are, how we're going to manage that.  
  
Q. Speak on your freshmen Luther Muhammad, what you like about him, what
you think some of his challenges might be breaking into the rotation?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Absolutely. Luther Muhammad has been a really important
recruit for us, given our lack of guard depth. We have loved coaching him. He
has a tremendous work ethic, capacity for work. He is really competitive. I
think he has the ability to impact the game on both ends. He's been really
well-coached in high school. Comes from a terrific program.  
  
He's going to play an important role really from day one for us. We're excited
about his development. I think some of his challenges will be like any
freshman: understanding some of the things you can and cannot do at this
level.  
  
Q. You mentioned some of the recruiting class. You guys get to see all
these guys in recruiting. Who are three, four, five guys around the league who
you think fans really should pay attention to early on?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Freshmen that are ready to make an impact?  
  
Q. Yes.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Obviously I think Romeo Langford is one of the very first ones
that comes to mind. Many people are aware of his talent, his ability,
certainly what he's going to mean for Indiana. I think he is a part of a very
gifted and talented Indiana team.  
  
I think the young man from Michigan has a chance to have a real impact. I
didn't see him a whole lot, but I think he's got a chance to have a real
impact from day one from what I understand.  
  
I think there are many others. I know Minnesota has a terrific, versatile big
that they've added to their roster that we're excited about. I'm sure will
have a tremendous Big Ten career.  
  
Q. Coming off a great season, what plans have you done as a coach as
well as a team to get you prepared for this season?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well, we tried to put last year as quickly as possible in the
rearview mirror. I think you get asked about last year's team because it was a
fun team for people to watch and observe. But we tried to quickly turn the
page as much as possible.  
  
I think our guys understand that many of the major components of last year's
team are gone. That's exciting for them in new roles. But we tried to quickly
turn the page and focus on the development and the growth of this team on a
day-to-day basis. That's probably been the most important thing we've tried to
do.  
  
Q. Obviously this year the Big Ten tournament moves back to its
traditional week. How is that going to help with that extra week?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think the rest will help. Lord knows, I can use all the help
possible when it comes to Big Ten tournament, conference tournaments for that
matter. But I do like the week of rest. I do think the schedule, as it is now,
sets up better for a more quality tournament, and hopefully for post-season
play.  
  
I don't know that it limited any of us last year, the added rest going into
the NCAA Tournament. But I certainly like this setup better.  
  
Q. Keyshawn Woods coming from Wake Forest probably counting on him to
play some pretty good minutes for you. What is your thought after two weeks
working every day on this, what you're seeing and getting with him?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: He's been good. He's been good for us. He's a solid player
right now, has a terrific feel for the game, which means he's going to play a
significant amount of point guard for us, as well as off the ball, really all
three perimeter spots.  
  
He's been really solid for us. Kind of what we've expected. I think he's
waiting a little bit to assert a level of leadership. I think he wants his
teammates to observe how he works on a day-to-day basis. But as you mentioned,
he is critical for this group.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much for your time.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Thank you. Have a great day.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us we today is Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard.  
  
Gard is in his fourth season at the helm of the Badger program, leading them
to the NCAA tournament twice. Wisconsin is returning all five starters from
last year's team, including unanimous pre-season all Big Ten selection Ethan
Happ.  
  
Coach, start with an opening statement, we'll open the floor for questions.  
  
GREG GARD: Thank you.  
  
We're about 11 days into practice. Excited about our group. Really they've
come to work every day. Obviously as you just heard we have pretty much
everybody back from last year. To be able to start, hit the floor running, so
to speak, how they've competed in drill work, how they competed in some short
scrimmage situations we've been in, competition has been extremely high.  
  
It's a group that's really hungry and eager, obviously having that much
experience back has helped us expedite things through the pre-season, albeit
you take it step by step. We're excited about where we're at. The potential
for this group, where they go, how they can grow, looking forward to
continuing to grow through the rest of this month and jump into games in
November.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Ethan Happ has grown every season, spiking to over 35% last year, you
have guys coming back from injury, any reason you think that trend won't
continue this year?  
GREG GARD: In terms of growing?  
  
I think obviously you have a young man that brings a lot of experience back.
Just looking through things with him statistically, what he's done for this
program, he's going to go down as one of the best that's ever played
statistically at Wisconsin, obviously his impact on and off the floor has been
tremendous.  
  
But also he does, as you mentioned, we have a lot more pieces around him that
can come to his aid and his assistance. I think that's a natural progression
that when you have a new group together on the floor, the older guy, the more
experienced guy, carries more of the load early. I think we saw more balance
as we went through the year, started to balance out a little bit as obviously
we worked into February.  
  
But I know he's excited about the guys that are around him this year, but also
we understand how much of an impactful player he is, how good he can be. We'll
definitely try to utilize him the best we can. He has great teammates around
him, too.  
  
Q. Talk about the off-season for Brad Davison. He had shoulder injury
last year, was able to overcome that, playing through pain. What kind of
development do you hope he makes this year, obviously healthy?  
GREG GARD: Well, I think obviously you mentioned the shoulder injury, he had
repaired right away as soon as our season was over last March. He's gone
through an extensive rehab process and doing some really good things.  
  
I think the thing that jumps out about Brad, that shines with him everywhere,
is his personality, his leadership ability, his communication ability, how he
relates to whether it's upperclassmen, players about his age, student-athletes
that are younger, how he's taken the freshmen under his wing. Just his
personality that everybody sees on the floor is the same thing that resonates
throughout the other courses of his day, hours in his day.  
  
He's impactful in so many ways. His fingerprints were all over the improvement
and how we played at the end of the year. I know he's excited to be healthy
and to have, as I mentioned talking about Ethan, having guys returning around
him that can utilize the experience that they gained last year, put us in
position to have a great experience this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the motivation from the guys and from the program
after last year not making the tournament in 20 years, talk about the
atmosphere and the motivation coming into this season, what that feels like
for the team.  
GREG GARD: Yeah, I think you utilize and you reflect and you learn, albeit
quickly on what we went through last year, you utilize those experiences to
improve yourself, to grow. This group has done a terrific job of kind of
harnessing what we went through last year, learning from it, how they were
able to play down the stretch, play pretty well. How do you take all those
experiences and utilize those through the off-season, but also getting back
here this fall, getting into drills, official practices? We started last week.  
  
There's an experience level that they went through last year that's created an
edge to them, created a competitive drive internally. Having more guys back,
more healthy bodies, it's made practices much more competitive. Obviously
we're in a position where we have more bodies. That in itself raises the level
by how we're able to compete and practice with each other.  
  
It's a learning experience, something that obviously you go through, you
become better on the other end of it because of it.  
  
This group has done a good job of keeping things in perspective, understanding
how they can utilize that experience. They have done that. They've put
themselves in position to grow upon what they went through last year and
learned, improve. We're looking forward to that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.  
  
GREG GARD: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Jim Delany](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24310)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: Good morning. Let me start off by making a couple of
preliminary comments, looking backwards a little bit, looking forward to the
upcoming season and seasons, and also then provide most of the time for you to
ask some questions.  
  
Looking back to last year, certainly with Michigan playing their way to the
championship game, it's a great season for them and represented us extremely
well. Penn State playing its way to the NIT championship was another highlight
last year.  
  
But last year I think was our first year with our four TV partners, other than
the NFL we enjoy partners across FOX, CBS, ESPN, and BTN that I think provides
unbelievable exposure for our programs, big platforms, great promotion from
those companies.  
  
Attendance, 42nd year in a row we led the country in attendance. Continue to
do things in scheduling and other ways to bring Big Ten fans to our venues.  
  
One thing that we're going to be doing going forward is adopting the 20-game
conference schedule. We're pleased about that. If you went back a decade ago,
we had a year where we were 16, then went 18, now 20. I had a couple coaches
jokes last night someday we'll be at 26. I don't know if that will be a fact
any time soon.  
  
Conference games by and large are winners with our fans, provide great
competition for our players, and certainly television likes that they rate
extremely well.  
  
In the format, a 20-game format, everybody will have seven partners that they
play on a regular basis twice, then six that sort of rotate. We've got three
protected rivalries, Purdue-Indiana, Illinois-Northwestern, and Michigan-
Michigan State. If you really inspect it closely, there's more, the closer you
are to each other geographically, the more you play each other. We're going to
try to leverage rivalries in that way.  
  
Last year we exceeded three million fans for the fourth year in a row. We had
80 sellouts. For the 11th year in a row we put two teams into the Sweet 16.
We've continued to move teams into the Final Four and the Elite 8. Next four
years, Chicago, Indianapolis, Chicago, Indianapolis. Long-term, as noted,
we'll have probably 80% of our post-season play in the Midwestern region,
probably 20% out east.  
  
We had a very successful opportunity to play in New York City, very good
crowds, great excitement. We've talked to them about the future. We've
presented them with a powerful promotion plan that we think, along with other
conferences, if you can elevate Madison Square Garden, we think we can elevate
that to the next level with regard to a college basketball post-season.  
  
We're not going to be able to play early, but if we can play in a regular date
in the out years, that would be something we would try to achieve with really
strong presence 80% of the time in the Midwest. But that's part of our
conference territory. We want to be in our legacy territory, as well as out
east from time to time.  
  
We have 14 coaches back, which is good news. We're looking forward to
continuing working with them. We were with them last night. They're optimistic
and excited about the start of the season.  
  
This is college basketball. College basketball has been challenged, is being
challenged. A lot of that is in the Southern District of New York now. It's
not a good story, but we have to be realistic about it. There are issues and
challenges. But we're committed to try to do it the right way.  
  
You can change rules, but you also have to change culture if you're going to
get different results. We're going to continue to recruit students, graduate
students, develop students. We've had six students been National Players of
the Year in the last decade, all of whom have gone on to professional careers.
We're proud of them. Proud of the coaches and young people that come to our
campuses. We'll see what's outcomes are, but we're excited about the way the
game is presented.  
  
This conference and the players that play on the courts right now are the
number one in the peer group of the A-five number one GSR graduation rate. So
we are trying to graduate students. We're trying to develop students, market
the games, trying to play each other more, and we're trying to push into the
NCAA Tournament after having a strong regular season.  
  
I should say that there are challenges in college basketball, especially with
regard to November and December games. We've tried to enhance that. We've
tried to enhance it with the ACC Challenge, with the Gavitt Games, and you'll
see this year, everywhere we play home and away games early December and late
November. It has grown in an amazing way.  
  
30 years ago we had 15 bowls, started on December 25th, ended January 1st.
Today the bowl season starts earlier, you have conference championship games,
goes all the way to January 10th. We have to find ways to present basketball.
We shouldn't give up November and December. We're going to try to have more
meaningful games, we have 22 pretty powerful games. We're not going to go to
cede the college sports scene to college football. We want college basketball
to be successful, while college football is doing well, as well. We've given a
lot of thought of presenting college basketball through our partners, we have
the cooperation of our coaches on this. I think it's going to be good for us
going along.  
  
I think others will adopt 20-game schedules, play each other more. I don't
think there's anything less interesting than a bad college basketball in the
month of November. We're trying to improve it.  
  
Let me stop there and see what questions you may have for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. What do you think the impact of the trial in New York will be on
college sports in general?  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: I mean, it's certainly an unsettling, negative
narrative. Not shocking to me. I would say there's going to be three trials.
Every day there seems to be revelations. Some of them are new, some have been
heard before. These are statements made under oath as a result of the FBI wire
taps of hundreds of hours, if not more, thousands of conversations. Very
negative.  
  
I would say as negative as it is, there's no doubt that they are storm clouds
of a significant magnitude, we have 300 Division I institutions, and we have a
thousand players that are going recruited every year. While these are not
isolated, I think they are, at a certain level of recruitment, at certain
institutions, appear to be a pattern. These are not to be dismissed, taken
seriously.  
  
But I will tell you this, I think there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
of players who are recruited properly, and hundreds and hundreds of programs
that are clean and do it by the book. But there's no doubt in certain places,
at certain times, there's been a total crater in terms of approach in terms of
compliance with the rules that we pass and that our institutions pass. While a
lot of us have had suspicions and concerns for a very long time, I would tell
you that there are a lot of people that still do it the right way.  
  
We have a rule of law. We have due process. People will be charged. They have
been charged. They will get their day in court. The theory of the government
will be tested. The jury will make its decision. We have an opportunity here
to get better and healthier. I hope we take advantage of that.  
  
Q. Can you explain, since you are a lawyer, the government's case as to
what makes this criminal as opposed to NCAA charges. When you talk about
changing culture, how do you go about doing that when rules are in place but
already being violated?  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: The government, I'm not going to try to interpret the
government's theory of the case. I know that there's money moving across state
lines. I know there's statutes that are intended to protect institutions.
There's the prosecution decision that this activity crosses a line.  
  
That's a question better left to them. I haven't practiced law for 40 years. I
read the same papers you do. So your understanding of their theory is probably
as good as mine.  
  
As far as culture and rules are concerned, I think it's always been an issue
probably going back, Dave Robson wrote a book, if you read his book about
college football in the 1890s, there always have been these issues. They used
to involved boosters, third parties shoe companies, commercial interests of
one kind or another, agents and runners. I think there has to be a recognition
that our approach can't be the same approach we took in the '80s. I don't
think the colleges and the NCAA will ever get the kinds of governmental
authority that it takes to break a conspiracy of silence or conspiracy of
hiding their approach.  
  
I do think we can set up evaluation processes, I think we can set up
relationships with the companies that are cleaner, better, less conflict
ridden. I think the coaches who coach, that are brought in to recruit, can be
better educated. I think that the expectations can be clearer.  
  
So I don't think any of the Rice Commission recommendations will solve them by
themselves. I do think culture is something beyond the rules. It's about
people and expectations, then institutions, NCAA and others taking action when
they see something wrong.  
  
I don't think there is going to flip in 60 days, but I do think we're in a
process of change. My hope would be in future years we'll be better than we
are today, because what we have today is not a good scene.  
  
Q. Listening to you discuss this issue, it's very complex, I understand.
I know you're not the NCAA, don't make any of these decisions. When you hear a
year and a half ago or last fall when this came out with a shoe company is
involved brazenly with buying athletes, why would the NCAA certify any events
connected with that company going forward until such time that they prove
they're not flouting the rules of the NCAA? I think a zero tolerance policy or
it's going to continue to happen.  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: I agree with you. I don't know what their
certification process is. I think they're intending based on the Rice
Commission to move evaluation processes in different directions. That's in the
process of being formulated. I think you're going to see more evaluation on
our campuses in areas where we have more control.  
  
I agree with you. This didn't happen overnight. This has been going on for 30
years. It really wasn't much of an environment like this in the '80s or '70s.
They had different challenges. It's not news to anybody who covers it. It's
not news to anybody who recruits in it. It's not news to anybody who tries to
oversee it. It's not a pretty situation.  
  
Having said that, I have to tell you there are a lot of men who work in a lot
of programs who don't engage in it, but there are some who do.  
  
Q. You mentioned going forward with the conference tournament, 80% will
be in the Midwest. Are you speaking about Chicago and Indianapolis or other
Midwestern cities?  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: I think Chicago, it's great to be back in Chicago.
It's the number three market in the country, number one to Big Ten. We're
fortunate to have Chicago and Indianapolis. Two of the great college
basketball towns, college sports towns in the country.  
  
After we get out in four years and put a plan out and send it, think it will
be more open and more competitive. There will be other opportunities for other
cities to express interest. There's no plan to put Indianapolis and Chicago,
great cities, but there will be a competitive environment and others will have
a chance to comment on their interest in the out years.  
  
Q. You talked about third parties, boosters. There's clearly a black
market, whatever you want to call it, for players that are talented. Why is
there a thought that there's anything other than paying players that's going
to alleviate these problems?  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: Because while there is a certain portion of
compromised players, compromised programs, I don't think anybody would dispute
that, we are in a business that is student based, education based. I think we
have over $200 million of financial aid, most kids don't go pro, but some do.
To be honest with you, there should be more access to professional sports. We
have it in baseball and other sports. We have different kinds of rules. Those
are a function of who can go pro is how good you are, but it's really the
players union and the owners who prevent that.  
  
I'm very pleased that the NBA, it's at least taking up the rules that prohibit
access by young players to professional sports. That's not the business we're
in. We're in the business of creating opportunities for men, for women, for
white guys, black guys, international guys, international women. We have
10,000 athletes, 200 some million dollars of financial aid, 300 teams, 28
championships. That's what we do. We do have a problem in certain parts of our
sports programs. And there is a black market. It's not a new black market. I
mean, it was there in the '70s, it was there in the '40s. I spent five years
as an NCAA investigator in the '70s.  
  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: It was a different problem then. It was a booster
problem. We don't have a booster problem, but we have a corporate problem.
Before you throw the baby out with the bath water, say the only answer is to
have a draft, pay players at certain colleges, that will solve it. You have a
situation in the NBA where you have players caps. You have a variety of other
mechanisms. People violate that. They lose first round draft choices. People
in many cases are broken timber. We do have the rule of laws. There's being
tested in the courts. Like the cases in New York, we'll live with the outcome.
People have access to the courts. We've won some, we've lost some. We got one
in California that's ongoing now. It will go to the Supreme Court.  
  
I think our way of doing business is justified, justifiable historically.
We'll see whether or not college sports will be college sports 10 years from
now. It's being challenges in a lot of different ways. In the interim, until
those decisions are rendered in New York, California, or by the Supreme Court,
we'll try to manage and provide as many quality educational opportunities as
we can, notwithstanding the fact it's an imperfect system and people are
imperfect as they try to work through it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Commissioner Jim Delany, thank you very much for your time.  
  
COMMISSIONER JIM DELANY: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined at the podium by Northwestern head coach Chris
Collins. Collins enters his sixth season with the Wildcats, led Northwestern
to its first NCAA Tournament appearance in program history in 2017.  
  
Coach, we'll start with your opening statement, then take questions.  
  
CHRIS COLLINS: Good morning. Good to see everybody again. Before I get
started, obviously we lost a great member of the Northwestern basketball
family last night in Tex Winter. I got to know Tex a little bit. He was an
assistant coach for my father with the Bulls in the '80s. Terrific basketball
mind, person. I want to wish his family all the best. Tough loss last night.  
  
Coming into the season, as all coaches are now, we haven't lost any games, so
we're all really excited. We all feel really good about our teams. But I'm
looking forward to seeing what our group can become. We have a really
interesting mix of newcomers and some mainstays. I've been really proud of the
leadership of our senior class, Dererk Pardon, Jordan Ash and Vic Law, that
set a really good tone for six new players, four freshmen and two transfers
that we're going to count on.  
  
We're still in the process of figuring out kind of how our pieces fit, who
we're going to be as a team. I think we have good players. I think we have a
good mindset. Obviously we're opening a brand-new arena this year, which is
going to give us a nice jolt of energy getting back home, back on campus,
really excited about what that's going to bring for our team.  
  
Really looking forward, it's going to be a great conference season. A lot of
good teams, terrific coaching obviously. I mean, for the first time in a
while, there's no new coaches. Every program in our conference has a good
culture, has a good plan. The games are going to be hard-fought. I think it's
going to be up to us to become that tough-minded group that finds a way to win
in a tough conference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Obviously two years ago make the tournament, not last year. For a
gentleman like you that's building a program, how do they take the next step
from going to not just celebrating a tournament but now being there
consistently? How do you teach them that?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Yeah, it's a mindset, it's a consistent work ethic. We're very
proud of what we've done over the past five years, how we've grown. You learn
lessons along the way, good and bad. I think for our older guys, specifically
Vic Law and Dererk Pardon, having the year two years ago where we were a
together group, played well, then last year just could never put all the
pieces together, kind of find that consistency, I think shows the value of
what you have to do day in and day out. You can never assume anything. If you
have a lot of guys coming back, you feel like you're the same team, every year
is new, and you got to work every day as if you have never won a game. You
have to build that camaraderie again, and build that teamwork again.  
  
I've been really proud of our guys, the way they've handled the off-season. We
don't talk about last year. I think that's redundant. I think we look forward.
We have a lot of new players. There's new blood in the program, new energy.
We're excited about what we can potentially become, what can potentially come
of our team this year. We know it's a new journey. We've tried to work
incredibly hard to get ready for the season.  
  
Q. Your team struggled shooting the ball, especially from deep, last
year. How much do you expect to focus or have Ryan Taylor as a focal point in
this offense?  
CHRIS COLLINS: That's something that we would get into ruts offensively at
times. It's hard to win when you have six to eight-minute stretches in games
where you don't score, or you go into that drought. It's something we've
really tried to address in recruiting. Having a guy like Ryan Taylor, coming
from Evansville, was the leading score in the Missouri Valley, is an elite-
level shooter and shot-maker, is going to give us another potent weapon
offensively.  
  
I feel like we have more shot-makers than we've had in the past. Certainly
we're going to miss what McIntosh and Lindsey brought in the backcourt. But
with the pieces we added, the ability to have more guys that can put the ball
in the basket will help some of those offensive woes we went through at times
last year.  
  
Q. Obviously in the past couple seasons, the question of who is going to
bring up the ball, initiate the offense is pretty clear. Is there an
individual that might be stepping up into that role?  
CHRIS COLLINS: I think it's going to be maybe a little bit of both. We have a
couple guys in Jordan Ash and Ryan Greer who are more point guard types. Then
I think you'll also see us take a look at more unconventional lineups. I feel
one of the strengths of our team is our versatility on the perimeter, guys
like Anthony Gaines and A.J. Turner, who is a newcomer, who sat out from
Boston College, Ryan Taylor, Vic Law, Miller Kopp as a freshman, Pete Nance as
a freshman. I feel like we have a lot of guys on the perimeter that have
length, that have size, that can score, do a little bit of everything.  
  
I think you'll see us take a look at different lineups, kind of find that
right mix. Certainly we don't have anybody who is going to do what Bryant
McIntosh did. He was a special player, did a lot of great things in our
program. I think we can be effective in different ways. I think you'll see us
take a look at some different lineups and things defensively to tailor what
the guys we do have to the floor.  
  
Q. This Vic Law guy seems very interesting, seems like a dynamic guy. I
want to know how you're going to use him this year.  
CHRIS COLLINS: I hope he plays some defense (laughter). It's special to have
Vic Law back for his fifth year. Vic was the first guy who committed to me
when I first got the job at Northwestern. We have a special bond because of
that. He's been an incredible leader for us.  
  
I've always said Vic is the jack-of-all-trades type of player. He's at his
best when he's impacting the game in a lot of different ways. I think he can
score, but I think he -- I really believe he's a leading candidate for
Defensive Player of the Year in the conference, his defensive versatility to
guard four positions, the impact he can have at that end on the glass. I'm
really going to challenge him from a leadership perspective. With a lot of new
guys, the connection that he and I and Dererk and Jordan, those older guys, we
have to collectively lead this group and make sure that we're always on the
right path towards winning. He's done a great job with that.  
  
I think you'll see Vic have a really good year this year.  
  
Q. Last year Miles Bridges told me it was ridiculous that the NCAA kept
him from spending time with Tom Izzo. That's why he came back. Engineering
students aren't hindered. Do you think it's ridiculous that the NCAA is made
up of bureaucrats and there's no coaches?  
CHRIS COLLINS: I mean, I guess, the way you put it. Look, I mean, I think
they're trying to do the best that they can. There's been a lot of talk of
adding more former coaches, people that are going to be in the room that can
give a coach's perspective.  
  
Inherently, when it comes to spending time with the players, I believe guys
that want to be good, they want to be coached by their coaches, they want to
get on the floor. I think there's a fine line figuring out the time
management. They did give us a couple more hours than we've had in the past
when it comes to being on the court with our guys in the off-season. I think
more of that is nothing but a positive.  
  
Guys are going to be training. If you're not letting us work with them,
they're going to find it in other avenues. So, you know, the guys who want to
invest, want to be good, they want to be able to work with their coaches.
Anything we can make, any steps to continue to do that, are very much
positives in my book.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much for your time.  
  
CHRIS COLLINS: Thank you, guys.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Penn State head coach
Patrick Chambers. Chambers begins his eighth season and welcomes back 10
letter winners from last year's squad that won the National Invitational
Tournament.  
  
We'd like to start with your opening statement, Coach.  
  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Good morning. Penn State basketball definitely climbed last
year. I feel like the players feel it, there's great momentum for us. The fans
feel it, as evidenced by our ticket sales right now are skyrocketing, which is
fantastic. We're climbing in the right direction. I think that's why there's
so much optimism surrounding our program right now.  
  
I think we see it recruiting. I think the Big Ten conference sees it as well.
We're returning three fantastic players. I think our frontline can go against
anybody in the country. These guys need to build, though, off that 26-win
season last year. Cutting down the nets at MSG, we broke 51 records last year.
So really exciting stuff for Penn State basketball.  
  
Led by Josh Reaves, All-Defensive Team last year. Mike Watkins, All-Defensive
Team last year. Lamar Stevens, Most Outstanding Player in the NIT, honorable
mention, All Big Ten. You have three veterans right there who have logged a
lot of minutes.  
  
You add in big John Harrar, who helped us to a 7-1 record at the starting
position. That's a frontline to be reckoned with.  
  
You throw Jamari Wheeler in there. Again, that NIT run was a valuable
experience for these guys, all right? A ton of minutes to educate them so they
can learn how hard it is to be successful in this league.  
  
You marry that with a great young freshman class that we have, really skilled,
really talented, high IQs, really shoot the basketball. There's great optimism
for Penn State basketball.  
  
Leads us to our schedule. Our non-conference schedule is going to be the most
difficult we've had in my tenure. We're hoping that non-conference schedule
prepares us for the 20-game slate that the Big Ten now has us playing. That
will put us in position to get that NCAA Tournament berth. That's the goal,
make no mistake about it. That is the next step in our process, the next step
in our climb is to get to that next tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. You said the season tickets are spiking. Bryce Jordan has always been
the quietest arena in the Big Ten, that's a challenge you have to face. Do you
have any numbers that you're willing to share with us at this point?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I'll share some numbers with you last year: The last five
games of the year we averaged close to 11,500 fans. It really became a home-
court advantage for us. In Madison Square Garden, our numbers were huge as far
as Rutgers and Penn State filling MSG. For the championship game we have
11,500, most since 2005. So I think Penn State fans want good basketball.
They're craving good basketball. I think they're sensing an incredible buzz
about what we're doing.  
  
With the guys we have coming back, I think that's why you see a great spike in
our ticket sales.  
  
Q. You said you got to keep climbing, take the next step to get to the
NCAA Tournament. Losing a guy like Tony Carr, what is it going to take, what
do you think you have in place besides that front court that's going to get
you to the next step?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Tony Carr was a great player. You're never replacing a kid
like Tony Carr. Our first draft choice since 1999. He's doing terrific. It's
got to be a collective effort led by Lamar, Josh and Mike. We have great
leaders this year, coupled with a lot of talent. So the next step for us is
defending a little bit better, rebounding a little bit better, doing the
little things just a little bit better, and more consistently.  
  
I think if we get more consistency from our frontline and our veterans, I
think the younger guys are going to follow suit. One advantage we have is when
Lamar, Tony, that great group came in, I don't know if we had the leadership.
This year we have the leadership. That should pull us through, especially in
tough times, especially on the road in the Big Ten, when the venues are very
difficult to play in.  
  
Q. You talked about replacing Tony from the standpoint of leadership,
that sort of thing. How about positionally, what you do in the backcourt?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Right now Jamari Wheeler is playing great basketball. I
think you remember him from last year, shot out of a cannon. Great defender.
Also good at managing the team right now. Really bringing those freshmen
guards along, setting the table for Josh, Lamar and Mike to be successful on
the offensive end.  
  
As long as he continues on that path, I think he's got a great chance to do
something special for us, to lead us.  
  
Couple with that Rasir Bolton, Myles Dread, Myreon Jones, really talented
freshmen that can score the basketball, high IQs, can score off the bounce.
You add those four guys together, they're not going to average 19, one guy,
but I think collectively we can get anywhere from 20 to 25 points out of those
guys. That's the goal for them.  
  
I don't want to put a lot of pressure on them, which is another advantage.
When Tony came in, there was a lot of pressure on him. I gave him the ball
from the start. Now you have four guys that can really handle business. Jamari
got great experience last year to be able to pass down to these younger guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Chambers, thank you so much for your time.  
  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 11, 2018

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined at the podium by Michigan head coach John
Beilein. Coach Beilein enters his 12th year with the Wolverines. Coach, if
you'd like to begin with an opening statement, we'll open the floor for
questions.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you.  
  
It is great to be here this year. It's wonderful to see this. I've been 12
years in the league, watching this league continue to grow. I think we're in
for a heck of a year. We all know it's well-documented, we had four teams in
last year. There was a reason for that: it's that we're a young league, and we
have teams that have almost everybody back that are going to be terrific.
They're not going to be the 10th or 11th team in this league like some of you
project. They're really good.  
  
It's going to be a dogfight all year long. I think the league is as balanced
as it's ever been, maybe more than it's ever been. It's going to lead to a lot
of excitement all across Big Ten country and around the country as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll open up the floor for questions.  
  
Q. In addition to the scoring, you really lost the heart of your team. I
know it's an issue every year in college basketball. Is it more of a challenge
this year to find that blend of leadership, that voice in the locker room
after losing so many great veteran players?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think it's more than just the players, it's the style we could
play. We had a guy Muhammad-Ali had 135 assists and 35 turnovers. He led the
country in that category. You have a shooting big that can make 69 threes, it
changes everything. I have think it's that. Duncan Robinson, allowed us to
play four-on-four.  
  
It's not just that, but the style that we're going to have to play, we have to
adapt again. He we had to adapt last year, midway, to some things. Again, I
think that's what I love: embracing change, trying to change your team both
offensively and defensively what can work. I think we have a chance to be a
good defensive team again, but I think offensively we're a work in progress.  
  
Q. Two years ago your offensive efficiency was top five, last year
defensive efficiency was top five. What is the key to adjusting leaning on a
defense last year versus offense, then defense again this year?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think it evolves. We could see it more this year, I hope we're
right, that with the four hours we could work with kids in the summer, you
could see some things. Now, after 10 days of practice, I think today is our
10th day of practice, you can see we're going to be able to do this. How do
you create points? Last year there was no question after four weeks of
practice, we weren't going to be at offensively efficient as we were with
Derrick Walton, D.J. Wilson, and Zak Irvin. I said, We're going to have to
spend more time on defense.  
  
It's really hard to, if you're a hell of a coach if you're top five in both,
top 10 in both. I said, It's okay. A lot of ways to win. If we're going to
slip to, what were we, 30 to 50, in offense, we can't be 100 in defense,
right? We're not going to have a very good year. We were able to flip those.  
  
Q. You went to the national championship game now twice I think in five
years. What is your overall thought? Is there regret obviously that a lot of
coaches coach for 10, 20 years, never get there, even to a Final Four? For you
to have been there twice and not won it... Could you look at it and say, We
must be doing something right to get to the Final Four, to play for the
championship? If we just stay the course, we will break through at some
point?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I mean, that's a great question. I think my regrets are that I
wasn't able to lead those kids to win it. I say this as honestly as I can say
anything. Nothing about me personally. This is not going to define me as a
coach, whether it could win this thing. It's about what could I have done
better to get Mo Wagner, Duncan, Muhammad, all our guys to a championship last
year?  
  
This is a thing with our league, we have had -- Wisconsin has been there a
couple times, Michigan State has been there, we've been there, last 10 years.
We're right there. This is a referee's call, this a ball bounce the wrong way,
this is an injury away from us winning, it's that simple. It will all come
back around.  
  
Our programs are just too good not to win a national championship somewhere
along the line.  
  
Q. On the 20-game schedule, do you like it? Would you rather have it be
18 or 16? What are your thoughts on that? What are your thoughts on two Big
Ten games being earlier in the season?  
JOHN BEILEIN: First, I didn't think I would like the 20. But scheduling is so
difficult, trying to get teams to play you home and home. We've been able to
really do a good job with that. It's really hard.  
  
If Jim said we're going to go to 22 or 24, what do you think about going to
26? This is crazy now, I'd say, You know what, let's do it. Scheduling is
really, really hard. Right now we have 25 or 26 -- I think we have 25 Power 5
type of games. Obviously counting the Big East being in that. That's really
good.  
  
But that is hard to schedule home and home. Getting home games for your
students in December is everything. If you were with our games last year, with
Ohio State -- I'm sorry, home with Indiana, away at Ohio State, that first
weekend in December, packed arenas, it was great. One of the best moves we've
made is play in December and expand the schedule.  
  
Who knows where it could go from here.  
  
Q. In regards to the federal trial that's ongoing, were you aware of the
allegations that came out about former Michigan receiver Tai Streets?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Somebody just mentioned that to me. I don't know enough about it
right now.  
  
Q. Is there any concern about potential violation?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I don't think you ever have to worry about us and that in any
area.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you very much.

## March 4, 2018

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Isaac Haas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27912)

_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 75, Purdue - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Congratulations obviously goes out to Michigan. I thought they
played a very good game. A very tough matchup for anybody in the country,
well-coached. Have really kind of scrapped their offense and just tried to
spread people out and break people down within our league, especially us
because of our size.  
  
And I thought they did a really good job of moving the basketball, kind of
finding the matchups they want, breaking us down off the dribble. We were
fortunate I felt to be down five at half. They missed some open shots and I
thought we could make a little run there.  
  
In the beginning of the second half, we'd get two or three stops, about three
stops in a row, but we couldn't get an offensive rebound. Then when we would
go to the matchup, to try to switch and then they had a size advantage down
low on a couple of rebounds. We got a foul called against us we couldn't get a
couple of balls.  
  
I thought that was a real important time in the game. They gained momentum
will, never looked back. I thought the guys at the end we gave some energy and
we played hard but that happens after you get down at that time. But hats off
to Michigan for winning the Big Ten Tournament.  
  
Q. Isaac, if you can assess just what you thought of your team's effort
in this game?  
ISAAC HAAS: I thought that at the beginning that we didn't give our best
effort. And I think that showed. And then towards the end of the second half
we showed pretty well, pretty good effort. But it was too late by that time.  
  
Q. Isaac, with Jon Teske in the game instead of Wagner what are the
differences between those two? And what were the challenges of Teske today?  
ISAAC HAAS: I think he hit a few crucial shots for them. He played well. So
you've got to give him credit. Wagner obviously is a guy, he can pick and pop
and do a lot of things. So you've got to respect them on that. And he did his
thing. And we just let Teske be a part of the game.  
  
Q. Isaac, I know it's obviously not the result you will vote for, but
how much has Carsen grown in meaning to you guys in these last couple of
months, in particular in a tournament setting? He had such a strong setting
here.  
ISAAC HAAS: I think he's a great player. He does good things for us. He's able
to go get a bucket if we need one. He's an elite scorer and people don't
respect him as such, I feel like sometimes. And I think he does a great job
creating opportunities for others as well.  
  
I think he's done a really good job maturing this year and I think he's a huge
part of this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Basically the same question. I know it's not the game you wanted to
have, but not just tonight but this weekend and just these last couple of
months how much has Carsen grown in meaning to you guys?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, Carsen is a very dynamic player. And he can really get on
-- he can get into runs where he scores the basketball.  
  
Just kind of finding that rhythm in a game, like getting those rhythm, pull-up
3s and getting to the rim. Whenever he's driving the basketball and getting
his layups and getting to the free-throw line to go along with his 3s, that's
kind of the total package for him.  
  
But he's really grown here going from January to February you'll watch tape
even of some games earlier, like when we played Michigan, you can see how he's
grown and been able to take advantage of some opportunities. He's hard to deal
with once he gets an angle, then if you back up whatever he's got such a quick
trigger, he's hard to guard.  
  
Tonight he just really didn't get in a rhythm. He had a couple of drives that
didn't go down for him, and he had a couple of 3s where he could never get
back-to-back pullups or back-to-back pullup 3s to get into that rhythm. But
he's been fabulous for us.  
  
Q. Seemed like they were having a lot of success screening especially in
the first half. What was going on, was it lack of communication on defense
from you guys?  
COACH PAINTER: A little bit of both. We were guarding it different with Teske.
But it was more penetration. Our weak side and our guys in ball-screen
defense, sometimes when the ball got deep, had to stay home. And you gotta
force them to throw the ball out and they didn't do that.  
  
Our guys sometimes will get really enamored sometimes with guys that can shoot
the basketball, especially on the weak side. You've got to be able to come to
it.  
  
But I thought we struggled to contain the dribble more than anything and that
opened some things up for Teske. Because when they drove then we had the help,
then they made passes. A couple of them were off ball screens but a couple of
them were simply off us not being able to contain the dribble.  
  
Q. You guys are still probably going to be like a top 2, top 3 NCAA
Tournament seed. When you sort of look at what you guys are going to be doing
over the next week, is there one thing maybe you think you need to focus on,
perhaps it's a ball-screen defense, as you just mentioned, or something like
that?  
COACH PAINTER: They're a unique team. Playing Michigan, John has a great
system, even though they have gone away from their system a lot and just kind
of spread things out.  
  
But you're going to play people that are going to run ball screen motion. 90
percent of the country runs ball screen motion.  
  
So for us I think it's more of a concentration thing than anything, not one
actual aspect of the game. We have to do a better job of defending and
concentrating. I thought we rebounded the ball better today. But we don't
force any turnovers in the first half. We just kind of showed we weren't very
active. But no, not one thing.  
  
We've got to play together. We've got to be unselfish and move the basketball.
And like we said earlier we've got to do a better job moving the ball.  
  
Q. What makes John Beilein so successful in the coach in a tournament
setting in your mind?  
COACH PAINTER: I just think that a lot of what they run, I would guess that he
would go back to running more of his stuff against unfamiliar people.  
  
They run so many different things and have so many different calls within his
system that it's a tough prep, especially after they win the first game.  
  
So when they get into that second game -- you always learn something when you
play him. I always say that about when Bill Carmody was at Northwestern, when
Dana Altman at Creighton. Kind of those systems where they have a lot of quick
hitters and a lot of different things you can go to. You always learn
something when you play them, and you fix something. As a coach you think
you've got them figured out, you don't have them figured out.  
  
He's just very unique in that. You can't allow them to do what they want to
do. And if you do, now it's just hitting or missing, especially when they put
skill. His ideal thing is having a 5 that can shoot. That's why Teske's
picking pops, him going into the short roll into elbow, Wagner being able to
make the 3s and drive the ball. He makes them special.  
  
Those guards are good but not everybody has a guy like Wagner that can stick
3s, drive the ball and play with passion.  
  
Q. It's a week away from Selection Sunday. How concerned are you that
you can still (indiscernible) get, play hard and effort out of these guys?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't think it's as much as playing hard. I thought we did a
good job rebounding the ball. I thought it was more concentration. We have to
do a better job on the basketball. We've got to do a better job in ball-screen
defense.  
  
But good teams will expose you. That's what you're going to face. You'll face
good teams but there's only one team leaving this weekend as a winner. So
you've got other teams, obviously some teams are finished. But there's always
opportunities to improve. There's always a silver lining.  
  
So hopefully this can help us concentrate better and play better on the
defensive end and just play -- we've done a good job of playing together as a
group. But sometimes that, when you deal with a lot of people that are
skilled, you deal with a lot of people that are confident, and sometimes they
want it a little bit too much. And we just gotta probe the defense a little
more and be a little more patient.  
  
Q. What do you tell your guys to regroup, put this in the rearview
mirror and really refocus on the next challenge ahead the NCAA Tournament
coming up?  
COACH PAINTER: I'm not a guy that throws the tape away. I'm a guy that when
you have struggles, look in the mirror, face, take those struggles so they
don't happen again.  
  
So we'll talk about it. We'll watch this tape. We'll watch all three of them.
And we'll try to learn from some of our successes and learn from some of our
failures and just kind of stick with it. You've got to know who you are.
You've got to know who you are and you've just got to go back to the drawing
board.  
  
We have enough successes together to be able to reflect on those also. I think
it's kind of a two-way street sometimes when you lose.  
  
Q. You had three or four games in 12-day stretches this year. Now you're
going to go 12 days without a game. What's your plan for that 12 days?  
COACH PAINTER: We'll take a couple of days off. We'll practice for a couple of
days and take a day off. Practice for a couple of days, take a day off. It's
not something where we need to practice every single day but we don't need to
go four days off in a row. I think that's obviously too much. But we'll
definitely take off Monday and Tuesday and get back after it on Wednesday.  
  
But we're also going to be smart. I think it's more at this point in the year
more mental training and guys gotta be able to understand and learn from some
of those mistakes that we made today and be better because of it.  
  
You go full bore and you get physical and you practice two hours a day while
you're done and one of your better players gets hurt. That doesn't make a
whole lot of sense to me.  
  
Q. Is this the best defensive team that Michigan has had since John
Beilein got there? Having watched them on film and faced them today, what in
your eyes has made them so successful on that end in this season?  
COACH PAINTER: I just think it's attention to detail. I think Matthews,
Simpson, Abdur-Rahkman are all three good defensive players. Duncan Robinson
has a lot of experience. Duncan Robinson was a poor defensive player when he
got there, but he's really, really worked hard and he's a much better defender
out there.  
  
He used to be out there and be a liability but now he's not. That's being a
well-rounded player, because he can shoot the basketball, he's a good
offensive player and now he's a good defensive player. And you've got to give
somebody like that credit to them.  
  
So I think it's their personnel. Jordan Poole gives them length and some
athleticism when he comes in there. Livers, who got hurt tonight, has done a
good job as a young guy guarding.  
  
I think it's personnel and attention to detail. Anytime you put talent on the
court and you give it time and you work on something, whether it's offense or
defense, and those guys stick together, you're going to make some
improvements.  
  
Q. Vince had an extended spell there on the bench toward the end. Did he
tweak the injury or was it a matchup thing?  
COACH PAINTER: No it wasn't matchup. We wanted guys to go out there and have
energy. I thought Nojel Eastern, I looked at how he played and I thought he
brought us energy. And I thought Eifert could bring us some energy, and I had
to keep enough scorers out there. I wanted Isaac on the court.  
  
At that point in the game, when you get down like that you're searching as a
coach, you want guys to be able to bring energy, and I was just trying to get
Nojel and Grady out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 75, Purdue - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan head coach John Beilein, Zavier
Simpson and Jon Teske and MVP Moe Wagner.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: I'm shivering up here. I think I was doused with a couple
gallons of the Hudson River. It was cold. As I told the Big Ten Network, you
can't win these championships if they're not dedicated all year long.  
  
It takes a long time to sort of build up the substance to your team that can
persevere and just won't give in. They won't give in to fatigue. They won't
give in to momentum changes. They just stick in there.  
  
This is one of the best teams I've ever coached at just taking on the --
moving on to the next play and keep moving forward and doing things just the
old-fashioned way with a lot of hard work.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You beat two of the top teams in the nation back to back here at
Madison Square Garden. You have a lot of confidence and you have a week off
compared to other teams. Do you feel that it's an advantage going into the
tournament?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I would just say I don't think we really think about that too
much. I think we are just going to focus on -- first of all, we're going to
enjoy this a couple days and to get some rest. Then we're going to focus on
what's next. Whether that's an advantage or disadvantage, doesn't really
matter.  
  
Q. Jon, that dunk that you had, can you talk a little bit about what
that feeling is like to hear your name hitting the rafters of Madison Square
Garden on that moment? And I guess bigger picture as well, what was it today
in that first half that allowed you to hit some of those big shots?  
JON TESKE: I really have no words to explain. The play just happened in that
instance and it was a great pass and just finish it. But then in the first
half we were in foul trouble a little bit and I was able to knock down a
couple shots and just trying to help my team win.  
  
Q. Along the same lines for Moe, how did you feel when you hit that
turnaround 3? The Garden also rocked for that one, too. I'm not sure that's
exactly in the playbook but you can tell me otherwise.  
MORITZ WAGNER: To be honest with you I didn't know how much time was on the
clock. I just saw Duncan running for the hand-off. It must have been a little
time on the clock so I took my (indiscernible) and shot it and it went in. And
obviously it's a good feeling when the ball goes in and the Garden cheers for
you. Yeah, it's pretty cool.  
  
Q. How does it feel to win in the mecca or in the Madison Square
Garden?  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I mean, it feels great. It feels great just being able to do
it with my teammates. We worked hard for this. It's something we've been
plotting on for a while since July.  
  
I'm just glad that what we worked so hard for, for it to be earned. It means a
lot. I'm appreciative of the coaches, and hopefully we can just continue to
keep winning and keep doing good things like this.  
  
JON TESKE: It feels amazing. We had great support from our fans who traveled
from far distances and great fans out here, out east. And we just wanted to
come out here and they always show support for us, so we wanted to put on a
great show for them.  
  
Q. Moe, watching Jon in that first half and hearing his name, the crowd
chanting that name, it's got to be a special feeling working with a guy for a
full season and seeing that to fruition. What did you see from him today?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I was so happy when he popped off after that dunk. I got so
excited. He got emotional. Yeah, I know how good he is. I play against him
every day. That was long overdue. And incredible to be part of such a great
group, to play with such great people. Yeah, very grateful for that.  
  
Q. Moe, can you talk about how this week will help you guys as you get
ready for the NCAAs?  
MORITZ WAGNER: Yeah, obviously playing four games in four days, you kind of
establish a certain rhythm for how you prepare for games, with how you
approach certain things. So that's going to be helpful going into the NCAA
weekend. So, yeah, that's helpful.  
  
And just also the thought that we all committed together for the end goal and
not looking ahead too far, and just trying to keep growing every day.  
  
Q. Moe, last year was such a unique run, what you guys did. Now four
wins in four days again. Can you tell me whether there were any differences or
similarities to what you did this year as to how it felt doing it last year?  
MORITZ WAGNER: That's tough to reflect that short after it happened, to be
honest with you. Obviously the personnel is different. Last year it was a
little different with the whole plane accident thing obviously, but winning is
so much fun. You can't compare it. It's very special.  
  
Q. Zavier, it was another really stellar defensive effort by you and
especially the guys on the perimeter. What was sort of the game plan? It
seemed like you and the rest of the team were really focused on taking away
their 3s?  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: We knew Purdue has a lot of great talent. Good guard play. And
Muhammad and I just wanted to come out and set the tone. We wanted to play
great defense from the start so our energy could be contagious. And as you've
seen, others followed. And we were just glad to be able to just take away the
big 3, play good defense on Haas and secure the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I know you talked about making adjustments to bring the best of the
players forward. What ways have you adjusted in the past month or so to let
some of their personalities emerge and let their confidence build?  
COACH BEILEIN: It was really hard, because we had just -- we had extremely
talented players last year that had really been through the process before.
And so we let them lead.  
  
Now, we had all new leadership. The role players had to step up. And I think
it wasn't until we got almost til February that our coaching staff just
figured out a little bit what we could do and what we could expect.  
  
So it was some guys had (indiscernible) some latitude. Some other guys, okay,
they're not going to do that this year. You get to a point in February where
you only practice -- you're playing games like crazy. You only practicing four
times a week.  
  
Is he really going to get better in the next 16 practices on that? Or let's
find something that works better for him. So we tried to make adjustments that
way.  
  
But that whole time it's skill development every day in our practice. We do
worry about the next game. We really do a great job scouting, I think, and
preparing, but we're still doing -- when Z is making those hook shots, you
don't know how much he works on those, because with him that's the only way
he's going to score over a big guy. So he works on it. And it's really paid
off, all the stuff they do on their own or with coaches in practice.  
  
Q. What's the difference in feeling now that you don't have to go
straight into the Selection Show tonight? I heard you reference it with Jim
Nantz. Seemed like you might preferring to play Thursday, Friday and instead
of having this big gap.  
COACH BEILEIN: In a perfect world that would be great. But as I said to the
crowd, to play in this arena in front of that crowd, which was, I feel, was
very pro Michigan, that's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us. So it will
be worth the wait.  
  
I'll remind everybody, there's been some great NCAA Tournament teams that win
their tournament like this Sunday or this Monday: Gonzaga; Wichita State;
Butler. These teams all have been great NCAA Tournament teams, and I've had
both Richmond and Canisius had the same wait.  
  
You work around it. We'll give our guys some rest but we'll be practicing,
we'll still be doing those hook shots with Zavier.  
  
Q. With Teske, did you see that coming with him?  
COACH BEILEIN: No, absolutely not. What he is is -- he's got so much -- he'll
drift around. We talk about the boiling point of 212. He probably was at 205
last year. He gets 211, hits 212 for a day and then comes back to 211.  
  
That's -- he and Austin Davis, they need some of Moe's energy and they can do
it. But it's not expected -- it's expected of them, but it's not something
that you just click on and all of a sudden I'm 19 years old and now I'm going
to start playing with a motor.  
  
But to get him to dunk in practice is difficult to do. But he's worked with
Jon Sanderson. We have the greatest strength coach anywhere. And where a
vertical jump went from here to here, he's able to do. He's worked. He's a no-
nonsense kid. As we continue to improve his skill set and his body, he's got a
great future.  
  
Q. (Question off mic.)  
JOHN BEILEIN: You have to ask him. Ask him. But here's what you know. If you
looked at our bench, he's so loved by his teammates. "Big Sleep" they call
him. "Big Bad Jon" they call him. He's so quiet. And so there's nothing quiet
about his performance today.  
  
And he will gradually just grow through this. If you watch young men over the
college experience, both the process, the maturity, just changes. And he
certainly is changing.  
  
He didn't walk in like Moe Wagner with this personality that just says I'm an
alpha dog and I'm going out to get it.  
  
No, he's more waiting and waiting for the process to work itself out.  
  
Q. You talked about Zavier's hook shot. Moe won the MVP. He seemed to be
the catalyst, Zavier, on both ends of the floor. What does he do to set the
tone defensively and offensively?  
COACH BEILEIN: He's a pit bull. We have a picture of a big, mean pit bull in
our locker room for every game. And he is that guy. He's one that loves to
play defense.  
  
We've had some really good point guards, really good point guards over time.
All those point guards right there were tremendous offensive players, and they
were really good defenders also.  
  
They probably hung their hats on both ends. This guy hangs his hat on defense.
And that's a really great thing to have. He's stubborn. He wants to play every
minute.  
  
He doesn't want to rest. He and I have -- he's just wore me out so much with
how hard he plays, that he's got a trust for me that he didn't have earlier in
the year. I mentioned before, he used to go in there, playing hard, and was
not smart. He fouled people like crazy. Now all of a sudden they're at the
foul line. Now he's really playing smart, defensive basketball.  
  
Q. How much do guys like Zavier and others earning that trust from you
change the trajectory of this team? Seemed like you guys were hitting on all
cylinders at the right time.  
COACH BEILEIN: They didn't give in. They didn't sulk. We ended up taking
Zavier out of the starting lineup early in the year because he wasn't making
the extra pass. He wasn't seeing the open man. He was fouling every time he
got in there.  
  
So he had to earn his way back. When he earned his way back and we started
winning, and I could see that he was really trying hard to do the right thing,
what the coaching staff wanted -- you just earn that trust every day.  
  
Same thing with all our guys -- Jordan Poole, he had games in the beginning of
the year he didn't play at all, didn't play because he didn't have that trust.  
  
It's not about going to a game, show me I can trust you. No, show me every day
in practice you're going to make the right play and you play. It's that
simple.  
  
Every kid has two hours every day to show us what he can do. You don't get
time in practice -- in games to show me what you can do. Do it in practice,
you'll get time in games. And he did it both on the court in practice and in
the games he was appearing in.  
  
Q. So you win the Big Ten Tournament and you're riding on a nine-game
winning streak, nine in a row, and three in the tournament. How are you going
to prepare the guys to win six or seven more games?  
COACH BEILEIN: Oh, man, do we have to go there right now? I'll tell you what,
every day that I'm contemplating -- and I probably overthink everything, I
have to take myself back to just seize today. It's about today. We'll take
tomorrow like tomorrow and the next day. There won't be any thoughts about,
all right, what's up next?  
  
The NCAA I'm sure will put us in a good bracket and we will do everything we
can to win one practice at a time, leading up to that one game at a time.  
  
And if we're still around in San Antonio, we'd be delighted. But there's a lot
of good teams that's going to go into this thing just like this. And anything
can happen once we get to the first round of the tournament.  
  
Thanks everybody. You've been terrific.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2018

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Dakota Mathias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30764)

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Purdue - 78, Penn State - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement, Coach.  
  
COACH PAINTER: I thought kind of the key to the game was the end of the first
half and start of the second half. Thought we gained some momentum at the end
of the first half. The basket by Carsen to give us that lead, but kind of that
transaction right in there with a couple of stops.  
  
They gained momentum after we had a lead for most of the first half. And I
thought how we came out in the start of the second half, that first five or
six minutes kind of set the tone.  
  
And we had to do a much better job rebounding the basketball. Even though we
didn't do a great job we did a much better job in the second half. I thought
we tried our best to stay out of rotations. They're very tough in their
isolations and they're hard to guard. And I thought our guys did a much better
job there.  
  
And when we could get some stops, we got into a good rhythm on the offensive
end. Carsen got into a good rhythm. Dakota got into a good rhythm and really
had some balance. And obviously Isaac had a good game for us also.  
  
But just a good team win. Thought our energy really picked up there at the end
of the first half and start of the second half. We didn't have much energy, I
felt, in the first half.  
  
And it's so important in these tournaments, when you play back-to-back games,
just to keep that fight and keep going. I thought our guys really picked that
up.  
  
And obviously when you're getting stops and you're making 3s, you're going to
put a string together and be able to build that lead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tomorrow's Michigan for the third time. It's been said that it's hard
to beat a team three times in a year. What do you guys have to do well to
execute that?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Definitely going to be defense for us. They run a good system
with a lot of counters, a lot of options. Moe Wagner is one of the best
players in our league. They just have just a lot of different options.  
  
Just staying tight on some of their action, being disciplined on defense is
going to be huge for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to win the Big Ten Championship game
particularly here at Madison Square Garden?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I mean, it's a good opportunity. I mean, this was a goal of
ours to be able to have this opportunity to win it, and (indiscernible) in the
regular season. So to have this opportunity here just for us as a team and as
for the seniors as well is a good opportunity and in an environment like this.
So hopefully we can take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Dakota, just what's Carsen mean right now as far as a consistent big
score provider for you guys on a nightly basis?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: You said it. It's a consistency. He's being very efficient,
too. He's making the right reads, the right passes. And he's attracting so
many defenders. That's the good thing about him; he's unselfish and he finds
the open guy when the time comes. So just another dynamic for us and he's a
great playmaker.  
  
Q. How much of the game tomorrow for you guys is their bench considering
you guys were the 1 seed last year when Michigan knocked you off in the
quarterfinals?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Did you say revenge? I mean, I personally don't look at it
like that. Just the opportunity to play the game. You want to win every game.
It's not like -- it's just going out to play, honestly and just try to come
out with a win. Looking forward to this opportunity and it should be a good
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Was it nice to see guys like that calm down your bigs so they
wouldn't get more technicals?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah. We want our bigs to play hard. And I don't think Matt
Haarms deserved to get a technical. The ref couldn't tell me what he said.
You're allowed to have emotion on the basketball court. You're allowed to say
positive things.  
  
If they said something negative, they should be able to repeat what they said.
So I don't really think he deserved to get it. When you had the WWE body slam,
both of those guys -- I just told them, you know, Ed Hightower used to blow
the whistle come out and not call a foul on anybody.  
  
How can you call a foul on either one of them? They're hooked up. They don't
see who hooks up first. If they do then they need to call it on the one person
who does.  
  
But if they can't, why call that right there because it's 600 pounds hitting
the ground at the same time. And neither one of them want that, you know what
I mean? I didn't quite understand how Matt Haarms got a technical and then how
Isaac got one and Satchel got one also. I don't think there should have been
an technicals in terms of that. But it's part of it.  
  
We've got some guards that are pretty level-headed. And I think our bench is
pretty good, too. Nojel Eastern played really well tonight. And Ryan Cline hit
a couple of huge 3s for us. So we're just excited about moving on and playing.  
  
Q. Tony Carr, 4-of-18 shooting today. How important was that and how
does Nojel's length help you in that matchup?  
COACH PAINTER: We really wanted P.J. to start off the game and get into him
and just make him work. Third game in three days. We know he has the ball in
his hands a lot and how important he is.  
  
And he's a tough shot-maker. Most people that make tough shots don't make them
the next game. He's a guy that can make tough shots consistently. When you're
shooting a lot from 20 to 25 feet, when people are hounding you, sometimes you
have nights like he did.  
  
But he's a great player. He's one of the best guards in our league. But I
thought P.J. did a great job on him. I thought Nojel really fought him, really
made it hard for him and fought him and tried to use his length when he shot
the runners and the floaters and the pull-up 3s.  
  
Q. How do you think playing together in World University Games all the
way to today, how has the team improved? And how do you think that will help
you going forward once we get to March?  
COACH PAINTER: We've been together a lot. Obviously we start four seniors. But
the more basketball you can play together just raises your value overall. And
so I think the trust of getting in the games -- we've had to win games
differently the whole season. And we've had to grind games out.  
  
We've been able to shoot the ball well in some games and other games we've
been able to win when we didn't shoot as well. But we had that three-game skid
in conference play where the ball didn't go in for us much and we had to do a
better job in other areas and we just didn't.  
  
But I think that anytime you can have that kind of an experience -- the one
thing that's misleading about traditional international trips are the
competition's not very good.  
  
But it's great. You go to Italy. You go to Spain. It's a great learning
experience for your kids to be able to see everything and see a different
culture.  
  
But early August is a lot of a times where we make those trips. This trip is
different. The World University Games is different. The competition is really
good. About every other team is equal to you. You do have some teams that get
in there, especially in pool play, that are just okay. But we played in a good
pool. We obviously got there and so we played high-level competition.  
  
And I think anytime you can play high-level competition, represent your
country, it's going to help your kids.  
  
Q. Speaking of winning in different ways you had a grind-out game up in
Ann Arbor to beat Michigan, and then you had that kind of video game at Mackey
Arena to beat them. What do you take out of those games as far as what you're
going to have to do well?  
COACH PAINTER: We have to rebound the ball better. We have to execute. From
just how we've played here, I think we can do a much better job in our
execution. But no matter who we're playing we have to rebound the basketball
better and I think that's going to be imperative tomorrow.  
  
I think their team's consistently getting better on the defensive end and
really played hard defensively so we know it's going to be tough to go against
them. But that was one of those games, we've had a couple games where we were
fortunate because we struggled to stop Michigan at our place, but we were able
to outscore them. And then we get a break and then it came at their place.
They go to the monitor and we get the ball back. And we're able to go to the
free-throw line after we got fouled.  
  
So we definitely got a break, kind of like they got a break in the Big Ten
Tournament when we missed the front end of a one-on-one layup late in the game
to send it into overtime. That's part of it. If you don't like having
something go against you or something like that happen, try your best not to
be in those situations. But if you get in those situations a lot of times it's
about 50/50.  
  
Q. I know you have the Big Ten final tomorrow, but in your opinion does
Penn State deserve to be a NCAA Tournament team?  
COACH PAINTER: Without question. The NCAA Tournament, I think you've got to
earn your way in there. I think obviously their three wins against Ohio State.
Ohio State is really good. Ohio State is a really good basketball team. To be
able to beat them three times I think really shows just how good they are.  
  
We were able to push the game out a little bit today. But our game at Mackey
Arena could have went either way. They're shooting two free throws with 10
seconds to go to tie the game up. They miss one of them, so we win. You know
what I mean? If they're looking from the lit test, there's no doubt they're a
NCAA Tournament team.  
  
Q. There's been a trend the last couple of games and it's not been
isolated. It happened throughout the season here and there. But you go on
these runs with 3-point shooting in the second halves. Is there anything to
that? Is it them taking time to settle in or their decision-making maybe being
better in the second half or the way it's shaping out?  
COACH PAINTER: Probably a little bit of everything that you just said.
Obviously if you can kind of get that figured out, you try to make that for 40
minutes. But settling into the games is a good way to put it. I thought Carsen
did a better job today than he did yesterday against Rutgers.  
  
He struggled in the first half and had a great second half. I thought he was
solid in the first half today. I thought he settled into the game a little
easier. And then he was obviously great in the second half.  
  
So in terms of our whole team, we're very confident and sometimes being
overconfident, you take shots a little bit quicker, you take a quick contested
one. And we've got to be patient, gotta have better movement when things don't
go our way or when we don't get into something in one of our sets.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2018

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Miles Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32885)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 75, Michigan State - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: Well, I thought we got off to a poor start, and give them credit.
Yet, the guys that hits the 3s were not the guys that normally you thought
would make 3s.  
  
I thought Matthews hit two of them and Simpson hits one, they had nine points.
And, you know, not the players' fault as much as it is what we were going to
do in the scouting report.  
  
So they did the job; we just didn't do a good enough job on the scouting
report. And then we bounced back and actually played pretty good the rest of
the half. The second half we couldn't make any shots, and I think it affected
our defense. We missed a lot of good shots. And we had it down, I think it was
four or five, and Rahkman crotched in that 35-footer. That was tough. And then
I think we had it to five or six and Nick missed that layup.  
  
Not enough things were going our way. And give them credit. They played well.
They didn't shoot it much better than us the first half. They shoot 66 percent
in the second half. And they only shoot 44 for the game.  
  
You know, we weren't great, but we weren't bad defensively. Our number one
concern was the turnovers. And we had 13 of 5 on second chance points and 7 to
4 on points off turnovers. The first game it was 26-7.  
  
So we did some of the things we needed to do. We just did not do a good enough
job making shots and they won fair and square and deserved to win.  
  
Q. Obviously disappointing to lose, but this isn't defining your season.
The next tournament is. So how do you take this and just get ready and move on
quickly to the tournament-type mindset?  
MILES BRIDGES: We're just going to try to move on, get back in practice and
continue to get better.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, you know, it was a big game. But it's not the end of
our season. There's still another big goal that we're very capable of
achieving. So we just gotta use this to fuel our fire. I think everybody
didn't play their best game today. And we just gotta get back (indiscernible)
to the shop and become that team we can become.  
  
Q. When you guys played Ohio State earlier in the year and had that
loss, it kind of dinged your confidence for a while. How different are you
guys now and confident that losing to these guys a second time won't mess with
you going forward? And how different are you as a team mentally?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: We won, I don't know, 13, 12, 13 straight. So we got that
ability as a team to make runs and put wins together. So this was -- like I
said, it was a big game for us but they came out on top with the victory. But
that's not going to alter our end goal and what we think we're capable of as a
team.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: We know what we're capable of. We're not going to let one loss
determine how we play for the rest of the season, because we know we have
bigger goals ahead.  
  
Q. Miles, what turned the game around early in the second half? You did
have a halftime lead.  
MILES BRIDGES: For the bad or for the good? We just came out really stagnant,
let them get going at the 3-point line, you know, they like to hit three
pointers, and we allowed penetration.  
  
Q. It's every basketball player's dream to play at the Garden. LeBron
calls its his playground and Kevin Durant says the energy of the fans just
playing at the Garden is second to none. What are your thoughts and what did
you love about playing here at the Garden?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It was an amazing experience, just being in such a legendary
place and playing in front of all those fans, a lot of Spartan Nation out
there that came and supported us. It was great playing out there.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: Like Cassius said, it was definitely great. We're blessed to be
here. There's a lot of history here. Like I say, we're just blessed to be
here.  
  
Q. What's the mood in the locker room after going 0-for-2 against the
arch rivals from down the road?  
MILES BRIDGES: Our mood is we're really mad. But like I said, we're not going
to let this affect us in the future.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: I would say disappointed. I think there's a lot of things
that were in our control that we didn't do to win these type of games, and we
dropped the ball twice. They played pretty well. They had a really good team.
So kudos to them, but there's a lot of things we could have done to be better
in these games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of teams that didn't win the Big Ten Tournament and
went on and had great success in the NCAA. How different is it with this group
of guys that listen to you so intently getting them to flip the switch for
that next tournament?  
COACH IZZO: I'll be honest, I was really disappointed in how we started out
and kind of like my old buddy Brian Gregory says, what starts bad sometimes
ends bad. And it wasn't the start that -- Matthews hits two 3s and Simpson
hits a 3. That's nine points that they normally don't get.  
  
But it was the things that we had in the scouting report on how they drove us,
which way they drove us, that we didn't seem to pick up as well as I thought
we would.  
  
And because of that -- and still it was a game and us not playing our best. I
don't know what John felt about his team playing their best, but both of us
didn't play real well the first half. They just had a better start. We had a
better finish.  
  
In the second half, I thought it changed when Wagner hit that 3 in the corner.
We acted surprise that he was going to shoot it. I think it put them up two or
three. And then something else happened and then, of course, the missed layup
and I guess the good shot from long range. And then we were playing catch-up.  
  
Q. Michigan this season is rating higher defensively than it ever has
under Beilein. And from your perspective, from the eyes of a coach, in both
scouting and execution, can you speak to what you see as true differences with
this team this season versus all the other years you've prepped to play
Beilein's teams?  
COACH IZZO: I think they're a little tougher, personally. I think Matthews is
a great athlete that prides himself on guarding. And Simpson 100 percent
prides himself on his defense. So you've got two pretty good defenders in
places where -- that I think is important.  
  
I think the young freshman, Livers, I thought does a pretty good job
defending. I think they've got a couple of players that are better defensive
players. And maybe, I don't know, him, their staff still figured out at the
end of the day you do gotta check people well to win.  
  
And as evident by our second half. I mean, they shoot 66 percent. I thought we
did. I bet you the last 16 minutes of the first half we probably held them in
the 20s. And we kind of disappeared from that in the second half.  
  
So I think his team is a better defensive team. Some of it is players and I
don't know if some of it is coaching staff and what they did. But I think they
are better defensively.  
  
Q. You got an 11- or 12-day layoff coming up. Have you ever been through
something like that before as a coach? And any ideas on how to keep your guys
sharp?  
COACH IZZO: No, I haven't ever been through that. I think it's 11 or 12 days
either way, I guess, or maybe more. What is it, Saturday? We played on Friday.
That could be 13 days, huh?  
  
I don't know what I'm going to do. And the best part is we're on spring break
next week. So we might just go to the beach, East Lansing, and see if we can
play a little beach basketball and -- we're going to do something. We talked
about doing something in Chicago and going over and seeing Zel play. We might
go down and see the Pistons or do something as a team.  
  
The one thing that I would remind everybody, this team has won 12 games in a
row and won 29 games this season. And through some trying times, and I think
that I'm going to appreciate a lot. Now, do we have to get it back on track?
Yeah, we do. Cash struggled out here. He's been playing so good but he
struggled out here.  
  
And we just had some guys that didn't do the things they needed to do. But
they've done the things they've needed to do over a long period of time. And
I'm going to keep that in mind, not panic over a loss when it's your rival.
It's always a bigger win when it's playing for a chance to play in the
championship game. Of course it's a bigger one.  
  
But I've got a lot of pride in these guys and what they've done and how
they've worked through some circumstances that had nothing to do with them.
And I'm really pleased with that and proud of them, to be honest with you. So
we'll get better. We'll probably practice a lot during that time.  
  
I mean, it will be one time in my life the NCAA has no rules on us. It's --
we're on break and we don't have any games. That doesn't happen very often. In
fact, it's never happened to me. So knowing me, I'm going to take advantage of
that.  
  
Q. Michigan State-Michigan is one of the great in-state rivalries in
college basketball. What do you love about the rivalry and how that we were
able to see that rivalry in the biggest stage of sports?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you asked the question to our players about Madison Square
Garden and I think everybody knows from a coaching standpoint this was a tough
year the way everything was condensed.  
  
But as I said, once you got to Madison Square Garden, the thrill of playing in
an arena like this was special. And in all honesty the way that place was
alive I thought both teams brought tremendous crowds here, a lot of alums. And
I didn't think they got a great game, but they got a pretty good game that was
played hard and competitive.  
  
So I guess for me I appreciate being in Madison Square Garden and for only the
second time in this rivalry did we get to play each other in the Big Ten
Tournament. We did not play good enough to win; they did. Credit goes to them.  
  
But the memory and the -- of playing here I think will be important to our
guys as they go through life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2018

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Shep Garner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28486)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Purdue - 78, Penn State - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll start with an opening statement.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: Wow. It's very emotional for me to be sitting next to Shep and
the way he played tonight. He really carried our team. So proud of this group.
I'm really proud of this group for what we've done, what we've accomplished.
So many positives. To be able to put us, on the evening of Saturday being in
the so-called final four the Big Ten, it's a huge step for our program. And
obviously he has a lot to do with that.  
  
Give Purdue credit. That's a great team. They have so many weapons. And
obviously Carsen Edwards took over in the second half there. Our guys had an
amazing year. I reminded them of that. And I reminded them we have a lot of
basketball still to play. And we look forward to that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Shep.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about setting the record, 33 points, No. 33. That
number seems to be popping up a lot in your career. Can you just talk about
not wanting to stop playing tonight?  
SHEP GARNER: I knew I didn't want this to be my last game tonight. And I told
my teammates, you know, I'll give it everything I've got to get this win. I
gave it everything I had out there. I left it all out there on the court. And
I was filled with emotion because I didn't want to lose. I didn't want to
lose, our whole team felt the same way. It was just a tough night for us.  
  
Q. How difficult was it playing these three games in less than 48
hours?  
SHEP GARNER: It was tough. We put a lot of work in though the summer to
prepare for this. We knew we would be here playing on the weekend in the
tournament. So we always preached that in the summer, back to backs, we need
to be ready for back to backs early in the regular season. So we were
preparing for this all year.  
  
Q. When things were kind of going the wrong way in the second half and
you guys were showing your fatigue, what were you telling the guys in the
huddle during the stop, with your experience, to try to get them going
again?  
SHEP GARNER: Take it one play at a time, one stop at a team. We're built on
defending and rebounding. So we wanted to stop them, stop them one play at a
time. We didn't want to try to get it all back in one possession.  
  
And I guess late we started to do that a little bit and early in the second
half. So just came up short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What did they do so well to slow down Tony?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I think they were very physical. Obviously that's why I felt
like I needed to get T'ed up, my first T in a long, long time. But they were
playing him very tough and very physical. And I was hoping that would help him
out a little bit, and it did. It did early in the second half.  
  
But they shot really well. I think they made seven 3s in the second half. We
scored the ball; it wasn't like we scored the ball. But we couldn't get stops.
We needed to get stops. And Carsen Edwards played so well. And Vince being out
there, you try to take that away then they go to Haas. That's a very, very
good basketball team.  
  
Q. What happened that last three and a half minutes or so that turned
that seven-point lead into a two-point deficit there at the end of the first
half?  
COACH CHAMBERS: We weren't making shots. We started missing shots. We took a
couple of tough shots. And they made some shots. Carsen Edwards, again, went
on a little mini run on his own to end the half. And we know how explosive he
is. He hit a deep 3 to end the half.  
  
But you can watch film all you want. Now you've got to go out and get it done.
And give him a lot of credit, and give Matt a lot of credit.  
  
Q. How difficult is the next eight days going to be just sort of
thinking about whether you guys are going to be in or out of the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Well, I'm an optimist. You can ask Sandy Barbour and Lynn and
Phil about that. I'm an optimist, very positive. You can ask all the Big Ten
coaches that we played over the last month. Nobody's going to want to see us
in the NCAA Tournament. We have NCAA Tournament talent.  
  
And I think the administration's going to see that. The teams that we've come
up a little short with has been Purdue twice. We've played some really, really
good teams. And on the road. So I believe we're going to be in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2018

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

### [Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30705)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 75, Michigan State - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Beilein to make an opening statement and then
go to questions for the students.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Great game, incredible atmosphere here at Madison Square Garden
that -- played in the Big East championship game before. It has every element
that you could ever want and even more because the Michigan-Michigan State
being here. But basically many of our teams would have commanded that same
audience.  
  
So great idea. I don't think anybody liked the timing being a little bit
earlier, but I think in the long run anybody who attended that game today knew
it was well worth it for us to make this trip.  
  
So much respect for Michigan State. We beat a really, really good basketball
team, a team that deserves where they are, top 1 to 10 ranking. They can win
the national championship. Everybody needs breaks to do that. But they're a
fantastic team and we're very appreciative that we were able to get a win
today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Moe, after a slow start, how did you approach your game on the
offensive end in the second half?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I think my teammates and our coaching staff -- to be honest
with you, I didn't really care, you just keep playing. When you're confident
as a team you just let the game come to you and that's just how it goes.  
  
Q. How tough was it winning three games in less than 48 hours here?  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: When you're playing against good teams it's always
going to be tough. But everybody has the same fatigue level at this point. And
it's not really a factor. We just keep playing.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, obviously a challenge. Everybody is going through it,
though. And you're playing in front of a crowd like that, you don't even feel
fatigue. It's just instinct to, it's easy to get up for.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: Yeah, obviously three games in -- four games in four days is a
challenge. But fatigue shouldn't be an excuse or a reason for anything.  
  
Q. I think there were more Michigan fans here at the Garden than Spartan
fans. Do you think that the crowd -- were you able to feed off the energy of
the crowd, which probably was a motivating factor in winning the game today?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, the crowd was huge. We know there's a really good
contingency of Michigan fans here in New York. So that's one of the reasons
why we were so excited to come play here. That was a huge difference in the
play. We really felt their support. And it was a difference maker.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: Obviously it's a lot fun to celebrate a win like that with the
fans and makes it all worth it.  
  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: I agree with both of them, a lot of energy in the
building. Felt like a home game and we definitely fed off the energy.  
  
Q. Muhammad, you had one of the game's biggest shots, a shot clock-
beating 3 with 2:50 to go to by up eight. Can you take us through what
happened on that play?  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: I think the play broke down a little bit and I was
dribbling at the top of the key and saw the shot clock was running down. And I
knew I had to take a shot.  
  
It felt good. I felt like it should have switched, but hit the back of the rim
and it went in. So I'm glad.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Would you say overall with having to go through the condensed
schedule this year that it was worth it to have this experience playing in New
York City?  
COACH BEILEIN: Absolutely. I just think if you're in, anybody that was here
today said, you know, that was well worth it. And I know that the University
of Michigan, when we heard about it, because of our tremendous alums in this
area, the support and people, I think, in this area have a great appreciation
even if they didn't go to Michigan for what an incredible university we have
and basketball program we have.  
  
For us it was like a no-brainer, even though we knew that it was going to be a
bit more difficult schedule. We've got one more game to play and we've got a
little time to rest before whatever is next.  
  
Q. You guys have struggled from the line a little bit this season.  
COACH BEILEIN: More than a little.  
  
Q. More than a little. But how does your success at the line yesterday
and your success today show how your team's developed over the course of the
season?  
COACH BEILEIN: It's a lot of hard work. As you know -- especially Zavier and
Charles, how hard they work on their own and after practice, to be in that, so
they're in that situation. And I think there were 6-for-8 and 4-for-6. They're
not perfect yet. But they really work at it.  
  
But there's nothing -- it was a sweet sight to see Zavier's shots just go
right through the middle. Of his foul shots the last couple of days, maybe
8-for-10 or 10-for-12, shooting it right down the middle.  
  
Q. What turned the game around early in the second half in your favor?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, the first half I think that we had some really good
looks and we didn't make them. And in the second half, I think they got really
good looks and they didn't make them.  
  
And that's what it is sometimes. Just the ball's going to bounce your way or
not because both teams played really good defense. Tough to score on Michigan
State. And they did a really good job. All of a sudden a few went in for us
and Moe got going a little bit.  
  
I told him, this is my great motivation at halftime, hey, Moe, are you going
to make a shot? Because right now you're stinking the place up. Just make one
shot. We played with each other like that. He just smiled: Yes, Coach, I can
do that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

### [Geo Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34756)

### [Corey Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32917)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Purdue - 82, Rutgers - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: I hate this day to put the uniform up. I love basketball. But I
want to thank everyone for coming out today. Rutgers was great.  
  
I love our players, our seniors. I told them that. They brought a lot of
respect to this uniform. And we played a heck of a team.  
  
As you know, I mean, that team is experienced and talented. I was proud of our
guys, how they fought for three days. And just disappointed we couldn't get a
few more days here at Madison Square Garden.  
  
Q. Geo, Corey, what do you think the world learned about Rutgers
basketball today and the past three days?  
COREY SANDERS: Just a program that don't give up, that you can't count out,
even though we were put last. That's not how we're going to finish. That's not
how we want to be remembered.  
  
Just a program that's on the rise. Just don't sleep on us. We've got a great
head coach here and we've got great players that's ready to learn and compete.  
  
GEO BAKER: Just that we're a really tough team and we never gave up.  
  
Q. Physically, how worn down were you tonight, this being the third game
in a row?  
GEO BAKER: I don't really think that we felt really worn down. I think we had
a lot of adrenaline coming in. We were really hyped up for the game. And we
just came up short.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) about covering Purdue defensively?  
COREY SANDERS: They got a lot of shooters. Everybody on their team can shoot
the ball with the exception to, like, their posts. But great shooters. Some
hard matchups for us out there. Haas is a monster. Coach compares him to the
Empire State Building.  
  
I mean, just tough coverage out there. But I think we did a great job. Had the
game we wanted to. A couple more plays, the game could have went another way.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to put things in perspective after a loss like this,
but just with the ups and downs you guys had this season, what did it feel
like in the moment, this type of environment at the Garden and with all the
Rutgers fans here and how you went toe to toe with one of the best teams in
the country?  
COREY SANDERS: Felt great. Especially to come out here for our seniors, the
guys that don't get to play again at this program. Had their families come out
and had great support. The last couple of games went on a little run, made
some history. So it was pretty good for us. Nobody expected us to win one
game. To win two and push Purdue to the max, that's a great accomplishment.  
  
Q. Geo, obviously a tough loss, but you played well. You and Corey,
efficient in tonight's scoring. How does this feel for you playing on the big
stage, Madison Square Garden, Big Ten Tournament and your confidence going
into next summer and the next season?  
GEO BAKER: It feels really good. I've got great teammates and a great coach,
always telling me to stay confident and ready. I was really just playing for
the seniors, to be honest with you. I really didn't want to go home because I
know when we go home it's their last game ever in this program. But in terms
for me, it felt really good going forward.  
  
Q. Geo, coming off some of the high screens and pick-and-rolls, were you
surprised how many times they left you wide open and you were draining those
3s?  
GEO BAKER: Maybe a little bit but that was definitely our game plan coming in.
You know that Haas is a big dude and he's kind of slow. That was definitely
our game plan coming off those high screens and pulling up.  
  
Q. Corey, just your impressions of the impact P.J. Thompson had on this
game? He hit a couple big shots for them. And maybe defensively what he was
doing against you?  
COREY SANDERS: Yeah, I definitely -- it was two big 3s he hit that I helped
too much, definitely were big shots. But defensive end, I mean, I went for 11
for 20. So I don't think it was a problem what he was doing for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. This game in particular, you outscored them 20-2 in second-chance
points, you had all the hustle stats in your favor. What ultimately turned the
game for them down the stretch, do you think?  
COACH PIKIELL: Again, I think this is a Final Four team. I watched all the
tapes. I watched all the films. I mean, they really don't have a weakness.  
  
The only thing that they don't do great, that they're not 1 or 2 or 3 in the
league in, is offensive rebounds, and I think that's partly because they make
all their shots.  
  
So they're in the top 2 in the country in field goal percentage, making 3s.
They're efficient. They have assists. They have the most experienced team in
the conference. They have size. They have versatility. I mean, we outrebounded
them. We did a lot of good things.  
  
We hung around with a really talented team. But down the stretch they had four
different guys make huge plays for them. And they're well-coached. So
tremendous respect for that team. That's as good a team as there is in the
country. I haven't seen many teams better honestly in the last 10 or 15 years
of doing this.  
  
I thought we had a good game plan, one day to prepare. And I thought we played
well. We were playing well at the right time of the season, too.  
  
Q. For how this season finished, not knowing maybe what was going to
happen here, what was it like for you to see how the crowd responded here, to
how the players responded to basically getting everything, I'm sure, that the
program had hoped to see when they joined the Big Ten?  
COACH PIKIELL: I love the crowd. I'm glad people came out. It was a tough
weather night, too. So I think you're getting a dose of what we can be at
Rutgers. I'm so excited about the future. I really am. And we're going to get
better and better. And you saw us on a stage today.  
  
Corey was terrific this whole weekend. And everyone kind of chipped in and did
their thing. But they liked the big stage and I liked that they liked that.
And that bodes well for us moving forward in this league.  
  
But Rutgers, you know, I said to them, two years now we've gained some
respect. And people don't want to play us. My phone's not ringing as much, and
I think that's a good thing.  
  
Q. A tight game. Obviously shot goes in for you guys, a miss for Purdue
and the game turns out differently. How much of it was physical tiredness
versus mental? It seemed like a couple of the plays that Purdue hit 3s you
guys were maybe a step slow, rotating challenges, just a fraction --  
COACH PIKIELL: Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it was really that. I really
don't. When Haas sets a screen it's like going around a bus. And so if you're
a half a second late, it's not a normal-sized screen.  
  
So they're just very efficient, too, in what they do. And if you close out a
little bit late, they can really pass the ball. I mean, you guys have seen a
lot of basketball. That's a very good basketball team. They space you out.
They have inside. They have outside. They have veteran guys. They have
versatility.  
  
Vince Edwards is good at driving it. If you play up on him he goes by you. If
you stay off him he makes 3s. And then he can drive it and kick. Very few
teams in the country can drive four guys drive and kick. They have that. So
it's a real tough team to defend with one day to prepare, too.  
  
But I thought we did a great job, I really did. I thought we just hung around
there. And they made some tough shots, too. They hit a banked 3 at one point
in time. Again it's hard.  
  
I kept telling our guys you can't defend the free-throw line. So like I want
them to score over us or make contested shots at the free-throw line. And
can't defend that, and they got to the free-throw line a lot more than us.  
  
Q. It seems appropriate Mike Williams in his final game led the team in
rebounds, eight rebounds, he had five offensive. Can you talk about what he's
meant to this team and this program the last two years, for him to finish it
out in the hometown?  
COACH PIKIELL: He was the first guy two years ago when I took over the
program. He's a dean's list student. He's graduating here. He's been a captain
for two years and he's overachieved. He really has. I mean, he's really
overachieved. Proud of him.  
  
He missed 12 games this year with a high ankle sprain. Didn't think I would
even have him back. Tells you what kind of a kid he is, and that tells you
what a Scarlet Knight is moving forward.  
  
He'll be an example to me and the rest of the team for the rest of my career.
There will be a big picture of Mike in my office and next year at this time
I'll be calling him somewhere and I'll be wishing he had another year of
eligibility.  
  
I'll tell you the same thing with Deshawn Freeman. He's really given blood,
too, to the program. And he's improved so much, too. He's graduating here in
May. And Candido Sa has been great and Jake Dadika. I want to mention all of
those guys. All four of those guys jumped on board.  
  
It's not easy when you get a new coach that didn't recruit you, and people are
telling you should do something else or leave or whatever. And these guys
stuck with us and they're true Rutgers people. And they love Rutgers and real
proud to have coached them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

### [Vince Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27929)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Purdue - 82, Rutgers - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously we're pleased to be able to advance and have the
opportunity to play Penn State. Have nothing but great things to say about
Rutgers and their fight today.  
  
This was one of those games that really could have went either way. They made
a lot of difficult shots. They were great on the offensive glass.  
  
But our guys hung in there. We made a lot of plays offensively and knocked
down shots. And we were fortunate. We missed some free throws down the stretch
that we normally make. But just hats off to Rutgers. They're a tough out and
they were very good today.  
  
But the two guys next to me really played well and stepped up and made some
huge plays for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Carsen and Vince.  
  
Q. What did Coach say to you during halftime to get you motivated to
pick it up in the second half?  
VINCE EDWARDS: Just came and said our energy wasn't there or where it needed
to be and challenged us as a whole, so we had to get together and challenge
each other, pick each other up. When your coach comes in and (indiscernible)
and gets on you like that, he wants to see how you respond. It was a challenge
and we were able to respond and get stops.  
  
Q. Carsen, great game tonight, took the lead early in the second half
for the first time. Even though they never came back and took it again, did it
feel like you couldn't seize control or shake them the rest of the way?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Absolutely. Yes, sir. It came down to a lot of possessions and
they were hitting tough shots. We were able to execute as well, but we were
just kind of going back and forth, so it felt like, it was probably a close
game the entire time. It was a fight, which we knew that coming in, though,
but, yeah.  
  
Q. Vince, you've obviously dealt with injury, illness. What was it like
to have the game you had tonight in that situation?  
VINCE EDWARDS: Huge, really. Just a good confidence booster, honestly. Credit
my teammates for finding me and the coaches for putting me in position to make
plays. But just to be able to walk again and walk normally and put pressure on
my foot feels great. Really don't take anything for granted after going
through that type of injury.  
  
Q. Carsen, for a while it seemed like you and Vince were playing horse,
going back and forth making shots. How did you feel your shot was going? You
struggled a little bit in the beginning of the game but then, like, you really
heated up in the second half?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I mean it's good to see -- I felt like Vince played well,
played well in the first half. He had some big plays in the first half. But it
was good to see some shots falling in the second half knowing I had a tougher
first half, not even offensively but defensively as well. So just seeing some
shots go in and able to take the lead in the second half was good and felt
good.  
  
Q. Every game today seemed like the underdog was a little fresher. Maybe
the team with the bye was rusty. Did you feel like you had a hard time keeping
up with their energy?  
VINCE EDWARDS: I just felt, like you said, they were a little, maybe, I don't
want to say fresher, but we've just got to come out and be ready. There's no
excuse, whether you have a bye, double bye, or you've been playing for two or
three days. So to be a player and to be a great player, you've gotta come to
play no matter what the circumstances are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the second half it seemed like Rutgers, their field goal
percentage dropped. Was there something that you saw at halftime, how you
defended them?  
COACH PAINTER: Not really. As a coach, sometimes it's hard when people just
want to get into isos and play. Because you normally want to build in your
help and do some things differently to get them out of that rhythm.  
  
So we were just trying to take up their space. And even the ones they made I
thought they were pretty tough, you know, step-backs where our guys are right
on them.  
  
Kind of the issue for us is could we get a rebound. They got a lot of
offensive rebounds. We didn't do a good job of boxing out and going to get it.
It was just being better at what we do. It wasn't much of a change in what we
were doing defensively.  
  
We were switching three ways and we weren't switching with their 4. So the
second half we thought we'd switch with their 4. But then you gotta worry
about the iso post up, and you've got to worry about a guard trying to box out
their 4-man, which is hard to do.  
  
But guys like Mike Williams he really helped him. Deshawn Freeman got four
offensive rebounds and Mike got five. They're hard to keep off the glass.  
  
Q. It was brought up earlier today that some of the teams who had byes
that it's hard to adjust and to get court time. Did you feel like you started
off rusty because this was kind of a new environment and Rutgers had already
played?  
COACH PAINTER: I think that holds true at times. I don't think it did today. I
think we took a couple shots early that we shouldn't have taken. I didn't
think our weak-side defense was having good in that first four or five
minutes.  
  
We weren't there. We were very fortunate. I didn't think offense was our issue
in the first half. I thought our defensive awareness and understanding at
times was. And that's not to take anything away from them.  
  
But I've been in that situation when I felt that is the case; the other team,
they get that experience on that court, especially these guys playing two
games.  
  
But I didn't see fatigue from them at the end. Sometimes you see you wear a
team down that has to play three games in a row. I didn't see that from
Rutgers. I thought we made a couple more plays than they did.  
  
Q. Every time you guys get a four, five, six, seven-point lead there in
the second half, they would get a basket; the crowd would get crazy for them.
Were you worried at all that the tsunami of emotions of the three days would
overwhelm you guys at the end?  
COACH PAINTER: Sure, to get kind of a functional piece in terms of basketball.
As a coach you worry more on trying to guard them, trying to box them out,
trying to do functional things from the basketball standpoint.  
  
We have a rule when we go on the road and the crowd gets loud: Pass the
basketball, move the basketball. Don't let it stick in your hands.  
  
So we talked about it before and said, hey, they're going to have a strong
following here at this game, if the crowd starts to get into it.  
  
I think what you see in this game is sometimes what you see with those lower
seeds in the NCAA Tournament. You go to a different -- you go play in Denver
and you've got two teams from the East playing, but one team's a 12 and one
team's a 5, Denver adopts that 12 seed as the game keeps going.  
  
I felt like you have a little bit of that. They probably feel the same way
when they come to Chicago and Indianapolis, especially when you've got a lower
seed closer to them and you have more fans.  
  
Q. Two or three seasons ago you went into Piscataway, I think, and beat
them by 50. What have you seen in that short span of time how the program has
improved?  
COACH PAINTER: They compete. They play hard. I know that's a basic thing. But
when you -- you face one of Steve's teams, you better bring your lunch.
They're going to hit you. They're going to attack the glass. They're going to
play hard.  
  
The three constants I always talk about: Run, rebound and defend. That's what
they do: They play hard, they rebound the basketball and they defend.  
  
I think if you would have saw these shot-making from these guys the whole
season, they would have a different record. They always gave the effort. They
always laid it on the line. But those guys are out there making some tough
shots.  
  
They made those against us. Maybe that's the common denominator. But
throughout the season they don't make those kind of shots all the time. If
they can make shots like that, they're in business, because his teams defend
and his teams rebound.  
  
Q. Just that looked like 100 percent Vince. Did you feel like it was 100
percent Vince, or are you still seeing limitations?  
COACH PAINTER: No, I thought he was fine. I thought he let some things come to
him. Even that shot at the end that he missed, I thought he shot faked, pass
faked, took a dribble and took a good shot. It just didn't go down.  
  
But I thought tonight he took what the defense gives you. That's when he's at
his best. When he takes what the defense gives him, plays off other people,
takes his 3, drives the basketball, when he gets in that flow he's very
effective.  
  
This was a great game for him. I thought the key was him playing in our last
game to kind of get the rust off and I think that helped him play well today.  
  
Q. Specifically two weeks ago against Penn State you guys really had to
claw to win at home, specifically with this team, this Penn State team, what
about them makes them a tough out?  
COACH PAINTER: Tony Carr to start with. He's tough to handle. He gets into
isos and breaks people down. Lamar Stevens is a real tough cover at kind of
that 3, 4-type guy that can post, drive you and play. I just like their
personnel.  
  
Shep's been around the block. Makes shots. You can't let him get going. Tony
Carr get going. Lamar Stevens. Reaves is one of the best defenders in our
league, obviously makes a big basket today.  
  
I know they don't have Big Mike, but it shows you the quality of those guys I
talked about. Pat's done a great job at getting them to play hard, getting
them to play together.  
  
And it's going to be a war. It's going to be a really tough game.  
  
Q. You had seven turnovers in the first half, really cleaned it up after
that, only had two the rest of the game. Was it just focus? Was it guys taking
better care, what was the difference in the second half?  
COACH PAINTER: Just the focus. Just being, getting into a rhythm. And I know
Carsen takes -- Carsen's rhythm is different than other guys' rhythm. He can
shoot the ball so well off the dribble. Sometimes he'll dribble in place and
let one go where it's not that bad of a shot for him.  
  
But I just thought we concentrated better, did little things better. I thought
we were better on both ends of the court in the second half. But with all that
being said, when you shoot the ball well, everything looks better.  
  
Q. You talked about Sanders getting his point. P.J. spent a lot of time
on him today. And he at least made him pretty inefficient. I think he had 23
points on 20 shots, something like that. He missed a big free throw, had four
turnovers. What makes P.J. ideal for that kind of matchup, what makes him the
guy that goes up on a guy like Sanders, maybe allows him to persevere through,
a guy making some tough shots to wear him down?  
COACH PAINTER: The one thing about Corey, he's not a great 3-point shooter. So
like getting him and trying to get into his space and making those long 2s,
it's hard. That's a hard thing.  
  
But we just try to get P.J. to get under him and make it hard for him to come
up and shoot the basketball and just stay with him. Be persistent. I thought
we gave him too much space at times tonight. If he gets to a step back and
jumps over us and shoots it, good for him, especially when it's a 2.  
  
But Corey Sanders is a tough cover. I know we really struggled with him in the
second half of our game at Rutgers. And tonight he was fabulous again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [James Palmer Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34739)

### [Isaiah Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34738)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 77, Nebraska - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MILES: Well, credit Michigan. I thought they played terrific. Their
offensive pace really got us on our heels early. And when they make 11
3-pointers, you're in big trouble because then your defense gets too spread
out, and it's hard to get them under control. And we've done a good job all
year of taking away 3s but we didn't today.  
  
Again, I think Michigan just really played excellent sound, too, put us in a
position of, I thought, overhandle the ball and take real questionable shots.
And we just couldn't get back up on top once we got down by 11 or whatever it
was. But I think the credit goes to Michigan. They played excellent basketball
tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I'm sure your coach will get asked the same thing but I'll ask you
what's the next week or so going to be like sort of waiting to see what
happens with the NCAA bid?  
JAMES PALMER JR.: I think we're just going to wait to see what happens.
Whether it's NCAA -- which I think we should be. But we're just going to wait
this week out, see what happens. Because I don't think this loss should affect
us.  
  
ISAIAH ROBY: I agree with him. I think we're going to have to just start
working hard again and just get ready for whatever postseason we're in,
hopefully it's the NCAA. I think we should be in there, too.  
  
Q. James, what made Zavier Simpson so good defensively against you guys
this afternoon? What made him excel on that side of the floor?  
JAMES PALMER JR.: I don't think it was just Zavier. I think it was a good team
effort with their defense. They was in some good help spots and made us take
tough shots, which I took some of them. And I think they just did a good job
defensively and they got it going on the offensive end. That definitely helped
them on the defensive end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tim, do you guys think you deserve an NCAA bid? And what would be
your case to make to the committee?  
COACH MILES: Well, I believe we're an NCAA Tournament team now. That was -- we
just ran into a buzz saw with Michigan, but I don't think that undoes what
we've already accomplished.  
  
What we've done is we've won games away from home. We've beaten the teams that
we should beat with maybe one exception. And to go through that type of season
where you have to win, I think we won eight out of our last nine, four of
those on the road, we showed we could win away from home.  
  
And to put 13 league wins, I know that's not a marker or anything like that,
but to be able to do that in a difficult environment, because those teams --
Indiana is a good team. You saw today, Iowa is not easy to beat.  
  
And at the end of the day if Quad 1 is the holy grail, that's a tough deal.
But I don't think Quad 1 is the holy grail. There's tough wins in Quad 3. You
just have to see where it goes.  
  
Q. In retrospect would you have done anything differently in schedule so
you got more Tier 1s? I know it's a little difficult, obviously, but is there
anything you would have done differently?  
COACH MILES: We had some bad luck with the Big Ten schedule. If you look at
our Quad 1, I think we've got five games against the Top 25. There's no top 75
in there. I mean, it's all loaded, top-heavy.  
  
And most of those were on the road. I might have switched a screen against
Kansas. That would have made me feel a hell of a lot better. But we didn't do
it.  
  
And so we've competed well against good teams. We weren't able to beat Central
Florida when they had Tacko Fall, so we lost out on the chance to play West
Virginia. And we end up playing Marist and Long Beach in that tournament last
year. We beat Dayton in the Wooden Legacy, then we got UCLA and Virginia Tech,
which was almost too much. And this year we just missed a little bit.  
  
We've never underscheduled. We played at Creighton. We took the Kansas game on
our own volition which not many people are doing.  
  
I think Villanova is the next home-and-away they've got. It says a lot about
what we're about. We're in the Gavitt Games, went to St. John's early when
LoVett was there. We beat Minnesota when Minnesota was basically a Quad 1 win.
That was a very good team.  
  
We've won some excellent games. But I don't know that the league schedule and
the quirkiness of that, there's nothing you can do about it.  
  
Q. Same question as I asked James earlier, just you touched on Michigan,
how good they were defensively. Within that, what made Zavier Simpson so good
on that end and making things difficult for your guards?  
COACH MILES: Zavier was really tough on the ball. He wouldn't let guys past
him. He'd defeat the ball screen and get back in front so we couldn't get
downhill, we couldn't turn the corner. They also did a good job zoning up,
getting guys into the mid-line and then getting back out to shooters. And that
got us standing around and overdribbling. So when you overdribble you stand
around.  
  
And I'm begging guys, cut, cut, on the ball screen stuff, to force them to
have to pick up a cutter and then maybe we can skip and drive or closeout,
shoot an open shot from there. I thought they did a good job getting us --
your goal in defense is to stand the ball up and stand the offense up; get
them standing still as much as you can.  
  
I thought they did a good job, all of them, with active hands, handling ball
screens, just defeating screens, guarding the ball one-on-one in a really good
manner.  
  
Now we did get to the foul line some, but by the time we started getting
downhill there was only three minutes left. We had that little run early where
we hit some shots but then we stood around for a long time. And then I think
we got score-sensitive in the second half. We got a little panicky. And
Michigan will make you do that.  
  
Q. As it stands now the Big Ten might only get four or five NCAA
Tournament bids. Just curious, if you sort of look at the overall strength of
the league, how would you compare it to what it's been in the previous three
seasons since the league increased to 14 teams?  
COACH MILES: Well, you know, like I was looking at the KenPom numbers and what
is Michigan like defensively, like 12? Ninth or tenth. And the league is just
a little different.  
  
Now, we had some changeover. We had some injuries. Certainly left a few teams
with less talent. But Maryland still has a lot of talent, you know what I
mean. You play a Maryland team you're playing Cowan and Huerter and Fernando.
You're playing plenty of talent. They lost some guys here, but I'm just using
it as an example. It's too bad guys were injured, but everybody kind of goes
through that at a different time. But I believe the Big Ten's always a grind.  
  
I thought we were going to have a good team anyway this year. I've read that
this is a decidedly down year. I don't know who the hell decided that, but at
the same time when you look at this, the Big Ten, I think how many other teams
we get in the tournament, we'll all do very well.  
  
Q. With all the talk about how big this game was going in for your
resume and profile, do you feel your kids put extra pressure going into the
game, and did that play on as the game continued on?  
COACH MILES: I don't think there's any question the guys kind of felt a burden
of expectation that way. You could see and you could see in the reaction
afterwards. The other thing with the double bye, you just don't get in the
facility. And that advantage of playing that day before, you have seen that
with even Wisconsin and Michigan State, I think, there's a true advantage
there.  
  
But not being in the facility I don't love that but I don't know what our
options are either. I think our option was like 8.00 a.m. or 7:30 this
morning. You're not going to get your guys out of bed for that. So I do think
when we arrived we arrived a little tight. But they've also done some
excellent things this year, and I don't think that one game takes away all
that hard work over months and months.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Brad Davison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34697)

### [Aleem Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34729)

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Ethan Happ](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30815)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Michigan State - 63, Wisconsin - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, let's start with an opening statement.  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously a tough locker room. But I couldn't be more proud of how
they've grown together. I told them even before today, I don't know if there's
a more improved team -- there's not a more improved team in the league. I
don't know across the country if there's a team that's come as far as this
group has with what they've had to overcome and work through and how they've
grown.  
  
So short here today and it ends on an extremely bitter note. But proud of how
they've grown. Went toe to toe the last two games with Michigan State. Credit
to Tom and his group. Made enough plays when they needed to and we didn't come
up with enough rebounds when we needed to.  
  
But, like I said, proud of these guys to my right and the rest of the group in
the locker room as we've grown over the last 30 days or so.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you address, did Michigan State make any changes? It was the
third time and you played them just a week ago. Did they make any changes or
adjustments that you didn't see last Sunday in Madison?  
ETHAN HAPP: I didn't see any, no.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I understand that there isn't a lot of silver linings at this level
of basketball, but when you look at the injuries this team has endured and
where they finished, can you end the season taking great pride in just how far
they've come?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, as I mentioned in my statement, obviously with what they've
overcome, obviously with what we started early in the year, you mentioned
injuries. We've tried to put that behind us and grow from December on when
that happened. And how they've been able to persevere and continue to get
better. And from where we were in, I think those two guys went out December
4th or 5th, to where we are now, we didn't -- the problem was by the time we
got out of the nest, so to speak, it was a little too late in terms of this
past month.  
  
This team is kind of a microcosm of our players over the years. We've been
very successful with a lot of late bloomers, guys that have really sprung into
their own as juniors and seniors.  
  
We don't have any seniors and just a couple of juniors that are playing. And
this team was much the same way; it was a late-blooming team. Unfortunately,
like I said, December and January weren't -- early December and January
weren't as kind to us. But proud of how they persevered. There's been a lot of
teams across the country that would have folded up shop and quit a long time
ago. And we were 3-9 in the league at one point.  
  
But this group kept persevering and battling and getting better. And
unfortunately we didn't have enough today nor enough earlier in the year to be
able to keep playing in the NCAA Tournament, which I know everybody in that
locker room that was the goal was to try to win this thing to get there.  
  
Q. You've coached against Miles Bridges for two years now. Can you talk
about the challenges he presents and how much of a handful he's going to be
going forward for other teams in what it will probably be his final
postseason?  
COACH GARD: As I've said before, when we played him his addition to the
3-point shot to his game has changed it. And it not only helps him, it helps
Ward inside and other guys inside, Jackson inside, because now you've got to
stretch the floor. You've got to stay with Winston and Langford and McQuaid.
And it gives those guys inside a little more room to operate.  
  
And then he's added some play-making ability. His ability to change direction
with the ball, some of the things he's done not only today but in other games,
in the past he's been primarily a straight-line driver. And he was able to
change direction. He put -- he had a good move there on Davison in the second
half where he got separation and got a jump shot off.  
  
So he's becoming a much more complete player. And obviously at his size he's a
matchup problem too at 6'8" with his ability to play inside and outside. And
he's evolved as you would expect him to.  
  
Q. Over the past two decades, 19 straight seasons, Wisconsin has made
the tournament. This is the first time in a long time you've obviously been a
big part of that. Wisconsin fans have come to expect making the tournament.
But can you speak to how the program has grown to this point? And then if
you're going to get back next year, what philosophical changes you might tweak
heading into a new season, obviously with the goal of making the Big Dance?  
COACH GARD: The biggest thing that will help us going into next year is get
older and healthier. As I mentioned we had no seniors in the rotation. We had
two guys that were out for most of the majority of the season other than 10
games. So we've got a lot of things we've got to get better at and grow. It's
the youngest we've been in 20 years, since the last time it didn't happen in
terms of number of freshmen in the rotation and the biological age of those
playing.  
  
But that wasn't -- these guys didn't want to use it as an excuse. They thought
we could get there with a bunch of young guys. Like I said, the perseverance
of this group has been pretty admirable in terms of how they've continued to
battle. And today was another great example of it.  
  
So we'll reflect on this and I've got a lot of things that I won't share that
we'll work on and get better at, and part of it will be just health and
maturity will help us a lot.  
  
Q. Above and beyond obviously disappointment that would come from any
season that ends the way you don't want it to, did you have extra emotional
investment in that streak? You were such a big part of it, really, and not to
preempt the committee but it looks pretty jeopardized?  
COACH GARD: We've never talked about a streak. All the way back to 2001, we've
never talked about, oh, we've been to the tournament five years in a row, ten
years in a row, we've never used that.  
  
It was always about doing your best you could do to try to win the conference
championship first, then come and try to win the conference tournament
championship and then you try to bop until you drop in the NCAA Tournament. So
we never said -- we never went through it with it being results-oriented. We
always try to get better as the season went on.  
  
Mentioned earlier, this group just surged late, too late. But, so, I don't get
caught up into streaks. I understand that. But how about admiring the great
string that's been put together? That's pretty dang impressive.  
  
I think the next one, I know Michigan State has one, Kansas has one. Duke
maybe has one. Gonzaga has one. Then I saw the next closest was seven years.
After that, Iowa State and somebody else has, Cincinnati maybe that has it at
seven years.  
  
How about applauding those 19 teams that were able to make it. I'll tell you
what, there's a lot more that could go wrong than can go right. If you have
injuries or have things happen at the wrong time to you, there's a lot of
teams would have -- 400-some Division I teams and we're only one of four or
five that have strings this long.  
  
I think we reflect back and admire the coaches and the players and the
tradition that's been established and appreciate that. Because that's pretty
special. 19 years in a row is hard. And obviously there's a few that --
Michigan State has a string that's going at 20 or something like that. But
that's hard to do.  
  
And our goal will be to try to get back there next year not were the idea that
we're going to start 19 in a row again. Let's just do the best we can do to
get ready for next year, try to win the Big Ten Championship and take that
process-oriented approach.  
  
Q. Having played them before, preparing for them, what adjustments did
you make for the athleticism and length this time around?  
COACH GARD: Well, I think the one thing that we didn't do a good enough job
especially the second half today is keep them off the glass. And that happened
a little bit in Madison. That's one of their pillars. They hit the offensive
glass pretty hard.  
  
I think we gave up 13 offensive rebounds in the second half on 19 missed
shots. That's almost 70 percent of misses; that's too many. And that extended
possessions. That allowed them to do what they do and hurt us from being able
to maybe expand upon a lead we had or catch them closer.  
  
So going against them for a lot of years, the keys really haven't changed.
You've got to be good in transition defensively. Gotta keep them off the
glass. They're very good defensively. Jackson makes a whole difference for
them compared to years past just because of his shot blocking at the rim. So,
yeah, they're a pretty complete team.  
  
Q. On Jackson, the second straight game they switched to that lineup
with him at the five down the stretch of the game. Just what difference does
that look give them and what is the impact?  
COACH GARD: I think it's not only Jackson at the 5 but I think it's Bridges at
the 4 because we went with our more mobile 4 down the stretch, too, and the
lean forward. So they were doing some things to counter what we were doing in
terms of trying to stretch the floor more with our 4-man.  
  
So I think it was more -- I don't know because I haven't asked Tom about his
rotations or who he has in, but I know they were trying to match what we were
doing with Ford a little bit too, and to go a little more mobile and smaller
on the perimeter. They've done that before. Bridges has played the 4 a lot in
the past.  
  
Q. How would you evaluate the overall strength of the Big Ten this
season compared to what it's been in the three seasons since it increased to
14 teams?  
COACH GARD: I don't think it gets enough credit. I think obviously we've got
three or four, five at the top that obviously get a lot of, but the middle --
I mean here it is. We finished in, what, ninth and we have a game, we have
back-to-back games like this with the first-place team. And you've seen that
across the board. Watch what Rutgers has done. Rutgers played Michigan State,
tough both times. Overtime in East Lansing and what they've done here in the
previous two games.  
  
So it doesn't get maybe the attention and everybody thinks the Big Ten is
down. People that are saying that are the people that aren't playing in it,
aren't having to coach in it every night, having to see the players -- Penn
State, how Iowa played yesterday. And Michigan is playing real well right now.  
  
So, yeah, you think it's easier or not as good until you have to come play in
it. Then you find out it's a little different.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Tony Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32878)

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Josh Reaves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34745)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State - 69, Ohio State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: Just really proud of my guys. Every time Ohio State made a run
and it looked like they were going to extend the lead, you know they stepped
up, made a big play. Tony hit a big 3, makes a great decision at the end
there. Shep yesterday takes a big-time charge. Today he gets the steal. Give
Ohio State a lot of credit. Diop took over there and he went on a little
scoring run.  
  
But these guys stood tall. They really did. They stuck together, really
believed in our foundation of defending and rebounding.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, could you take us through the last play with the steal and what
you saw there before you got the layup and when you got the layup?  
JOSH REAVES: To be completely honest, when they got the steal I was really
excited. I was kind of like trying to gather myself.  
  
We got the ball, gave it to Tony, and Coach called a really good play. I just
noticed my man wasn't looking at me so I took advantage of that. And Tony just
shows how much of a great player he is to find an open man in a time like
that. I was just fortunate enough to make the dunk.  
  
Q. Tony, you had 25 tonight, 25 last night as well. Couple of times
tonight where you really got the offense going with a late shot. What kind of
mentality do you have to go in there and be a closer?  
TONY CARR: I would say that I'm (indiscernible) mentality. Coach put the
utmost confidence in me, and my teammates have the utmost confidence in me. I
just want to step up and take those shots.  
  
Q. Tony, how do you push through the tiredness and exhaustion at the end
of the game to make a win like that?  
TONY CARR: I was definitely tired, like, by the five-minute mark. But we put
in so much work this offseason and I wanted to win so bad, so you dig down
deep. Coach always preaches that, and we've got great leaders around us just
kept us on track. And Shep and Josh -- and we just wanted to get the win.  
  
Q. What does this kind of win mean for the program just as a whole and
obviously for this season as well?  
JOSH REAVES: This is a big win for us. We go into every single game confident.
And we're just fortunate enough to pull out the win at the end of the game.
We're going to enjoy this one for now and focus on who we have next.  
  
Q. How do you explain being 3-0 against a good team like Ohio State?  
TONY CARR: I would just say with the way the ball bounced, like you said, Ohio
State is a great team. But I think we're a pretty good team, too. So we just
want to come out and play every game to our best and hopefully come out with
the win.  
  
Q. Tony, what's it like for you, just how are you feeling kind of on the
court scoring as much as you are? The ball's in your hand late. What's that
like for you?  
TONY CARR: I felt great. Like I said before, I have the utmost confidence in
myself. I put in so much work this offseason. And basically it's just paying
off for me. And my teammates find me in great spots. Coach calls great plays
where I'm able to score. And I feel great.  
  
Q. Tony, what was the play that was called for that possession?  
TONY CARR: It was fist two (phonetic), basically try to get the mismatch and I
was just trying to make a play. And Josh basically made the play. He made a
great cut. I was just out there dribbling around. Josh made a great play. And
I thank God I found him.  
  
Q. Tony, what's the benefit to shooting with so much arc? Have guys
tried to change it over the years or do most coaches like it that way?  
TONY CARR: No, my grandpop told me when I was young shoot it in the air, it
gives it a better chance to go in. I've been shooting like that my whole life.
We definitely made some changes to it this offseason but nothing drastic or
anything like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What was the mentality there to not call a timeout with 15 seconds
left and you had two timeouts?  
COACH CHAMBERS: We've been in this situation before. Go back to Wisconsin. I
think Tony learned a lot from it. Our team learned a lot from it. You learn a
lot from setbacks and losses. And I just felt like if I called timeout they
could set up different defense or make substitutions.  
  
And I don't want to do that. I felt the play that we were running with Josh
setting a ball screen and them switching was the appropriate play at that
point. And it was very successful, and obviously Tony made the right decision.  
  
Q. By the reaction you had to the Penn State fans across from your
bench, talk about how much fun you had and the climb it's been in this season
to get to the point where you are right now.  
COACH CHAMBERS: There's no doubt. The climb is never straight up, is it? Down,
sideways, it's crazy. I just really appreciate all the support when Penn
Staters come out like that, the last four home games were outstanding. They do
want good basketball here, and it's been dormant a little bit but we're
starting to see it and it's getting exciting.  
  
Q. First off, were you surprised Tony passed the ball to Josh in the
final 10 seconds? And despite Josh having a tough night shooting what does it
say for him to come through like that in such a big moment here in Madison
Square Garden?  
COACH CHAMBERS: You know what, I knew he would make the right decision. That's
why I didn't call a timeout. Mostly he's been shooting it. But I knew he would
make the right decision.  
  
Q. Related to that, can you speak to the growth of Tony over the course
of this season and how his play has certainly helped, I guess lead the way for
the improvement of your team overall versus -- he was a good player to start
with, but seemed like his overall attitude and approach to the game is really
rising the tide for your team?  
COACH CHAMBERS: No doubt. He's really matured. He's shown a lot of growth.
That's really important for me as long as he has the growth mindset, willing
to get better, learning from setbacks. I think that's what you've seen all
year.  
  
Now he's starting to emerge more as a leader. You need leadership, especially
with your point guard. Your point guard needs to be your leader. He just turns
out to be our best player, too. That's really working out for us.  
  
It's the whole team in general, if you think about it. Without Mike Watkins,
this team is very connected. They understand their roles very well. They're
talking to each other out there. They're taking over huddles. There's a lot of
fun to be in that game today.  
  
Q. The bus had a bit of trouble getting over here today. What was that
whole experience like?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Unbelievable. A little fender bender, we're 1-0 with fender
benders. But we're in New York. What do you expect?  
  
Q. What do you think this win does tonight for you guys to get on the
bubble and get selected to the tournament?  
COACH CHAMBERS: It's a good win. They talk about Quad 1 wins. We've got plenty
of Quad 1 wins. That's a quality win. We hope they give us a hard look.  
  
Q. Your seniors, Julian and Shep, both had critical plays on defense.
Julian a good job on Bates-Diop and Shep with the steal late and the dunk. How
much of that is urgency and how much of that is they sense that this is their
last crack at it and they want to go out with a bang?  
COACH CHAMBERS: They've been in there before. They've been in these types of
games and battles. Shep yesterday with the charge and Julian had the block and
a couple rebounds yesterday. And today he did the same thing. That's what
seniors are supposed to do for you.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team go up about eight, down by four? And
then specifically when Ohio State calls a timeout you're down one, they had
the ball. What did you notice about your guys in that huddle that gave you
that confidence that you're going to pull this out?  
COACH CHAMBERS: The correct word is confidence. I didn't see anybody sulking
or bad body language. No heads were down. They were eager and willing to
listen: What are we going to do; how do we get a stop; how are we going to
execute? And let us know. They were so connected. That's why I was saying it
was so fun to be in those huddles because everybody was really engaged.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Miles Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32885)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Michigan State - 63, Wisconsin - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, played against Wisconsin since Dick Bennett, and
before that even and seems like it never changes. You know, I remember Jud
saying to me one time that a win is when you win by one. A real good game, you
win by two. And a blowout, you win by three. And I don't think it's quite that
way.  
  
But give [Greg Gard] credit. His team played well again in back-to-back games.
And I did not think we played very well. I thought the first half we were
really out of sync. And so we talked about it as a team and we just gotta do
some better things.  
  
Cassius was unbelievable the first half. Miles played really well the second
half. And those guys brought us back in it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Cassius, getting here and getting game 1, does that help? Do you
think it was the nerves, because it was the Garden, the start of the run for
the title? Do you think just getting game 1 will help this team exponentially
better?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely. I think it's a lot of shots. We got a couple good
shots that we missed that we usually make. It was a lot going into the game,
the first game is always the hardest game.  
  
So it's a lot we can learn and get better from. And we got another opportunity
to come back tomorrow and get better.  
  
Q. Miles, you got pushed to the 4 there and you had success as a team
overall. One way or the other playing the 3 or the 4, which do you think is
the most efficient position for you with this team at this stage of the
season?  
MILES BRIDGES: I feel it doesn't matter to me. I know plays from both wing and
the 4. So my teammates did a great job getting me involved. And we executed.  
  
Q. Miles, what's it like playing here at the Garden? And is it a little
weird you're doing this tournament a week early? And also I know you decided
to come back in part to pursue a national championship and all that. How
excited are you that this time of year is finally here?  
MILES BRIDGES: We're definitely excited we get to play here for a championship
at the mecca of basketball. We had to get some first-game jitters out of the
way. But I feel like once we got that out of the way we got comfortable and we
got going.  
  
It's not really that weird. We play in the PK80. I feel it prepared us for
this. We've just got to stay focused throughout the whole tournament.  
  
Q. I know that you don't care who you play, you just want to win a
title. How much would you like another shot at Michigan?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like I said, if Michigan wins this game, we end up playing, I
definitely won't be disappointed to get another opportunity to go out there.
And I definitely myself got an opportunity to go out there and play against
them. I think I dropped the ball the last game.  
  
If we play Michigan, it's going to be a big rival game for the tournament to
move on to the championship, but that's the type of game you live for.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: We'd like to prepare for both teams. But if we play Michigan,
it will be more of a pride thing as well. But both teams are good and we're
going to try to prepare for both.  
  
Q. Miles, how tough is it to beat a team three times, especially in one
week?  
MILES BRIDGES: It's definitely tough. Last year we played Minnesota three
times, we lost the last game. And we definitely didn't want to do it this
year. Wisconsin is a great team, too. Their record doesn't determine how good
they are.  
  
Q. Miles, you passed on a lot of money to come back to school and win a
championship. How did it feel when you saw your name in the mix of that FBI
report?  
COACH IZZO: I'm sorry, we're not talking about any of that stuff. I made that
perfectly clear. And I apologize, I don't blame you for asking, but we've got
enough to do.  
  
Q. Guys, obviously you had to beat Wisconsin three times this year, but
you guys just played them on Sunday. So I know you guys didn't know who you
were playing until like last night but did that kind of help that you already
had some scouting done on them already?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely. I think we knew their offense pretty well, just
coming off playing them. We knew the game was going to come down to details,
rebounding who played the hardest. In terms of what they ran and the type of
players and the scouting report, we had that down.  
  
Q. When it came down to crunch time and you started spreading route,
athleticism and length, do you think that played a part in the last two
minutes of the game?  
MILES BRIDGES: It definitely helped us because they played a game yesterday.
So we just tried to go after them because they looked kind of fatigued, and we
wanted to execute and get stops.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely. I think it bothered them a little bit, the length
bothered them definitely, especially Jaren and Josh on the wing. We got a lot
of deflections and steals down the stretch. That helped us get some key stops.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously Miles and Cassius scored well today, but a guy like Matt
McQuaid we saw a little bit earlier this year, didn't get a lot of shots
today, but kind of kept them off the line, but was able to step up and hit the
big 3 late. What does it say about a kid like that -- we've seen his
confidence up and down at times -- to be able to do those things?  
COACH IZZO: Hit that one and hit that big layup and he got a couple of great
offensive rebounds. I thought, in all honesty, Matt and Josh played extremely
well defensively, yet we couldn't get either one of them to buy a shot.  
  
They did a pretty good job on Davison and Pritzl. Between those two they were,
what, 5-for-21, and those two had a lot to do with it. But there's no question
that for the kid who hadn't been shooting very much tonight to knock down that
big 3, we needed it and he needed it. I think it will help us down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Your team is now 8-0 in games decided by six points or fewer in
overtime this season. How impressed are you that a team this young still
continues to win these games in clutch time like this?  
COACH IZZO: I watched Jay Wright the other night and they came back and won a
game in overtime.  
  
And I watched the interview and then I talked to him the next day. And he
said, you know, at this time of year it's better to win close than blow a team
out by 20.  
  
I told him he was freakin' crazy when I talked to him. But I kind of
understood his point. In other words, yesterday there's four games in single
digit numbers, and that's kind of the way the NCAA Tournament is going to be.  
  
I was disappointed in my team, maybe in myself, too. I just didn't think we
played well. But like some of my, my equipment man and guys like that said out
to me, when has it been any different with Wisconsin?  
  
I still give [Greg] a lot of credit. His team played so hard. And they're very
patient. They're a tough team to play against.  
  
So in general, winning a close game, you know, if we march on any in this
tournament or in the next tournament, there's probably going to be a lot of
close games. Couple of years ago we won by 15 in a lot of these games and we
weren't ready for a close game.  
  
Q. The free throws, you were getting aggressive and getting to the line,
and then Miles misses one at the end there. But more importantly, did you see
what you wanted from the guys trying to go to the basket and getting there
hard?  
COACH IZZO: I did. And it was a physical game. Probably a hard game to
officiate. I wasn't happy; [Greg] probably wasn't happy. But I wouldn't envy
the officials in that game. I thought there was a lot of banging inside. And
Jaren's last foul was a question mark on a hook or whatever.  
  
But I think in general that's Big Ten basketball. That's tournament time. And
not as much is called. I thought both teams were physical. We only got 11 free
throws. They only got six or seven free throws. It wasn't like there were a
lot of free throws, but I think we did try to drive it a little bit. One time
Josh either tripped himself or got tripped. Those are big plays.  
  
But in general we were more aggressive in some ways, Miles was a lot more
aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. When you're motivating your guys, is it just about winning that day's
game, or do you take a larger picture of trying to get a No. 1 seed in the
tournament?  
COACH IZZO: I haven't talked about the 1 seed in the tournament because I
really don't care. I look at the way they're doing it. Notre Dame doesn't
count as anything.  
  
And it doesn't bother me. It really doesn't bother me. It does bother me that
we're not maybe playing at the level you need to play at to advance in that
tournament. Nothing to do with the 1 seed, just to do it with how well we play
and what we need.  
  
Q. You might have more postseason experience than just about any coach
in the country, outside of Coach K. But just what is it about teams like
Wisconsin that maybe don't have that good of a regular season but seem to be
able to click at -- do you see anything? What's the motivating factor there?  
COACH IZZO: If you look at their last six or seven games, first of all, well-
coached. His team is not going to make the NCAA Tournament unless they win
this. And I don't know if he looked at winning it. I think he was just able to
get his team to play. And I have a lot of respect for him in that.  
  
But Wisconsin has been this way, like I said, early. Just like I said in their
DNA over there. Always tough to play against, whether you beat them or lose.
I've lost a lot of close games to Wisconsin when Bo was there. Lost a lot of
one-point games, last second shot games. That's what I said.  
  
I mean, I'll promise you this, the year we won the national championship with
Dick Bennett, we beat them four times.  
  
And I think the blowout was maybe six points. I don't know. Eight. It was just
-- it's the way it was and so it's got to be in their DNA more than just each
individual player.  
  
It's what they do there. And they've had some continuity in their coaching
staffs, or a guy like Dick Bennett and Bo had a similar philosophy. But give
[Greg] a lot of credit, to take that team that was struggling. They played
really well, not just against us but the last six. They beat Purdue. They
played very well.  
  
Q. How much would you enjoy having a second shot at Michigan if it
worked out that way?  
COACH IZZO: You know, the rivalry is the rivalry, but I learned a long time
ago that if you get caught up in that, I don't know who is going to win this
game. Nebraska is maybe playing as well. Michigan was playing pretty well the
last two games.  
  
And then they struggled yesterday. We all struggle. So, I mean, do I want a
chance at them again? Yes. Do I want a chance at Nebraska if it helps us move
on to the championship game? Yes.  
  
So John's done a good job with his team. I think Tim -- to be 13-5 and we're
sitting here asking if they're going to be in the NCAA Tournament, almost
sounds ridiculous to me. But whoever we play we'll be ready to play. I think
it will be a little better.  
  
We had kind of a tough night last night. We got in late. Had a little plane
problem. And I just don't think we were as sharp as we needed to be. That
usually falls on the coach. And I'll take that blame and see if I can do a
better job tonight.  
  
Q. With the decision in the last two games against Wisconsin, sliding
Jaren over to the 5 to close those games, how much of that was you wanting to
do it versus reactionary to what they were doing when they stretched things
out?  
COACH IZZO: A little bit of both. We thought we could stretch things out,
because Happ doesn't come out a lot. We thought we could do a better job of
stretching things out.  
  
And Jaren gives us -- now we've got a 4 and 5 that are stretched. And Jaren's
done a good job. Today was one of those days where he reverted back and we
couldn't -- a couple of reach-in fouls, although the last foul I think was a
question mark. But he deserved probably three of his five. And we just gotta
keep him in the game because Jaren Jackson is very valuable to this team.  
  
So we went to that as we went to it in Madison last week, and we'll probably
do a little bit more of that, because he's a better free throw shooter than a
lot of those other guys. And he is a shot blocker, and we can use him to
switch 5 which is what we wanted to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State - 69, Ohio State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Give Penn State credit, I thought they made the necessary
plays down the stretch. Tough back and forth game. We'll learn from it and get
ready for the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of the student-athletes.  
  
Q. When someone is scoring as effortlessly and easily as Carr was, is
there anything you can do defensively?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I mean, we just gotta try to make them as uncomfortable as
possible. He's a great player and it's hard to stop him when he can score on
all three levels. So the best thing we could do is try to get the ball out of
his hands.  
  
Q. Jae'Sean, I saw you shaking your head as you were looking down at the
statistics. What was it that you were shaking your head at?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: A lot of things. The amount of offensive rebounds we gave up in
the second half -- I mean in the first half. That really came down to why the
game went that way. We just gotta be -- in the future we've got to lock down
on the offensive end. I think we did, on the defensive end, we did a great job
of making them take tough shots, but we gave them one-on-one chance and that's
where it hurt us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Chris, did Pat throw anything different in here, third matchup,
anything the first, second half, or was this all according to the scouting
report, no new surprises?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Nothing different, nothing different. I don't know why they
would have. They've beaten us twice. The same way they've played and attacked
us.  
  
Q. I know you're not really concerned with their team, but do you think
they're an NCAA Tournament team?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I thought that about them and Nebraska. I've thought that
about both. But I don't study the metrics. Do I think they're talented enough
and capable enough to win a game in the NCAA Tournament? Absolutely,
absolutely.  
  
Look across the board, even without Watkins. They're plenty good enough. They
play together. They play hard. But whether they've done the necessary stuff
throughout the year, and I've not looked at good wins versus, outside of our
three, versus bad losses. I don't know what their metrics are like. I really
don't. So I don't even know what ours are like.  
  
Q. Speaking of the NCAA Tournament, you're looking at about two weeks
until you play your first game; is that something that you're looking forward
to the rest, or are you worried that you might come out a little flat?  
COACH HOLTMANN: We've gotten that question a lot. I think we'll try to balance
rest versus rest. And I've already talked to some people about that in
preparation for it. It's obviously unique given the length of the layoff that
we have right now. But we'll work on that and put a plan together here in
place tomorrow.  
  
Q. You said that you didn't really see anything different from Penn
State tonight. Without Mike Watkins, did your game plan going in change any
way on offense or defense?  
COACH HOLTMANN: A little bit. A little bit. But Watkins was a presence at the
rim in both games. But he did not -- he impacted the game, but it wasn't as
much as their other guys. And they really have great depth on the interior.  
  
So at the end of the day the guy that hurt us in previous games hurt us. I
think his ability to affect shots at the rim hurts them and his size, but
they've got really good interior depth.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 2, 2018

  

### [Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30705)

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 77, Nebraska - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: I'm not taking credit away from Iowa and certainly from last
night, but I think it's really hard -- I think the team that's already played
here once has a real advantage when you can't shoot around, you can't do
anything, you walk in, sort of been there.  
  
So I don't know if that's what happened with Nebraska today, but I know we
were really good because we've been here yesterday and played a really tough
Iowa team.  
  
And so I'm just thrilled with the win. Thrilled for our kids. This reminded me
very much of like our Penn State and our Maryland games where we just were
hitting on all cylinders and a lot of things on both offense and defense. And
the defense, you look at the numbers right now, our defense was not good; it
was great.  
  
Q. Does this run feel anything like last year seeing how you got to DC,
but just how you're playing right now?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: I think there are some similarities. Obviously there's some
different personnel. But the guys that have been through it, we know what it's
like to get hot at the right time, and we feel like we're playing well right
now.  
  
Obviously we definitely have some work we still need to do. But right now
we're just focused on, first of all, recovering from today's game but learning
from it and then also getting ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. For each of the players, everyone talks about the Michigan-Michigan
State rivalry in football; it's known as "the game." How would you describe
the rivalry in basketball and what do you think tomorrow's going to be like?  
MORITZ WAGNER: To be honest with you, I'm going to enjoy this win for another
30 minutes to an hour and then I'll probably think about tomorrow. Michigan
State is a very good team that deserves to win the Big Ten Championship the
way they play. So it's on tomorrow and it's a great team.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Similar to what Moe said. We're just going to enjoy this one
right now and learn from it. And obviously at the same time it's an in-state
rival, we have a lot of pride and we're going to come out and compete. And I'm
sure they'll do the same.  
  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: Like they were saying, it's a rivalry game even
though it's postseason you want to come out and have a sense of urgency and be
ready for a fight.  
  
Q. Duncan, ever since the Wisconsin game you've been shooting 55 percent
from long range. What have you been doing differently since then to start
hitting from there?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Nothing in particular. I think a lot of it was just mental.
Found myself in a situation where my time in a Michigan uniform is running
out. You heighten your sense of urgency when you realize that. And I think
it's just been my mental approach and just trying to be aggressive, and I get
a lot of that from my teammates and coaches as well from their encouragement.  
  
Q. Moe, you had one of your best games of the year against Michigan
State. They obviously have a bunch of big-time prospects. What do you think
went well for you in that first game? And what do you think you maybe have to
do different against them this time?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I mean it doesn't really matter, to be honest with you, who is
going to have a good game. I think that day I think things just worked out the
way -- our offense, kind of pick your poison a little bit. And it was my day
that day.  
  
I'm not trying to focus on that too much because it doesn't mean tomorrow.
We're playing in the semifinals for a Big Ten Championship. And January 13th
or whatever it was doesn't mean anything tomorrow. Yeah.  
  
Q. You would expect them to be extra motivated after how well you played
against them?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I mean, yeah, maybe. But that's nothing I'm worried about,
that's nothing I can control. I'm just going to worry about my own team and
the way we're going to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Moe, after fouling out yesterday, did you change your approach at all
defensively?  
MORITZ WAGNER: Yeah, I mean, I can't start the first half with a dumb foul on
the ball screen, I can't do that. And then I just hurt my team. And obviously
that was topic in team meetings in the last 24 hours. So I feel a certain
responsibility to help my team out there and not do that dumb stuff.  
  
Q. Duncan, Coach Beilein talked about how you guys were not good but
great defensively, that's been a mark of your team throughout the season.
What's been the biggest thing in terms of becoming such an elite defensive
team now?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: I think pride, first and foremost. At least in my time here,
I feel we've been always criticized for not getting after it at that end. But
this team has just completely transformed that mentality.  
  
To be honest with you, I think it starts with Zavier. He brings it every
single game and every single day in practice and raises everybody's level.  
  
When you have veteran guards like Muhammad and Charles, and Moe's improved so
much as well defensively, I think when we come together and stay connected on
defense, it makes all the difference.  
  
Q. Muhammad, you mentioned yesterday, the game in Lincoln, you guys just
didn't respond very well to their defense, maybe doing some switching you guys
didn't adjust to, what was different today that worked so well that didn't
work in Lincoln?  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: I think we just seen it a lot more. As of late,
teams have been trying to switch out their defenses against us. And I think we
were just more comfortable with it today and we just picked our poison within
our offense and found open shots in slots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been some time now since you played State last. Do you
see anything different about this team going into tomorrow that's just
different?  
COACH BEILEIN: From our team?  
  
Q. About State, is State any different?  
COACH BEILEIN: I haven't watched one bit of their game. The last time I
watched them was whenever we played them. I have no idea. I'll start that now.
Just focus on the next game. You can't go around just watching games on TV in
our business. You have to stay on the next opponent; you might watch that game
three or four times.  
  
I wish I could help you with that.  
  
Q. Are you going to watch basketball next week when you're trying to
figure out how to kill that extra week?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, if the NCAA Tournament -- I think we're in good
shape. But it's going to be interesting because it's up to 10 days. But I will
probably watch some things. But I'll be more focused on what can we do; try to
put all the things who we could be playing, whether work on our zone offense,
people switching against us. That's what we did on Monday. We worked 24
minutes on people switching against us thinking that Nebraska could be doing
that if we got there.  
  
Then we didn't talk about Nebraska again. So I'll probably do some of those
things, maybe look at some of those charts, see some possible opponents, see
if somebody is a little strange with what they do and get a head start, but
more than that I'll just try and make our team better on simple things,
shooting, cutting, passing.  
  
Q. From a physical standpoint, is this the best defensive team that
you've had since you've been here? And when Duncan was asked about the defense
a minute ago, he mentioned Zavier Simpson and being important in transforming
your identity on that end. What would you point to in terms of one thing
that's been key to your success on that end of the court?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think one of the things it helped us last year a lot was
having -- the 4-man and the point guard are really key defensively right now
because of all the ball screens set by the 4-man here and there.  
  
That young man right there much maligned by his defense by probably all you
and me has been a huge -- Duncan has been a huge development, playing with
more toughness more resilience, really trying to make a difference at that end
of the floor. So that's been a big key. But there's no question that Zavier,
right, that's what he does. That's his mark.  
  
He works on his all other games, all the areas of his other games, all these
finger rolls he's been working on and things like that. He sets the stage.  
  
When they come through the front door and they meet Zavier, they know they're
in for a tussle. And all of our other guys sort of feed off that. Muhammad is
really good too. Two really good defensive guards.  
  
Q. How do you think Moe is different now compared to this point last
year?  
COACH BEILEIN: Rebounding. It's an exceptional difference. I mean, his timing,
it was all off. He didn't go get the ball. He didn't necessarily box out.  
  
For him to get 13 rebounds today is exceptional. And that's been -- that's one
of the things that I think if he's going to play in the pros one day, that was
one of the things -- he's a stretch 4 at that level. Stretch 4s have to, they
certainly have to rebound. And he's really shown some great growth there.  
  
Q. Last night you guys missed, I think, your first 11 or 12 shots from
beyond the arc. Tonight was a different story. Was that an emphasis or just
kind of fell into place?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think that once you get a little bit more comfortable when
you're here, it's a different ball; it's a different arena.  
  
We did come over and shoot around ahead of time and it didn't seem to make a
difference yesterday. It's really made a difference today.  
  
But that's the way we've been a little bit. There's one guy, like today it was
-- Duncan has been on fire for about a month. But Muhammad couldn't make them
yesterday.  
  
J.P. couldn't make them yesterday. And Duncan made just enough. Today there
were several people doing that. So been having a lot of shooters for a lot of
years. You try to stay calm and they'll come back to the mean all the time.  
  
Q. Coach Miles commended your defensive effort today, specifically
closing out ball screen defense, what are you looking to carry over from today
into tomorrow's game?  
COACH BEILEIN: Michigan State's got a tremendous ball screen offense as well
as some -- Tom's got tremendous system of things countering off each other,
unless they've changed since the last time we played them.  
  
But one of the big things is you've got to be able to guard the ball screen.
Moe has been really exceptional at that. That was not his strength for two
years. He's really impacting people. And getting -- recovering back to his
man. So it's going to be a challenge again tomorrow. But we're better
defensively than we were back then. But they're probably better offensively.
So who knows what's going to happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Rutgers - 76, Indiana - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
COACH MILLER: Congratulations to Rutgers. They fought their way out of a
really deep hole early. And I thought our team was really doing a nice job.
But they continued to fight it through. And got away from us a little bit in
terms of composure on both ends.  
  
And halftime felt a little bit different. And the confidence that they
continued to play with throughout the rest of the game, you know, really was
the difference. They were more forceful in a lot of areas. They took things
away from us. And we really just at the end of the day didn't have an answer
for guarding the ball and just doing some things that we were doing really
well for a long time.  
  
So you've got to give them credit. On this stage you're playing for a lot. And
I thought they played with a lot of confidence. For our guys, I'm really
disappointed. Wish we could have done a better job. They gave everything they
had all season long through a lot of ups and downs. Saw a lot of guys grow
throughout the course of the year and do some things that a lot of people
probably didn't anticipate. From that standpoint I'm proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Robert, you guys were doing so well in the first 10, 12 minutes. Did
you guys relax a little bit at 24-8 or what do you think really started the
downfall tonight?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I think we didn't do a good enough job of keeping our foot on
the gas once we had them down in that type of situation, and they responded
and we never did.  
  
Q. Juwan, you guys came out in the second half and you eventually got it
back and tied it. They came down and hit a big shot after that. Was it just
one of those things where you couldn't make enough shots?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I think it just comes down to us not getting enough stops, not
so much shooting because if we were getting stops we would have got out and
our offense would have been flourishing, but we didn't get those.  
  
Q. Maybe you talked about it a little bit there, but you've been really
good in close games this season in terms of executing in key moments. But
maybe what wasn't getting you guys over the line in some key positions there
in the second half, do you think?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I just think we weren't as sharp as we needed to be down the
stretch. And we never really got over that hump where we strung stops together
and buckets with those.  
  
Q. Rob, what was it about Sanders that made him so tough to defend?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: You know, he was really good at getting to his right hand, and
that's something we talked about. And when we allowed him to do that, he
really hurt us. And I don't think us guards did a good enough job of taking
that away from him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I know you just lost, but I'm wondering if you had any thoughts on
what occurred with your brother today?  
COACH MILLER: No thoughts at all, no thoughts at all about what's going on out
there. He is my brother, and that's big. It's my family. And anything that's
discussed with them about us is about family and stays within that. But no
thoughts on what's going on in terms of other than thinking about them.  
  
Q. After you had that stretch of the second half, I think 10 or 11
minutes you were only able to make one field goal. Was it guys just not taking
good shots, not communicating? What do you think was going on with the offense
in the second half?  
COACH MILLER: I thought they did a great job of establishing that they weren't
going to let Juwan catch the ball. And usually we can play through him. This
team really relies on being able to play through him.  
  
And if you look at how difficult they made him catch the ball, how hard it was
for him to play in space, it just became a lot harder for our team to not be
able to play through him. That's one. And then I thought early in the first
half when we had things going in a good direction, we had some shot-selection
issues that didn't help us.  
  
And the shot selection in the first half sort of took its toll on us when you
could have extended the lead or at least given yourself a chance to play
comfortably.  
  
But late in the game, and as we tried to play and we needed to run offense,
they eliminated what I thought was our ability to run through Juwan. And after
that, our guards -- and we needed to be able to make some plays for others and
that wasn't happening. And give them credit. I thought they were in the now. I
thought they used great quickness. They played extremely hard. They made
things challenged.  
  
But when you're not able to play inside out and we're not able to establish
our best player, that's when it comes back on me. We have to figure out a
better way to do it because he didn't have the impact in the game, even with
15 and nine that he usually has in the game.  
  
Q. They shot 68 percent in the second half. That included only four
attempts from 3-point range. Did it feel as though you were almost swimming
against the current a little bit there? And how would you assess your level of
satisfaction with your team's defense in the final 20 minutes?  
COACH MILLER: Well, I mean, you can start with probably the first 12 and say
that's who we've been. We had a great connection on the floor. And then I
thought our offense sort of gave them some easy ones on the break --
turnovers, run-outs. They started to get a little bit of confidence. The lead
shrunk.  
  
And in the second half we were not able to stop the ball. We just couldn't.
Whether it was Sanders at the basket. I thought Deshawn Freeman really hurt us
throughout the game with his ability to play off the lane and drive.  
  
They were able to do some things one-on-one that we just didn't have an answer
for for the first time in a long time. We just couldn't answer the bell. 68
percent from the floor in the second half, allowing them to shoot 58 for the
game and in all reality still be in kind of in the game for the most part was
just disappointing.  
  
I thought just the tougher team won tonight. And at this time of year you
don't expect to have that happen. But we just didn't get the job done in
enough areas and we didn't respond like we have been responding when we needed
to.  
  
But I give them credit. If you look at Corey Sanders' game tonight, they took
away the help. They let him play one-on-one, and I thought he did a great job
of getting down hill, also hit some tough ones but that's back-to-back games
he's done that. He's a tough guy to stop one-on-one and he got going.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this is the end of the year, or do you feel like
this is still a team that could get an NIT berth?  
COACH MILLER: I would be surprised. I would be surprised if there's postseason
on the horizon for us, even with a sixth-place finish in the Big Ten, I would
be surprised. If something came along the line we would be really excited
because I think this team likes to play with one another and they're a group
that's worked hard to improve, and as improved as any team I've been around to
be honest with you in terms of where we started and finished. I'd be surprised
and if they threw one our way, I'm sure we'd be ready but I would be
surprised.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, is there any thought beyond the NIT or --  
COACH MILLER: No.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2018

  

### [Kevin Huerter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32972)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 59, Maryland - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I felt like we were fighting uphill all night. We had the
lead 24-23, that was the only time we had the lead. We tied it a bunch of
times. Really came down to two things: We fouled too darn much and we couldn't
get a rebound when we had to get a rebound.  
  
And I thought we tried hard. I thought we competed. I thought we did a great
job on Happ who is absolutely a terrific player. Didn't get a rebound. And so
disappointed in the outcome. I thought our guys were dialed in a little bit
more, especially defensively today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, what were you hoping for there on the inbound at the end? I
know you guys were wary of Iverson's defensive rep.  
COACH TURGEON: Not what happened. That's not what we wanted. We ran the play
-- had a guy run the play wrong. So not what we wanted.  
  
Q. Is it surprising that that was, something like that would happen so
late in the season?  
COACH TURGEON: It's disappointing, yeah. Disappointing. But it's
disappointing.  
  
Q. In terms of trying to get the lead, you had a number of chances. Do
you think like in a game like this getting the lead would have, with your
team, made a difference, even a small lead?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, it would have been nice. We just couldn't get stops. And
I think for the most part our defense was pretty good. We just fouled too
much. I thought Davison made a really tough shot on the baseline. I think
another one they made was another tough shot. But we just fouled them too
much.  
  
Getting the lead would have been nice, but we just couldn't get it. Whether it
was a rebound or a missed shot or whatever it was, we just couldn't get it.
It's kind of the way the year's gone.  
  
Q. What was that last huddle like? Did it seem like you guys were going
to -- you being down three, going to finally break through?  
COACH TURGEON: No, because they only had five team fouls and we had 12. So we
knew they were going to foul us, which makes it -- takes more time off the
clock. So you were hoping. Really, a minute 22 you were hoping you'd get a
rebound. That's what you were hoping, when the score is tied, and have a
chance to take the lead.  
  
We gave them two offensive rebounds and they finally scored and then missed a
free throw. Had a chance to tie it again with 8.9 or whatever that was and we
missed a free throw.  
  
Q. In terms of the start of the second half, you were talking about
fighting uphill, is that what you were talking about when they jumped out
seven right at the beginning?  
COACH TURGEON: I just felt like we were always behind the whole time. We never
took the lead. Whether it was fouls, them shooting more free throws or
whatever it was, I just felt like we were fighting uphill all day. It is what
it is. It would have been nice to get the lead. Might have helped.  
  
Q. Defensive effort against Ethan Happ, excellent today. Did you change
a rotation. Saw a lot of guys flying at him?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, we've gotten better at doubling the post. Our timing was
better. And I think we made him work harder to catch it. And once he caught
it, I think our timing was better and our rotations were better tonight in it.
But obviously we just didn't get enough stops.  
  
Q. Kevin, just the quickness of Iverson to make that steal on that last
play, were you aware that he was that close to you?  
KEVIN HUERTER: I was. Unfortunately, it's a play that we were supposed to be
running that I wasn't the look, so I wasn't really expecting the ball. And
Dion taking it out, had to get the ball in and didn't have a timeout. When it
broke down, I should have tried harder to get open.  
  
Q. During those last free throws, looked like Ethan Happ was talking to
the officials, buying time. What was going through your head as you were
waiting to get the ball?  
KEVIN HUERTER: I didn't know why we weren't shooting yet. I don't know what
was happening under the basket. But I'm not going to say too much. I just
don't know why I wasn't shooting, and I was getting frustrated, just that I
was getting taken out of rhythm.  
  
But that's not an excuse for missing. I just didn't know why I wasn't shooting
the ball. I don't know why it took so long to get the ball.  
  
Q. Some of the games this year where you've fallen behind early in the
second half, come back, and then couldn't make the plays down the stretch. Did
this feel the same, or did you think it was going to be different at the
end?  
KEVIN HUERTER: Felt different. We were making plays. We were kind of going
back and forth. We never got over the hump, never made the shot to go up.  
  
But similar thing happened that's been happening all year. Coach Turgeon is
going to take a lot of heat for it. Everybody is going to point to him;
everyone's going to look at him.  
  
I'm sure he probably took the blame up here a couple of minutes ago. But Coach
Turgeon doesn't miss rebounds; Coach Turgeon doesn't miss a free throw. Coach
Turgeon doesn't throw the ball away. Coach Turgeon doesn't execute plays when
we're supposed to execute plays that we practiced multiple times. That's all
on the players.  
  
And so this loss is on everybody, especially the players, because we didn't
make the plays down in the last minute 12 seconds to win the game. So
everybody can say what they want about him, but we didn't make plays for him.  
  
Q. Did Mark talk about what you guys are going to do the next week,
whether it's wait for the NIT or just what -- how hard is it going to be to
wait for the next week, just about the postseason and everything like that?  
KEVIN HUERTER: We haven't gotten to talking about that. We really don't know
what's going to happen.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2018

  

### [Deshawn Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32827)

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

### [Corey Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32917)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Rutgers - 76, Indiana - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could start with an opening statement.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: Thank you for coming and staying late tonight. Just real proud
day. These guys kept fighting. I'm real happy for Rutgers Nation. Happy for
these two guys. All of our seniors. Two stepped up, made big plays. We kind of
just hung around and we toughed it out. It was an exciting game. Rutgers
Nation got excited, made it loud and proud.  
  
A great day today for us, and we get 40 more. So we're excited about that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. What was the -- was there a moment that turned it around, a play, a
sequence? What started the charge for you guys in the first half?  
COREY SANDERS: I think it was De's steal. I think he had a turn around steal.
Might have missed a layup but I just got things going. From that point on the
defense buckled down from that timeout that we had. And our offense caught up
-- like Coach always said, let our defense come and offense catch up. And we
were able to go on a run.  
  
Q. Deshawn, when you were doing your ESPN interview, I saw fans cheering
your name. One Rutgers fan said, they said Rutgers didn't belong in the Big
Ten. How does that make you feel? And do you feel like you made a statement by
winning these two games that you guys really do belong in this league?  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that at all, so no comment.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. Both of you had amazing an game tonight. You played with so much
tenacity and excitement that even the crowd was even behind you. Do you feel
that that was a motivating factor for you guys to win tonight?  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: Yeah, gotta give credit to the Rutgers fan section. That was
amazing tonight. I gotta give a lot of credit to them.  
  
COREY SANDERS: It was great playing at home, especially for the seniors. They
get to come, the parents get to come and stuff and see them play. We had a lot
of people come from different places. Deshawn's family came, my family came.  
  
Just to have people that support you like that, especially in the New York
area, we've got a lot of alumni. Just to have the fans come out there and be
behind us, just a great feeling, and it helps us get more amped up for the
game and try to win.  
  
Q. How does the culture of Rutgers University changed -- it's been like
a number of coaching changes -- this right here is a local guy, comes in, puts
the staple in the Rutgers program. How is the culture down in Piscataway
changed since Coach Pikiell has taken over?  
COREY SANDERS: It's just a different type of motto, different type of team,
different type of chemistry than we had before. When Coach comes in he's
always working hard, just makes you want to work hard. You always want to
match his energy.  
  
If you see Coach in practice you'll be, like, wow, like, wow, this man really
cares. That's one thing that stuck with me for the first day he brought me in.
A lot of things have changed about this program. We're still rebuilding, we're
going to keep trying to become one of those programs, try to get to the top.  
  
Q. Deshawn, just in terms of the last few games of the regular season
you faced some adversity, started coming off the bench. How have you
persevered and tonight when the team really needed someone to step up, you
really carried them down, like the start of the game and got them going? What
has been your mindset in just keeping moving forward?  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: I didn't let that affect me at all. Eugene came -- Eugene
started. He did a really good job. So after Eugene, Coach kind of put me in
the game, just got me going.  
  
Q. What was that feeling like leaving the court? You have all the
Rutgers fans there. You're the 14th seed, now getting a chance to play Friday
night quarterfinals at the Garden against the eighth-ranked team in the
country. What did it feel like tonight walking off the court?  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: It felt good. Last year, yesterday, we've been there before.
Tonight we haven't been there. So it felt amazing. Felt amazing.  
  
COREY SANDERS: Unfinished business.  
  
Q. For either of you, the first time you played Purdue they won pretty
easily. The second time, though, you guys gave them all they could handle in
New Jersey. So did that give you any more confidence that second time around
that this is the team that you can compete against?  
COREY SANDERS: Yeah, kind of got a little strategy for them. Coaches drew up a
great game plan. I'm sure we're going to get back to that tomorrow. So the
game you see at Rutgers, trying to make that same game at the Garden, make it
very interesting and see if we can come out with the W.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. For people who just tuned in to Rutgers basketball tonight around the
country, what do they say about your team?  
COACH PIKIELL: I hope the last two years you saw a team that fights and
competes. And you certainly saw that tonight against a program that I have
tremendous respect for, and Coach Miller does an unbelievable job. And they
have very good players and tradition and all that.  
  
But they stayed the course, and it's tough when you're building a program, but
like I said last night, I'm very confident in what we're doing here. We're
doing it with great kids. These two guys had great chemistry today and great
leadership. And we did something special I knew we could do. And it was nice
to do it here at Madison Square Garden.  
  
Q. The Big Ten purists per se were not happy that the tournament was
moved to the Garden. Do you feel like playing on your home court you guys are
sending a message to the conference?  
COACH PIKIELL: I don't worry about what other people think. It's a great venue
here, maybe the best venue in the world. People love New York. It's great to
spread the great word of what a great league it is with great coaches to the
biggest media market in the world.  
  
So this is great for the league. And I think a lot of people are learning how
good and exciting basketball is played in this league and how many good,
quality teams there are from 1 to 14. So I'm hoping they're getting a great
feel for that.  
  
Q. Down 24-8, kind of seemed like deja vu from last year in the second
round. Was there anything that you said to the team in the huddle or was there
a moment where you felt like things just clicked and that's when the
turnaround started?  
COACH PIKIELL: We brought our subs in, and I thought De really gave us
terrific energy. Geo Baker, coming off the flu, had great minutes, too. I told
the guys I believe in what we do, I believe in our defense, I believe in our
players. We just have to stay the course.  
  
These games are not easy. Any of them you're going to be up sometimes and down
sometimes, go through scoring droughts, defensive droughts, just gotta
continue to stay the course. They did tonight. I'm really proud. Once we got
the lead we did a really good job of keeping it. And made our free throws down
the stretch.  
  
And Corey was terrific again. I think he has something to prove here. And he's
a good, really good player, and I think this is a great venue for him to
showcase that.  
  
Q. What do you think the significance for your program is of these last
two games?  
COACH PIKIELL: Well, I mean, just steps in the building process. We have a lot
of tremendous things going on at Rutgers, we really do. We just got a $15
million donation by the Rodkins to build a student academic center. We're
building a new practice facility. It's a great university with great people
and great leadership.  
  
There's a lot of good things happening at Rutgers. And I'm proud to be the
coach and proud to play a little role in it. But the players are what make it
special. Like, they could have left two years ago. They stayed the course.
They believed in what we're doing, and they're getting rewarded for that now.  
  
And they've gotten better. Freshmen -- Issa has gotten better. Eugene Omoruyi
has gotten better. The things that I told them we're going to here we're
doing, and it's going to be better and better days ahead for Rutgers
University.  
  
Q. Coach, every game your team won this year before yesterday was at
home. How similar has this environment, the preparation for this been in
comparison to playing at home? And why do your players thrive in that
scenario?  
COACH PIKIELL: I will tell you we played the toughest schedule in the Big Ten.
So we played every good team in this league twice. Played a lot of good teams
once. We've been through the wars and these guys have battled through it, on
the road, home, neutral site.  
  
I think this is exciting to us because these are our fans and Rutgers Nation
right down the road, but this is the world's most famous arena, too.  
  
So we got off to that good start yesterday. Got it rolling a little bit today,
and hopefully we're going to play a great Purdue team -- tremendous respect,
senior-laden, really good coach -- tomorrow. I'm excited we'll get a chance to
play again.  
  
Q. You were probably the biggest underdog of all the Big Ten teams and
probably the favorite now, favorite underdog.  
COACH PIKIELL: Favorite. Just leave it at that. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. And you probably have the state of New Jersey and perhaps the city of
New York behind you. What do you like your chances against Purdue and perhaps
the tournament?  
COACH PIKIELL: I'll tell you, never get caught up in the numbers. I told our
guys this is a new season a couple days ago. And there's no number. Everyone's
the same. Just gotta keep winning. And been able to do that.  
  
And I hope we get all of New Jersey and all of New York really helping us out
because I know our guys love playing in front of a lot of people. But those
numbers next to your name don't mean anything.  
  
I used to be in a one-bid league where you could win 20 games in a row during
the regular season, nobody cares. You've got to win the tournament. It's a lot
like what I'm used to for my whole career. You have to have a great weekend
and we've had a couple of good days. So hopefully we can make it a great
weekend.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2018

  

### [Brad Davison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34697)

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Ethan Happ](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30815)

### [Khalil Iverson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34698)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 59, Maryland - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask coach for an opening statement.  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously hard-fought game. Extremely happy for our guys the way
they responded throughout the back half of the season here and they just
continue to get better and better. And I think today's game was kind of a
epitome or microcosm of how we've grown when you only shoot 30 percent for the
game and you get to the line that many times and do the job defensively that
we did, take care of the ball, rebound the ball the way we rebounded. It's a
credit to these guys to my right and also the guys back in the locker room.
How they've grown over the last month has been fun to watch and hopefully
we've got a lot more basketball yet to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Speaking of that growth over the past month, seems like you guys have
figured out how to win close games during that stretch, too. What's been the
biggest difference there how are you doing it today.  
BRAD DAVISON: I think it's just buying into the little things that Coach has
been preaching all year. I think, especially at the end of this game the
possessions are magnified. When you do things right those final possessions
you can really turn things around and kind of everyone sticks together and we
can do it at the end.  
  
ETHAN HAPP: Brad said it well, but also we've got guys knocking down shots.
Brevin has been clutch and at the end of games Brad hit a couple ones. That
helps, too.  
  
KHALIL IVERSON: I think Brad said it well. I think we've been playing together
for longer stretches. (Indiscernible).  
  
Q. You get Michigan State next. Obviously you just played them the other
day. I think, Brad, you might have mentioned losing to them the other day
doesn't really matter because this week is a bigger deal for that. I guess
what is your mindset knowing that you just saw them, you played them tough?
You feel like this is a game you guys can win going into tomorrow?  
KHALIL IVERSON: For sure we just played these guys and we went toe to toe with
them, punch for punch. I personally figure we just have to string together an
entire game for 40 minutes and just staying toe to toe with them like we did
last game. I know we'll be ready for them.  
  
Q. How are you guys able to maintain things defensively when you're
struggling offensively and shooting 36 percent from the field.  
ETHAN HAPP: We didn't do a great job of it, but try and keep the ball out of
the paint and limit their open 3s is something that we always work on here at
Wisconsin. But I think just being tough. You saw Brevin flying around,
(indiscernible) on the ball and the same with Khalil.  
  
Q. Khalil, during that final possession were you surprised by what you
saw? Seemed like Maryland was confused trying to get the ball in. I guess what
did you see there?  
KHALIL IVERSON: Looked like they probably tried to get the ball to Huerter.
When he came off like the down screen he just kind of stopped. Everybody was
looking around. Guy throwing the ball in just threw the ball in
(indiscernible).  
  
Q. Looking at the matchup with Miles Bridges, what did you do
effectively against him last time and what do you want to do against him this
time?  
KHALIL IVERSON: Just last game I think we kept him -- we contained him from
the perimeter, really good outside shooter. And he got a dunk the first play
of the game, but I think we also played defense as a whole and we kind of cut
off those driving lanes and things like that that usually get him going. It
wasn't just one guy playing a one-on-one, it was the whole team. That's how we
stop a guy like that.  
  
Q. What were you expecting them to do in terms of players? Were you
trying to just deny Huerter and Cowan on that last possession?  
COACH GARD: No, we had debated whether we were going to foul or not. Up three
and we decided not to, or I decided not to. So we were going to play it out.
Khalil made a heck of a play. Made a read on the pass that maybe got -- have
to look at the film because I was watching obviously some stuff off the ball,
too -- but we happened to get a hand on the ball, get a deflection, and go
knock down two free throws. So that was a good play on his part.  
  
Q. What was your game plan against Maryland? Was it based on what you
saw against them when they played Michigan last week, kind of like very
similar first half with them where they could not score?  
COACH GARD: Well, we couldn't either. So I think obviously you watch other
teams, but you still rely on your philosophy and your game plan. I thought it
was very similar to how we played at Maryland. Thought we were a little better
down the stretch today than what we were there. And we did -- even though
Huerter and Cowan got loose on us a couple times, I thought we were better
defensively keeping the ball out of the paint, made it a little bit harder for
them.  
  
And we were more aggressive on the glass, did a better job rebounding. And
obviously getting to the free-throw line was big, when you can get there 24
times. Those were things that -- and we turned the ball over less.  
  
When you get to the foul line and you're a little better defensively and you
don't turn the ball over, your odds shoot back in your favor.  
  
Q. With the quick turnaround in a tournament setting like this, does it
help you that you've just played Michigan State a few days ago so prep might
not be --  
COACH GARD: Obviously, yeah, it's the last game before we got to today that we
had. So it's fresh in everybody's mind. Don't have to dig back through
previous games. But that game was Sunday and tomorrow's will be a different
game. They're a terrific team.  
  
They're two deep at every position. Very talented. Obviously been playing
really well. So we know we'll have to play really, really well.  
  
Q. Going back to that game and what you did defensively against Miles
Bridges, how critical is that to shut him down and make guys be -- do you have
just to expect him to do something?  
COACH GARD: I don't know if we -- I mean, we got him to miss some shots. But
they had -- Ward was doing a lot of good things inside. Jackson was a handful.
Jackson really affected the game defensively I thought. And I think the one
that nobody talks about as much is what the evolution and growth of Cassius
Winston, how he's involved and that was him going 6-for-6 from 3 and hitting
some tough shots. Some were wide open, but some were tougher. That was the
difference.  
  
But you can't focus just on one guy with that team, just like hopefully you
can't focus with one guy on our team. It takes a group effort like Khalil
mentioned in terms of what we need to do. It won't be just about Miles
Bridges. They've got a locker room full of really good players.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 1, 2018

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

### [Scottie Lindsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32974)

### [Bryant McIntosh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28555)

### [Dererk Pardon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33132)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State - 65, Northwestern - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH COLLINS: It's always a tough night when your season ends. And I've been
lucky to coach these guys sitting next to me over the last four years. And I
couldn't have been more proud of the fight that we showed, undermanned, banged
up. And we had every reason, even early in the second half, we had every
reason to kind of lay down when they hit us with a little spurt. But that's
not who these guys have been. I'm not surprised. We kept fighting.  
  
We gave ourselves a chance, and then give Penn State credit, the under-4
timeout, it's a one-point game, they made two big 3s and got a couple of
stops. They were able to get a charge on Scottie and hit two big 3s to get it
to seven which was the separation in the game.  
  
So I thought we played incredibly hard. I thought we gave ourselves a chance.
They're a tough team to play against. Terrifically talented. Obviously Tony
Carr is a great player and showed that with his 3-point shooting.  
  
Although I'm disappointed to lose the game, I'm more disappointed I won't get
a chance to coach these guys anymore.  
  
Q. Bryant and Scottie, Chris is choked up, he's emotional. What's it
like to hear him and what emotions are going through you now?  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: Kind of raw right now. I don't really know how to feel.
Obviously this is not how we wanted the season to end. So I think we're all a
little bit emotional.  
  
But like Coach said, I appreciate all the guys fighting until the end, even
everything didn't go the way it was supposed to or how we planned.  
  
BRYANT MCINTOSH: Obviously it's disappointing how the season ends. Every year
there's only one team that, as seniors, that you can go out as winners.
Everybody else, you generally lose. There's not a lot of -- to end your
career, you don't usually end up winning.  
  
Obviously we didn't want to end it this early. It's the start of March. Not
what we envisioned when we started the season. But I think all of us are just
very emotional and upset that this is the last time we get to put on the
jersey.  
  
Q. Dererk, you and Barret were very productive on the interior today.
What allowed you two to be so successful?  
DERERK PARDON: I think Coach Collins put in a good offense to help us get in
our spots where we practiced, so just getting the touches, our teammates saw
it and I think that put us in good position to score the ball.  
  
Q. Dererk, you're going to be a senior next year. What lessons have you
learned this year and how will you apply that going forward?  
DERERK PARDON: First off, I want to thank the seniors for everything they've
done for the program, also me, taking me under their wings and just preparing
me to be a senior, be a senior and I just want to thank them from the bottom
of my heart.  
  
And a lot of lessons was learned. We've been through a lot of ups and downs,
just to stay level-headed and always put the work in and just be ready for the
next obstacle.  
  
Q. Bryant, the second half, I think, for the first 13 minutes Tony Carr
didn't score. What happened at the end where he just kind of picked it up? Did
he just feel it or what?  
BRYANT MCINTOSH: They went to some of their favorite action and just got him
in ball screens. And he obviously knew it was winning time, and he stepped up
and got aggressive offensively and was just looking to make plays. To his
credit, he did.  
  
Q. Barret obviously showed a lot of life there. Why did you decide to
start him and what did you think of his game?  
COACH COLLINS: He played very well in our last game against Iowa. We had a big
deficit in that game. And I thought he came in and just gave us a nice boost
of energy. And I noticed that his size was a factor in the game, especially
when he was with Dererk.  
  
I think our main goal was we had a couple of days to figure out how can we win
the game? And that's how I always approach it. Like, what can we do with what
we're doing -- we have no Vic Law, Bryant is hurting. Like, what can we do to
give ourselves a chance to win?  
  
And I just felt like going with the two big guys playing a power game with
Bryant being hurt with his shoulder and not having Vic would, especially with
Watkins not playing, I thought it would give us a chance to maybe cause some
problems for them.  
  
I thought those guys played great together. I'm really proud of Barret.
Throughout the course of the year he had his ups and downs, and he finished
the year really strong, which I told him in the locker room afterwards should
be a great motivator for him heading into the offseason now in the spring.  
  
Q. Do you think that Scottie's fouling out with three minutes left sort
of took the air out of the team that led to that Penn State run?  
COACH COLLINS: It was a big play, yeah, it was a big play. And they're good
officials. So he left his feet. I'd have to see a replay. I'm not sure if it
was a charge or not. But that's what was called. And when you're only playing
seven guys, you know, and your leading scorer goes out in the last four
minutes in a four-point game, it's going to affect the team.  
  
I think we tried to keep fighting. But I think they came down then and Carr
hit a big three, long three, late in the clock. It was still a four-point
game. When he hit that three to get it to seven and we didn't come down and we
didn't score, that's when I noticed our guys, the wind in our sails start to
go a little bit.  
  
Q. Seemed like a recurring theme this year, you'd be right there at the
end and the other team would pull away. Do you think that was because Bryant
was banged up or what might be some other factors for that?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, we have to be better in those situations. I don't want to
put it on one guy. But I mean, yeah, the last few games kind of makeshift,
different kinds of guys handling the ball and trying to figure out where to go
to late in the games.  
  
That's what you do at the games, like what Penn State do, you play to Tony
Carr and you play through him and he makes plays. This season we didn't take
advantage of those opportunities. We had our chances. We had a stretch there
in the middle of the league, we were 6-6 and we lost three or four games in a
row that were right there for the taking.  
  
I think when we went through that stretch we lost confidence then we started
losing players and bodies and made it tough.  
  
But, again, I thought our guys' fight tonight -- I wasn't surprised and I was
hoping this wasn't going to be the case -- but a lot of teams get to this
point and they don't see a lot of hope, and you kind of just fade to black and
you want the season to be over.  
  
And I was proud that our guys didn't do that. I thought we came to fight. I
thought we came to win. I thought we laid it on the floor, and Penn State just
made more plays in the last four minutes. It was a one-point game, we're
shooting a one and one to go up one. And I think we had one field goal the
rest of the game.  
  
So there's no question that's got to be something as we move forward, closing
out games has got to be a focus of ours if we want to get back to where we
want to go in this conference.  
  
Q. This is -- your first recruiting class is done essentially. Despite
the hardships, have you had a chance to put it in perspective what those guys
have accomplished in the last four years?  
COACH COLLINS: Absolutely, and I get it. It's always the focus on the now and
the present. And none of us are happy about how our season went. None of us
are excited about what we did this year. We're all very disappointed that we
didn't have a better season.  
  
But that being said, I told these guys in the locker room what they've
accomplished over a four-year period is incredible. I mean, back-to-back
20-win seasons, getting to the Big Ten semifinals last year and the
tournament, going to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 70-whatever
years, winning an NCAA Tournament game.  
  
There's so many things that these guys, the notches on their belts, that they
need to be proud of. And it stings right now because you always remember the
moment you're in, but I'm confident, in time, that these guys will be
extremely proud of what they accomplished.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2018

  

### [Tony Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32878)

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Shep Garner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28486)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State - 65, Northwestern - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: Really proud of this team. We played without Mike. And we
heard all the noise. And these guys really responded and stepped up, played
really good Penn State basketball.  
  
We defended and rebounded when we had to for most of the game. But really at
the end, the last four minutes when we went on that run, just everybody really
buckled down and got some stops there.  
  
And then on the offensive end, obviously these two guys played terrific
basketball. But they stayed in that zone and dared us. And these guys stepped
up to the challenge.  
  
I thought we really did a nice job sharing the ball but more importantly we
didn't turn it over. I thought we did a good job of playing small and
rebounding the ball, because at Northwestern they had, if I recall, 17 second-
chance points and today it was only 11. So that's big when you're playing the
lineups that we are.  
  
So really proud of this group. For us to get to 20 wins, just shows you where
these players are taking this program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How do you like Madison Square Garden, bright light, big city? Seems
like you're handling it pretty well. Tony, had a little flagger there at the
end of the game when you hit the second 3 in a row?  
TONY CARR: We definitely love playing here. Madison Square Garden is a great
gym. It's every child's dream to play here. And just for us to be playing a
Big Ten Tournament for a great university like Penn State is great. We just
want to keep it going.  
  
SHEP GARNER: It's always great to play in New York. I love playing here.
Madison Square Garden is a great arena. A lot of history here. So it's always
good to get a win here.  
  
Q. Talk about the last four minutes and being able to close out a game
like this that was close all the way down to the last four.  
SHEP GARNER: Like Coach said, we buckled down on the defensive end. We knew
that that was going to win the game for us. Defending and rebounding is our
staple. And that's what we did at that stretch of the game. We knew we needed
it. That led to easy offense for us.  
  
TONY CARR: We definitely know all these games are going to be a possession
game. So we just want to buckle down, like Shep said, and Coach always
preaches about (indiscernible) and rebound, and that's what we did down the
stretch.  
  
Q. What can you guys take away from the two games you guys played
against Ohio State as you get ready to play them again?  
TONY CARR: We just want to defend and rebound like we did those past two
games. To be honest, I haven't thought about it. I just want to celebrate this
with my team and my coaches. We earned it and we'll talk about that tomorrow.  
  
SHEP GARNER: I mean, those games, it was in the regular season. This is a
brand new season for everyone. So we're going to enjoy this game tonight,
focus on Ohio State tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tony, 19 wins is nice, but you had lost three in a row coming into
this one. Down the stretch, were you sensing if we don't win this, we not only
will be out of the tournament, maybe out of the NCAA as well?  
TONY CARR: I don't think like that. I always think positive thoughts. You
think positive thoughts, positive outcomes come out. And I was just thinking
going to take the game one play at a time. I wasn't thinking about the
outcomes or if we lose this or if we win this. I just want to play basketball.  
  
Q. With Northwestern going with that zone, how much did you think that
3-point shooting was going to be a factor throughout the game?  
SHEP GARNER: We knew we would have to hit a couple of shots for them to come
out and guard us and create some lanes. But they stayed in the zone. They
stayed in it.  
  
And they made it tough for us. They're led by seniors. They're a great team,
great coach. And they made it tough for us tonight.  
  
TONY CARR: It's definitely tough to play against the zone for 40 minutes. But
we have great shooters like Shep, Josh and myself. And that kind of loosened
the zone up for us, and in the second half for us to get down hill and
penetrate and find some easy shots.  
  
Q. You said that you -- you reference that we heard the noise that was
out there. So what was the noise? And to the question that Tony was asked,
too, about what the scheme means in terms of what you're trying to do going
forward. How did you feel about it?  
COACH CHAMBERS: The noise is can you win without Mike Watkins. The naysayers
thought we were slumping and lost our confidence and not sure if we could do
it. And we believed in ourselves. And I thought we threw some great lineups
out there and played small.  
  
I thought Johnny Harrar did a great job for a freshman. To throw him in his
first career start at the Garden at the Big Ten Tournament, I thought he
handled himself well.  
  
But you saw Julian Moore's production. He did some good things. Huge block.
Seniors stepped up.  
  
Shep Garner, that charge to foul out Scottie Lindsey, nobody is even talking
about that. That was a huge swing play for us.  
  
Those guys did some really great things down the stretch. I was really proud
because I played some different lineups and different guys at different spots.
They really responded.  
  
Q. The 3-point shot, couple years ago -- that was 45 percent from 3
tonight. Couple years ago that wasn't always the case for you guys. Could you
talk about the development of guys like Josh from his freshman year to now;
Tony jumped from last year to this year from behind the line?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Shep -- Shep shot 32 last year. Now he's well above 40. I
think it's player development. I think it's the effort that they put into it.
I give a lot of credit to the players. Then you give credit to your staff for
helping these guys along their journey. And just staying positive.  
  
That's the other thing we do. We try to be positive. They're never going to
look at me after a bad shot. They're never going to look at me if it's a poor
decision.  
  
They know, on the offensive end, they're going to have some freedoms, as long
as they're buying in, sharing the ball, playing to our concepts. We've got to
defend, rebound and play hard and we've got to compete on the other end.  
  
I think because you give them that freedom and that confidence, shots are
going to go in.  
  
Q. With that charge by Shep, how does that represent the kind of player
that he is and being one of your lone seniors?  
COACH CHAMBERS: He embodies what a Penn State player is. That's Penn State
basketball, to take a big-time charge at that point of the game where it could
go either way. And he put his body on the line for his teammates, which is
critical. That's what seniors do. That's what leaders do. But that also shows
you where this program is headed.  
  
We're willing to make those winning plays. That's what I told them in the
huddle, that's a winning play. And the huddle was absolutely outstanding, the
energy and juice that we had in that huddle is terrific.  
  
Q. You were talking about progression and where the team's going. Talk
about being able to close out a tight game like this, this isn't something
that has always been able to happen in past games, and an environment like
this and coming down to it and being able to finish of strong and seeing the
Final Four.  
COACH CHAMBERS: Good question. Early on, we didn't finish these games. But I
think we learned from those setbacks. We learned from those experiences and we
grew from them. We still have sophomores leading us.  
  
So with every little failure, you're going to get a little bit better and
you're going to learn from it. And I think they did.  
  
Even though Northwestern went up there, I didn't see any panic in the huddle.
I saw guys completely dialed in, focused on the next possession. And that
takes a long time to do.  
  
So you know what encourages me about this group is we can still get a lot
better, and it's going to be fun coaching them.  
  
Q. Question about the tournament, do you talk about that elephant in the
room; that we need to win these games to get ourselves back in this
conversation?  
COACH CHAMBERS: No. You know the fabric I'm from, we don't talk about that. We
talk about getting better. We talk about next game. We talk about next
practice. We talk about next possession. We talk about every rep matters.  
  
Why would I want to put that pressure on these kids? Everybody else is doing
it. Social media is doing it. I just want to try to get these kids to the
point where they're maximizing their potential.  
  
Q. You've obviously had success against Ohio State this season. I know
it's a new part of the season, tournament play is different. But as you
prepare for a third matchup against a team like that, what's the confidence
level like in a matchup like that and how do you approach playing a team that,
they lost three times in the conference and you gave them two of them?  
COACH CHAMBERS: It goes back to what Shep said. Those games are in the past.
And Ohio State finished the season really strong. So they're a very confident
bunch as well.  
  
I think about the game at Indiana with the big 3 from C.J. This is a new
slate, new game. We've got to prepare for everything. I'll enjoy this for the
next I don't know 30 minutes we'll start working on Ohio State. We're going to
throw the records out and be ready to compete against a very well-coached team
in Chris Holtmann.  
  
Q. How long do you continue to build off the momentum you had from
tonight going into round three against Ohio State?  
COACH CHAMBERS: We'll watch film at some point tomorrow. I'll let them see
some successes because I want my team to be positive, upbeat and confident.
Just really try to get better. That's our goal, try to get better. Don't worry
about outcomes, like Tony said. We don't talk about outcomes. We talk about
just getting better and control what we can control.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 77, Iowa - 71 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach McCaffery.  
  
Q. What did you see different from the defense today than yesterday
against Illinois that gave you guys trouble shooting in the second half?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Illinois plays such a unique style you can't really compare
them with anybody. I thought they -- you know, they were up into us, our key
guys, like you would expect.  
  
They're long. They're athletic. They've got veteran guys. And they were
physical and moved their feet. I don't think there was anything tricky. Just
good, solid, fundamental defense, which you would expect from one of John's
teams.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 1, 2018

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Charles Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34355)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

### [Zavier Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34703)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Michigan - 77, Iowa - 71 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: I was really -- I was impressed with Iowa, and I saw them play
several times this year, both on video and when we played them. Watched the
game last night. Got so much really good, young talent. Very young team that
is going to make a lot of noise in the Big Ten in the future.  
  
I'm proud of our guys, because it was not -- if you just look at the stat
lines, the only way we could win that game was defense. The foul shots didn't
go in. The 3s didn't go in. I think one guy made a 3. That was the exact
opposite of what we saw at Maryland last week.  
  
But we'll take it. Our defense won the game. Zavier Simpson did an incredible
job on Bohannon. Again, just did a wonderful job. Just a lot of energy to get
that done. Did a great job.  
  
And everyone else just sort of pitched in. They're a really tough guard
because Garza and Cook can all shoot. And they're a little bit like us, they
spread you out and it's tough to get to all the shooters. Great win for us.
Quick turnaround, Nebraska tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. What's the win say about the depth of the Michigan team?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: I think it says a lot. Foul trouble obviously early in the
first half and then in the second half and guys (indiscernible) come in and
step up, it's huge. That's what you need this time of year, a deep bench and I
think we had that today, which was really important.  
  
Q. You guys struggled from 3 throughout the game and coincidentally the
only shot you hit in overtime is the 3-pointer. How were you able to fight
through not having a great shooting night and still able to come out for the
win?  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: Just being able to stick together. We fought through
adversity. There were some tough calls out there. We just wanted to stick
together, keep playing hard and keep playing smart. That's what we did, and
we're just glad to come out with the victory.  
  
Q. What was your mindset going into overtime right after Iowa hit the
big 3 to tie the game?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Well, we just knew it was win or go home. And we understand
they made a great run at the end, and we said we just want to stick together
and try to come out of here with the win.  
  
Q. Duncan, seems like you've been doing this forever, kind of hitting
big shots and 3s. Describe the play and did it feel great coming off your
hand?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, it was a great play called by Coach B and X. It's a
good screen by Jon and a good pass by Charles, I think, Charles. And it all
stems from my teammates and coaches, giving me confidence to step in and take
that shot in the first place, and today fortunately enough I was able to make
it.  
  
Q. Duncan, sticking with you, really maybe for the other guys, too, when
you're missing, when the team is missing, does that sort of become contagious,
too. Do you sort of find yourself in a little more pressure -- man we've got
to hit one of these? And from Duncan's standpoint, how do you overcome that,
if that's the case?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Not necessarily. We know we're a really good shooting team.
We've done it a lot this year. And we certainly do it every day in practice as
well. It's something we emphasize. If they're not going early, we like to
think of it water is going to find its level.  
  
Fortunately enough we were able to make some late, but at the same time it
puts more pressure on our defense and we stepped up in that area today. And we
knew we needed a heightened sense of urgency on that end.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: Just being able, when Duncan's hitting shots, our momentum
increases; we get going. Our energy gets better. We feel like, as you said,
we're a great shooting team, just have to keep shooting, just stay confident.  
  
Q. Duncan, if I'm seeing this right, there's only one game you didn't
score this year and it was Nebraska.  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, I think so. I don't know. Obviously they're playing
real well right now so they kind of put it on us at their place this year. I
know they're gunning for us because they feel they're in a do-or-die
situation. So we have to match their intensity, and we'll be ready for them
come tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is the first time that the Big Ten Tournament is held here at
Madison Square Garden. What are your thoughts and feeling playing in the
biggest stage in sports?  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: It's great. The atmosphere is great out there. Just glad to be
able to play in an arena like this. Just happy we can get our first victory
here. And hopefully we can continue. But as far as playing here, it's an
amazing feeling.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: It's incredible. Being an East Coast kid growing up, this is
the mecca of it all. I feel very fortunate to be here, and specifically with
this team. I feel like we can band together and do something special.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Experience playing here is second to none. This is every
childhood dream, to be able to say that they played in the Garden. And
especially, like Duncan said, having a great group of guys, wouldn't rather
have done this with anybody else.  
  
Q. How do you feel that you guys have changed, this team, since the last
meeting in Nebraska?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: I thought we've grown a lot. I think that was one of the
first teams that really started switching ball screens. I think we've learned
a lot since then. I think a lot of people as a team and individually we've
grown a lot. So hopefully that will be on display tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. With Mo and Muhammad-Ali in foul trouble, do you feel you have to be
creative with the lineups at the end of the game; how did you approach that?  
COACH BEILEIN: We haven't had that all year long. We haven't had three guys in
foul trouble in the first half, and our situation in the second half, with
guys fouling out. Someone do the stat, probably just a couple of games.  
  
There were some tough breaks. And, yeah, we just had to try and find ways. But
we felt Jon was still, his presence in there was good enough.  
  
Jordan Poole did not have a very good game. But at the same time, he's capable
of that. And so we went with those. We played Duncan as a 3-man a little bit.
And it all worked out. But we want to stay away from that situation.  
  
Q. Is there a reason why we didn't see Isaiah Livers play for the
majority of the overtime period?  
COACH BEILEIN: We probably felt that the lineup we had was the best chance at
winning. How is that?  
  
Q. What did Nebraska do so well when you guys played them?  
COACH BEILEIN: Bill Belichick impersonation. What was that?  
  
Q. What was so good about the Cornhuskers the first time you played
them?  
COACH BEILEIN: If anybody has gone to Nebraska to play, it is a tremendous,
tremendous environment and atmosphere. And the place was all jacked up and
they were ready to roll.  
  
They have a -- they can go small. They can play big or small. And they came in
with great quickness and great game plan and were just much better than us.
And that's all it was. They were just better than us.  
  
I think they beat us on that day, whether it was in Nebraska, here, anywhere,
hopefully we've improved a great deal for some things they threw at us. But
still Tim's got a really, really good team and very deserving team of being
here and being in postseason play.  
  
Q. You coached here in the Big East Tournament with West Virginia,
what's it like to be back with the Big Ten and Michigan?  
COACH BEILEIN: I played in some quarterfinal games here with West Virginia,
but I don't think I've ever been in a quarterfinal game that was as loud as
that game today. That was an exciting atmosphere to be in.  
  
And it's really -- I don't think -- we had to sacrifice a lot to put ourselves
in this position to be in the Garden.  
  
I think when it's all said and done, we'll all say it was worth it. If you
witness these games we're having right now and how New York loves basketball,
they love college basketball. Something that I mentioned several times, March
in New York is just -- I don't know why it's a really favorite time of mine.  
  
Q. Were you expecting a battle so hard so early on in the tournament,
can you speak to the overall level of competition in the tournament?  
COACH BEILEIN: Like I said, Iowa is just, is right there. I mean, they're
right there. Just a little young. Got all freshmen and sophomores out there.
And we just got -- you could see what we were like when we took our seniors
off the court and our junior off the court.  
  
So they just really battle. And I'm just -- there's not -- with the parity
there is in college basketball, I don't care where it is, if you have any
games going on in a tournament right now, every game is going to be
competitive. Nobody has home advantage. Everybody's playing for a whole lot.  
  
Usually, it's a win or go home. And so it means a lot to just get that W.  
  
Q. Were you frustrated at all with the pace of the game?  
COACH BEILEIN: No. No, I did want to run more I think in the second half when
we got going -- we got the stops and really ran, and all of a sudden we took
the air out a little bit. That wasn't me. That was the rebound and getting it
and walking it up the court.  
  
I would have liked to -- I felt our transition offense is some real good
numbers. I wanted to do it. We stopped. But that's telling me we're a little
tired right now.  
  
And so you just go -- but I don't want to play that half court basketball like
that. I want to get up and down. But it wasn't me slowing it down. But if my
point guard wants to slow it down, or Charles or Muhammad wants to slow it
down a little bit, then they slow it down. I tried to speed it up.  
  
I thought it was fine. Again, this team plays at one of the faster paces in
the league. Our OER is really good, their OER. But their pace is a little
different than us. We want to play at a pace to keep people from getting to
their number and their scoring average.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## February 28, 2018

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

### [Corey Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32917)

### [Mike Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34690)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Rutgers - 65, Minnesota - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach to make an opening statement then go to
questions for Corey and Mike.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: We thank you. Thanks for coming. I love the environment.
Rutgers Nation was out tonight. Good win for us against the good and talented
Minnesota team. I thought these guys were locked in from the start.  
  
Proud of these two guys. Made big plays all night. Everyone chipped in. Great
team win, and we get to play another night. Excited about that.  
  
Q. This actually is for Mike Williams. I remember you when you played at
Bishop Loughlin here in New York. How is it to have a local following --
Rutgers now being part of the Big Ten Conference, being like I said it was a
switch, how is it being that this is your first -- not just your first but how
was it playing here in the Garden and playing in the Big Ten Tournament?  
MIKE WILLIAMS: Well, it was a great atmosphere. I think the big thing, I did
it on purpose, because you know it's my senior year, I wanted to close it out
here. It's ironic for it to close out here, my last year at home here. I have
to thank the Big Ten for that.  
  
I had a great crowd here. My family was here. It was great for the Rutgers
faithful to come here and watch us play. And we've just got to keep the ball
rolling and hopefully we have a lot more fans tomorrow.  
  
Q. For both Mike and Corey, do you guys see your seeding as No. 14 as
just a number or is this going to add an act of motivation for you guys going
forward?  
COREY SANDERS: Both. That 14 certainly doesn't represents the type of team we
are. We play hard every game. Sometimes the result isn't what we want it to
be. But we're going to fight and play hard against anybody that we get. The
number really doesn't matter.  
  
MIKE WILLIAMS: Definitely, the number doesn't matter. In our case, it's March
Madness. Anything can happen. That's why this is the best league, the best
kind of basketball in the world.  
  
Even the little guys who is No. 14 can upset somebody. We don't really worry
about the number. We just go out and play hard every day.  
  
Q. Minnesota was within two at various points in the final seven
minutes. Every time there's a basket Corey hit a 3-pointer. Nine of 10 free
throws in the final minute. Talk about how clutch you guys were down the
stretch.  
MIKE WILLIAMS: We practice this every day. Coach, he teaches, he preaches
about free throws. We spend at least a good portion of practice shooting free
throws because we know it's going to come down to that.  
  
And we was able to come down, stay calm, just hit the free throws. And was
able to come out with a win.  
  
Q. What is it about this team two years in a row being able to come in
No. 14 seed and winning the first night, and just the mentality that you guys
have?  
COREY SANDERS: I think sometimes teams look at the 14, just think that they're
going to come in, it's going to be an easy win for them. But we know this type
of team that's going to fight hard through all the adversity and all the hard
times, going to go out there and we're going to fight. That's what Coach
preaches: Don't give up; go out there and play the 40 minutes. 40 minutes gets
you 40 minutes. And that's that.  
  
MIKE WILLIAMS: Definitely what Corey said. 40 gets you 40. That's been our
motto. We came to the tournament. Everybody's 0-0 except after tonight. We
came into that mentality we don't want to go home. I don't want to go home.
It's my senior year. I want to keep playing.  
  
Q. It's been 13 years since you guys have won two conference games two
years in a row. What's that mean in trying to rebuild this program to be able
to do that?  
COREY SANDERS: You know, it just shows the growth. It's a program that is
rebuilding, rebuilding with something that can be very special. But you gotta
take the right type of player. We've got a good coach in here now, and just
take the players that come along. Just fight along with Coach and follow the
game plan and see the vision he sees and a lot of things can change around
here.  
  
MIKE WILLIAMS: Definitely, it's all about buying in. You just gotta -- we
believe in what Coach Pikiell's vision is. Sometimes we're going to take lumps
because we know this is the best conference in the nation. And these guys keep
believing. Gotta keep believing in ourselves and it showed today.  
  
Q. Obviously this year hasn't been great for you guys. How does it feel
to get a highlight win tonight?  
MIKE WILLIAMS: It feels good. Especially we hope our record would be a little
bit different this year. But we know we have to take what God gives us and
it's all God's plan. That's one of my favorite songs. It's all about God's
plan. Gotta keep rolling with the punches and hopefully we'll win tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, today was a big win for you. But not only that, it showed the
grit and toughness of your team. What did you learn about your team today,
because it was a tough season?  
COACH PIKIELL: You know what, during the build process, there's a lot of tough
times you have to go through. We played the hardest schedule in the Big Ten,
first and foremost. You guys all love Kenpom. You said it. Not anybody else.  
  
We've got a lot of obstacles that we've gone through. We've had sickness.
Injuries. These guys have fought through everything. And I'm real proud today.
We really followed the game plan. We had to do a great job on Mason and
Murphy, two of the best players in the league. And we did that.  
  
We were tough. We outrebounded them. That was the key to the game. And I'm
real proud. These guys made huge plays. Mike makes that big out-of-bounds play
where he gets an and one. And Corey made big shots all night. Everybody kind
of chipped in. Seven rebounds for Issa. Eugene, seven. De gets 11 rebounds.
These guys have fought.  
  
It's not been easy, but it's never easy when you're building something. And
you've got to go through these times to enjoy the good times. And it's not
easy. It's the best league in the country with the best coaches.  
  
And as you saw tonight, some really, really good players, too. So we're
excited about having the opportunity to play again tomorrow and hope Rutgers
Nation is there and cheering us on just like they did today.  
  
Q. What do you guys need to do to beat Indiana after they beat you
earlier in the season?  
COACH PIKIELL: Here you go: Just won this game five minutes ago and you're
already on to the next one. Indiana is well-coached. Again, terrific. We'll
sit down and watch a few tapes.  
  
They have matchup problems. They play tremendously hard. They have matchup
problems for us. We have a day. We have a lot of time to prepare. Our guys
will sleep tonight. And then we'll get ready for a good Indiana team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask: How satisfying it is for you in terms of seeing Mike
Williams, the kind of effort he put forth tonight, how he bought into your
program when he came here two years ago, and just to see him have this type of
effort in front of his hometown?  
COACH PIKIELL: Just real excited. Put him in the lineup tonight. Knew he would
respond. I didn't even know if he was going to be back for the season. He and
Eugene have had bad injuries. They both really came back and did a great job.
But De, I thought -- our seniors all chipped in. Candido gave us some good
minutes too when he was in there. Real happy.  
  
Mike's been a great representative: Dean's list student and graduating on
time, he's been great, a four-year guy here. To get another win in the
tournament so he can keep playing, certainly a great thing.  
  
Q. You played here as a player in the Big East Tournament. What was it
like to coach here in the first --  
COACH PIKIELL: I love Madison Square Garden. There's no better place. There's
no better venue. I'm glad that people can see some unbelievable basketball
tomorrow. There were great games today: Illinois, Iowa, that comes down to
some really good and exciting basketball.  
  
And everyone will realize how good everyone is in this league from 1 to 14.
Who is in the league, 1 to 14, don't want to play anybody. You don't want to
play Illinois, Iowa or Minnesota. Good basketball teams, tremendous tradition,
tremendous coaches.  
  
So it's great to be here in this venue. I've always loved it. Loved it as a
player, Big East, and every time I come here and play, it's just great.  
  
Q. Who was better, you against Boston College in 1986 or Corey Sanders
tonight?  
COACH PIKIELL: Did they play basketball back in that time? Peach basket? Corey
Sanders by far. Better by far. And I was proud of him tonight. He showed a
very good basketball player. And he made big plays. But I also liked his
defense. He chased Nate Mason around all night. Not an easy thing.  
  
Q. Along those lines about Corey, I know the next loss will be Mike's
final game, but it also could be Corey's. Any concern about where the program
might be without a kid like him, the way he played?  
COACH PIKIELL: You know what, Corey's been great. We'll figure that out. And
whatever is best for Corey is what it is.  
  
We've got to continue to grow the program no matter who leaves. We're going to
put this program in a good place where we have good players in every class.
Very confident in what I'm doing. I'm very confident in the build that we
have. Our athletic director is the best. And we're building practice
facilities.  
  
Everything else that we need, compete in the best league in the country. And
feel really good about where we are. And I know everyone wants 20, 25 wins --
how it works.  
  
I'd like that, too. But gotta go through these tough times and we've gone
through them but we've been in every game pretty much and these guys keep
fighting. And we're growing the program.  
  
Two freshmen today played a lot of minutes. A couple sophomores playing a lot
of minutes. Couple of juniors. We don't have a huge senior class, and we've
got a great class coming in.  
  
We have two kids sitting out that I think are tremendous. So I feel really
good about where we're headed; and figure out next year who is going to be on
that roster next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## February 28, 2018

  

### [Dupree McBrayer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32984)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Rutgers - 65, Minnesota - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH PITINO: Well, it was disappointing. You know, we just couldn't generate
enough baskets. It was difficult. But we kept cutting the lead and we just
couldn't make a shot to save our lives.  
  
So they fought. We went small. And we scrapped. But it was just -- we got
really, really worn down, tired. Depth became certainly a factor. But these
guys gave me great effort. So we can't fault them for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Dupree, just talk about coming back to New York, for you and Isaiah,
obviously it's not the season you would have hoped for. But what was your
feeling? And then Isaiah's feeling coming into this game?  
DUPREE MCBRAYER: It's always good to come home, but it was a business trip and
the goal was to stay focused, not worry about the families -- we'll see our
families after -- but just focusing on the game, the tasks at hand.  
  
Q. Jordan, happy birthday, not the happy birthday you wanted, but you
guys got back in it the second half. I think your dunk cut it to three and
Sanders hit the big 3. Did that feel like a turning point?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Yeah, it definitely seemed like we were still in the game. We
were still in the game I think with 11 minutes to go. So I think that was
definitely a turning point in the game. Our guys tried really hard down the
stretch.  
  
We were getting it done defensively. We just couldn't muster enough buckets to
get it done.  
  
Q. Jordan, as a captain this year and a junior, when you look back on
this season, what do you want the guys returning to kind of take into the
offseason?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Just don't be complacent. I mean, anything can happen during
any season. It's pretty unpredictable. It's not going to go the way you think
it is. Just don't be complacent with where you are right now. Always become a
better player and improve on every aspect of your game. I think that's what
everyone has to take into the offseason.  
  
Q. Coach, the rebounding margin was pretty one-sided for them. Could you
tell me how that affected the game and what the difference was there?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we didn't do a very good job of blocking out. I thought we
did a better job in the second half.  
  
Then we had to go small, but I thought our smaller lineup actually was better.
Physically it battled with it. They're a really good offensive rebounding
team. We certainly stressed it. But I thought it might have surprised us a
little bit early. And we just don't have the size right now and then with
Jordan in foul trouble it really hurt us.  
  
Q. The way that Corey was playing over the last four or four and a half
minutes there in the first half, what was he doing that was helping Rutgers to
take control there?  
COACH PITINO: Just iso basketball. Nate Mason was exhausted. He's battling the
flu. I was trying to get him in and out as best I could. But he was getting
really, really tired. He was cramping up. And Corey was playing really good
one-on-one basketball.  
  
Q. What did Corey do differently than the last time you played him? I
think you kept him in check the last time you played him. What did he do
differently; what did he do well?  
COACH PITINO: I think we had a different team. He got a lot of stuff off just
one-on-one.  
  
Q. What do you take from this season? Obviously you guys had a lot of
expectations going in. Just summing up now?  
COACH PITINO: I think there was a reason why we struggled. Dupree McBrayer was
on one leg. Losing your starting center, losing your starting small forward,
losing your first guy off the bench, reality -- not an excuse. Reality. I
don't think any team can sustain that.  
  
So I think when their expectations were high, we had a full roster. When we
lost players, obviously it changed. So take from it that it doesn't happen
again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## February 28, 2018

  

### [Trent Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34688)

### [Kipper Nichols](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34687)

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Iowa - 96, Illinois - 87  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement and then we'll go to questions for
the players first.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Very, very similar to our game in Champaign, other than the
fact that we got up 20 in the game in Champaign.  
  
But it was the same three culprits. And we didn't do a very good job tonight.
Luka Garza just, again, had his way with us. He's done that two nights in a
row. Bohannon has 25 and limited minutes really in the first half. He had 29
in Champaign. And then Tyler Cook has 19.  
  
And so it was frustrating early. I thought defensively Iowa was very sharp. We
got out of rhythm. It took us a little while to get going.  
  
I liked our looks. We made 14 3s tonight. And that's a great number for us.
But you can't get outrebounded 20 and expect to win, period, in any kind of
game.  
  
But that was -- the game was decided on the glass. And you have eight
turnovers, you shoot 50 percent almost, but when you get outrebounded and then
you allow them to shoot 57 percent, 56 percent, you're in trouble.  
  
So a lot of credit to Iowa. They're very good. Very explosive offensive team.
And their size bothered us. And then Bohannon just loved seeing [inaudible].  
  
Q. What was this week like for you coming in? You've been here a few
days in New York and playing at the Garden for the first time, the Big Ten
Tournament?  
TRENT FRAZIER: First time in New York, great experience. Our guys, we're
coming in this tournament excited, pumped up and fired up to get a snap back
out of Iowa.  
  
But coming up short tonight. But coming off what Coach Underwood talked about,
rebounding, we got killed on the boards tonight, and I think that was the
game, down two -- we give up two rebounds off of free throws. Those are big,
big momentum plays right there. Changed the game.  
  
KIPPER NICHOLS: Like he said, the week didn't end the way we wanted it to. So
that's really all that matters at this point. But like they both said, you
don't win that rebounding battle, you get killed like that, it's tough to come
out victorious.  
  
Q. You both have a lot of years ahead of you relatively speaking. How do
you plan to use the experience today going forward?  
KIPPER NICHOLS: As I said in the locker room just now and Coach talked to us,
a lot of it hit me that it's a lot about details. Our youth has shown
throughout the year. I think that once we get better collectively and come
together as a unit and hone in on that stuff, I think the sky's the limit. And
with this new coaching staff, they've done a tremendous job. And I think we
all need what Coach Underwood is trying to instill in us and his coaches. Like
I said, the sky's the limit for us.  
  
TRENT FRAZIER: For me, I think I kind of used this as a little energy for us
for next year. We're right there. This is a hell of a season for our guys. Had
an awesome, awesome season playing with these guys. These guys are my
brothers.  
  
We worked really hard. But feeding off of what Kip talked about, next year
we've got a few guys coming in. We've got to pull those guys in, show them
what it is to play for Illinois.  
  
The Fighting Illini, obviously new coaching staff, like he said, new system.
We've got to bring everyone together and just play as one unit.  
  
Q. Kipper, back in the locker room, what was it like to score that many
points in a famous arena like this?  
KIPPER NICHOLS: My teammates, they found me tonight, like it always is. The
offense created shots for us but we lost. That's really what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, did you get the technical, was that a lot of frustration
buildup or more trying to motivate the guys?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I'm going to fight for them. I'm going to fight for them.
They were on a run. It's my only technical of the year. I'm not a big fan of
them to be quite honest, and it wasn't directed at any one official or
anything else.  
  
That was pretty well planned on my part just to, at that moment in time I
needed to change some sort of mojo or whatever you want to use about the game
and hopefully try to rally our guys, give them something to rally around. But
it worked for a minute or two. But that was the whole purpose.  
  
Q. Coach, the best way to describe it would be how do you sum up this
first year? Where are you in the growing process? Is this game reflective of
maybe the rest of the year?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Yeah, this fits just about every category you want. And we
had three overtime losses early. We had -- Nebraska throws in a prayer at
their place, buzzer, to beat us.  
  
We've led in most games. Led by 15 at Ohio State. Led by 10 at Michigan. And
we've got to get tougher. Our guys played great at the end.  
  
I liked our growth. I liked our development. It was -- lost 70 percent of our
scoring, 70 percent of our rebounding and really Leron Black was the only guy
that played and was on an opponent scouting report.  
  
We left two scholarships open for a reason once we got the job. Mark Alstork
was our only senior, a grad transfer. I have tremendous respect for what he's
done in terms of coming in and helping us lay a foundation. But it was
frustrating at times, but very -- and now that it's over I'll look back on it
and reflect a little more.  
  
A lot of rewarding things. To see Trent Frazier, a guy that didn't play at
Northwestern or barely played, to see him become a member of the all-freshmen
team. And Leron Black had an incredible season.  
  
Everybody knows we didn't shoot the ball real well throughout most of the
year, and Trent and Leron took the brunt of every team's defensive attack and
scheme. But there will be some great things. Aaron Jordan scored more points
in three games, the first three games of the year than he did all of last
year.  
  
So there's a lot of positives. And there's a lot of growth still to be had.
But there's no question, when you're at the University of Illinois, finishing
where we finished and losing in the first day, and when you're the 11th ranked
program in the history of college basketball, that's not why I'm here.  
  
Q. It's February 28th and the season is already over. Does it feel odd
at all to have a season be over at this early stage in the calendar?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Yeah. No idea. I mean, it's a different feeling, and one --
I've never been done in February before ever. I was thinking about that a few
days ago. Never ever been done now. Not that it's any different a week from
now if your season is over. But it's sure a different feeling making a deep
run into March which we've been able to do in the last few years.  
  
Q. You mentioned the growth. Where is Mark Smith's game? And I noticed
the Iowa fans were doing the 3-2-1 and I think they kind of tricked him into
shooting early one time. Is that the kind of thing that we're not going to see
in future years, do you think?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: You know, Mark had an interesting year. He had a real -- he's
going to be a really, really good player. And he fought illness two or three
different times.  
  
He went through the growing spurts that freshmen go through. I love his game.
And he didn't play in our last game at Rutgers, so I was really unsure what he
was -- what he was capable of tonight.  
  
Mark's a terrific offensive player. And offseason will be good, full offseason
in the spring, getting in the weight room, we've got one of the best strength
coaches in America.  
  
So I was pleased. All of our freshmen had ups and downs, and that's to be
expected. And it's the old cliché that the best thing about freshmen is they
become sophomores. So they all played a great deal and they've all got work to
do and we'll expect that from them.  
  
Q. It's been a crazy week off the court in college basketball. I just
wanted to get your thoughts on the FBI probe and what you think needs to be
done? And do you have confidence that the NCAA can do what has to be done?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Answering that here and now -- we've got the greatest game in
the world, and it will continue to be that. I've got as much confidence as
need be. I'm not really in a place to set up here and talk about that.  
  
But I know we've got something special. It's lasted a lot longer than I've
been alive and it's an encouraging moment when you look out and we're playing
in Madison Square Garden and we've got tremendous amount of fan support. And
the game of basketball will be just fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## February 28, 2018

  

### [Jordan Bohannon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32904)

### [Luka Garza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34689)

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Iowa - 96, Illinois - 87  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for Jordan and Luka.  
  
Q. Jordan, Coach Underwood said you must love to see orange and blue
because you blew these guys up in Champaign as well. But to play against them
obviously you must have a certain comfort level wherever the looks that
they're showing you and plus also playing this well in this building, I was
wondering if there's anything maybe a little special about coming here to
Madison Square Garden and playing real well?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: Obviously anytime you get to play in Madison Square Garden
and first time being here and something new. Always want to do when you grow
up is play at Madison Square Garden. And think about all the people that
played here before and currently playing here.  
  
But Illinois is a really tough team. That was a really tough fight for us to
play them tonight. We knew it was going to be a tough first round, and you've
got to give them a lot of credit because they worked their butts off on the
defensive end and made it really tough for us.  
  
I struggled first half, turned the ball over, had a couple of bad turnovers.
But gotta give a lot of credit to my guys especially him right here. They
really stepped up tonight and made big-time plays.  
  
Q. You have Michigan tomorrow. What has to happen differently to reverse
the two results you got earlier this season?  
LUKA GARZA: You know, we're going to get into the film room and watch more
film on them. And last time we played them, but we've got to come in here with
the same mindset we did today and get the rebound, get to the glass and keep
defensive intensity.  
  
They're a great team. They move the ball really well, have a lot of 3-point
shooters. We've got to know and get to the corners and get to different areas
on the floor where their shooters are a threat.  
  
Just gotta execute the game plan that our coaches give us.  
  
Q. Jordan?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: He said it all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach McCaffery.  
  
Q. Luka mentioned getting to the film room in preparation for tomorrow's
game. What else do you guys have to do on such short notice to reverse the
results from earlier in this season?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, we have to play better. That sounds very
simplistic. But when you get beat twice, we played a little better I thought
at home than up there. It's not uncommon.  
  
But you can be a little better defensively, whether we're man or zone. We've
got to move the ball a little better. We've got to execute a little bit
better. They're not an easy team to guard. They share it. They spread you out.
They have multiple 3-point shooters, like Luka said, but they also have
multiple drivers. Incredibly unselfish team.  
  
The one guy that I've been incredibly impressed with this year has been Abdur-
Rahkman. And nobody talks about that kid. And he's one of the best players in
our league.  
  
I thought he had as good a year as anybody in our league this year. I think
one of the big reasons why they had the success they had, among a lot of other
people. But he's a senior that has been through a lot and has been a really
good player for them.  
  
I thought he was a star this year. I really did. But, again, they've got a lot
of weapons. They've got depth. They've got speed. They've got size. So they
can downshift and go small.  
  
They can play big. But everybody can score. Everybody they put out there can
score. You've got to be impressed with Duncan Robinson, starter, and accepts
his role coming off the bench. Sixth man of the year in the league. Tells you
about that team.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the resilience of the team that you
guys led all but for 20 -- well, 26 seconds and eight second tied. So just
talk a little bit about that for this year.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I was really pleased with that aspect. I think you make a
great point, because you know, when you're playing Illinois, they're going to
keep coming. They fight you.  
  
It seemed like every time we got what seemingly was a comfortable lead, it was
not a comfortable lead. They hit a 3. Get a steal. Get a put-back. And it was
a game right up until the last possession, seemingly.  
  
So to be able to hold the lead -- we had goofy turnovers that were obviously
upsetting at the time and you can't do that. But you gotta give them credit
for how they played, and they were up into us and they were challenging. They
were anticipating.  
  
But we made the plays that were necessary to win. We got to their free-throw
line. We got to the bonus. We got to the double bonus early.  
  
When they're playing physical like that, and the X is on the O, and they're
denying the next pass, you've got to put it on the deck. I thought in the
second half our decision-making and our passing and our catching and shot
selection was really good, much better than the first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 22, 2018

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Kentucky 80, North Carolina 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, give us some initial thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, hope everybody has a better Christmas than I'm going
to have. Mine's not going to be as smooth as I would like for it to be.  
  
But congratulate John and his club, and amazing thing to look down and Ashton
Hagans is 2-for-6, seven points, and I thought in some ways he was more
dominating in the game than anybody, seven steals. We turned it over 18 times,
17 times, and gave him 20 points out of it. That's one of the keys for us in
the game was to make the easy play and not turn it over but their effort I
thought was much better than ours.  
  
We had one play where they go down and get a layup and we had a couple guys
that I didn't think sprinted back as hard and they got a layup and it comes
down and one of those guys on Kentucky came running from behind and the corner
crossed from our bench and deflected it.  
  
So I think Kentucky's staff did a better job than North Carolina's staff about
trying to get the kids to play as hard as they possibly could play.  
  
I don't think either team played exceptionally well but John's club came
better prepared, and it's a little frustrating for us right now. Not much else
to say.  
  
Q. Coach, especially early on, it seemed like Reid Travis gave you a lot
of trouble. If you can talk about that and his performance?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Our intention was to try to front the low post. We didn't
get him fronted. We also, one of the rules we had defensively is not to help
up the lane and three different times in the first half, we helped up the lane
and they ditched it down to either read or PJ or one of their other big guys
and they dumped three of them because we just doing something we weren't
supposed to do.  
  
Reid, he was first team all SEC last year -- not SEC, whatever that league was
he was in last year (laughter) his first team preseason SEC this year, so he's
a very good player. They dominated things inside, and we don't have a big stud
like we've had at times in the past. But we've still got to figure out a play
to win.  
  
But got to front the guy in the low post if he's like Reid and PJ, as well. PJ
loves to get the ball in the foul line area and drive right, and laid it up
and had one guy that was there to take a charge and sort of backed out, so
we've got to do a better job of getting our guys to do those kind of things.  
  
Q. The players talk about, they need to buy in more, is the message. I'm
sure they are not openly defying you, so how do they --  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: You've got to lose yourself in the game more and not be
concerned about how you're doing. Reid twice today said, if it takes an extra
five seconds to get a better shot, let's take five extra seconds, and took two
bad shots immediately.  
  
They are great kids, I have no problem, they are the kind of kids would I
trust with my grandchildren and I wouldn't trust my grandchildren with any of
you guys because I don't know you. But they do, they have to buy in more about
the name in front of the jersey. If you lose yourself in the game and lose
yourself into the success of the team, every individual will be taken care of.
That's stood the test of time with everybody I think, but it's stood the test
of time I think with me for 31 years.  
  
We've got to get better defensively. I think the defensive intensity is
something that's got to go up, the defensive brain has got to get better.
There's too many missed assignments, and we actually, one time on a time-out,
a dead-ball situation, I called a trap and we didn't even get the trap and it
was a veteran team in there at the time. It wasn't -- can't blame it on Nassir
or Leaky or Coby. It was a veteran team in there and we're getting a double-
team.  
  
Got to use your heart, just got to care more about it, that name on the front
of the jersey, take care of it, got to use our brain a little more,
concentration.  
  
Of course, so many little things in the game make a big difference in winning
and losing. I think three things we put up on the board is one, win the
rebounding battle. We lost it by ten. And before the game, we had the best
rebound margin than anybody in the country and they were two or three.  
  
Another thing was limit turnovers and make the easy play and didn't do a very
good job of that. Another thing, the first half, they shoot 12 free throws and
we shoot two and third thing up on the board is play defense without fouling.
So it's a tough situation.  
  
Q. What did you see of Hagans on film coming into the game defensively
and what did you see --  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Scouting report said he was a really good on the ball
defender. Saw him in high school and really liked him in high school.
Reclassified. He's a really gifted young man and works really hard, too. I
don't know if he's the one that got it. I think it was a 6-point game, we get
the rebound, and just make a simple pass, and I'm not sure if he's the one
that got the steal or not. A guy that sees the defense. He's a gifted
youngster and his shooting percentage from deep is not good, but where he
attacks the basket and passes the ball and defends like crazy and plays with a
reckless abandon.  
  
Q. What did you think of Kentucky's passing, and especially the bigs,
Reid and PJ?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I think they probably passed it better than, you know, I
don't know who had the most turnovers for them. They were just as bad as us.
They had 18 turnovers.  
  
But I think their big guys looked for each other. It's a little bit of a buddy
system, which is what we try to do which is one big guy gets the ball and
another big guy goes to the front of the him and makes himself available.  
  
Like I said, three times in the first half, we helped up the lane and supposed
to fake and cover the basket if you're a big guy and get help from the wings
and we didn't do that. I think all those dunks that they got at the end of the
first half was big guy to big guy.  
  
Q. You have the toughest schedule in the league; Gonzaga, then Kentucky.
Mentally what preparation goes into having back-to-back games like tough
opponents like this?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I like it myself. I think playing the better teams tells
you more about your team. I love having a tough game every game. Every now and
then it's okay to win easy, but I still think you get better preparation
playing a tough schedule and playing on the road and playing different places.  
  
Gonzaga, I would think, what did we do -- Texas, UCLA, Michigan, Wilmington,
Gonzaga and Kentucky, that's a pretty tough stretch but we didn't do so well,
either. But everybody wants you to play a tough schedule which you really
benefit by playing a tough schedule when you win a few of them.  
  
Q. You mentioned the glass -- what was the difference?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Effort. Toughness. Probably a little size might have had
something to do with it, too. We went small and it was just terrible. We
couldn't guard the post and couldn't get a rebound, either.  
  
I think rebounding is a little technique, but it's going after the basketball,
too. I took Kenny and Cam out one time because Coby shoots a lay up and they
don't go to the board and neither one of them get back, either. So it's just
right now, it's a combination of errors. It's not one simple thing.  
  
Q. How much further along -- a couple weeks ago in Vegas, you said
Nassir still on both ends not settled, defensively. How much closer is he now,
obviously on the bench in crunch time?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: One of my buddies -- reports -- I don't care what the hell
anybody else thinks. If you guys think I care what you think -- if I hold the
guy back, why am I playing Coby in come on, if I'm holding the guy back, why
am I playing Coby?  
  
And the other thing, the guy that is playing in front of him made six out of
eight from three-point line and was the ACC player of the league last week. So
that's all I'm going to say about some report. Is that all right -- I know --
I know -- Jeff, let me answer. I got it, okay? You're a good guy.  
  
I don't think there is an answer to your question. I think he is trying hard.
I want him to have more time. That's why I'm playing him at the 3 and 4 both,
and it's difficult for him. It's difficult for anybody, when you're crossing
the line, whether it's a position at point guard, 2 and 3 is a position, 4 and
5 is a position. There's three spots but if you go across the line, it's
really difficult.  
  
I'm trying to get him some more minutes out there. Today we wanted to him to
drive the ball to the basket and we settled for three point shots. In the All-
American game, they never guard anybody, so if you go down and dunk, you look
pretty good in that and he does that as well as anybody. He's a kid that wants
to be good.  
  
He's a kid that's trying to learn, and he's trying to learn against Texas,
UCLA, Michigan, Gonzaga and Kentucky and so that makes it hard, as well. But I
think he's coming along. I love the way he wants to be good. He wants to be
better. He's willing to stay out there and shoot extra shots. He's willing to
do the things. I don't know that there is a calendar or a schedule that you
have on anybody, freshmen and big guys are about the same. They come at a
different rate. Big guys, you never know when a big guy is going to Wake up
and the light switch has gone on and I think freshmen, a little bit of that,
as well. He needs to really have a good game defensively and give him a little
more confidence there, and he needs a game for a couple of jumpshots to go in.  
  
But he's trying and I'm sticking with him. Again, when you're playing Gonzaga,
Michigan, Kentucky, Texas, UCLA, it's a hard way to learn.

## December 22, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Kaleb Wesson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36358)

### [CJ Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36359)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Ohio State 80, UCLA 66  
  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: Really proud of the effort of our guys, particularly the
second half, I thought UCLA's length bothered us. I know, I give them credit,
I think they played a hard game the other night on the road, and we thought
that we would see zone but.  
  
I'm not sure we thought we would see that much. But give our guys credit, they
responded well. I thought UCLA, they were difficult to attack in that zone
because of their length and their size.  
  
We certainly wish them well moving forward, but these guys were instrumental
in our second half.  
  
Q. What were you able to do in the second half to better attack the zone
and then have success?  
KALEB WESSON: Is that for all of us? Can you repeat the question, please?  
  
Q. In the second half, you had much better success against the zone,
what did you do to attack it?  
KALEB WESSON: I felt our off-ball movement, just being able to get the ball in
the middle of the floor and then just everybody moving off of that really
helped find open shots.  
  
C.J. JACKSON: Kaleb pretty much said it. Guys were making a lot were making
the pass -- in the first half, we were kind of letting the zone push us back
to halfcourt. At halftime, adjustment, Coach told us to press up more on the
line closer and we were able to find Kaleb in the middle and he was able to
make good plays.  
  
Q. C.J., you person any in the second half, you had 20 or 22. When you
get rolling, what does that feel like, and how does help the team?  
C.J. JACKSON: Biggest thing was my teammates, they were looking out for me. I
started hitting a couple of shots, got an easy floater in the beginning.  
  
When I was struggling in the first half, all the coaches and players stayed on
me and said keep shooting, and that's how they are in practice when you're
struggling. They tell you to keep going because they have seen the success out
of each player. It's always easy to play for guys like that.  
  
KALEB WESSON: We know we want him to keep shooting. If he misses three in a
row, we want him to shoot the fourth one. He's a great shooter and we like to
find him when he's open.  
  
Q. C.J., you seem to have a knack, like if you're struggling for 30
minutes, usually the last ten are good. What does it take to put that in the
back of your mind and start making plays when the team needs you?  
C.J. JACKSON: The biggest thing you is want to affect the game in some type of
way, whether it's rebounding, defensively, anything. First half, I was
struggling with my turnovers, a couple defensive assignments I missed.  
  
So in the second half, I just had to change my mindset and the defense -- I
focused on defense more and I was able to knock down a couple shots.  
  
Q. Kaleb, with C.J. struggling the first half, you were able to -- I
think ten points and a handful of rebounds. Complementing each other seems to
be big for you guys. How are you able to do that and then carry that over to
help him get going in the second half?  
KALEB WESSON: I think about it as playing inside-out. It helps C.J. get open
shots. As well as I can keep it up and pick up the game, I feel like he gets
my teammates open shots, and I feel like that helps my team a lot.  
  
Q. Kaleb, how much were you focused on trying to wear them down
physically? Looked like you really made an effort, especially early. They
obviously had length and size, but you seemed to go at them from a physical
standpoint.  
KALEB WESSON: Yeah, that's what we tried to do for 40 minutes, I feel just
occupying them, getting in their legs, trying to wear them down was a big key.  
  
Q. For both players. You guys are at this point going into your holiday
11-1, best start for Ohio State in probably five years or more. Just your
thoughts about where you are at right now, you have one more game left non-
conference before you get into the big part of your schedule, the Big Ten.
Your thoughts; are you guys pleased -- I know there's been ups and downs, but
overall, 11-1 is a pretty good start.  
KALEB WESSON: Happy but not satisfied. We still have a lot of work to do. We
have to work on our defense and staying in for 40 minutes, from the tip to the
final buzzer I feel like.  
  
C.J. JACKSON: Yeah, it's always a good thing, just when you're winning, that
you can't really complain too much. But like Kaleb said, I feel like we have a
long way to go. The coaches know that we are not at our best and like I said,
December is not when you want to be at your best.  
  
It's a long season. We have to finish this last part of our first non-
conference part of the season right against high point.  
  
Q. Kaleb, size was a big factor in this one, going against their guys in
the paint, what challenge was that for you? How was that a challenge and how
did you overcome it?  
KALEB WESSON: It made me work on my lower body more, trying to get in their
legs and weed out space for myself for rebounding and finding angles for my
teammates to find me.  
  
Q. I know you have a long way to go here, but you have these four sort
of non-conference games and your team got three of them and you got three that
weren't in your own building. Do you take inventory of that, knowing you have
a lot still to play but what these three could mean for you guys moving
forward?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, Syracuse, couldn't get that one at home, that's
for sure.  
  
Yeah, listen, we wanted to -- last year, we did not do a great job in non-
conference games that are going to be evaluated at the end of the year by the
NCAA Tournament selection committee. That was something we were trying to be a
little more aware of, but you know, I doubt we're going 15-3 in the Big Ten
this year.  
  
So to have a non-conference where we could pick up some wins that are
important was good, but more than anything, you know, we have to keep growing
and getting better.  
  
Q. The zone obviously gave you some problems which you seemed to solve
as the game went on. What was the key in your eyes to doing that and you had
26 assists on 28 field goals. Pretty good.  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I think it was -- you know, we were a little bit
passive early in the zone. I think that hurt us early with probably the first
four or five possessions, and you know, I've obviously got to do a better job
of making sure that our guys are more aggressive and attacking in the zone.  
  
Their length bothered us. I think their first two possessions, they had two
steals off of C.J.'s passes. I just thought we were more aggressive. We drove
them a little bit more in the zone and we posted and moved it a little bit
quicker, which was instrumental for us.  
  
I thought we had really open 3s for the bulk of the game. We just didn't make
them all.  
  
Q. What happened today that was better against UCLA than Syracuse and
did that game pre prepare you for today's game?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: We were okay nearly attacking their zone. I thought we
did some good things in that particular game sense Syracuse. Our defense
struggled in that game. That was probably the most significant.  
  
But you know, they are different zones, and how they play, both have terrific
size. You know, there's some intricacies that make Syracuse's zone a little
bit different because it's been their base defense for however long Boeheim's
been there.  
  
Q. We talked to you the other day that length and size was a big thing.
What made Kaleb able to overcome that? We've seen that before against Purdue
last year and whatnot. Why was he able to go against bigger guys and have
success?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: We felt like he can could take advantage of his size.
And he's really good at stealing. He's really good at catching. When you're
evaluating big kids, those are two things that are important.  
  
He's got terrific hands. His width is improving, but we felt like he could get
deep seal touches, deep post touches, against them. And we've been fairly
effective all year at getting him some deep post touches. He just didn't quite
finish them against Syracuse.  
  
Q. You're not going to get 20 1/2 every night from C.J. but when he gets
rolling, what does that do for this team and your offense?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: I was really proud of him because I thought he was
struggling a little bit early and I thought he had a stretch there that kind
of broke the game open in the second half when we moved him off the ball. I
thought Keyshawn, having ten assists and zero turnovers might have been as
instrumental as anything because he can see things in the zone, and he's
really good.  
  
That's why I couldn't take him out, because he's really good at attacking
zones, driving gaps and finding right -- finding the right guys. So moving
C.J. off the ball helped us.  
  
Q. What's the value in neutral court, national televised big games,
events like this for you in the schedule.  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: We love it. We love this event. I've said that. We have
not -- oh, we've struggled in this event; I think they were maybe 1-3 coming
into it.  
  
So to be able to get a win is important. We love the event. It's really well
done. It's obviously three other basketball schools, three schools that have a
tradition that's really unparalleled, so for us to kind of align ourselves in
an event like that's great.  
  
Q. How do you handle C.J. throughout a game like this? He's had other
games where he's had stretches where he just looks a little lost but then all
of the sudden -- is he a guy you just have to have patience with?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: He just wants to do well and he intends to do well. He
didn't always make great decisions. He drove it in there two-deep, but I like
how aggressive he was late, and we just tried to stay positive with him as
much as possible.  
  
I think with him, when you know you have a guy that all he cares about is his
team win, I think you can give him a little bit of latitude it took to make
mistakes.  
  
Q. You said you doubt you go 15-3 in the Big Ten this year. What do you
think would be a good record in the league?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: I mean, it's fantastic. I have not watched all the
teams, but I've never been a part of a league that is this deep in good from
top to bottom. I've been part of this great leagues but never one quite like
this.  
  
So I'd hate to speculate. I think Michigan State was 16-2 last year. If
someone goes through this league this year, 16-2, they can certainly cut down
the nets.  
  
Q. You said you didn't necessarily like the defense against Syracuse,
but maybe some of that defense tied into the offensive struggles. Tonight that
wasn't the case. You weren't hitting shots but the defense didn't seem to
waiver. Why do you think you guys were able to handle that challenge in that
way?  
COACH CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, my only disagreement would be I couldn't stand our
defense in the first ten minutes. I thought it was atrocious. I thought it was
really bad. Now, we responded the last 30 minutes.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 22, 2018

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Keldon Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36360)

### [Tyler Herro](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36361)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Kentucky 80, North Carolina 72  
  
Q. Can you talk about Ashton's play tonight?  
KELDON JOHNSON: His defensive presence is amazing. You seen it all, he was
locking up, making plays, big stops and you could just see it rubbing off on
everybody.  
  
TYLER HERRO: I think on defense, really tough to beat, just the way he puts it
on every team, he played great tonight and we expect that from him every
night.  
  
Q. I know you guys play all around the country and the fans travel. What
was it like in this atmosphere?  
TYLER HERRO: It was good to see how loud it got. Big Blue Nation are the best
fan base in the country. The way they travel with us is amazing. It was good
to see how loud they got. It's always good to have them on our side and they
helped us get the W.  
  
KELDON JOHNSON: I would just say the same. Our hat goes off to the fan base
that travels with us and support us through ups and downs.  
  
Q. What does it mean to get a win like this? You've been waiting for a
resumé win like this for a while now.  
KELDON JOHNSON: It's definitely a big win I think, but I mean, it was a great
game. I think we came out and was very aggressive and just played all phases
like in practice. It's just a big-time win.  
  
TYLER HERRO: I think it's big-time just because how hard we've been working in
practice. I think we're seeing that payoff game by game. We're getting better
each game.  
  
Defensively we still have to things to improve on but it's getting better each
and every game.  
  
Q. Reid, especially in the first half, seemed to kind of set the tone
inside. How much was that a plan going in to try to use him, and what did you
think of the bigs passing, he and PJ?  
TYLER HERRO: Yeah, I think they did a great job again tonight. They did the
same against Utah last weekend. You know, Reid is a veteran to us and we look
up to him a lot. When he's tall like that, you almost have to follow him, the
way he passed tonight was amazing. It was good.  
  
KELDON JOHNSON: I agree. I think that he came out ready to play and
aggressive, and same with him and PJ, just sharing the ball and being willing
passers, and it paid off.  
  
Q. Guys, the pace was pretty phrenetic today. Seems like you guys really
love to play in that kind of pace up and down. Is there any way you can kind
of convince Coach Cal to play that way a little bit more?  
KELDON JOHNSON: I mean, I just think that with him trusting us more and more
each and every day, we like to get out and run, and just get each other
involved and pass the ball to each other and give great shots. I mean, I just
think that obviously executing with that, I think he'll let us play.  
  
Q. I know it's December right now but with how the season has sort of
unfolded up to tonight's game, did this feel sort of like a must-win for this
group against those guys?  
TYLER HERRO: Yeah, just talking before the game at the hotel and stuff, at
dinner a couple days before the game, this is like you said, a must-win for
us. It's a resumé win. Like I said before, how hard we've been working in
practice, today was important to finally see something pay off. It was a big
win and we're excited about it.  
  
Q. At one point I think you had 21 assists in the first 24 made field
goals. Just talk about the passing that's been going on and how much that has
changed the traction in the last two games?  
KELDON JOHNSON: We definitely just been working on passes. While we're doing
that, you see our assists goes up and everybody's happy. Everybody's jumping
with joy.  
  
I just think that, I mean, that's just the main thing is that they are willing
passers. That's what we've been focusing on in practice and it's just paying
off.  
  
Q. Is there a pride that you guys are not taking in this to some degree
about making that extra pass or making --  
TYLER HERRO: Like Keldon said, once you see one guy being a willing passer, it
just goes around the whole team and everybody is happy and we're getting stops
on defense.  
  
Q. How did you all bounce back mentally from that loss to Duke to play
the way you did against North Carolina?  
KELDON JOHNSON: I think that once that game -- once we finished that game, it
was over, and we knew that we just had to put it in the back of our minds.
That's just the main thing. We know that we didn't do what we're supposed to
do that game and we just bounced back and kept going harder and harder in
practice each and every day and just put that behind us.  
  
TYLER HERRO: I think it was kind of like a must; we had to put it behind us.
How the coaches approached us after the game, we just have to get back to the
drawing board and work harder in practice.  
  
Q. You talked about this being kind of a resumé win and a chance for
another one next week. I know there's the holiday break in between but first
thoughts on the rivalry game at Louisville next week in?  
TYLER HERRO: I heard the atmosphere is crazy in Kentucky, Louisville. One of
the fans told us when we got here: You can lose every game just not the
Louisville game.  
  
It's going to be fun. Just going to approach that game like any other game and
go out there and compete.  
  
KELDON JOHNSON: I agree. Just go out there and take care of business. I think
we'll come out with the same mindset of just wanting to win. That's what we
do.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the lift Nick gave you guys? It seemed like
he was a spark there.  
KELDON JOHNSON: I definitely agree. He's definitely a sparkplug. That's just
the Nick that we need every day, and we see that Nick in practice. Just to see
him put that for us in the game is just amazing and we're happy for him.  
  
TYLER HERRO: I think the same way that Ashton can change the game how he did
today, and Nick can do the same thing defensively with shots and blocking. He
did a great job tonight, and expect that every night.  
  
Q. Tyler, you mentioned a fan approaching you about just making sure you
don't lose to Louisville. How much, if at all, do you guys hear the fan stuff,
when people start to question, you know, whether this team is going to be what
it was supposed to be.  
TYLER HERRO: The coaching staff does a good job of telling us to stay off
social media in regards to reading what people say. You know, we just work
hard in practice every day. We got our team that we stick to and we stick to
each other and we work hard to get better every day in practice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Calipari to the media room.  
  
Coach, give us some opening thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: We have two really good practices and all I'm on them
about is player-driven. I want this to be a player driven-team. I don't want
it to be a coach-driven team. I shouldn't hear myself or any other coaches
getting on guys to play hard, and that's all we've been talking about. I want
this to be a player-driven team.  
  
I'm trying to keep some of this stuff simple so they can play, and we shot way
more threes than we wanted to, but North Carolina plays in a way that kind of
forces you to shoot threes.  
  
So I don't know the stats. I haven't seen -- I can't read -- I don't even know
what that is, that stat sheet, I couldn't even read it. Could you guys read
it? No. Some of you couldn't, right. Did we win? That's -- okay.  
  
Q. Reid Travis, what made him such an attractive prospect for you?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: Well, first team all Pac-10 and he was like 18-10, and he
said, I'd like to come with you. I says, come on, we'll figure this out.  
  
If you came in our practice, he is so focused and works so hard. Gives
everything he can. I had a coach walk in the other day and say, "He never
takes his eyes off of you when you're coaching." Now, we've got a lot of
freshmen that do take their eyes off me, and sometimes turn their ears off to
me, but he has been a beast that we usually don't have.  
  
Q. Is he the leader of the team or is it a guy maybe like PJ who has
been around?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: It's still developing, and he's not the kind that would
take over but when he speaks, they listen. Guy is in the gym all the time.
He's either in getting treatments -- this kid, he's wired and treatment and
really a wonderful kid. I say kid. I call him kid and he laughs at me. I said,
"When is the last time you've been called kid"?  
  
He said, "About eight years ago."  
  
Q. In the hallway before the game, Ashton was walking up and down
saying, "The aggressor wins." Looked like he had that mentality. Is he
becoming the guy you thought he would be?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, he is -- I'm putting the ball in his hands and he's
making the right plays, and it was a small tweak that we made about a week ago
and when I watched it, I said, "Okay, we got this now." And he's making the
game easy for everybody.  
  
Now, he did jog it up a little bit today when I got on him but the reality of
it is it's kind of like a pressing team. You press a pressing team and if a
team is a speed team, you go right back at him with speed which is what we're
trying to do today.  
  
But he's really, you know, he's making strides.  
  
Q. About being willing passers, I wonder if Reid and PJ really set a
tone, post to post and big to big, and what did you think of the passing
overall?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: Pretty good. We still have a ways to go, though. I'll
watch it on tape. I thought there were four or five that we held on to too
long that we tried to do the harder thing versus just give the ball to the
open man, but we're getting better.  
  
Look, I keep saying and I told them for two days: We're not the same team we
were two weeks ago. It's not even close. And hopefully two weeks from now,
we're not going to be the same team we are today. And that's the process of
every day, let's try to get better. You have games that are kind of tests that
show you. We lost to Seton Hall but we got better between the week before
Seton Hall and Seton Hall. He we just lose a buzzer beater.  
  
But that's all I'm trying to do with this team. If they will become a
defensive-rebounding-minded team, that's where they are about, I think our
offense good enough, I really do.  
  
But we were just so bad defensively those first two, three weeks, and that's
on me. I passed some stuff that I thought they would know, and it was wrong
and I had to go back. But like I said, this is a good win, but it's one game.
Now we've got another tough one coming up.  
  
Q. I know it's only December, but how big was this win? I think for your
kids and maybe their psyches, going into the Louisville game?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: I don't think going into the Louisville game. It's just
that we -- it's amazing, because we had the ball up three with 1:30 to go in
New York and somehow gave that game away. If we had won that game, we wouldn't
have all this craziness, but this is Kentucky. Good luck.  
  
And then if you talk about winning and learning, who doesn't care about
winning. Do you ever watch me coach and say that I don't care about winning?
So this stuff, for them, keeping the clutter away from them, is part of what
we have to do.  
  
We have the greatest fans in the country, we do. And they also want to win
every game by 25 and if you lose the game, you have the outliers that try to
create issues. None of us listen to them, but every year that I've coached --
last year, we lost four in a row. The year we went to the Final Four, we lost
three of our last four. This is hard. Teams are really good. They are well
coached and they are inexperienced with a grad transfer.  
  
Q. With Tyler being from driving distance, did you get a sense this was
going to mean more to him, this game?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: I'll give you a follow-up. I didn't listen to what you
said. Say it again.  
  
Q. With him being from Milwaukee, driving distance, did you sense that
this game was going to mean more to him?  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: I didn't think about it. I was just trying to get these
guys in the right frame of mind to play a game like this, to battle on every
possession, and he still has a ways to go. I mean, but he has gotten so much
better. Defensively, he's not even the same guy. He's way better. Offensively,
he's still learning. You know, some of the passes and some of the stuff he's
just got to learn and the only way you learn is to be in games and make some
mistakes and learn from them and accept where you have to take things.  
  
I was really pleased. He made some shots and PJ did a little bit of everything
today, which is what we wanted. He scored, rebounded, he had assists, but
that's who he should be and I told him, first half, I took him out, I didn't
think he was playing hard enough, you're either going to compete second half I
thought he competed the entire time  
  
What is your follow-up?  
  
Q. You actually already answered it.  
COACH JOHN CALIPARI: I usually do that.  
  
For everybody, have a great Christmas, you hope you spends it with family and
I tell all the people out there, if you get a chance to bring somebody into
your home for Christmas, a neighbor or somebody that's out there, maybe think
about doing it. Thanks.

## December 22, 2018

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Kris Wilkes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36356)

### [Jaylen Hands](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36357)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Ohio State 80, UCLA 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome UCLA to the media room.  
  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: I thought obviously a very good team that we played today.
They do a lot of good things, both offensively and defensively, and I thought
that offensively, I liked our shots that we got. We didn't make a lot,
4-for-18 from 3. We are normally a better shooting team than that, so we
didn't make some shots there. Getting rid of them around the rim for a while,
it happened late, and I really like what we did defensively in the zone in the
first half.  
  
Second half we just gave up way too many offensive rebounds. I think how we
went about things, it was a much better effort than what it was Wednesday
night when it snowballed. I thought we made some strides tonight, but against
a very good team like this, you can't give them second opportunities; we gave
them 15.  
  
Our young guys have got to learn that, but it's finishing possessions. It's
finishing 40 minutes of play, and you know, hopefully we can get back and get
back to work after Christmas, but this was better than -- we had some strides
here, and we got some guys that are working and learning and getting going
through this grind. Today was much better.  
  
Q. Two things that stood out were 12 turnovers in the first half and not
making a lot of three-pointers. What were the issues with both those things,
the first half turnovers and the 3-pointers?  
KRIS WILKES: Honestly I think we just got too excited. We got the ball; we got
careless. We got real happy. We got in the post a couple times and turned it
over. I know I brought it to the rim a couple times and brought it low and
turned it over. We were moving too fast. We didn't play at our pace and as far
as the shots, I mean, we should have knocked down more open shots but you
know, the game feels like that sometimes, and you know, we've just got to go
to the gym and work it out.  
  
JAYLEN HANDS: You know, not much you can see. Just got to get better. Make
more shots, make smarter plays. Just be better.  
  
Q. Why do you feel like you are on the trajectory of improvement now
versus when the season started? What areas has the team grown?  
KRIS WILKES: As far as the defensive-wise, I think our zone tonight was some
of the best we did all year. I think the main part was rebounding.  
  
Like Coach said, we didn't get a lot of offensive rebounds and I think that
was mostly a lot of the guards up to the and a lot of us just looking at the
ball and not getting it. We just have to work an the ball and we'll be good.  
  
Q. You guys have lost three in a row; you're not used to that. How hard
is that right now and what is it going to take to get it turned around?  
JAYLEN HANDS: We just got to get back to practice, get back to the gym and
compete with each other and come back out and fix it. We can't look in the
past. We have one more game non-conference in the Pac-12, just working hard
and getting better day-by-day.  
  
Q. Kaleb Wesson is coming off a 31-point game. In preparing for Ohio
State, how much did you focus on him, as opposed to maybe their guards?  
KRIS WILKES: We did focus a lot on him. We know he threw it in the post a lot,
but he didn't 30 tonight, I thought we did a decent job on him. I know he got
a couple easy buckets. I know we played hard and we dug hard like we should
have but I feel like we missed a lot of opportunities when we should have did
it, as well.  
  
Q. I know it was a tough game on Wednesday. What were the last two days
like and what was your prep work like? Was it really heavy? Did you do some
soul-searching?  
JAYLEN HANDS: It was a quick turnaround, so got on the flight and did a lot of
prep for Ohio State. You know, got together as a team and talked. We prepared
hard. They didn't do anything out there that we haven't seen, so that's what
the prep was like.  
  
Q. There was talk in Ohio State's conference and them struggling with
the zone against Syracuse. Is that something you noticed?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: They only lost one game and it happened to be Syracuse,
and obviously Syracuse is going to throw 40 minutes at you that way. We've
been working on it with our length. I think that's something we've got to
continue getting better at.  
  
I thought our slides, everything we were doing in our zone was pretty good. We
obviously had some break downs, but most of the breakdowns in the zone tonight
were off the backboards.  
  
So we've got to get back to work after the break and the guys have to look at
that and figure that out in our zone. I liked our -- we got some deflections.
We got some steals out of our zone. I did like that.  
  
Wesson is known to play man-to-man for a long period of time just because of
the space that he takes up, but other than board play, it was pretty good.  
  
Q. You got the good win against Notre Dame but the other major
conference teams you've played against, you've lost. In your history as a
close, when you enter into a Christmas break like this having lost those kind
of games against big opponents, do you have concern over your players'
collective mentality heading into Pac-12 play and them having the confidence
that they can turn things around inside the league?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: Well, that's what we have to do a good job with. In 2015,
we lost five in a row. We finished 7th in the Bahamas and got beat by Kentucky
by 40, and that team ended up going to the Sweet 16. It's not like it can't be
done.  
  
Our league has not performed well. That's obvious. As a whole, our league has
not done well out of conference, so we've got a lot of work to do from that
standpoint because that year we had a little bit more, I think opportunities,
in league play to get big wins, and this year out of conference, our league
hasn't performed well.  
  
We have to make sure by the time we get to Stanford and Cal week, the first
week in January, we're a better basketball team. We have the makings of it. We
have a lot of young guys, inexperienced, that hopefully this will help. I'm
not seeing them not being confident. I loved the effort today. I loved the
shot selection today. I'm probably just most disappointed in the board play
because we should be a good rebounding team but now we've got to get back
home.  
  
We've got two weeks at home, so we'll play Liberty at home and then we get
Stanford and Cal at home, so before we travel again, we've got to take care of
business in those three games and get out of the conference ahead.  
  
And so you know, the break will be good for them. It will be good for the
staff and then when we resume, I think we're going to have a group of guys,
they are starting to understand it. The teams we've gotten beat by are really
good. Ohio State is 11-1. Cincinnati doesn't lose at home very often.  
  
And we lost to a very good Belmont team; we were up 14 in the second half and
we went from like 3-for-18 from the free throw line. That doesn't happen very
often. If we make foul shots in that game, we win.  
  
So those things happen. This was a tough trip as far as not getting the win.
We did see some progression today and hopefully we can build on it.  
  
Q. How is this team different from when it opened the season? In what
areas do you see growth?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: Well, we're starting to see Cody getting more into it. I
think he had like 25 minutes tonight. This is his seventh or eighth game as a
college player, so he's starting to get a little more comfortable and we're
getting more comfortable how we can use him.  
  
Both coaches and players are getting more comfortable with him. Going to get
Alex back hopefully by the end of next week, so now we get an experienced guy.
Prince is the only player right now on our team with any experience at all,
and now we get Alex back. So I think that will help.  
  
We're just trying to figure out -- we're a three-point shooting team. That's
been our efficiency. That's where we've been and a lot of our issues have been
that we're not making enough, we're not shooting enough and then we're not
getting the ball inside out enough from an offensive standpoint.  
  
So I think we have to look at what our offense has to look like with this team
and then just keep building on what we're doing defensively. I think we're
seeing some growth defensively. Just the finishing of plays and being able to
do it for two halves, that's been a concern the last two games.  
  
Q. How have you processed some of the backlash and speculation about
your future in the middle of this difficult stretch?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: There's no -- there's no issue with that with me. I just
do my job as well as I possibly can and that's what I do every day. I'm a man
of God, so I've got an audience of one, and I shoot it up every day, work as
hard as I can for my guys and at the end of the day, if I know that I've
prepared and worked hard, then that's what matters to me.  
  
You know, obviously with its fans, whether it be at UCLA or anywhere else, you
always have those opinions. That's what you're dealt and I totally understand
that and I get that.  
  
I'm a fan of basketball. I'm not happy. I'm not happy with our losses. I'm not
happy with what happened Wednesday night and obviously not happy with getting
a loss tonight, but we're working, we're grinding, trying to stay positive
with a young group, an inexperienced group. Ohio State starts three seniors
tonight that have experience. They have been there and done that and one kid
is a fifth-year guy.  
  
We're battling as hard as we can, and we get it. We understand it's UCLA. But
when you've got -- we had six of them it was their first road game and it was
at Cincinnati, that's not easy. No excuses, but I've just got to show some
patience and I've got to be that leader for the group because right now,
finding a leader on our team is hard because I'm not sure anybody is equipped
to do it because of our youth.  
  
As coaches, we have to believe in them. They have to know that we believe in
them, and there's a good trust right now in our locker room among players and
coaches. We hang in there and we keep grinding and that's what we can control.
The other stuff, we can't control that, anyway.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana 71, Butler 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, go ahead and make an opening statement.  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Just a heck of a college basketball game. Another amazing
environment in here for the Crossroads. Got to give Butler a lot of credit,
they're a heck of a team, battle-tested. Have a lot of guys that have been in
a lot of big ones and won a lot of big games.  
  
Our guys for whatever reason, they just keep finding a way to muddy it up.
However many games it's been now in a row, seems like we're in those huddles
feeling the same way every game. They have a confidence about each other.
Sometimes it's a different guy. Sometimes it's the same guy. A lot of
different people, a lot of great attitude throughout a very tough game. I give
our guys some credit, as well.  
  
Rob obviously will be the hero with the game winner. But clearly there's a lot
of guys that did great things. Juwan Morgan had as good of a game as I've been
involved in in a long time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Take us through what you were looking for on the last possession.  
ARCHIE MILLER: We've run the action a few times in the game. Give them credit,
they really tried to do their best to take the ball and not let Romeo get a
catch, which is what we were trying to get. Either we didn't screen, because I
didn't see it, or it got blown up.  
  
They definitely tried to take the ball out of his hands, which it did, it
happened. Devonte was stuck, didn't panic a little bit. As the clock wound
down, he kind of got rid of the ball. Obviously Rob had the wherewithal to let
it go. I'd be lying if I said when he shot it, I didn't think it had a chance
to go in. I just didn't know the time.  
  
They definitely blew the play up. We weren't strong enough to execute it, get
the ball where we wanted to. It's part of getting better. We got to keep
getting better.  
  
Q. What do you enjoy about coaching Juwan Morgan?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Every day is the same. Game day is no different than practice.
Very few guys that can eliminate moodiness, the ability not to feel tired. For
about two years straight, through about 150 practices, that's what I get to
see every day. Not that his game days are perfectly. But the guy plays the
right way.  
  
To his credit, he's turned into a really good leader, vocally, he's the guy
that is kind of really evolved over the last year and some change.  
  
Q. Everyone is going to remember his three, but the possession before
when he drives the baseline.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, he kind of probed it, baseline, kept his dribble, didn't
panic. Justin circled into the area. He delivered a really nice bounce pass on
that. Tried to get a two-man game going on with that one with Romeo and Juwan.
Give Butler credit, continued to blow up actions and screens. He got around
the corner, he was able to make an assist.  
  
Q. On the final play, was Romeo supposed to get the ball in time to do a
two-man game with Juwan?  
ARCHIE MILLER: We wanted to get him open, get him sort of on a sweet spot
there in the top, see if he could have gotten downhill with his right hand. If
he would have caught it, I think he would have been able to. Again, give them
credit. We have to do a better job of executing the screen action.  
  
Q. You've talked about Juwan, but especially with this young team, how
important has he been?  
ARCHIE MILLER: You got to give him all the credit in the world. He's vocal in
huddles. He's really an extension of the staff. If you can communicate
something to him, he can get it communicated to the other guys. He's a smart,
smart basketball player.  
  
But definitely in huddles, you hear a guy talking, it's encouraging. I think
he gives everyone confidence on the team when he's engaged.  
  
When you see the face, the oldest face on the team, being the guy that
everyone sort of looks to when things aren't going really well, I think that
has to give people confidence. He definitely does that for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned you keep finding a way to muddy it up as a team. Is it
the same thing over and over or is it different areas?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I think the same thing over and over on the negative is our
lack of movement, our lack of action on offense. It turns into a standstill
game. You got to take care of the ball. Those two things really kind of get us
in tough spots. When we're sort of good, or we're better, we're able to
execute, we're able to get better possessions offensively because we shoot a
decent percentage.  
  
The thing that you got to hang your hat on at the end of the day is your
defense can hang in there when things aren't going well. When things have not
gone well for us, we have not quit, just stuck with it, and not that you're
perfect, but you're at least getting, hanging around, keeping yourself in it.  
  
If you look at the last 12, 16 minutes, I don't know what the score was, but
started to really consistently get some stops. I thought Rob on Baldwin,
although he's a tough guy to deal with, I thought Rob kind of hung in there
around the basket a few times, didn't bail out, kind of walled up and made
some tough stops. We got some rebounds. We were able to get the ball, at least
run a play.  
  
First half in particular, again, long rebounds. I think 23 points at halftime
where we second chance or we turn the ball over. Give them credit, second
half, I don't think that was the case. I think we only turned it over six
times in the second half. I believe we won the battle on the glass.  
  
It comes down to the little things. I think our guys believe if we continue to
play and work together defensively, we can win a game when we're not playing
real well. We've had to do that. I think when we get to the last eight, last
four, guys have some confidence that we're okay.  
  
Q. When the offense seems to be struggling early, Romeo has done a good
job of letting the game come to him, not forcing stuff, but he didn't score a
hoop till five minutes left in the first half. Do you need him to start
hunting shots earlier?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I think Romeo does a great job of just playing within himself.
In the first half, sometimes when the ball is going away from us, as a staff,
the ball is going away from you as a coach, you have to watch those guys and
let them play. When you're not doing real well working together out there, you
don't have the movement, you don't have the sharing, then he's not going to
get -- or any of them are not going to get the touches or the angles or reads
they need to go ahead.  
  
That's the things you need to get better at as a team. He hung in there. A
couple times I told him, You have to get yourself going on the glass, a couple
offensive rebounds. Butler is a tough team to drive on, just drive by your
man. They help, they're good on defense, big at the five.  
  
When he started to get rolling, he got going. He made some good plays for us
in the first and second half.  
  
Q. On Rob, what is it that's made him good late in games?  
ARCHIE MILLER: He's got confidence in himself. He's very competitive. It's a
quiet competitiveness that he has about him that he believes in kind of he can
get it done. I thought early in the game, I got him a quick blow early, I
thought he was a little bit jittery with the ball to start. As the game goes
on, you start to go with him. You have faith he's going to be able to get a
stop, hang in there defensively. For whatever reason, he's not afraid to take
or make a play when we need him to. He's just a solid, solid dude. He's a good
kid. Works his butt off. Hangs in there regardless of the circumstances in the
game.  
  
You watch a guy here recently in the last probably three games make some huge
plays for us.  
  
Q. You inherited this spot in this classic. Do you want to keep doing
this?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I tell you what, the environment in here is so NCAA tournament-
esque. It's so passionate, it's kind of hard not to want to be in here. For
Indiana and Indiana University, the city of Indianapolis, my feel is in here
this is a great environment for our team.  
  
I also think it's a hard, hard game for Indiana in here because I do think you
come in here and you get that bullseye put right on you regardless of the
circumstances that you have to play through that. It's a great opportunity for
the other two teams in the state. You're not going to get a chance to play
them often if it's not set up like this.  
  
For us, I've been in it twice, won two crazy games, clearly it feels really
good when you win. If it was on the other end, I probably would tell you the
opposite. But the environment for our players, though, is incredible to play
in. I would say that. It's an incredible venue. The fan base is obviously I
think very excited for it. So for us, to me this is nothing but a positive for
our university, our fans and our players most specifically. It's a great
chance for them to play in here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. We'll continue with the players.  
  
Q. Rob, the obvious question: take us through the last shot.  
ROB PHINISEE: Obviously it wasn't drawn up like that, but I saw Devonte
holding the ball. I slid over, put it up, prayed to God it went in (smiling).  
  
Q. Juwan, it's four straight games you have won now, all of them by one
possession. This is the widest margin of victory. What is it about this group
that keeps finding a way whatever the circumstances?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I just think we have a trust into each other, trust in the
system. We're all bought in. I think we'd like to get a couple, you know, wins
where it's not within the last 10 seconds where we win. At the same time, you
know, it's the ones that you grind out that are the best feeling. Come March
time, those are the ones you're really going to need.  
  
Q. You must like shooting in this building. When you see a freshman get
up and hit a shot like that, you were the first to congratulate him on the
baseline, but what did you see on that play? What was your perspective when
you saw the shot go in?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I saw a breakdown in the play we originally called. I saw him go
up and make a veteran shot. Like I said earlier, they're not really freshmen
any more, as you can tell from that shot, how they carry themselves. That was
a savvy move by Rob, and he knocked it down.  
  
Q. What is it about Juwan that in these tight games, how important is he
in huddles with his leadership?  
ROMEO LANGFORD: He's very important, just him being a veteran. We can lean on
him when times get rough to maybe get us going in general. He's not one of the
veterans that leads by example, he leads by example and his voice.  
  
Q. Rob, on Juwan, why do you feel he was so good today?  
ROB PHINISEE: Really we just tried to play inside-out. Once we knock down
threes, they have to help off of them. I feel like that opened up a couple
things for him. After that, he just did his thing. It worked out.  
  
Q. Rob, when the play broke down and Devonte had the ball, how conscious
were you of how much time was left when you got it back? Did you look at the
clock before you got it? Did you know there wasn't much time left?  
ROB PHINISEE: I knew there was probably around, I think, two or three seconds
left when he picked up his dribble. I just ran over because I saw Romeo being
denied.  
  
Q. Juwan, the Butler coach was talking about how when you're hitting
threes, making free throws, it just takes your game to a completely different
level. Talk about that.  
JUWAN MORGAN: I mean, it's what we work on every day. I've changed my free
throw up a lot this year. I think I found something that really works for me.
As you can see from tonight, I just stepped up with confidence, knocked them
down.  
  
Q. Juwan, what is it about this building that brings out the best in
you?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I don't know (smiling). I mean, I approach every game the same
way. Some games, the shots are going in. Usually if they're not going in, I
try to look for my teammates more, give them a shot.  
  
Q. Juwan, you scored your thousandth point this game. What does that
mean to you?  
JUWAN MORGAN: It means I guess I join a list of great players to have scored a
thousand before me. It's a great honor. But, you know, it's just one small
piece of the puzzle going forward.  
  
Q. Juwan, Butler coach said Rob was one of the best guards he's seen.
What has impressed you the most about his play?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Just how he carries himself. Like I said earlier in the season
as well, I said he's like the pitbull of the team. Starts with him. As soon as
the ball is tipped, he always has the first defensive or offensive possession.
We go as he goes. That's how I think about it.  
  
Q. Romeo, I thought you did a really nice job on their scoring leader
today defensively. Offensively you didn't get a bucket till maybe five minutes
left, only your second shot. You let the game come to you. Do you feel like
you need to start hunting shots a little earlier?  
ROMEO LANGFORD: Wouldn't necessarily say 'hunt for my shot'. You can always be
a little bit more aggressive. I feel like I need to start doing that, maybe
get our team going whenever they need me.  
  
I'm not just going to start hunting my shot because I haven't got a shot
within, like, three minutes. I'm going to keep letting the game come to me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: INDIANA VS
BUTLER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+INDIANA+VS+BUTLER)

  

## December 15, 2018

  

### [LaVall Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34451)

### [Sean McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35118)

### [Kamar Baldwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33252)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana 71, Butler 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, then questions.  
  
LaVALL JORDAN: The Crossroads is a great event to be a part of. Put Indiana
college basketball on that stage nationally, you should get games like that.
Obviously we'd rather end on the other side of it, where the shot goes in for
us. We've had those. Tonight the shot went in for them.  
  
I think it was a heck of a basketball game to watch. I'm sure hopefully a ton
of people tuned in. Our guys had a lot of fight in them. Two really good
teams, two really good programs competing. Somebody's got to win, somebody's
got to lose. Unfortunately tonight we were on the other side.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. They were really scuffling there on the final possession. Did you
feel with a second or two left, you had them where you wanted them?  
LaVALL JORDAN: We figured obviously Morgan and Langford -- Juwan Morgan is a
heck of a college basketball player, he competed, he willed in some shots,
free throws. We wanted to try to take those guys away, and we did.  
  
I've been telling our staff on film, Phinisee has been as impressive as any
guard I've seen. He's poised, a tough kid. He ended up with it. I thought we
did a good job containing, didn't let Langford get the ball, he heaved one in.  
  
Q. On Morgan, what makes him so tough to forward?  
LaVALL JORDAN: If he's hitting threes, he's a real problem. We know how good
he is inside. He got a lot of work done in there, as well. But if he's making
his free throws, 7-7 tonight, he stepped up and made threes from the corner. I
think it was just his competitive will.  
  
You love having guys like that, that have that about them. We have a few guys
like that, two of them are sitting with me, that will step up and make big
shots, no matter how the game is going. Kamar had a huge shot down the
stretch.  
  
That's the beauty of this game. That's why people talk about him as a good
player, in the class that he's in.  
  
Q. Had you thought of using Jordan any more in the second half? Did you
use him about as much as you thought?  
LaVALL JORDAN: It was dependent on the game. I thought he did a good job just
kind of letting it come to him when he got in early, not trying to do too
much. He was really locked in on the defensive end.  
  
We struggled to stop them, they shot 52%. He hasn't had the reps that these
guys had defensively. That played a big part in the decision in the second
half.  
  
Q. Kamar, the last possession, when you guys have them all the way out
there, he's taking that shot, do you feel pretty good about the defensive
possession you have to force him to make that thing?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Yeah, I would say so.  
  
LaVALL JORDAN: We probably wanted him to miss.  
  
KAMAR BALDWIN: What Coach said. But I think we did a good job not letting too
many guys get it. He just knocked in a tough one.  
  
Q. Sean, maybe not fair to ask a few minutes after the game, but do you
feel like the Bulldogs even in defeat made progress in this game?  
SEAN McDERMOTT: Yeah, I think we played pretty well as a team. We stayed
locked in. In the huddles, we were as connected as I think we've been all
season. Guys were talking on the court.  
  
I thought overall we played a really good game and it came down to a final
possession, and the kid made a tough shot.  
  
Q. Butler played pretty well on defense in the games coming up to this.
Did you think you were able to maintain that? Do you look at Indiana's field
goal percentage and you feel you were deficient in that area?  
LaVALL JORDAN: Yeah, it was kind of either high risk, high reward. We didn't
turn it over, they scored it. Obviously Morgan is a low down there, so you
have to make some decisions whether you're going to double-team or not. I
thought the zone affected him some. If he misses a couple threes he made,
maybe there's a different outcome to it.  
  
We've got to tighten some things up, no question about it. The competitive
will that our guys showed I thought was at a high, high level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

Notre Dame 88, Purdue 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
RYAN CLINE: Just ball screen defense. They just ran a basic motion ball screen
offense. It was just on our lapses. They got up good shots, knocked them down
early.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
RYAN CLINE: Yeah, I mean, I guess you would say that. Like I said, it was our
lapses. They got open shots.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TREVION WILLIAMS: Just putting in extra time in the gym. Like usually never
your name's going to be called. I haven't done many minutes. Just always
staying in the gym, that stuff pays off.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TREVION WILLIAMS: Getting in extra running, whether it's after practice,
before practice. Extra conditioning, elliptical, stuff like that with our
trainer. It's been helping a lot.  
  
It seems little, but it pays off when games come.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
RYAN CLINE: I think for us it's just knowing that we can't play through our
offense, we got to get stops. Got to make consecutive stops instead of one. We
just got to put it together.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Just kind of agree with what Ryan said. Just going to continue
to work.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
RYAN CLINE: Just being able to go into practice the next couple days before
our next game, just have energy, just play the way we know we can play.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
RYAN CLINE: I mean, it was fine. The confidence is always there, so it was
nice obviously.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Learn anything about our team? I mean, I feel like I know my
guys now. I mean, I depend on them. I feel like I know what I'm going to get
from them. We're going to continue to work.  
  
I don't think this is going to make me think differently or feel something
differently. I have guys around me that can play the game. We got to clean
some things up and we'll be okay.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I mean, what about it? Spark?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I mean, honestly to me that's not surprising. I know Tre
can play. He plays well, competes at practice, does all the things he needs to
do. When his name is called, he's ready. Not surprising at all to me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I thought today we just started the game off wrong. That's
what we really talked about, what we were able to do last year in this game
against Butler, being ready to play. We jumped on them early. Then we also
talked about the game two years ago against Notre Dame, where they jumped on
us early, then we had a great second half.  
  
Just not trying to put ourselves back in that position. I thought defensively
we had too many breakdowns early. Sometimes your breakdowns can get
camouflaged when you play well offensively. We didn't make enough shots there
in that stretch.  
  
I thought our defense was pretty good the last six, seven minutes of the first
half. But we just weren't consistent enough. We had some breakdowns where we
left some guys we didn't want to leave. When you get into that, you go back
and forth, now you're trying to outscore somebody, you're not going to win a
lot of basketball games that way.  
  
We have to do a better job on the defensive end of things.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah, we have to do a better job of keeping the ball in front of
us. I think when we do a good job with that, we stay out of rotations, and it
really helps us. So I think that's where it really starts.  
  
I'm just trying to be detailed in that so they can't move the ball quick on
you. Then you get in those rotations, have bad closeouts. Have to do a good
job when you get in those situations, but you have to limit them.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: It's hard to tell. I think people's offense is a little bit
ahead of their defense at time, and vice versa. You're projecting. You have to
be able to lean on people and I think that starts with everybody's experienced
players. You have to be good on both ends.  
  
We just have to do a better job of finding those guys. Right now we're just
not consistent when it comes to defense at all. We're playing three games on a
neutral court, know where you're going to be in three weeks. You just try to
get better each day.  
  
When we don't shoot the ball very well, you have those breakdowns, you're
going to get beat.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: He's a good player. Half of the shots he made were threes. He
went 3-3, 8-18 coming into the game. One of them our guys did what they were
supposed to. The other two were breakdowns. So we had to limit him.  
  
He made some of those points obviously at the end. We fouled for a long time.
There's some inflated stats there. But I thought he was very efficient. Any
time you can score 21 points, only take eight shots, it's a pretty good night.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: We're trying to stay into the basketball, ball screen defense,
to make it hard for them to pass. I think when you see some of those cross-
court passes, the guy on the basketball, the guy hedging, has to do a good job
of limiting their vision. You guys ask to get a general answer, and there's a
lot of different possessions and types of possessions.  
  
I thought we had times where we did a good job, we had other times where it
was a complete breakdown.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: He's a good player. He got in there, he's been wanting to play.
The other guys are in front of him. I think once you get an opportunity and
guys aren't productive -- and he was productive, that's definitely going to
help his cause.  
  
When you got two guys that are there that are fully capable, you know, it's
hard because you don't get much of an opportunity. Then when you do get one,
he played well. He definitely helped his case.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: When you lose 40 pounds, you're going to move better. But I
wasn't with him before. I recruited him, but I wasn't with him every single
day.  
  
It's hard to pick up everything when you're trying to transform your body.
You're not a very good listener when you're fatigued. I think for him, it was
just a lot at the same time. Then we run a lot of stuff. Being able to know
what's going on at all times is pretty difficult.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: Good hands, got long arms. He's got a good touch. The best thing
he does is rebound. He's a very good rebounder. He's going to have a good
career at our place.  
  
Q. Four seniors last year, all leaders. They finished games. Who is
filling that void in the leadership this year?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think those guys did a really good job in terms of kind
of all around play. They took care of the basketball. They made threes. They
had that experience. So right now, with the guys that are playing and doing
those things, it's a different type of team for us. We still had somebody
where we could go get a basket in Isaac Haas. You had other guys that have
great assist-turnover ratios. But they had growing pains when they were
younger. Trying to get leadership, you want leadership by action, by
everybody. Sometimes when you're searching to get the right group, you're
searching to get some of that, anybody who can do their job and play hard and
do the little things, you embrace.  
  
Obviously right now we're not at that place with this group.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: I thought we did all right. There are some areas of the game,
you out-rebound somebody by 10, have two fewer turnovers. You take 70 freaking
shots. You have 40 misses is your issue. We got to be able to convert things.
We had some hustle, got some offensive rebounds. I think there were some looks
out there, some shots we took that you'd like to have back. I don't think
there was an abundance of them.  
  
We got to be able to convert. We had the ball in the paint at times when we
didn't continue, a layup, a transition play, a runner. You got to be able to
convert.  
  
I thought we did an all right job. I don't have the numbers in front of me. I
think that's a hard thing for us at times, is when you do those things, is now
being able to finish it.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: Not really just because we came off of a 30-win season. We
really leaned on those guys. But the people that we play a lot are the people
that have been in our program. I think when you want and you've earned some of
those roles, but you also have to be able to keep everything together. It's a
fine line.  
  
Today it didn't come down to a possession game at the end. We've been in three
possession games that we could have finished out and we didn't. Our defense
wasn't as good in those games in the end as it was during stretches of those
games.  
  
Sometimes it's hard to assess. The one thing you got to be able to do as a
coach is just keep working. I think a lot of times when you don't win the
games that you think you should win, you're just in a lull, whatever it might
be. Is that growing pains or is that who you are? I don't want to admit that's
who we are. I want to think that we can get better. We have other things.  
  
We do have players. The guys that are playing the majority of our minutes are
people that played for us before. To me, when I look at that, we got to be
better together. I think we can all look at a box score, try to pull things
out. We have to get some of the same efforts we're getting on the glass. We
didn't do a good job of taking care of the basketball three, four games ago.
We really made a conscious effort to do that. The last two games, we've had
six and seven turnovers, and we still lose the game. Still only one aspect of
the game. There's a lot of other aspects. Just because you cover one hole up,
you have another hole coming, you still got to be able to do those things
well.  
  
We just need more consistency, need to keep working. We've tried to do more as
the whole in practice, do things, so we cover what somebody is going to do. I
think that's important at times. But you also got to teach them the part where
you're having discipline, you're detailed in whatever you're doing, whether
ball screen defense, post defense, what have you.  
  
I like our guys. I think we got good guys. I don't like our fight right now.
We have to have more of a fight to us.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: No question. Boy, when it happens back-to-back, you got to look
at yourself. It's not like we're giving it to them, but you play the
percentages. You don't give somebody anything. We talked about that. I don't
even know what his numbers are. They weren't great.  
  
We talked about Gibbs. He had shot 34% going into this game. We talked about,
he's better than that. He's not a 34% shooter. We talked about that with Matt
Coleman. Matt Coleman from Texas is 33%, ended up scoring two against us.  
  
D.J. Harvey was good, Mooney was efficient. Look at their bench. Dane made a
couple good pull-ups, he's 4-5. He's solid. Durham comes in, he's 3-5. We got
some consistent play from a lot of people.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: I think we have it. I talked to our guys about it. You have to
get over yourself. It's a real hard thing to do. I don't know how many people
we have here that played high school basketball, then played college
basketball. In high school basketball, like you know how many points you have
in your head. It's a real selfish thing, but it's a very natural thing because
your whole life, you've equated playing well to scoring. As you grow in
college, and you can get there, you have to normally play a role before you
can be a major guy. Sometimes you never get out of that role, you're always a
role player.  
  
You have to be able to give yourself to the team but get over, you know, those
type of things, those kind of... You're not going to get on this team if you
can just shoot well and that's it, be able to help us. We need everybody to be
able to defend. We need everybody to be able to do other things. Right now
we're not very good at that. When we sub young guys in, they play off the
looks that they get. You can see it in their body language, and older guys.
It's not just those guys. It's kind of everybody.  
  
Each guy is different. Everything can't be the same for each guy. You're going
to have different people taking different shots, taking more volume of shots.
But you got to be able to get over yourself and sacrifice. When you look over
there and you see guys cheering, giving energy, you're normally going to go in
the game and play better. Those guys sitting there, being duds, not cheering
for the team. When you get the opportunity, you don't play well.  
  
It's really a maturation process. You always are going to have a guy or two on
your team that way. You just are. That doesn't change when you deal with 19-
to 22-year-olds. We have a lot of good guys on our team, but too many people
are searching for answers through their jumpers. You got to compete and scrap.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: There's urgency always. Whether we won or lost this game, we're
still going to practice, try to get better, beat our next opponent.  
  
We're very fortunate that we're in a good league and we're going to have a lot
of opportunities. You don't like to see opportunities go past because you want
to get wins and keep building your résumé, so there's definitely a sense of
urgency. But there would be anyways.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MATT PAINTER: No, not at all. Not at all. He can score all day long. He should
be able to play another game right now. Think about it. If you want to play in
the NBA, they play 82 games. We're playing 30. There's no comparison. When
those guys want to go from 20 to 21 or 21 to 22, make that jump, if you can't
handle playing in a basketball game twice a week, boy, I don't know what the
next one is going to look for.  
  
That's the world he lives in. He's talented. He can play at the next level. He
should be able to lace it up right now and play another game. He's that
explosive, he's that athletic, he's in shape. He takes care of himself.  
  
I'm not worried about that. It's good to get him a couple minutes in each
half. He seems to be better when you do that coming down the stretch.  
  
Why when we lose you want to talk forever. When we win, you guys don't say
shit. Explain that (smiling). Unbelievable. You're better than that.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: PURDUE VS NOTRE
DAME](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+PURDUE+VS+NOTRE+DAME)

  

## December 15, 2018

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [John Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36337)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Notre Dame 88, Purdue 80  
  
MIKE BREY: What an afternoon of growth for our game. I'm really proud of our
team. We were heartbroken in Los Angeles the other night. To finish the way we
did, I thought we put two halves of offense together. We haven't been able to
do that in the last three games away from our building. So many guys in new
roles made big plays in a big game, in a big atmosphere. I feel we can grow
off of it.  
  
This guy to my right continues to look like one of the best frontline players
in the ACC. He's just getting better and better and better.  
  
Going to do a little MRI next week. So we don't know. That's the one thing
that's really sad because he was fabulous. He jump-started us with his play
making. You know, it didn't look good.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIKE BREY: I thought we swung the ball and moved the ball better. We didn't
hold it. We have a tendency sometimes after three passes to hold it or ball
screen too early. I thought we got post touches to Johnny and Juwan. That
helps our offense. I think we had 20 assists today, which that's a little bit
of how we play offensively.  
  
But I actually felt even with the second halves last week, the three days of
practice this week, we were finding our flow offensively. We did it for 40
minutes tonight, which is something to build on.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIKE BREY: No question. Whew. This is huge for us. Again, we lost to two good
teams away from our building in Oklahoma and UCLA. If you get out of this
stretch 0-3, you're digging out of a hole for a while.  
  
But this is a quality win for us. Purdue is going to have a heck of a year,
especially when they get into the Big Ten. For us, are there must wins in
December? We certainly were staring at one probably today.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, we were moving good. I think, again, it's something to look
at. But I think we've been trending that way. I think we've been trending
better offensively. Starting with the DePaul game, up to UCLA, it's been
second half offense. We haven't been able to do it for 40.  
  
Today we got out of the gate, played good offense, smart offense, for 40
minutes, close to 40.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIKE BREY: Big-time. He's one fearless guy. As you can see, we're really,
really confident in him. He has been coming in there early. We even downshift
our lineup and put him in there as the four man.  
  
He is a fearless winner. For him, he's got to be even more confident after
this afternoon.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, it's huge. I think every time since I've been here we came
-- we've been up at half by about 10, then we've kind of let it get away from
us in the second half. Kind of a similar situation today.  
  
But we closed it out. Like Coach said, they're a great team. That's definitely
big for us. Hopefully we can keep trending upwards.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, just guys making plays. We're kind of a younger group right
now. With time, down the stretch, the last five minutes, guys are going too
start making plays, like we did today. Made free throws, made some big shots,
got key stops. That's definitely good. Hopefully we can use that as momentum
moving forward.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, just moving the ball. Our guards were really good today.
Especially Rex, T.J., Prentiss setting the tone, finding us. I think Rex had
10 assists, which is insane. They're doing great. Starts with them moving the
ball. I think we did that today. So that's something to build on, too.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOHN MOONEY: No, I don't think so. We're a confident group. From 1 to 12,
everyone kind of believes in each other, believes in themselves. We're a
confident group.  
  
Yeah, they did kind of get it close there. It's just a matter of getting the
guys together, calming everyone down, taking a deep breath, just playing. We
did that.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, you know, I think it's been a hallmark of our program, that
we've been able to make big free throws. We went through a stretch in some of
our home games where we didn't shoot it as well. I just always felt that would
be a great weapon for us. To make game pressure free throws, different guys do
it in the last couple minutes, is I think something that will help all guys'
confidence, young guys especially.  
  
Thank you.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Trent Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34688)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Xavier - 83, Illinois - 74  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Give Xavier a lot of credit. They did something that they had
not been doing at a real high clip, and that was making threes. I felt like
offensively we played well enough in the first half and we forced 11
turnovers, and yet they shoot close to 70 percent. And it then compounds. And
we opened the second half in zone, and then we had three straight missed
assignments. And then it mounts. And that's something that we have got to,
I've got to do a better job of. This is on me. This is a young team. I knew we
were going to get three unbelievable opponents in this. The thing that I'm
striving for at Illinois. When you look at all of those banners, there's the
Zona way, the Duke way, the Zag way, right on down the list. Xavier's 23 of 24
NCAA tournaments or whatever, some crazy number. They have their programs
established. I don't want good teams, I want great programs. And we have got
to find our way. We're still building that. The guy to my left's going to be
at the forefront of that. But again give Xavier all the credit. They made
shots and then literally Tyrique Jones was just a man amongst boys.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for Trent?  
  
Q. Trent, after not getting a win here what's your biggest concern or
what do you think you guys need to adjust to most?  
TRENT FRAZIER: As a leader, like he said, I know what Coach Underwood wants
out of this program. And I know what he wants out of this system and what the
offense he runs. I think for me I got to do a better job as a leader. I'm not
a veteran, but I'm a veteran. Down the stretch I was a little vocal but I got
to be more vocal. I got to bring my teammates together. We kind of tend to
just go our separate ways and get mad at each other and I think that's what
caused us not to get a win tonight. But for me I just got to be more of a
leader, be more vocal and we just got to stay together, man. I think that's
the biggest thing. Coach -- I think coach is doing an unbelievable job with
this program. He's trying to change it, he's working his ass off. I'm with
him. I'm going to come out and play hard every night, whether the ball's going
in or not and I'm just going to give it my all.  
  
Q. Trent, coach said you guys learned a lot about your self on this
trip, whether good or bad, how do you feel like or what do you feel like you
guys learned after three games?  
TRENT FRAZIER: I think what he means by that is three games in a row, against
three great powerful teams, what it shows is if you can, if you come back the
next day and play, come hard and play 40 minutes a game. I think we did that
against Gonzaga. We played incredibly hard. But these last two nights we
didn't play the Illini way. Like I said before, we tend to just go our
separate ways. We didn't have enough fight tonight or yesterday. And I think
that's the thing right there. We got to come out and play hard every night and
play for 40 minutes. I'm not into the -- obviously, we got a lot of young guys
and new players. I'm not into that. Coach Underwood recruited these guys for a
reason and he's going to put them out there. So I think that's the biggest
thing, we just got to stay together and just keep playing hard.  
  
Q. You and Ayo both over 18 tonight, just how do you feel you guys
playing together and what do you think of his performance so far?  
TRENT FRAZIER: He can score the ball incredibly. I think the main thing for me
is me just communicating and be more vocal to him as we got to sit down and
guard more. Defensively I didn't think we were really good tonight. We got to
rebound. Coach Underwood's going to put five guards out there under 6'-5" and
that, he preaches to us me, Drey, Ayo we got to rebound, we got to rebound, we
got to rebound, you know. Giorgi is working his ass out there, pardon my
language, but he's working his behind off out there and I think the three of
us we just got to focus in and be better defensively. Offense will come
easily. I think we have the best three guards in The 10. So I'm not really
worried about offense, just sitting down and guarding and just helping,
helping our bigs out more, it's going to open up, give us some wins.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Is there anything that you're not concerned about from a fundamentals
point with this team?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: No. No, we got to get better in every facet of the game. It is
my job to get them to do that, it is my job to get them to carry over what we
do in practice to a game. That is really challenging. And yet I think it's
very important to understand, we had the ball down two with 10 seconds to go
by arguably the best team in the country -- or they at least tried to prove
that today by beating Duke -- Gonzaga. And yet there's a lot of adversity that
happens when you lose. We have to learn to handle that. Our guys have not.
There's a lot of those guys in there we said we recruited winners, have never
lost. But it's a completely different game at this level and you have to learn
to do it every night, every possession and every second. And we're making too
many mistakes. I mean we just are. In the first three possessions of the
second half -- Alan is going to be a tremendous player, Al made three
consecutive mistakes defensively. And that's my fault, I got to get him to
understand how to do his job better.  
  
Q. You said you recruited winners and obviously this program hasn't won
in a while, how tough is that, what are the challenges of changing that, of
even new players coming into a new program struggling to win?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Absolutely and that's what we are here trying to do. And
understand, I keep saying it, you can have good teams, I could have gone out
and got all grad transfers, okay? But this program has to stand for what is
right and how they're going to be. And there's a certain way -- and we can
talk about the two teams in the championship today, okay, there's a certain
way they do things and there's a certain way they recruit and there's a
certain energy and passion that those programs play for every single night.
And I didn't see the Gonzaga players -- and I watched the game in its entirety
-- I didn't see the Gonzaga players ever get frustrated, ever lose their mind
when Duke made their run. We have to establish that. And it maybe takes that
shot against Gonzaga to get you over the corner so you learn how to win once.
But understanding how to handle losing is something that we have got to handle
and we have got to grow from. And it's not having guys do one thing. Guys have
to learn to do multiple things. Not just score, but rebound and sit down and
guard. And when your job is to jump to the ball and get into a gap, you got to
do that. When your job's to block out, you got to block out. Right now we're
not consistently doing multiple things.  
  
Q. You said you went zone a little bit in the second half, obviously
here the points in the paint was a huge advantage to your opponents. Obviously
you don't have as many posts as you want, but do you think you got to make a
change defensively or what do you have to do to stop that?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, I mean we played pretty good against the best team in
the country. And I think it's finding the consistency that young people need
to have. I'm more concerned with our fouling and I thought we did a better job
of that tonight than I am philosophically what we do. I mean you can say, well
we'll play zone. We played zone tonight, same thing. And it's, again, it's
about being assignment sound and being better. And that's my job, I got to do
a better job with those guys getting them to do what we do.  
  
Q. One of the follow-up a little bit in terms of controlling fouling.
You see Giorgi, you're better when he's on the floor, he picks up some early
fouls and he's going to the bench. How can you get them to think about being
aggressive yet knowing that they're important to be on the floor rather than
sitting next to you on the bench?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, there's a maturity that has to happen with that. You
look at Giorgi's four fouls last night, they were all four fouls. And one is
just a post up where he just wraps his arms around a guy, the second half one
is a hook, then there's a shove. And he's got to understand that nobody's
picking on him, it's not personal, but you got a value. He's a really, really
good player and he established that probably against one of the best front
court guys in Gonzaga's Clark kid. And, yeah, when we didn't have him last
night against Iowa State he impacts our team dramatically. And it's constant
talking. You saw me every timeout every time I took him out he and having a
conversation. And those will continue. One of the tendencies of young guys is
to foul, one of the tendencies of young guys is to become frustrated. He does
both.  
  
Q. To follow-up a little bit, I know in the pretournament conference we
had a question with you about just the 30 year anniversary of the Fighting
Illini making a run to the Final Four, having that culture. Illinois's had a
culture, how much do these young men understand that culture of the program
that they're standing on those shoulders?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, they know the history. They have no idea about what that
'89 team did or what that 2005 team did. That 2005 team, they were three, you
know, and in diapers. So the difference is a lot of those have continued to
stay successful, we haven't. So now we're fighting for that culture back. We
bring guys in and talk to them all the time about the Illini Way. We have the
best fans in the country, there's 15,000 every night, you saw how they
traveled out here. And our fans have stuck with us through thick and thin. But
I like the foundation that we're laying and continuing to build and we're
going to fight for that every single day. And we have proven -- Ayo's a really
good player, okay? Ayo as he continues to mature and develop, as Trent did
last year, is going to develop into a heck of a college basketball player.
Adonis De La Rosa is the first time of any real, real playing time, coming off
an ACL. Giorgi. We're still finding our way. It's the first time we really
played with AD. We're just finding our way. But the thing is -- and I'm going
to say this -- we had a freshman leave his shooting shirt in the hotel room.
Okay, good programs, you're mentally prepared for the game. You don't do that.
Those things don't happen. And that's what we're trying to establish in being
the Illini Way is that, man, it is all for one, one for all, and we're going
to learn to win those games because we're that type. And we're that close.
That's what '89 did, that's what 2005 did, that's what all those great teams
do and by golly we're going to continue to fight for that.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Travis Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36242)

### [Elias Harden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36263)

### [Naji Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36264)

### [Quentin Goodin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32841)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Xavier - 83, Illinois - 74  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: I thought obviously Illinois is a really good team. Really
proud of our guys staying with it for 40 minutes. I thought that was just the
first time that we had stuck through a whole game for 40 minutes. And I
thought we played the right way offensively. We had a couple long meetings
over the last few days. And chemistry takes awhile to develop and I think our
guys grew up a lot out here in Maui and that's why we want to play in this
event. You want to play against great teams and some of the best teams in the
country to help prepare you for our league in the Big East which is really one
of the top premier leagues in the country and we got that. Obviously got that
with today with Illinois. But I think we grew up quite a bit on the offensive
end and the defensive end while we were out here.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Quentin, how much did you feel like this team needed this win
tonight?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: It always feels good to win. Helps with your confidence. I
feel like we went out and played hard and we came out with the win, which we
deserved.  
  
Q. For all the players, coach was talking about you having long
meetings. What did you say to each other to try to get yourselves back on
track? What are some of the things you tried to stress between all of you to
try to get yourself focused?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: We watched a lot of film these past few days, watching our
mistakes and learning from them. One of the biggest keys was just moving and
sharing the ball. And I feel like we came out and we emphasize that today and
that's what helped with the win.  
  
ELIAS HARDEN: It was a great feeling. But first I just want to thank my
teammates for sure, just trusting in me. My coach as well. But it felt good to
be out there. My freshman year didn't play as much, but just waiting on my
opportunity and my time came today, so I'm just thankful for the opportunity
today.  
  
Q. Quentin, what's the difference between the team that came to Maui for
this event and the team that's leaving?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: The trust level. I feel like today we had a lot of trust in
each other. I feel like we believed in each other and we communicated more
this last game and you could see that on the court. And we were having fun
today and I feel look over all that's what it was.  
  
Q. Naji, what did it mean for this team to have Elias and Keonte come in
and contribute the way they did tonight?  
NAJI MARSHALL: It meant a lot. We're going to need those guys down the stretch
and they just showed us today early in the season that at any given moment
when it's their time they can come in and step up.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I felt like you guys really passed the ball
well tonight, like all the way around, and it really made a difference in the
way you guys looked offensively. Did you kind of feel that? Was that the plan
coming in tonight?  
ELIAS HARDEN: Yeah. Yesterday like Quentin mentioned and Coach Steele, we had
a meeting and the emphasis was just taking care of the ball. But also whether
it's that next pass or landing on two to make that next person open, that was
kind of the emphasis for us. So I felt like just these past few days it's been
landing on two, just making that extra pass. Because lately we have been, I
guess you could kind of say just out of control, but today I felt like we were
under control as a team. So, yes.  
  
QUENTIN GOODIN: I was going to say -- actually he said it all. Never mind.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Quentin, you got hung up on a screen there in the second half, looked
like you hurt your shoulder. What happened there?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: He kind of just made -- I don't know if Reed called out the
screen or not, but I didn't hear it and I just kind of ran into the dude. I
just - my arm because it was just unexpected, but I'm fine. I'm good. I'm
healthy, so I'm fine.  
  
Q. A question for you and for Naji. A lot of talk before this season
with you guys playing new roles. Do you feel like tonight you were able to
feel comfortable playing the roles that you will play the rest of the
season?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: Absolutely. I give the credit to Coach Steele and the rest of
the coaching staff, just showing our mistakes and where to learn from them.
And I feel like we learned today and we didn't make those same mistakes as we
did in the past.  
  
NAJI MARSHALL: What was the question again?  
  
Q. How do you feel in your new role?  
NAJI MARSHALL: Very comfortable. Basically we need to share the ball to be a
good team. We stepped up big time this whole time in Maui on the defensive
end, and really kind of worked on our stuff offensively and on the offensive
end. So, yeah, I love the role, just sharing the ball, playing as hard as can
I for my team. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Did you get any help in this scout from your brother? Did John say
anything last night?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Honestly, I didn't even talk to him. He's busy. I think they're
in their own tournament down in the Cayman Islands, so I did not speak with
him about Illinois at all.  
  
Q. Same question I asked the guys. What did you think about the
contributions of Elias and Keonte and how they helped you tonight?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Those guys were huge off the bench. I thought all of our bench
guys were. Zach Hankins was tremendous as well. I think Keonte and Elias -- I
always say this, playing time is earned in practice. That's where it always
starts with us and always ends. And so those guys got significantly better
over the course of where they were when we first started practice, whatever it
was September 26th, 25th, whenever that was. They have gotten a lot better,
and they have gotten more consistent in practice and they're going to get more
time. And when you play three games in three days you have to have depth. And
Keonte and Elias really stepped up, and that's they have been playing in
practice as well, both on the defensive end and the offensive end and we need
to continue to develop those guys. But I think the only way to really develop
as a player, you need a chance. You got to be able to play. And those guys
took advantage of their opportunity tonight, for sure.  
  
Q. What are you going to leave here having learned about this team, do
you think?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I think obviously when you play in a good field, all the good
programs that are out here and we took two losses to start the, to start the
tournament here, we hit some adversity. And you always wonder how you're going
to respond, how are guys going to act, are they going to start to become more
fractured, which can happen to teams. I thought our team really came together.
And it's nice kind of getting away from Xavier and Cincinnati because you
start to learn a lot about your self. You spend a little bit more time even
together, and I thought through film -- because I said it after the San Diego
State game, I really feel like instead of just playing Illinois or you're
playing San Diego State or you're playing against whoever you're playing,
doesn't really matter. You're competing against your own self. We want to
execute our system, share the ball, which I thought our guys did. I think we
have gotten better within our defensive system. We're not perfect, but we have
gotten better. And we're looking to obviously continue to improve. But we have
taken a big step forward, I think, on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Third game in three days. Underwood came out and pressed you and ran
players in and out of the lineup indiscriminately early. How proud are you of
your team for handling all that stuff?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Yeah, Illinois's a tremendous, they're going to put tremendous
amounts of pressure on you whether it's a press, their 1-3-1, how they play in
the half court man-to-man defensive-wise. They turn you over and they try to
wear you down. And I was really proud of our guys. I thought we grew up a
little bit as far as like time and score even at the end. Like I thought like
our guys did a better job of managing the clock. Wasn't perfect and we still
got to continue to grow in those areas, but I was really proud of the way that
our game went. I know we ended up with 17 turnovers, but again, that's what
Illinois does. I thought we had several tremendous possessions, where I felt
like we were really in control on the offensive end and didn't let their
defense dictate it.  
  
Q. What about the overall floor game of Paul Scruggs? He's the energy
guy.  
TRAVIS STEELE: He is. He's kind of our glue guy in a lot of ways. He's just a
tough kid, he rebounds the ball, he'll defend, he makes hustle plays, big
blocks, he'll take a charge, he'll fill the stat sheet with rebounds, assists,
points, the whole deal. He's a tremendous player and he's got to the continue
to grow moving forward.

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Michael Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36254)

### [Marial Shayok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30844)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Iowa State - 87, SDSU - 57  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
STEVE PROHM: First off just want to thank everybody that's a part of hosting
this event, I know Coach Odom is out there, this was an unbelievable
opportunity for our program our school, our team, these players, myself and
the coaching staff and then our fan base the way they travel out here. So
first off just thanks for a really, really great experience. Hopefully we can
be back here at some point in the future. This was a great win, obviously a
lot better feeling than after the Arizona game to come back and go 2-1 against
a really strong field and get two wins that hopefully can help us later on
down the line. Proud of these guys' effort on both end of the floor. We got a
lot of respect for San Diego State and Brian's team. Today we made shots and
were able to do a good job defensively and that kind of spear headed us. So
I'll turn it over for the guys.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Marial, you came into the game with a sprained knee, what kind of
effect did that have on you if any today?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I had trouble moving laterally and then just wasn't the same
explosive-wise, but just wanted to come out here and play as hard as I can for
my teammates.  
  
Q. Was there any doubt that you could play?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: No, I definitely had to play for my guys, man, and I knew as
long as I got it warm I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Mike, how do you guys feel like you performed all three games I guess
relative to your own expectations for yourselves?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, I mean, obviously, we were coming out here to win the
whole thing, that didn't happen, had some trouble against Arizona, but we said
they're a very good team, but we knew we had to bounce back, three games in
three days and you can't really hold your head too much, you got to pick
yourself back up and come ready to play the next day because as coach said
it's a very high level of basketball out here and we just knew we needed to be
ready to go for day two and day three.  
  
Q. For both you guys, what did you learn in these whatever three games
about your team?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I thought we learned that we have to stay relentless even when
you have the lead and that was a big learning experience in that Arizona game.
So I think we learned from that and bounced back pretty well today, especially
going into halftime with the lead.  
  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, I would reiterate that. Just being up 10 against
Arizona we got to finish that game off better. They did some really good
things but, yeah, just holding on to leads and finishing games out the right
way and just staying relentless on the defensive end I think it's going to
start on defense for us and if we'll be able to do that we'll get out in
transition and get good shots and that's where I think our best offense is.  
  
Q. The first two games here they gave up a whole bunch of threes and
that's how they got behind in the first two, were you aware of that and what
were you seeing out there with the threes, were they giving them to you or
were you just hot?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I just got -- we took good shots and found each other and today
they started to fall and we just tried to keep each other confident about it
and we're just glad it fell today.  
  
Q. For both you, how has it been staying at the Sheraton during the
workers strike and have you had to change any plans because of it?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: I don't think we tried to change any plans as far as I know.
It's been good. Hospitality has been great, it's been an awesome experience
out here, something I never thought I would be able to do. I had a ton of fun
with it, haven't heard them too much or anything like that. We kind of went in
a side entrance, so I don't know if that was a change of plans from
originally, but, no, it's been good and I've been able to enjoy my trip to the
fullest, I think.  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I thought it was a great trip just like Mike said.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. After your team had such a good showing here the question becomes
what happens once you guys get healthy in the rotation, how do you work that
out?  
STEVE PROHM: That's been in the back of my mind for awhile, I probably think
about it every day. We have got a week off, we get home tomorrow afternoon,
watch the Redskins/Cowboys game and then we'll get back on the floor Saturday.
Then we play Monday and if it's all good Cameron and Zoran will join us back
on December 3rd. And so we really have that week for me to really sit down
with my staff at that point -- I've kind of got in the back of my mind things
that we may need if we're big at times, things we need to put if in Lard and
Jackson are in the game at the same time, things like that. But I think the
biggest thing, especially as we add some good players back into the fold is to
keep preaching the same message to these guys and that's just don't seek
honor, honor will find you, be selfless, and play for Iowa State. And if we
can do that, then everybody will benefit. Everybody's just got to buy into
their role and max out their job, but obviously it's in the back of my mind
and we just got to continue to do a good job. We have good relations with our
kids, I think they trust us, so we got to continue to invest in them and we'll
have that week off though and that will be a big week for us to try to instill
some other things.  
  
Q. With especially McDaniels in the lane was it a conscious effort to
shoot a lot of threes today?  
STEVE PROHM: No, I know we had that question earlier, I watched the first half
of Xavier, I watched the whole Xavier game yesterday, but the first half
Xavier was terrific from three. I really don't, I'm more worried about how
they cover ball screens or what they're going to do on certain situations than
I am telling guys what to shoot and what not to shoot. I'm not a big fan of
that. That's why you probably watch us play and you say, man, he let's them
shoot some crazy shots and then you watch us play and then the ball moves
really well. I don't like to over analyze some of that. What we did today that
we hadn't done the first two game here is we really made threes but I thought
we shot better threes too. Shayok shot it really well today and then Tyrese
who can shoot it he finally stepped out and made shots today.  
  
Q. When Cam and Solo went down, you talked about watching Mike and
evaluating him differently because of a different role. With what this team
did this week without the guys that you presumably will be adding shortly, do
you start to judge this team different or evaluate differently against
expectations, I guess?  
STEVE PROHM: A day at a time. Humility. Like I said last year, going through
last year was tough, you have to have great humility in success, you have to
have great humility in failure and so this team just needs to stay humble.
When we get home we got two days of rest, obviously Marial's feet up, Mike's
feet up. We just got to get home, get rested, be smart with them Saturday and
Sunday. I know we got a good team coming in Monday night, but our expectations
is just to be great every day and wherever that puts us at the end of the year
it puts us. But if we're selfless and humble I think this team -- I said from
the very beginning, I like this group, I like being around them.  
  
Q. Obviously people in your league know your style and are able to
prepare for it. How hard is it for a team that's never seen you or never
played against that style and to do it in a 24 hour turn around?  
STEVE PROHM: With all these games they're tough turn around because you're one
day prep because we're trying to figure out how you're going to guard
McDaniels. And I thought we did a good job of just trying to keep him off
balance, but they're really good and so it's hard to prep for them, Illinois
is a hard one day prep. It's tough to prep for any team in one day and really
not even one day, it's it could be 12, 15 hours. So that's the thing that we
have got to challenge our guys with as we get into guys that know us better is
what wrinkles can we do, how we have to be more efficient, why shot selection
is so important because the scouting will continue to come and increase.  
  
Q. Same question for you, how has it been staying at the Sheraton during
the strike and have you guys had to change any plans because of it?  
STEVE PROHM: No, we haven't changed. Big thing I was just is the food going to
be good? Food was great. Everything was great. The people over there, I think
went out of their way to help us from the day we got there, Coach Odom
welcomed us. And then we're obviously leaving here tonight, there's been not
one hiccup in anything in our itinerary at all so I appreciate everybody
rallying around and making a great -- this was a great experience, it's really
a dream come true for a lot of us being out here.

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [Malik Dunbar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36265)

### [Bryce Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35076)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Auburn - 73, Arizona - 57  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: Again, you can't help but just be honored to be in this field, in
this incredible tournament. And then really proud that you represented. Our
fans represented and traveled so well. Our families were here. Our kids
learned a lot about ourselves and the possibilities for our basketball team.
We got a lot of room to get better. We beat a historic program tonight in
Arizona. I told my guys that Sean Miller gets his guys to play as hard as
anybody out there and to me they're one of the better ball screen defensive
teams we would see all season long. So we had to find a way to beat them
without ball screens. And the last thing I'll just say I'm really proud of
these guys. Bryce broke the all time record for 3-pointers at Auburn. Wesley
Person is probably who he surpassed, I would guess, and then Malik Dunbar led
our guys off the bench. We outscored them 33 to 4. But that's the key to our
success is when we go to the bench and we don't drop off, which I know we're
capable of, and tonight we showed it. I just, I like the way the guys too --
because the guys who were on the bench are everybody's favorite. They're just
everybody's favorite. And fact that those guys stayed ready, stayed right, and
made a huge difference in our win is very much appreciated.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. For both you guys, just tell me what was it like playing in the Maui
Invitational, something you probably watched growing up. And then did it live
up to what you guys thought it would be?  
BRYCE BROWN: Yeah, it was a very exciting tournament. Just by watching other
teams, playing in it, growing up watching it, I just feel like it was a good
turning point for our team and letting us know where we could hang with
certain teams. As you know we hung in there with Duke, beat two very good
programs. So it just let's us know where we are as a team and I feel like it
can only, it's only up from here.  
  
MALIK DUNBAR: The same. I just feel like it was a blessing to be here,
blessing for the opportunity, a blessing to play at -- some top teams and so
that we can stick with the best teams and show what we're capable of. So I'm
just appreciative to be here for real.  
  
Q. Y'all aren't even a hundred percent yet with Purifoy on his way
coming back. How much confidence do you get knowing that this team's going to
get another guy that can help the team in a couple weeks?  
BRYCE BROWN: He stretches the floor for us, good facilitator, has good court
vision. He does nothing but help us. Just brings us depth and allows us to be
a better team.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach Odom just talked about the football team, and but you've been
trying to build this brand in basketball. What does it feel like to kind of
begin and shed some light on here before the Iron Bowl?  
BRUCE PEARL: Let me tell you something. Auburn is a football school. Auburn is
a football school. Auburn is a football school. And I'm proud of that. We're
pretty good in men's basketball too. Pretty good in women's basketball. Soccer
team's terrific. We win in golf, tennis, swimming, baseball, gymnastics, I'm
probably leaving several teams out. So for me -- the equestrian was the
national champion last year. To bring Auburn's men's basketball back to
credibility on campus is really gratifying right now. We have got a good team,
we'll see what we can do, see where we can get better. I'm happy for the
lettermen, I'm happy for guys like Charles Barkley who can sit there on a
prime time night last night and watch Auburn battle Duke -- and we didn't play
well, we played hard, and learned a lot about our team. Beat a historic
program, beat two historic programs in Xavier and Arizona. If you look over
the last 15 years, Xavier and Arizona are probably two of the Top-10 programs
in the country. And Auburn basketball just beat those teams. So that's, we're
very proud.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Chase Jeter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36246)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Auburn - 73, Arizona - 57  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
SEAN MILLER: I think that we played one of the top teams in the country. We
knew that before the game started. And we really struggled in the first half
to score. Credit their defense. And then we really hit our stride, I think
really the first eight to 10 minutes of the second half. And a very similar
story to Gonzaga. Right in around that six minute mark. Last night's game
against Gonzaga with six minutes and 20 seconds to go, we were down two
points, I think it was 64-62, and they really put it on us down the stretch.
Tonight was very similar. I think right around the eight minute mark, although
it was a little bit more than two points, I think it was a game that maybe
could have gone either way if we play well down the stretch. But we didn't. We
didn't have enough in either game and obviously playing against two really,
really talented teams, well coached teams and experienced group as well.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for chase.  
  
Q. Chase, what can you take home from this experience, these last three
days, playing some really good teams. You get a win and then I'm sure you
learned some things. What kind of things can you take home?  
CHASE JETER: Well, I think first and foremost, the flow of the game, a lot of
stuff happens and good things and bad things can occur. And I think one of the
things we need to work on is not getting too excited when the good things do
happen and kind of carrying that same dog and that same fight to the end of
the game. Kind of like Auburn and Gonzaga did these past two days against us.
So the biggest thing that we need to learn is that there's 40 minutes in a
game and that at the end of the day no matter how good or bad we're doing in
one segment, it's always on to the next thing and we got to stay strong.  
  
Q. Chase, last night coach talked a little bit about the number of
assists. Tonight I think you only had about nine assists. He's looking for
more ball movement. Who on the court really helps to kind of settle you guys
down? How do y'all get each other more involved in the offense and get more
touches? What can you do to try to do that with your teammates?  
CHASE JETER: Justin Coleman co-captain, he does a great very good job of being
vocal on the floor and keeping guys' heads level when we're out there. I think
it goes back to the same thing like I said in my previous answer, just there's
40 minutes in a game and I think one of the good things that we do need to add
is ball movement and swing the ball and working together a little bit more on
offense.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Same question for you. What do you take home from this week?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, thank God we took one win home. Very easily you can leave
this tournament 0-3. And we knew before we ever took off from Tucson Arizona
that the field was incredibly strong. And I'm very proud of our guys that we
were able to be as resilient as we were in the first game against Iowa State.
And I think we lost to two really talented teams. I think Gonzaga, obviously
will be fighting for one of the top seeds in the tournament. Really ditto for
Auburn. If you look at the team that they have returning, who they have added
and what they were able to accomplish last year, I mean those are two really
tough teams. For us, we played some excellent basketball in both of those
games. We were the furthest thing from a team that could finish. And sometimes
that's depth, sometimes that's talent, sometimes that's a little bit of
everything. Coaching. So for us it's a matter of when you play against great
competition you learn your strengths and weaknesses. And for us the other part
of it is confidence. If you watched us in the first half we were 1-7 from
three. I think if we had taken 20 threes I think we might have made one or
two.  
  
In the second half same team we're 9-18. Much, much more confident after
halftime. And when guys haven't been there and done it before, sometimes you
go through this in November, specifically if you're playing here in Maui
against the talented groups that we played against, really all three nights.
But we have learned a lot, we had some great moments in each of the games.
Justin Coleman, I would imagine he has a chance to be on the all tournament
team. He was outstanding. If he didn't play the way he played, I'm not sure
where we would have been in any of the three games. His second half against
Iowa State and just watching him play for 40 minutes, that's something that I
think gives us a lot of confidence moving forward, because he did it against
the best. And Justin is an experienced player as well.  
  
Q. Probably just a continuation of my last question. I think there's, I
know some things that you want to, you have a lot of great players and trying
to get touches. What are some of the things you want to do over the next few
weeks to kind of get your team to where you think you want it to be going down
the stretch?  
SEAN MILLER: You play in a tournament like this in November, you learn through
trial and error, you learn through baptism by fire. We're going to be a better
team when we return to Tucson because we came on this trip. We had two
practices here. We had to prepare hard for all three games. All of our players
kind of got a sense of what it's like to play against the best. And now it's a
matter of us getting back to practice. It's still very, very early and
building and growing and hopefully down the road we'll look back at this
tournament as one of the reasons that we had a successful season. But we need
to get a couple players who aren't starting the game. Our bench in particular
to play, help us contribute. I think in all three nights if you add up the
minutes they played and the production, that's something that I hope can grow
as the year goes on. And we haven't tried Devonaire Doutrive, who I would say
is our ninth or tenth guy and I think it's up to us to get him in the game
now, give him a try. And sometimes a young guy like that will come in with
confidence and maybe bolster what we have.  
  
Q. Beating Iowa State the one maybe down side was that you had to play
two Top-10 teams in a row and like you said, you learned a lot from it, but
with all the things you're having to deal with this kind of new team, was that
maybe a little too much to ask in that sense?  
SEAN MILLER: Evidently so. I mean, if you followed the patterns of both of the
last two games, again, last night it doesn't feel that way because of the
final score. But with six minutes left it was a 2-point game, we had as much
of a lead I think as 13 in the first couple minutes of the second half. We
played some really, really good basketball in the first half against Gonzaga.
Tonight I thought our best was kind of like an eight to 10 minute segment in
the second half, but we also played some great defense in the first half.
Auburn is a team that can score and we really held them in check for about, I
don't know, 24, 28 minutes and then they finished. Had a couple deep threes go
in but that's what they do. They have confident players, some great guards
that have been there before, and you feel that when you play against them.  
  
Q. You alluded to it there, but I was wondering about the defense. It's
been pretty strong and just kind of got away from you there at the end. I was
wondering about that. And also at the beginning you had a lot of turnovers and
a lot of them were charges that maybe could have gone either way or whatever,
but if that was, you know, anything you were concerned about.  
SEAN MILLER: Say that again.  
  
Q. I guess the turnovers early in the game and the defense late in the
game.  
SEAN MILLER: Auburn, they turn you over. That's what their defense does. Part
of our lack of ball movement, when you play them, you really have to dribble
the ball, you have to penetrate, you have to be able to drive, make good
decisions. No matter who plays against Auburn, the ball isn't going to move
around the perimeter. They don't let you play a certain way and you have to be
able to kind of adjust. At times we did a tremendous job of that. Certainly
the first 10, 12 minutes of the game we struggled. But that's who our team is
and it's up to us to improve and become the best that we can become.

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Tre Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36243)

### [Javin DeLaurier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36125)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Gonzaga - 89, Duke - 87  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Great game. I thought both teams played their hearts out.
Kind of two different halfs. I thought they dictated the flow, the pace, they
were very much in control the whole first half. I think their experience, I
mean they're really good, obviously Mark's teams are well coached, but they're
experienced good, they can beat anybody. They started out that way, where I
thought we looked young. It's not that we were tired, because we both played
the same amount of games, but I thought emotionally they were more ready than
we were. And that's something that you learn. You have to learn that by being
in these situations. We were ready to play but we weren't as emotionally ready
to play as we needed to be. And the second half they gave us a knockout punch
in the first four minutes. And then in the last 14, 15 minutes of the game I
thought we dictated everything. It started with Tre's play where he scored and
then stole the ball and got fouled. All of our guys need to know that just one
guy making a play like that can send, it can turn the emotion of the game
around and Tre did that. Then it's anybody's game there right at the end. We
have a number of moves right at the bucket or right around the bucket where we
couldn't finish or get fouled and that's really the game right there. We had
the ball right by the bucket a few times and couldn't finish or draw a foul
and then -- and they won. Congratulations to Mark and his team. They're a
beautiful program and great group of kids.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions, please.  
  
Q. For Tre. This is the reason why you come to Duke, to play in these
kind of games. What was it about playing Gonzaga that they were able to do
that other teams weren't able to do to you early on?  
TRE JONES: Like coach said, we both were ready to play but they came more
emotionally ready. So they came out more ready to play emotionally and had
more fire behind them. And we dug ourselves a hole that we had to dig
ourselves out of in the second half.  
  
Q. For Tre and then Javin, what do you think happened the last 14
minutes that allowed you guys to kind of dictate the tempo, where Gonzaga was
really sticking it to you before that?  
TRE JONES: I feel we just got to playing how we know we can play, the way that
the coaches want us to play and the way that us players know that we can play
and want to play as well. Like coach said, emotionally early on we weren't
ready to play. But within those last 14 minutes we all kept trying to pick
each other either up. And guys were picking me up and I was trying to pick
other guys up. And we all came together and started fighting together rather
than just by ourselves.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Just what Tre said. His play in the second half sparked the
rest of us and we finally started to fight in the last 14 minutes, whereas
before we had just come to play and we weren't as emotionally ready as
Gonzaga. But the last 14 minutes we played how we're capable of together with
emotion and we just got to do that earlier.  
  
Q. Javin, obviously a tough loss for the team, but how much has Tre kind
of evolved into the leader for this team and the first couple games of the
season?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Tre, I think, is the heart and soul of our team. We go as he
goes, he's an amazing player. He almost never makes the wrong play and he's
capable of providing everyone with energy. We all respect him. He's our point
guard and we'll follow him into battle.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Obviously great game by both teams but where would this rank as a
regular season type of early tournament game for you guys, for -- you've been
here a long time or been around, where would this rank?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, it's a big time game for any part of the season. We're
not, again we're not who we're going to be and they're not either because
they're missing a really good player. But they're ahead of us as far as
knowing one another and knowing their system and they're strong. Mark's teams
are smart, they're strong, they play together. And it's a tough matchup for
us. And we knew it going in, that's why you can't get off to that type of
start. But again it's a great game for us. This whole tournament we played,
look in our first six games, we played three Top-10 teams, and one other who
is supposed to win their conference. We played a hell of a schedule. I think
three days in a row for young emotionally, not physically, is tough. It's
just, it's tough. And that's where veterans win or have a better opportunity
to win. But proud of my team. And they -- we were in the process of getting
blown out there the first three minutes of the second half and they turned it
around. It wasn't coaching, our kids turned it around and Tre in particular
did that.  
  
Q. Tre missed that dunk early in the game. A lot of young kids that
could have taken them out emotionally for the game. He seemed to fight back
really well from that. What did you see from him the way he handled that?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well the other way is we handled it is we didn't make
anything of it. He knew -- you could feel it. When you compete like this it's
not just hearing, seeing. It's you feel the game and the game didn't feel
right. Even though you had really good knowledge, you're ready, but it doesn't
feel right. And as a guard, as a competitor, maybe making that play might,
boom, it might just do what he did in the second half. So I don't fault him
for that. He has tremendous feel for the game. He's way ahead in spite of his
young age. That's one of his gifts.  
  
Q. Gonzaga shot 65 percent in the first half and then 41 percent in the
second half. What were they doing offensively in the first half and what
adjustments did you make?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: They were just dictating the flow. I mean we were not playing
good defense. But they were playing great offense. They are an outstanding
offensive team. Not that they're bad defensively, but they have great movement
and we weren't talking. And our bigs were not able to defend their actions the
way we needed to defend them. So in the second half we went smaller and we
played better defense against them. Even though we had a height disadvantage
there, it was better in their movement, so we did a lot better job. But
they're a tough team to defend, they're a tough team to beat. They're a tough
team.  
  
Q. You talked the other day about just what Maui, as being so unique as
a tournament, what it can do for you guys in so many ways. Do you feel like
this, a loss is tough, but do you feel like this is part of that?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No. I mean we learned a lot here and we appreciate the -- how
everything is done, the people, all the people who helped, the volunteers and
everything. They create an environment that's really good for all the teams.
Gonzaga's a team you would like about four days of preparation for, you know?
They do so many things. So in trying to simplify things in a one day, less
than one day prep, we weren't able to do that. That's part of it. But we won't
be in that situation again. So overall to play and be put in a position to win
against them, overall that's a good thing for our team.  
  
Q. You guys were able to find your driving lanes on offense to the
basket more in the last 10, 12 minutes than you were the rest of the game. Was
there something you guys did differently there?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, we didn't have a big guy in. What they were doing with
our big guys just zoning in the middle and we weren't active or using the big
and DHOs or ball screens enough, so that just opened driving lanes for us.
Really pretty simple.  
  
Q. Jack was really solid through all 26 minutes that he played. As you
said, for such a young emotional -- or emotionally young team, what does he
provide being on the floor around those young players?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He's the ultimate glue guy because he also, he's the guy who
tried to guard Hachimura when we went small. And he just does all the dirty
work. And he's a heck of a player for us. Javin started playing that way.
Javin hasn't played as well. And then the last 10 minutes of this game he
played like he can play. And that makes us better. So I think it was tough for
Marques to come back from yesterday. That was such an emotional thing for him
to play at that level and that well. And again, there's some of youth in
there, just handling all -- not that he wasn't ready, but it just, it's tough
to get on at the same level when you are not accustomed to playing at that
level. You showed you were so damn good and then it's tough to do it 24 hours
later unless if you're, that's who you are. So hopefully we can all learn from
that. But there's a lot of good stuff from the game.  
  
Q. What did you think of Hachimura and the kind of player he is and the
challenges he presents?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, not only him but they have, they're good. I mean they
have good basketball players. And they're old. They're strong, they're old,
and they're unselfish and they play their butts off. And Hachimura gives them
a guy that you can go to to get a bucket or get fouled. But he's better
because the other guys are good too. In other words, you can't just double
team him or whatever -- well, you can try, but he'll, another good player is
going to be open. They have good weapons. Norvell is a heck of a player,
Perkins is that outstanding veteran guard that's been through all the wars. So
I talked to Mark before the game behind in here, behind the curtains there,
and just how much I liked their team and what he's done. He's done a marvelous
job with his program. And it's an honor to play against him and their fan base
and it's great game for college basketball today. The fan base is there, the
effort, and two outstanding programs. That was really good basketball today.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Zach Norvell Jr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36260)

### [Rui Hachimura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36250)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Gonzaga - 89, Duke - 87  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Give us your thoughts on the game, coach.  
  
MARK FEW: Yeah, hey, it was just a fantastic game and you just, you just got
to love this tournament. I love this place, I love Maui, and it's just been an
awesome, awesome experience for our team and our fans and everybody involved
with our program.  
  
But what a basketball game. Duke is everything that we thought they were and
probably even a little bit more. They got no quit in them. Those are really,
really talented, high character, tough dudes to stop and they made a heck of a
run. But what I was most proud of is we ended up winning this game on the
defensive end those last two stops. So obviously we can really build on that.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. For both you guys, can you just tell me what was going through your
mind as they were making that run toward the end there?  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Just stay positive, confident. Perkins and Geno, they did a
good job in our huddles keeping us together, not letting us waiver at all. It
was big time for us.  
  
RUI HACHIMURA: Honestly, I lost my like focus and everything like that minute.
And then but I came back because of those guys who are trying to make me go
back to the game. So I kind of, I think I did.  
  
MARK FEW: You were fantastic. It was only a little two-minute stretch. You
were fine.  
  
Q. Rui, in those last two drives that Barrett was coming down the gut
there, it seemed like to me your eyes kind of lit up a little bit like if you
were thinking in your head bring it a little bit, but how much do you look
forward to that one-on-one battle when you know he's coming down to try to win
this game?  
RUI HACHIMURA: I think he did, he switched on me and then he tried to play
one-on-one against me. And then I was like, okay, let's do it. I have to, you
know, we're the best team in the country and I'm going to be like, you know,
I'm the best player too, so I have to guard him.  
  
MARK FEW: Amen, brother. Now you're getting the message. I like this, yeah.
That's, let's continue on this line of thought here.  
  
RUI HACHIMURA: Yeah, my thinking was like I had to do it. I got to do it.  
  
Q. Rui and Zach, in a game like that, how much does it help when you
have won so many games already with this program? I mean how much does it help
you kind of not panic in those moments?  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Experience plays a big role in had this. Perkins, with him
being one of the top guards in the country, him controlling the pace of the
game was huge for us. We came down the stretch and got some stops, we knew we
were winning it on the defensive end. Things were kind of a little shaky down
the stretch on the offensive end, but we locked into our plan and sat down and
got some stops, it will be, it will come out good for us.  
  
RUI HACHIMURA: Yeah, I think we have more experience than those Duke guys. And
also I think we like practiced those like those five minutes, like the last
five minute situation, so that's why that's, yeah, we did pretty good job.  
  
Q. Rui, you looked surprised when they announced the MVP. Were you
surprised?  
RUI HACHIMURA: Oh, no. I didn't know what they were talking about.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Did you think you earned it?  
RUI HACHIMURA: No, I didn't know about it. I didn't know like we had a MVP and
stuff, so I didn't know like, yeah. And the people just, the teammates and
stuff started doing stuff for me, so I was like...  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. I know coming in here in early in the season you were having some
issues or some questions about your rim protection. Seems like a lot of those
questions got answered this tournament, especially today.  
MARK FEW: Yeah, some. I think we still had some issues there in that stretch
from about the 10 minute mark down to the 2 minute mark. But certainly when
Brandon's jumping up there and providing that and I think Filip still is kind
of learning. Obviously Rui did a nice job down the stretch. But obviously when
we get Killian back that will continue to get better and better. But it was
good, not great here. But we got a lot of stuff on film we can go home and
really spend some time with.  
  
Q. I know it's early, for not even 2019, but is this the biggest, one of
the biggest regular season wins that you can remember in your career? I know
it's been a long career but would this be right up there towards the top?  
MARK FEW: Yeah, I mean I would, shoot, I guess. My memory is not what it once
was, so I just kind of deal day-to-day and move forward. But obviously if you
can win this tournament, the premier tournament, every year and with this kind
of field and everybody was saying was the greatest ever, I think that it's
more a culmination of the three wins and how we did it. We certainly didn't
play perfect in games one or two, but figured out ways to get through them. We
had some great kind of performances from guys like Jeremy Jones and obviously
Brandon Clarke yesterday and that got us to this point. And we played good.
The lights were on us tonight and we played good, which you have to against
Duke. You have to pretty much play great. I thought we played great. We left a
couple points on the board with the free throws but other than that we were
pretty good.  
  
Q. Obviously players in those moments, they feel the energy and the
emotions of the game. But what about coaches? You're looking at Coach K on
other side of the court, do coaches feel some of that in those final moments
as well? Did you?  
MARK FEW: It's a real serene like calmness about it, actually. You just kind
of are in the moment and you're just watching the basketball and not really --
I'm more just kind of, that's kind of some of the calmest times, it's a heck
of a lot better than the pregame feelings when we were trapped in the locker
room waiting for the game to start, I can tell you that. You just trust your
guys to run the right scheme and we defended it the right way and then just
live with the consequences. It's a nice little calmness, actually.  
  
Q. There are moments in a program where you kind of reach those
milestones and it felt like in the arena there was a moment where it's clear
that this team is one of those teams that's going to challenge for the
championship. How do you keep full focus in the moment when you have a big
victory like this?  
MARK FEW: I think that's going to be a huge challenge. My good good buddy Jay
Wright, I think he used the term we just, we got to stay away from the poison,
last year when his guys moved up and were No. 1 early in the season and what a
phenomenal job they did, man, they just kept their eye on the prize and kept
getting better and better and their culture was strong. So we got to learn
from them and follow that lesson and we made so many mistakes this week I mean
when we get them in the film room it's probably not going to be the most
pleasant experience. We'll get back to just kind of coaching the way we tell
them and practicing what we do, but it's a long, long haul. Hopefully we can
get healthy here with Killian and that will change us and help us even more
and certainly we have been able to really grow with him out but he's an
integral part of what we do and keep it moving forward.  
  
Q. I know you struggled sometimes with Rui being a little too
differential sometimes. To hear him say what he just said, what does that,
what can that do for you your program if he starts to think that way?  
MARK FEW: No, I mean, it means everything. We have been working on this, I've
been working on him to truly believe that and he's not a great -- he doesn't
show his emotions great, he doesn't, he's not, he doesn't share much, but much
more comfortable talking like that and for him to voice that means he's
getting it and I think on this stage he showed it too. He was wanting the ball
and when we got him the ball for the most part he was delivering against some
high, high level athletes and some damn good defenders around the rim. So
that's a really, really good sign for us. And I think it's another great sign
that Brandon Clarke's really starting to figure out that he can do a lot of
great things at the highest level too. So those guys and you know Snacks
(Norvell) is always going to be hunting shots and making plays and I really
think Perk has really, really grown up and that was two unbelievable floor
generals going at it tonight, Jones is, I mean it looks like he plays like
he's 30 or something. I thought Perk did a good job of managing that game
also.  
  
Q. Duke has never lost here until now. You guys have a pretty special
relationship with Maui know how much you enjoy the island as well, you talked
about it yesterday, how special is this win going to be in the next 24, 36, 48
hours for you guys?  
MARK FEW: Hey, the best thing about when the Zags come to Maui is we get
tomorrow off. So I'm going to enjoy every hour on this island tomorrow with my
family and friends and we'll have a nice Few type of day where we do a little
bit of everything and get out and about and have a great time. The players are
going to do the same thing and then we have a big Thanksgiving dinner at night
and it's awesome and pretty powerful because obviously we have a lot to be
thankful for and then we head home, so it has the makings of a great day. For
me at least.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2018

  

### [Brian Dutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33374)

### [Matt Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34889)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Iowa State - 87, SDSU - 57  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Coach, your opening statement, please.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I thought Iowa State was sensational. They shot the ball at an
incredibly elite level and I think when they get all their pieces they're
going to be a very, very dangerous team. With that being said, there are so
many things we have learned about our own team, one is that we are not a very
good rebounding team right now and there were times where we would have three
people standing under the basket and they would send one guy and end up with
the ball. So we have to do better rebounding. Coaches always know, you got to
recruit a rebounder, but that's not an excuse. If you don't have an elite
level rebounder you got to get the guys you have on the roster rebounding
better. And so that's something we have learned over this week here that we
have to become a better rebounding team. The other thing we have to do is we
have to get out and contest some three-point shots. I mean three teams in a
row shot incredible against us from three-point range. So we're not closing
out tight enough, we're not dictating, people are towing the line on us and
getting good looks at three. So you're here to learn about your team and I
said yesterday I really like my team and so I can't be a hypocrite today and
because we lost say I don't like my team. I like my team. But there are things
we have to get better at, we all know that, the team more than anybody, so I
look my team, lesson learned, we have to get better. We all know that.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for Matt.  
  
Q. How do you process this? This is the worst loss in I think almost 20
years by a program that usually doesn't take big losses. How do you guys
process that and what do you think went wrong today?  
MATT MITCHELL: I think we just got to learn from it. Coach said it, it was not
a very good defensive rebounding team. Every time they went it felt like they
got the ball. We just weren't putting bodies on their bodies and what we got
to do is learn from it moving on in practice and in the upcoming games and get
better.  
  
Q. In terms of three-point shooting, all three games teams got out to a
really, really hot start against you. Were they just making threes or was
there something you guys weren't doing?  
MATT MITCHELL: We just weren't closing out tight enough. All three teams got
hot, but at the same time we got to be there and we know we're a good
defensive team, we know we can be and we know our potential, but at the same
time we have to learn and excel and especially in tournaments like these and
which we want to be in and we know we can be in and play up to the level and
the level of intensity that these gyms partake. I feel like just moving on
we'll learn from it and we'll get a lot better.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: All right. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Same question, you guys have a history of not getting blown out and
you have taken two of your worst losses since you've been at San Diego State.
How do you get over that and process that?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Got to use it as a motivator. Can't sit here and cry about it.
Got to use it as a motivator to get the team better. And test their pride a
little bit. I will say this, Jeremy Hemsley -- and I used him as an example --
we're down 25 with four, five minutes to go and you look up and Jeremy is
playing as hard as any guard you've ever seen play at the defensive end. And I
got on the freshmen, I put you guys in for the last three minutes and you're
on an audition for me and you don't meet that intensity from a senior that
played all the minutes? And I used him as an example to show what is required
if we're going to be great. I thought the only game that we won was the game
we dictated defensively. We got into the ball harder, we set the tempo.
Everything else we were on our heels reacting to everything the other team
did. And so lesson learned, we have to continue to be aggressive. Matchup-
wise, we were going to switch the five man ball screens at the start of the
game so I put Matt on the five man and Jalen on the wing and the wing went to
work on Jalen right away. Hit a three on him, ran the baseline on him, and so
maybe I set the tone by not having the right matchups, but I thought we had a
good game plan we just didn't execute it very well.  
  
Q. A lot of things you're talking about those are effort plays, those
are the kind of things that are published in the locker room sometimes with
the players. How do you poke and find those folks who in that space hold each
other accountable for these kind of efforts and being consistent?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I had -- I did talking after the game, but I thought it was
important to hear from the players. So I had Jeremy stand up, talk to the team
about what he felt. Just felt we had to compete harder, said we got big
brothered in the two games we played, we have to be tougher, we can't be the
little brother. We have to be tougher. And then I had Devin stand up and
Devin's not one for a lot of word so I had to coax it out of him, he just
basically delivered the message we have to play harder. And it's always easy
to say play harder, there's some strategy in there. There's being alert when
you're on the floor, knowing where the ball is, play with your head on a
swivel -- playing hard is just easy, everyone says you got to play harder, so
now we have to use that play harder to teach and say, how do we play harder.
Is it getting up on the ball tighter, is it picking up full court more, is it
over playing a little bit. We're a gap defensive team, how can we adjust to
what we do instead of just say, play harder, you know, what things can we do
to get better at and make it look like we're playing harder.  
  
Q. Injuries to your freshmen in the pre-season obviously stunted their
growth a little bit and you had a pretty short rotation here and probably some
tired legs today. How much did that hurt you and how much do you need at least
a couple of those freshmen to give you quality minutes going forward?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: We have to get quality play from our freshmen. I thought Nathan
had some moments, but missing a month of practice sometimes you watch them out
there and he can't get to where he's supposed to be or if he gets there it's
that half second late where, instead of grabbing the ball it falls to the
other team. So we have got to get him up to speed game minute wise and I think
if we do that he'll continue to improve, AG, I like AG a lot, we have to get
him playing at the pace of the game a little better and that's just freshmen.
So I think they will get better, I thought the six veterans played pretty good
for the most part and Nathan had some moments in the tournament where I
thought he looked like he belonged out there. AG's got to catch up. And we
have to just keep -- Adam Seiko obviously was a freshman, a red shirt
freshman, I thought he gave us a good level of play off the bench. So we are a
work in progress. So we got to keep progressing, that's the key, we don't want
to be a work in progress all year we want to progress and be ready to play on
Tuesday when we take the floor again.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Aaron Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36255)

### [Alan Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36256)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Iowa State - 84, Illinois - 68  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Alan, do you want to break down what happened between first half and
second half and how things fell apart?  
ALAN GRIFFIN: First half, felt like we all executed. Second half they came out
a little more aggressive, we let the game get away from us.  
  
AARON JORDAN: We didn't do what we had to do, we didn't stick to our
principles and how we know we can play, we got to transfer that going down the
road.  
  
Q. Aaron, what makes Talen Horton-Tucker difficult to deal with? He went
off in the second half?  
AARON JORDAN: I would say just play good as a whole. We didn't play so well,
we didn't stick to our defensive principles, deny on the wing, it's a team
effort guarding anybody it doesn't matter whose name is on front of the
jersey, whose name is on the back of the jersey, it's a team effort.  
  
Q. Alan, last couple nights you have gone off a little bit and had some
nice moments. Just what have these last two games been like for you, what are
you seeing and how have you been kind of feeling?  
ALAN GRIFFIN: I felt good, my teammates got me going and I knew I had to stay
ready to come bring some fire power off the bench and play my role.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Coach, your thoughts?  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well I felt great at half. I thought we were, we withstood
foul trouble, I thought we came out extremely flat and lacked some energy, but
we withstood it. I felt good. Giorgi was never a factor in the game. And then
it was a trend in the second half. We come out of the locker room very poorly
and I think we pounded every nail into the new floor here in the Maui Civic
Center. We just quit moving the ball and then it became not about doing our
system and what we do, it became everybody breaking everything off and then at
the defensive end give Talen a ton of credit, give Iowa State a lot of credit.
The guy I feared the most hurt us, probably as much as anybody, and that was
Jacobson. Those two guys were exceptional tonight.  
  
Q. How can you take what you've learned these first two games in Maui to
improve the team for tomorrow for the season?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, I just think that, you know, when you're playing four
freshmen a lot and you're putting Adonis who hasn't been in our system, you're
putting him into play, I think every experience is a new experience. I mean
it's maybe not the character I want to see today and yet we have got to be
able to learn from it and understand that, yeah, last night was an emotional
high and then it was an emotional low and you have to find that median. Quick
turn around, most of the time that doesn't happen, I mean we were back here
in, I don't know what time we got to bed, midnight? So you're back in the gym
in eight hours and with just a little film work. But they had, they didn't
have that much difference either. But again, I thought we did, we did enough
of the right things the first half to just not carry over the second half, we
got to get that figured out.  
  
Q. I think most people will sit there and go what if with Talen.
Obviously you guys battled Iowa State at the end there and there's history
with your staff and Iowa and them, what did you see from him tonight? Seemed
like he had a chip on his shoulder.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well he's really good. I mean let's give the young man credit.
He's a guy that is going to have every opportunity to be Freshman of the Year
in that league, he's a guy that 240 pounds, now he might be a mini version of
Zion Williamson in terms of not six eight and 280, but six three or four and
240 and he's physical, he's great with the ball, he gives them an exceptional
presence offensively because he can relieve pressure from a ball handling
standpoint and he's physically strong enough to go battle on the glass and do
those things. But he was terrific tonight, knew he would be, again, that's
going to be an exciting team as they move forward.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the 7th place game tomorrow that's a
heck of a 7th place game against Xavier?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, Xavier was a 1 seed last year. A 1 seed. And they have
got guys back from that team. I haven't seen a lot of them yet, but that's a
team, and most importantly it's a program that has such a long history of
success and there's pride, it will be a heck of a game and you've got to throw
character and attitude and all of that stuff into a game to find out who is
going to show up. We knew when you get in this field that there's going to be
three really, really hard games and now we get a 1 seed in last year's NCAA
tournament in the 7th place game. And as I've said all along, it's a great
opportunity and we're going to rally and do everything we can to play our
best.  
  
Q. How is Alan taking advantage of his opportunity?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, he's been great. Alan spends a lot of time in the gym.
Alan work, he's dedicated, he's, for him it's still trying to figure out the
defensive end, he wants to be aggressive, he's got a habit we have got to get
him out of. Every time he reaches he gets beat off the dribble and getting him
out of that. But he goes to the boards, he's offensively very gifted, he's
going to be a young man that's going to have a great, great career. He's going
to score a lot of points because he's an elite sure and we have got to
continue to find opportunities for him.  
  
Q. Kipper always seems like the X factor. Just where is his mind at
right now and what are you trying to get out of him?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well we got to get him going, there's no doubt we got to get
Kipper going. He's had two really hard matchups defensively, he's played in
foul trouble. But two baskets in two nights is something that we can't have.
I'm sure his confidence is shaken a little bit, he's not seeing the ball go
in. We tried to get him going early and having him shoot technical fouls and
things like that early. And there's a kid who was a 90 percent free throw
shooter last year and he's shooting 50 percent. We need him. He's got
versatility and -- I don't worry about him. I do think that he's going to have
one of those nights, he's going to have a breakthrough night. And like we say,
you got to flip the switch, you can't worry about it and yet our team needs
him to be good.  
  
Q. You mentioned Adonis adapting to the system. It seems like his role
and Da'Monte as well, they're both getting a more concrete role for things
that they do for the team.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah and I think that will continue. Adonis is still playing
himself into shape. The one thing we can't have when we put AD in the game is
we can't wait on him all the time. You have to be able to go. And again you're
talking a young man coming off an ACL, but his shear size and his ability to
rebound the basketball and do some things and score are needed and we have got
to get him where he's 20 plus minutes a game and playing at the pace we want
to play.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Travis Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36242)

### [Zach Hankins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36252)

### [Quentin Goodin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32841)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
SDSU - 79, Xavier - 74  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Coach give us an opening thought on tonight's, this morning's
game.  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: I thought we started off the game really well, obviously, got
out to an early lead. We have to be able to put 40 minutes together and not
turn it on and off. Give San Diego all the credit in the world though, they
got a couple tremendous players in Jalen McDaniels and Devin Watson who are
tremendous players. They fought back, they, the Mike Tyson old saying, you
find out what your plan is once you get punched and their plan was they
punched right back and we didn't have a response. I thought to start the
second half it was a little bit better, but again it's kind of, the game wore
on they pulled away. But again give San Diego all the credit in the world,
they deserved to win that game, they outplayed us of the.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. Quentin, you had a career high 20 points, but the team was ahead by
19 and lost that lead. Are you discouraged at all by the fact that you guys
have struggled to play with a lead and be consistent?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: I wouldn't say discouraged is the word. I feel like we're
still trying to figure it out. I feel like this tournament's really good for
us, get away from home, find out our team chemistry, we're still trying to
figure out our roles and take care of the missing pieces from last year. I
feel like San Diego State, they're a good team, they gave us their best shot
and I feel like we just keep that lead we win the game. I feel like our minds
drifted during the game and we didn't stay focused throughout the game and
that's what caused us to lose.  
  
Q. Zach, everything kind of seemed to go right for the first 10 minutes.
What went wrong after that?  
ZACH HANKINS: Kind of the same thing as what Q said. Just our minds started
wand erring and that's kind of been an issue for us, we just need to work on
staying focused, but we still have a lot of time to grow and a lot of time to
peak at the end of the season.  
  
Q. Zach, does that surprise you, having three grad transfers and a
couple guys that have been in the program that you would, even though you have
new pieces, that focus would be a problem?  
ZACH HANKINS: It is a lot of new pieces and we still have a lot of chemistry
to gain but we're getting closer every day and we're learning each other's
games every day more and more. So I fully believe as the season progresses
we'll just continue to get better and better and better.  
  
Q. For both players, it seemed like last year you had some guys who in
that situation could settle everybody down, kind of stabilize things. Is this
team still looking for that guy or those guys to be able to kind of steady the
ship in those moments?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: I wouldn't -- not really. I feel like if we didn't drift our
mind we wouldn't have put ourself in that situation. We would have kept that
lead. I feel like at this point of the season I just feel like we got to lock
in because it happens in practice too and I feel like we just got to focus
even more. I feel like as a captain it is my job to keep those guys in check.
So I guess I'll figure that out.  
  
ZACH HANKINS: I would say our captains are continuing to break out into those
roles and doing that a lot better.  
  
Q. For both players, just what changed for San Diego State? What did
they start doing differently? When they were down 19, how were they able to
get back into that?  
ZACH HANKINS: I think that we lost focus defensively. We started playing out
of our own system and so we would help in too much and just give them wide
open rhythm threes and they started hitting those. So that's really been the
main thing we got to do is just stay focused, stay locked in on D even when
we're up that much.  
  
QUENTIN GOODIN: Just go off of that, they stuck to their system I feel like.
They smelled blood and they got more aggressive, whereas to us we kind of
faded away when the crucial moment kind of hit and adversity hit. They just
got more aggressive and were kind of trusting each other. I feel like we hurt
ourself more this game than they hurt us.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. I heard the same thing from both coaching staffs after yesterday's
loss and today's, hey, that's a really good team and they're going to get
better. Even in a loss like this can you see some of that progress and see
this team improving going forward?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Yeah, I think it's obviously a long season. We're going to look
a lot different in December and January because the games like this. San Diego
State's a good team, they're a well coached team. We got a lot of room for
growth on both ends of the floor, that's for sure. But I do think we're
getting better. Give San Diego State all the credit in the world for the win
today.  
  
Q. If there were probably one or two things you want to see improved
with this team over the next game, what are those things you want to focus
on?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I would say two things. I would say number one when our guys
drive the ball it's not my turn, you know, it's like -- I feel like we keep on
pressing the repeat button on a song, a bad song, and it keeps happening over
and over and over and over and over again and at some point it's got to change
to get a different result. And again I feel like a lot of times like we're not
competing against Auburn, we weren't competing against San Diego State, we're
competing against ourselves. We have to be smarter and we have to be able to
make great decisions once we get there because we're getting the ball to the
paint a lot, but we're taking a lot of bad shots once we get there. When you
have three guys on you, it's not a good shot. Somebody is wide open. The
game's got to be played slow and again I think we're asking more out of our
guys that are returning, they weren't put in those roles last year. Quentin
wasn't, Naji wasn't, Paul wasn't and those are three of our primary playmakers
off the bounce and I think those guys have to continue to grow in that area
for us to be a good team. And I think defensively I think it's staying at home
on shooters, again it happened over and over again today against San Diego
State, where I think that like the Devin Watson kid would drive the ball all
of a sudden we would help off the ball side corner, we leave a wide open for a
three, a rhythm three for a guy that could really shoot the ball. Again
staying locked in, especially in the second half when the defense is away from
us has been an issue with our team so far.  
  
Q. You opened the game five of seven on threes and a few of those are
pretty contested. Was this just a case of you made some really, really hard
shots and you just missed them or what, you went from that to missing 13
straight.  
TRAVIS STEELE: No, I thought we had some pretty good looks early on to be
honest. I think Elias took one tough one after he had had a couple wide open
ones. But I thought we had some really good looks early on. I think that
obviously their defense tightened up as the game went on, but again I think it
goes back to when we play the game the right way, when we drive the ball and
we make the right reads, again, it has nothing to do with San Diego State, it
has nothing to do with Auburn, nothing to do with our opponent tomorrow, if we
do what we work on every single day in practice, like I told our guys, then
I'll live with the results, we'll live with it, win or lose. But when we don't
it's a problem and we got to get those fixed we got to stop being our own
worst enemy, because I really feel like we're competing against ourselves.
Part of it is new guys, new roles, there's no question about it, but you can't
get board with the simplicity. You have to -- I always I'm a big baseball fan,
like home run hitters strike out a lot, guys that get on base those are the
guys that get paid a lots of money in baseball and we want guys that are
getting on base, hit singles, trust each other, move the ball, make the right
plays. And again it's a work in progress, obviously, but you can't get board
with the simple plays.  
  
Q. Same question that I asked your players, how difficult is that
transition when you have guys last year who seemed to just be able to steady
the ship in those moments and having new guys who are trying to step into
those roles this year?  
TRAVIS STEELE: It's difficult but at the same time there's no excuses no
explanations with our program. There's no moral victories, we expect to win.
We have to figure it out. Sooner rather than later. We got to get guys that
are going to mature, grow, and in those areas, last year we relied on at the
end of games we had a lot of close games last year we had a closer, Travon,
and he made all the big plays or JP made several big plays as well and I don't
think, sometimes I think the media's made a big narrative of it it's like,
well, hey, like all these new guys getting thrusted in the same role that
Travon and JP were. No, they're different players. They have to be them, be
really good at what they do. And then I'm good with that. It's like I said,
like I think again we our guys got to learn how to play with one another, how
to share the basketball, make the right plays, not force it, which I thought
we took a lot of forced shots in the second half and even later on in the end
of the first half when they went on their run. I thought we were taking some
forced shots and our guys don't mean to, they're not selfish guys they got to
learn though it's our job as a coaching staff to teach those guys and help
guide them to where they can learn and continue to get better in that area.  
  
Q. Ryan Welage played really well in the first two games and was one of
your top scorers. Today he was pretty quiet, didn't take a shot until the
second half. Was there any reason behind that or just the way the game was
going?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I think it was the way the game was going I think San Diego
State again give them credit, he played in their league the last few years, so
they knew who he was pretty well. They did a good job making sure that they
were on the catch every single time for Ryan. I thought Ryan got frustrated a
little bit, you could probably tell. So again I think it's kind of game to
game. There's going to be games where he's going to be good like against
scoring, I know Zach had whatever it was, 15 off the bench or whatever, Ryan
didn't have as good of a game offensively as he would like to have, but again
he had a couple good looks, I thought he had the one really good look there in
the second half, just missed it and that's okay. We'll live with that shot.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Jalen Horton-Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36253)

### [Michael Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36254)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Iowa State - 84, Illinois - 68  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for players.  
  
STEVE PROHM: First thing, again, our crowd is phenomenal. This is a great,
great event. First time I've been out here and the atmosphere, the teams, it's
really a lot of fun. I'm really proud of our guys to respond. Yesterday was a
tough loss, but a great thing is I think our team grew today because we were
in the same situation, about the 10-minute mark up 10 and guys made plays. We
had our bench, a couple bench guys step up and do some good things and we beat
a good basketball team. Now we got a quick turnaround, got a really good team
with San Diego State. So turn it over to these guys.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. Did it mean anything specific to you to play this game against
Illinois?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: I'll take it every game, going out there and playing hard
pretty. Much the same I would do against anybody else.  
  
Q. Talen, what did Chin and Ayo say to you? What did they tell you after
the game?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: They just told me good game. Chin told me I deserved it
and that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Can both you guys just talk about how you came out of the locker room
to start that second half? It was really impressive. You guys were down five
and then all of a sudden I looked up you were up nine.  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, I think we just made some adjustments at halftime. We
knew we had to lock in on the defensive end, especially on this one action
they were running, we made a little adjustment to it. And I think we guarded
it a lot better. I think we were just more locked in on defense. We knew we
could shoot the ball, we knew some shots were eventually going to fall, we
didn't know when it was going to be, so we knew we had to stay locked in on D
and I thought we did that.  
  
Q. Mike, what's been the key for your offense not only today, but all
season you've been putting up pretty big numbers?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: I think just staying patient. I know coach puts us in really
good positions and I just try to take advantage of my opportunities when
they're there. Just shoot open shots, try not to force anything. And I think
he's put a lot of confidence in me, it gives me the freedom to make plays, and
it's a huge thing. And I'm just trying to take advantage of what's there and
just don't force anything. Just do what I do.  
  
Q. Talen, you went up hard to block, I can't say his name, in the first
half, I believe it was. Did he say anything to you or anything like that?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: No, nothing was said, just I tried to go make a play on
the ball and me having a pretty big body and I just bumped him and he fell but
nothing really other than that.  
  
Q. What is your relationship with him?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: We're from the same city. We used to talk a lot when we
went to college. We just focused on ourselves. But nothing like close or
anything like that.  
  
Q. Talen, I know you're one of the youngest guys in the country. How
have you just been able to start your career this way knowing that you are one
of the youngest guys? And how have you played through that?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: Age isn't anything but a number. I just take it every
day, learning from what coach tells me to do and learning from my older
teammates. So I just feel like I've been prepared to go through the storm and
get out of it.  
  
Q. For both you guys. Have you guys watched this tournament in the past
on TV, and if so, is actually playing here in an Iowa State uniform kind of
what you thought it might be like?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: To me it's crazy. I'm still young. I watched it really a
lot, watching those like Duke games with Austin Rivers playing here and all
those older guys. It's just been crazy, surreal. I'm happy to be here.  
  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, same thing for me. I've been watching it since I was
real little. This is kind of the premier Thanksgiving preseason tournament, so
it's pretty special to be here, something I never thought I would really have
the opportunity to do. And now that it's here and we're playing and having a
little bit of success it's a lot of fun and just got to keep it up tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talen, when do you know when to take over? There are moments when
it's clear that you have decided you're going to kind of assert yourself. How
do you know when it's time for you to take over?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: I wouldn't really say it's just taking over. I just feel
like when things are kind of going a certain way and somebody -- we need to
pick it up a little bit more. My teammates, if they're not following, I
usually look to them for help. But when I need to go, I just go, so it's not
really just a moment when I just need to stay open myself.  
  
Q. Both you guys, Mike, what do you think about Talen right now?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: He's a lot of fun to watch. Just being out there and being
able to play with him, he's such a good passer and ball handler that he found
me on that last play at the end where I got to dunk it. It's a lot of fun. You
got to be ready for the ball and just know that he's looking, he's looking to
find you and be in the right positions.  
  
Q. Talen, what about Mike?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: It's great to have an older leader and a guy that's
played college basketball and a person to look up to that knows what he's
doing. So I actually appreciate him and actually the rest of our guys, too,
because we have a few older guys, so they just teach me and tell me the right
things to do.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that second half, that run to begin the second
half. How key was that and what was the key to that happening?  
STEVE PROHM: I think the biggest thing is we got stops and we were able to get
out in transition. The coaches, we have a little familiarity with coach
Underwood's teams just because we played against each other at Oklahoma State.
The tough thing is when only player on your team has seen that kind of defense
was Nick Weiler-Babb and you have a short prep. And so I knew he would
struggle offensively for awhile until we could kind of get our rhythm. But the
biggest thing when you're going through that you got to score off your defense
and I thought we got a lot of transition opportunities and we were fortunate,
I thought we grew in the second half better defensively. And it's a make or
miss game too. They had some opportunities from three that we were fortunate
they missed.  
  
Q. Has Mike's ability to score around the basket been a pleasant
surprise for you, or is that kind of what you were expecting him to be able to
do when you got him?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, you know what, I really didn't know. Mike's recruiting
happened really fast, to be honest. So the one thing I knew about him, just
looking at him, was that he was a great rebounder. That's the one thing that
translates. I really didn't know much about his offensive game until he got
here and I was around him. And I think he's really worked to where I feel
comfortable with him shooting open threes and 17-footers. And I thought he did
a great job in the middle against the 1-3-1 today. When they threw that at us,
I thought that was a big key, we really handled that well. But, yeah, he's got
a nice little jump hook. We don't throw it, we don't have enough probably
package in right now of trying to get the ball inside, but that has to do with
a lot of the situations we have been dealing with injuries and some
suspensions that we knew we would be playing small a lot.  
  
Q. You won a recruiting battle over Illinois for Talen. What do you
think this meant to him today, and what do you think he showed today?  
STEVE PROHM: This isn't about Illinois or Iowa State. This was a great game.
Brad's a phenomenal coach and he's going to do a really, really good job. He's
won at this level for a long time. And we were fortunate to get Talen. I
thought we did a really good job in just recruiting him and making him know
that he was a priority. And but that's what I told the guys. This wasn't about
the Chicago or Illinois or Iowa State. This is both teams right now in
November just trying to get better. And Talen has a chance to be a really,
really good player. He's just tapping the surface, like he mentioned, he's 17
years old, and that's why some of the times -- he reminds me of Deonte Burton
a little bit that I coached, that you get 20 e-mails, you get 10 that say, why
do you let him shoot those shots? And then you get 10 that say, man, I love
watching him play. But I just think if you give him, you just got to continue
to instill confidence in him. But he's a terrific talent and he's just going
to continue to get better.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [Austin Wiley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36258)

### [Jared Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35147)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Duke - 78, Auburn - 72  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Coach, can you give an opening statement on tonight's game.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: Well, I thought our kids played really hard. We didn't quit, we
didn't play very well, we didn't execute. There were some, Duke's athleticism
and their ability to protect the rim, some of the things that they did
defensively to keep us out of our ball screen action was effective. We're very
disappointed that we weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity and our
great strength is our balance and I think when we continue to become a little
bit more balanced in many ways we'll continue to become a better team.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Austin how surprised were you by Marques Bolden and just how he
played inside today for them?  
AUSTIN WILEY: I really wasn't surprised, I know he's a very good player. I
remember playing against him in the past, so, yeah, he's a good player, it
wasn't any surprise.  
  
Q. For both players, obviously this was a big time game, what do you
think even in this loss that you kind of learned about your own team?  
JARED HARPER: I would just say that just learn that we can fight to the end,
we were in the game the whole time, I think, but we had some crucial plays,
some crucial turnovers during the game, I personally had two crucial turnovers
I thought could have swung the game a different way. But I guess use it as a
learning experience just getting us ready we have to play another game
tomorrow, so just getting prepared for that.  
  
AUSTIN WILEY: Yeah, going off what Jared said we had some crucial turnovers,
but rebounds me myself personally I gave up some, we just got to get back in
the lab when we get back to Auburn and just get better.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. When you look back it's just how they started and how they got in
your guards, I mean how much did that sort of set the tone for how things
unfolded the rest of the way?  
BRUCE PEARL: I thought that we let them get middle and turn corners and that
was a big part of our game plan to not let them do it. Once we solved that a
little bit I thought we kept them on the sides and gave us a fighting chance.
We fouled them way too much, and you got to play aggressively without fouling,
but Duke got whatever they wanted early. Now our kids kept on battling and
obviously we got some dangerous players that can make shots and we try to give
them some freedom. I thought our second chance points were terrific and but,
yeah, Duke's start says something about the fact that those four freshmen are
a lot more mature than -- those four guys are really good now. It's a special
group. So I think Coach K got out of this what he wanted, he wanted to get
tested a little bit. I don't think -- we threatened them but they were never
scared. If we could have got off to a better start we might have had a much
better chance to win the game.  
  
Q. In your opening press conference for the tournament you talked about
your back court who battled. What did you learn about them? You saw them under
the lights with this team, they seemed to come down the stretch and compete.
How did you, how were you reacting with that?  
BRUCE PEARL: Those two guys can play, offensively and defensively. And I trust
them, try to put them in positions where they can do what they can do and you
got to give them some freedom. But we're dangerous because of that. We didn't
shoot the ball well outside of those two guys and typically our stretch 5's
and 4's will knock down shots and Chuma just hasn't shot it well yet, here
Anfernee didn't and we were 0-5 between Chuma and Anfernee. Those guys make a
couple shots, which they typically do, all of a sudden we're in a little
different position.  
  
Q. You hear so much about the four freshmen and how dangerous they are.
But when you get Marques Bolden playing the way that he played today, how does
that change the dynamic of this team?  
BRUCE PEARL: Well, their size and their length at the rim was significant. 11
blocked shots, we got, we, they blocked more shots than we shot free throws. I
mean -- and they do a great job of changing shots. So that rim protection
allows them to kind of use their length on the perimeter and the length on the
inside. So look, Bolden is a great example, in this era of the one and done,
it's terrific. But without the Marques Boldens that stick around for two,
three and four years and grow and develop -- he's becoming a pro now. He was a
highly recruited kid, but he was a prospect, everybody knew it was going take
a little time. A lot of times with bigs that's the case. You rarely find bigs
that are ready to go one and done. Duke's done a terrific job, Marques has
done a terrific job and stayed patient. So many times, if he wasn't getting
his minutes early in his career as a very promising player, he's transferring,
go someplace else and go find playing time. He stuck it out and I'm glad he's
being rewarded with this team.  
  
Q. I guess I wanted to follow that up because no one's ever going to
question Harper's heart, I mean he's got a lot of guts of the. But when you're
trying to counter size and length sometimes with your back court what are some
of the ways you're going to be able to counter that in the future when you
face teams with that kind of size?  
BRUCE PEARL: Well, you know, those guys were still able to squeeze off 36
shots between the two of them, so sometimes they over shoot over, sometimes
they over shoot through, a little better job of getting some more inside
stuff. I got to do a better job of taking change of Chuma Okeke. He's a really
good player and I don't take advantage of him enough. I did a little better
job of it last night and I should have done a much better job of it today. We
should have gone at Zion a little bit more and made him cover and if I had to
do it over again that's what I would do.  
  
Q. Speaking of Jared, he had that drive end to end on the court to go
into half and he went up to -- he almost dunked it and it seemed like that
would have been a huge energy play for you guys going into half. Would that
have potentially --  
BRUCE PEARL: No, you know, they came out second half played well again early.
Don't forget. It wasn't like -- they jumped on us right away again at the
start of the second half. So I don't necessarily think that would have been
the key, the key would have been the starting both halves better. That would
have been the key to having a chance to win the game.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Brandon Randolph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36261)

### [Justin Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36245)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Gonzaga - 91, Arizona - 74  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Start with an opening statement.  
  
SEAN MILLER: We knew Gonzaga was obviously an excellent team and, you know,
for 20 minutes I thought we played with a lot of effort and played a great
first half. For us to have 45 points we did a lot of things well in the first
half and I thought had them on their heels about as much as you can. Maybe
they uncharacteristically missed a couple of open threes but for the most part
the first 20 minutes really favored us. And then obviously we were overwhelmed
in the second half. Their defense, they started to switch both on and off the
ball, not easy to do but the quickness that those two big guys had is very
impressive. I mean they can switch out on guards, they really took us out of
what we wanted to do and obviously a tale of two halves and they were the far
superior team. The one stat that really blows my mind is that we had three
assists in the game. I think what their defense did is they created a kind of
a drive out of desperation, drive to shoot, drive to score and you have to
move the ball, you have to share the ball and you have to be able to find open
teammates. But that's as much to Gonzaga's credit as it is to our detriment.
They were clearly the better team and especially in the second half, I mean it
was 54-29 in the second half, I think that's really all you need to know.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Did you see any changes in Gonzaga's defensive coverages in the
second half that surprised you?  
JUSTIN COLEMAN: First of all, I want to thank my Lord and Savior for this
opportunity once again. And to answer your question, yeah, like coach said,
they started to switch one through four, one through five, it was hard for to
us run our offense. We started to drive and not, like coach says, drive to
kick for others, we started to drive and kick for our own, which we shouldn't
have done, that's what got us in the hole we were in. So they just started to
switch one through four and one through five and it took us out of our
offense.  
  
BRANDON RANDOLPH: Just add on, yeah, I think it was kind of hard. I believe
like -- I just believe that we need to make that adjustment and we just didn't
do that, so we just got to move on to the next game.  
  
Q. Justin, offensively I just curious two nights in a row now you played
really well there and I didn't know if you feel like your confidence is up or
was it also a case maybe of what was needed tonight and what you got?  
JUSTIN COLEMAN: I just play my game and I just took the open shots that I had.
And my teammates played a big part in that, they created shots for me and also
like they had to guard, Brandon went up and Brandon Williams who also led the
team in scoring the first four games, so they just helped my game a lot
easier.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on the technical and the foul that Chase got
and he's been, like you said, a pretty sharp guy as far as the way he plays,
what happened in that moment do you think?  
SEAN MILLER: I think the emotions got the best of Chase. He has to control his
emotions in that situation. Really, we're not a deep team as it is, especially
up front, losing him didn't help. And it really gave them adjust an extra
surge of momentum at a very unique time in the game. Even though they were the
better team through the first eight minutes of the second half, I don't have
it in front of me, but at the 12 minute mark it was still really either way.
They were up four points, but from the 12 minute mark all the way to the end
-- and some of it is they wore us down, some of it is they're an excellent
team. Rui, the development of him and just what he's become as a player, it's
incredible, he's one of the best forwards that I think plays college
basketball. I don't know if everybody gets the opportunity to see him, in this
tournament they will, but he's a handful and like always Mark and his staff
they just do such a great job of putting their best players in a position to
hurt you. And right around that high post area he just has a really unique way
of being able to face up and make the shot, drive it, and he's really
physical. And again for the first half the same guys played in both halves, I
was very happy with our effort, I didn't think we could play much better,
certainly even defensively. But they wore us down and I thought their
adjustments defensively, switching on and off the ball it kind of took us out
of what we were doing. It's not easy to do that though. When you take your
five man and you switch on to a guard and take your four man and you're
switching out and they're able to do it, I think that says a lot about their
talent on both side of the ball and those two big guys, Brandon Clarke and Rui
tremendous front court, certainly one of the best, and if you look at our two
bigs we were 1-6 from the floor three points. We need to get more out of them.
And then our bench had one field goal and we played our bench quite a bit and
we, guys who didn't start the game played five minutes, 14 minutes, 17
minutes, 18 minutes when you sub like that you need some production. They're
better than they played, but I think fire power off the bench and a little bit
more balance inside and outside will help us. Again, three assists, that's
tough, man, there's not a lot of good basketball being played when you only
have three assists.  
  
Q. I was surprised when I saw three assists, but also you did a good job
of defending the three the first half and they kind of picked up. What did
they do on the offensive end that allowed them to get better looks from you in
terms of offensively?  
SEAN MILLER: They were great, they're a very balanced team. They can hurt you
from behind the arc, they really are terrific in transition and there aren't
many guards that are more experienced or better than Josh Perkins. He can
score, he can make his teammates better, he's averaging eight assists a game
and you can really see how he can do that. He's got a great group to play
with, but it's hard to hold them down for 40 minutes from behind the arc.
Again they were 2-11 from three at the half, maybe they missed a couple open
ones, but our defensive effort and the togetherness through the first 20
minutes, we needed to be able to do that for 40 and we didn't have it in us.  
  
Q. You have to turn the page quickly, so tomorrow what are some of the
things that you would like to see from your team tomorrow? You got to get them
to put this behind and you got to get them to focus. What do you want to see
from them tomorrow?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, I mean, I know Iowa State played very well today and I
think they're a really good team, we're excited to have an opportunity to be
1-0 in this tournament. And when you look at the next two games, Gonzaga and
either Duke or Auburn, that's not an easy, that's not an easy task for
anybody. And right now we have to learn from this game, grow, and that's what
a tournament like this really does. Everybody wants to win. There's going to
be one team that's going to leave here with zero wins and they're going to be
pretty good. Only one team will win all three games and then I think the rest
of us will take what we did and then either build from it, learn from it and
grow. And that's the team we want to be. But Auburn's exceptional, they're a
team that I think can go deep in the NCAA tournament. And Gonzaga's that way,
Duke's that way, so for us I think sharing the ball, seeing if we could have a
little bit more balanced attack and defending a very, very strong team in
transition as well.  
  
Q. I was wondering, when you talked about Gonzaga's defensive
adjustments in the second half do you think that helped them cut down on the
fouling too or was there something else? I mean a drastic difference between
the amount you guys went to the line.  
SEAN MILLER: Yeah, I would say that it did. It was an adjustment that worked.
For us, again, we're not a seasoned group, we're not a group that's been
through a lot of different things together, so early in the year in November,
change can affect us maybe more than other teams or a team, a few of our teams
in the past. We'll learn from this game, we'll grow from it. We played some
excellent basketball through 20, 24 minutes, even the first four minutes of
the second half, maybe the first three minutes of the second half, we were
continuing to play the game like we did in the first half. But Gonzaga's a
better team than us and they really showed it in the second half.  
  
Q. Justin's offense just the last couple games, do you see, I mean you
mentioned of course he had a couple of big time games at Alabama and earlier
in his career, but did you see that coming out this week, does that surprise
you at all?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes and no. He took -- he's playing with a lot of confidence. I
think last night kind of fed into tonight's game. Thank goodness he was able
to score the ball. A big reason we had the lead in the first half and why we
were able to score at all in the second half was because of his efforts. But
we have to be more balanced. Being able to get the ball inside, being able to
drive the ball, pass, share it, that's the types of things that we have done
well over the years and we have to kind of get back to being that team. Maybe
we have to do it a different way, but just driving to shoot and it's not
Justin, it's really our whole team, that gets you in trouble.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Tre Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36243)

### [Marques Bolden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36259)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Duke - 78, Auburn - 72  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Big time game. Both teams played so hard. That was a heck of
a win for us. To play this level of game at this time of the year is amazing
for us. I thought there two guards are really as good as any two guards in the
country. They are big time elite guards and we did, overall, a good job
against them. But they are elite. Tre did a hell of a job and he only had one
turnover, ran our team, I thought he did a good, really good job on Harper.
He's still 7-19, I think, or something like that, yeah. And but they can beat
anybody. They can beat anybody. They're primed to play us and our guys, I'm
proud of them. It's their fifth game to play at that level with that pressure.
Cam hitting the free throws. And then the huge difference I think in the game
was Marques' play, especially in the second half. Just for awhile there it was
play after play. And we had a 12-point lead and we had a chance to kind of I'm
not sure knock them out, but we missed like four really good shots, a couple
threes. And because they're winners, they came back and we made a couple
mistakes down the stretch, but we didn't miss free throws. So big win. I think
we're tired, definitely, and we got to get going again to play whoever we're
going to play tomorrow, is it noon? We play at noon? Yeah. All right. Thank
you. That's it for me.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. Marques, I'm not sure any player on this roster has faced more
scrutiny than you from the time you arrived. What did it feel like today to
sort of be a leader on this team and have the big game that you had here in
Maui?  
MARQUES BOLDEN: I really don't pay much attention to a lot of noise. I know
that my coach and my teammates have my back, so that's really what matters
most to me. And for us to come out and get this win today against a Top-10
team it means a lot.  
  
Q. Tre, you were guarding Jared Harper for much of the game. How was
guarding somebody so fast and so accurate at shooting those threes, especially
down the stretch when you guys really needed to get a stop to put the game
away?  
TRE JONES: He's a really good player like coach said. The coaches gave us a
great game plan against both of those guards, what to do. And I knew that my
teammates had my back no matter how I guarded him. So I felt like we did a
pretty good job and just did what we had to do to get the win.  
  
Q. Tre, this is the first time this year you guys have faced game
pressure like that, a single digit game in the last 10 minutes. What was it
like for you guys to be to -- that was the first time, what did you see from
your teammates and how they handled it?  
TRE JONES: I feel like we handled it really well. We go through those
situations all the time in practice. The coaches prepare us for situations
like this. I feel like we handled the adversity and were able to make the
plays to win the game.  
  
Q. Marques, I know you said you don't listen to the outside noise, but
internally how did you kind of keep yourself focused as you're kind of going
through the ebbs and flows of your career and stay confident in yourself?  
MARQUES BOLDEN: Just by staying positive and trusting the work that I put in.
We have a great coaching staff that's willing to help me whenever I want it.
So for us to just work as hard as I've done these three years has been good.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: One thing I would like to mention for Marques -- remember
Marques, this is the first year he's been healthy the whole time. So he has
continuity of preparation, shape, and it's a big thing. It's a big thing. He's
made the most of it. He's really gotten in great shape and he's taken great
care of himself and as a result he's good. And he's good and he's healthy.  
  
Q. Tre, how much different is this team -- how much better is this team
when Marques is playing the way that he played today?  
TRE JONES: We're a lot better as you see, or as you saw today, what he's
capable of doing. We knew all along what he was capable of doing. We knew he
could play like this. It was only a matter of time for it to come out in
games. So hopefully he can stay like this and he can bring us to the next
level.  
  
Q. Marques, talk about starting alongside the four freshmen there in the
second half. You really came out strong and made those big defensive plays and
that led to offense on the other side. Just how have you developed as a leader
this year playing alongside those guys?  
MARQUES BOLDEN: Those guys are really talented, obviously, as everyone can
see. And I just try to be the older guy on the court talking and just try to
teach the guys everything that I wish I had known coming in.  
  
Q. Marques, back in October you said you were really confident for the
first time in your career here and mostly because you were healthy, but how is
your confidence level? Have you maintained it during that time during in
practice in the early season and what did today do for that?  
MARQUES BOLDEN: I mean I know what I can do. I trust the work that I put in.
So for me to come out and have good games it's no surprise to me or my
teammates.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: One thing I would say about him too, this is the best, by
far, that we have protected our basket in a few years. I mean for a kid to get
seven blocks and change shots in there. He was as good as he was in some of
the offensive things. The defense was exquisite. It was at the highest level.
Seven blocks and changing some shots, man, that's a heck of a performance.  
  
Q. Tre, coach talks about you guys having kind of position-less kind of
basketball, but it's clear that you're the floor general. What are some of the
things that you try to do in those crucial moments to get that momentum going
with your teammates?  
TRE JONES: I try to surround them with a lot of talented players as you guys
know. So my job I feel like is just be a leader for us, try to get us
organized and get those guys in spots to be successful.  
  
Q. Marques, Coach mentioned it's the first year you have been healthy.
How frustrating was some of those previous years with the injuries you had to
overcome?  
MARQUES BOLDEN: Obviously it was really frustrating. I hadn't really dealt
with any injuries up until that point. And then for me to be coming into
college so young it was just kind of frustrating. But like I said, trusting my
coaches, my teammates, we have a great training staff who gets us right, so,
yeah, I just work with them every day and stay healthy.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Before they leave I would like one more thing about Marques.
In his freshman year he was starting and then got hurt and then never got back
to that level. His sophomore year he's playing really well and we have a lot
of bigs that we had a rotation. And then he had an injury in January. And so
he hasn't been the luckiest guy in the world. And we're proud of him because
he's stuck in there and we're fortunate. These freshmen are fortunate to have
him on our team.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for coach, please.  
  
Q. Last night talked a little bit about Zion kind of working through
some frustration. It seemed like he go frustrated early on in this game, but
it seems like he kind of picked up in other ways. What kind of growth did you
see from him in this game today?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I thought, I actually thought today he put some pressure on
himself. He usually is a kid that's having a lot of fun. At one of the
timeouts in the first half I said, smile, have fun, like that's -- I think he
wants to be so good and that we got to be careful for all these guys not to
put pressure on themselves and just to play the game because they love to
play. Then he got better on it. He and Cam have to -- it's part of learning.
They have to stay away from silly fouls. And Cam only played seven minutes in
the first half and got his third foul and we don't, we try to maneuver that
when a guy gets two. So if we're going to win a big game, we need our main
players in there. And the third foul was really a silly foul, 90 feet from the
bucket. And however, I thought he hit the biggest shot of the game when they
hit their three to go down, they were down five and he came down, it wasn't
called or anything, he just, boom, he got us back to eight. That's a big-time,
it's a big-time play. I thought that was the play of the game, really.  
  
Q. You guys have knocked teams out pretty much in the first half all
year. I want to ask you some of the things I asked Tre about. The way they
handled the first time in a tight situation, what did you see in their faces
during timeouts --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, it's the season. You look at our league we're going to be
in a lot of games. We're going to get beat. You can get beat and play well.
And this team would be an outstanding team in any league. And a lot of these
kids won the SEC regular season last year and I can see why. And Bruce does a
hell of a job of getting them to play so hard. And when they have Wiley out
they really spread you and shoot the 3, and then Wiley is coming on. These two
games he's played better, a lot better than he did in the two previous games.
So and when they get Purifoy back they're, they're right there. So to play
this level of game at this time, and we'll play another one tomorrow no matter
who we play.  
  
Q. Kind of regardless of who you play tomorrow, the bullseye is going to
be, as it often is, on your guys' back and you talked about them having fun
with this, but how do you manage this because the longer this boulder rolls
along, the more the pressure becomes on them?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know if they -- when I said that about Zion I don't,
I don't want you to think that I feel that these guys are all feeling
pressure. I just thought he wasn't himself today to begin with. And then
obviously he made some good plays. It's got to be fun for them. And they can't
let -- and I'll do everything I can not to let them think that everything is
won in November or December. But what we need to do is just use the season to
get better and don't worry about, no one gives a trophy for who is No. 1 in
November, December, January or February. Even March. And don't play for things
that the outside wants you to play for. Play for what you want to play for and
that's fun, getting better. They really like each other, they love each other,
and they play so hard. For us at the end of the game we needed to understand
time and score. We had a break and the ball and a 10-point lead and we turned
it over when we should have taken time and gone up by 12 or 13. Until you're
in those situations you don't learn them. 8-point lead, inbounding the ball
and we didn't post to get it, and they're playing hard, they have been in
those situations. So we'll point those things out -- and you're not going to
learn them, experience is the best way to learn, and hopefully we can get that
experience and win. But it might be that you get an experience and you lose
too. So but today they won and I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. This is a little off topic so I apologize, but yesterday you
mentioned getting a perfect 2-1 at the end of the first half. And in both
games you're not auto benching guys with two fouls in the first half. Why do
you think -- these are all normal things in the NBA, they're not normal in
college basketball. Do you have an opinion on why more college basketball
coaches don't do it?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think there's so many ways to coach, so many different
systems, and all of them at some time have won, so there's not a perfect way
of doing it. I think you have to do what you believe is right. And so for my
whole career I've played guys with two fouls. And if I'm playing against a
coach that doesn't play, then I go at -- I try to go at that guy at different
times during the half because that's the best way to play defense on them. But
again, sometimes when we have done that in the second half that coach has
beaten me. So there's not, it's not the perfect thing. But we have always gone
two for one. I think the international stuff that I've done helps me in that
regard because that's what those guys do. They do it just naturally and it's
beautiful when you get it done.  
  
Q. There's, in the sport of basketball, there's the wrong play, the
right play, and the necessary play. About 90 percent of the time your team
makes the right play or the necessary play. What do you attribute to the high
acumen of basketball IQ of this team collectively?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, recruiting. And then giving them a system where they're
allowed to think and react, not where they, there's, you don't put them in a
box. They, you let them grow freely. And so the development of their mind in
the game is huge. And then through talk, if you can combine all five minds,
then it's unbelievable. But I think that's the way kids get better. All of our
guys get better. Every kid that plays for us gets better. And because we, we
do that. And these kids are getting better. Hopefully they will get a lot
better.  
  
Q. About four years ago Tyus Jones kind of stepped into a role as a
leader on this team. Now we're watching Tre. How do they compare in terms of
their maturity level at this stage of their career?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Really the maturity level the same. Actually, Tre's ahead of
him defensively because Tyus played only zone in high school. But the ability
of understanding the game, being there to make big plays, great teammate, all
the stuff. They have all the intangibles, the Jones boys have all the
intangibles. Whatever Debbie Jones has fed them has worked. And I think that
the other thing is Tre's more ready maybe than even Tyus because Tre has Tyus.
Tyus had his older brother. He didn't have a guy who went through all this.
And they're so close. Tyus flew from California in between games to see his
brother in his first game. And ironically it's the same city that Tyus ended
his career. Tre -- I don't know that karma stuff, it's kind of cool. And do
you know what? Just a lot is said about Jimmy Butler. Good, bad. Jimmy
provided the transportation to have Tre's brother Tyus there. I texted him
right after the game. And he played for us on the Olympic team and that's a
hell of a -- they're basketball people. They just have lived the game and
we're benefiting from that. No question about it.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Josh Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30801)

### [Zach Norvell Jr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36260)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Gonzaga - 91, Arizona - 74  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MARK FEW: Another wild night in Lahaina. I've had a lot of those, but this one
was definitely memorable. So unbelievable job by our guys. We made some
halftime adjustments and they really, really bought in and flipped the switch.
We guarded much much better in the second half, played without fouling, and
took much much better care of the ball and pushed it. When these guys do that
they can be pretty special on the offensive end and I think that showed.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. You were down 13 with seven minutes ago, what's going through your
mind there? And then what sparked that comeback?  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Just staying positive. Every huddle we had we never really
talked about the score or nothing like that. We always knew we had it in us.
Coach did a good job of keeping our spirits up and not dwelling on the last
play or anything like that and we were able to respond pretty well.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: Like he said, a lot of credit goes to our coaching staff keeping
our head in it, but in the huddle we stayed positive and we stuck together.
Adversity hit, but at times like that, we stuck together and that's what came
out the win tonight.  
  
Q. Probably along the same lines. You look at it, you're shooting 2-11
from three-point land, you're confident shooters. What adjustments did you
feel like you made in the second half to kind of get a little bit more of the
flow offensively?  
JOSH PERKINS: Those are shots we usually make. Shooters shoot, is what we say.
And a guy like Snacks, he never let's his confidence waver. We tell him to
keep shooting it because more times it's going to go in than not. So we stayed
positive and stuck together as a team and we fought the adversity to fouls and
shots not going in, but we stuck with it, stayed together, and we stayed
confident. And a lot credit goes to our coaching staff and for us digging it
deep to get that win.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Exactly what he said. We shoot thousands of shots day-in and
day-out, so just trying to put this one behind us. We had a good team effort,
we were able to pull it out, just ready for the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Josh, how much does experience factor into that attitude that you
don't get rattled at all because it's loud in there and people are going crazy
and you guys kind of weathered it?  
JOSH PERKINS: I think it was a lot. It's not experience just for me, it's
experience from Coach Few and the coaching staff. They have been there before
and they stay positive and never -- and it didn't waver within us. So I
mentioned to the guys to stay positive, stick together. And we all did that.
You didn't see anybody's head going down, you didn't see us bickering at each
other. It was all positivity in the huddles. We knew things would go our way
eventually and it did and we came out with the win, so I'm glad we did that.  
  
Q. A lot of fouls in the first half, at the line a lot. What did you
guys do to ratchet up the defense without continuing to foul?  
JOSH PERKINS: They shot 22 free throws in the first half and made 19 of them.
We knew coming in they were a great free throw shooting team and that was
something they did and they took pride to get to the line. So second half we
switched a lot of things, kept our hands back and made things tough on them. A
lot of credit goes to them for getting to the line the first half, but I think
a lot of credit goes to us in the second half for getting our hands back and
adjusting to how the referees were calling the game in the first half.  
  
Q. For both guys, how much are you guys looking forward to Duke
tomorrow?  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Really excited. Any time you can play a top opponent like
that as a competitor, you are really excited. Also just knowing that our
coaches have a good game plan for us tonight to be able to wash this game down
the drain and be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: I think Zach tackled it. In this tournament we played Arizona
and Duke, so those are both programs that growing up you watch. So to play
them is a blessing that basketball gives us. So can't even speak for what
we're going through right now, but to play Duke tomorrow, Coach K obviously a
Hall of Fame coach and a guy that we know about. But like coach -- like Snacks
said, our coach got a great game plan for us, so if we follow that we should
be in good hands and looking forward to a big time matchup tomorrow.  
  
Q. Josh, how much more confidence does the team have getting these wins
without a guy like Tillie because of injury?  
JOSH PERKINS: Yeah, I mean we're playing well without one of our soldiers. And
I think guys are going confidently, guys like Filip, guys like Corey, guys
like Jeremy Jones, MVP yesterday, doesn't get a lot of credit, but Jeremy got
us that win yesterday. So guys like that confidence grows and when Tillie
comes back it's going to be a team added with Tillie. So looking forward to
him getting back, but we're playing for him right now. We definitely are.  
  
Q. It's always a pretty incredible atmosphere at the Kennel, but my ears
are still ringing from what happened in there. I can't even imagine what it's
going to be like in the championship game. What do you guys anticipate as far
as the environment tomorrow?  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Just Zag fans being Zag fans. Ever since I've been playing
here our fans travel well. Really looking forward to them being there
tomorrow, feed off their energy and can't wait.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: Yeah, I mean, my ears are ringing still, too. Before the game
listening to Duke fans I couldn't even hear my music in the ear pods, it was
so loud in the gym. So combining our fans with their fans, should be more ear
ringing, but hopefully our fans are louder than theirs tomorrow and I know
they will be.  
  
Q. You talked about watching Duke and Arizona growing up, kind of like
that's a name brand program. Aren't you guys one of those too now?  
JOSH PERKINS: Oh, yeah, yeah. We came here for a reason, you know. I said
Coach K was a Hall of Fame coach, we got a Hall of Fame coach on our side too.
And rolling with the guys we have, and I know coach is too, so like we said
we're looking forward to that matchup tomorrow and showing the world who we
are.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR: Just to piggyback off what Perkins said, we're a top program
too. Like our coaching staff did a good job building this program up to where
it is now. Gonzaga is a household name now and I'm pretty sure everyone knows
around the country with the runs we have been having and great job with this
guy and Coach Few and the coaching staff has done.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. The guys talked about it, but tomorrow at noon Maui time, is that
going to be a little bit different for the championship game?  
MARK FEW: Yeah, yeah. I mean it really, really makes for a short prep tonight,
so we'll do what we can. It's about these guys playing. They did a heck of a
job making adjustments on the fly in the second half. I mean a heck of a job
because we switched basically our whole game plan there at the half. And so --
and I think it's going to take something like that. We'll have to really
cerebrally challenge them tonight and there's not going to be any physical
things we can do, but just come out and play. But that's what makes this
tournament awesome. This little band box that we play in and you don't get the
locker room until 10 minutes before you go out on the floor and teams are
filing in and filing out. It's back to the true essence of why we all got
involved in basketball. So we'll get them ready and they will be ready and
we'll give it a good run.  
  
Q. I don't know how specific you can be to what -- how when you say you
flipped the switch entirely, what you did. But also -- and also, can you do
that with a team that's not as experienced as this one is?  
MARK FEW: No, no, no, you can't. And it wasn't anything diabolical or
inventing the atom or anything, but it was just getting back to who we are. We
lost our way a little bit with some silly turnovers that kind of got them
going. We fouled way way way too much and just obviously there was some legit
ones, but then we had some real silly ones that weren't really smart. But we
did change a couple things defensively that really helped, I think kind of
keep us out of foul trouble. And then also just offensively got back. We
played with massive foul trouble in that first half, so our lineups were
really literally probably as crazy as we have had all year. So we really lost
a lot of our offensive flow. That's why we rode those guys hard in the second
half.  
  
Q. Obviously this tournament is just an ultimate test here at this time
of the year, but I wanted to get your thoughts on what it would mean if you
guys can pull it out to win a Maui Invitational title under this season's
circumstances?  
MARK FEW: Well, we have won it before. It was an awesome, awesome feeling.
It's an incredible accomplishment, especially with the field we're looking at
here. Makes for a great Thanksgiving, which we get the day off. So I'll take
full advantage of that playing and frolicking in Maui. But it will put me in a
lot better mood, that's for sure. But, again, you got to realize when you're
playing this stiff of competition there's a lot -- you get exposed and there's
a lot to learn about your team, so I just like we learned tonight, we got
tested and pushed from the brink there and didn't break so I think that's a
great sign for us moving forward. Again, especially that we're doing this
without Killian Tillie, Killian Tillie is one of our best players and a lot of
nights he's our best player. And he solves, I say this all the time, he's my
problem solver. He solves a lot of things out there. And both nights obviously
just with depth alone but I really give these guys credit, they're scratching
and clawing and figuring out ways -- Jeremy Jones came in and there and give
us great minutes and Filip came in there and held his own. And on short prep,
we just got to rest them up and it should be a fun, I'd say night but it's
going to be morning, be a fun morning in about eight hours or whatever it is.
I don't want to see any of you guys in the bars tonight now. You guys get
ready to get down here and cover this properly, all right?  
  
Q. What's the one or two things you need to do tomorrow to get in the W
column?  
MARK FEW: Take better, take good care of the ball. We have taken great care of
the ball other than some zaniness against Illinois which they can bring and
then this first half. You can't turn the ball over and let Duke get out and
run. And we just got to defend aggressively, like we did in the second half
there without fouling. I think those will be two big keys. And again I need to
watch some more of them tonight, I've just kind of been glancing at them here
and there, so.

## November 20, 2018

  

### [Brian Dutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33374)

### [Jordan Schakel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36251)

### [Devin Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34926)

### [Jalen McDaniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34927)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
SDSU - 79, Xavier - 74  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Start with an opening comment from coach and take questions for
the players.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Well, I had the team prepared for a 9:45 start, unfortunately
the game started at 9:30. So they got out on us so fast, they made every
three, and even as a guy that sat through a lot of games I sat there and
wondered what in the world are we going to do to come back in this thing. But
I told the team before the game, I love my team. They play with great grit and
great determination and they got down 19 and they didn't panic and they didn't
point fingers and they just kept playing hard. Of and then we started
stringing some stops together and I think I told them at the 7:30 media
timeout let's get it down to 10 by halftime and we got it even closer than
that. I think it was a two or three point game at halftime. So we fought back
and then we continued our momentum into the second half, anybody that's heard
me talk about my team knows that I always love assisted baskets, I think we
had 26 baskets, 24 baskets, 17 of them assisted. So I thought once we settled
in and quit trying to drive the ball where it shouldn't go and just shared the
ball, we played much better offensively and I'm proud of the comeback and the
grit this team has.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. Jalen, when you get it going like that and knowing that you were down
and you had to carry it, what's that feeling on the floor?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: Man, it feels great. It just all started on defense picking
up full court playing with a lot of energy and just keeping it up. I feel like
when we did that the tone we just set the tone from that point on.  
  
Q. Jalen, there's that key three you shot right at the end of the shot
clock, you know what I'm talking about, late in the game?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: Yeah.  
  
Q. Talk us through what you saw there and did you know these rims were
really, really loose and the ball would pop over like that.  
JALEN MCDANIELS: I remember we first got here and we had a shoot around I said
these are the softest rims I ever played on. But he passed me the ball and it
was like three seconds and I had no other choice and I was confident shooting
it, so that's something I've been working on, so I'm glad I hit it.  
  
Q. What happened there? I mean what were you guys thinking down 19 and
what do you think the key was to be able to turn that around?  
JORDAN SCHAKEL: I was thinking we just need to get our energy up and start a
little something because we had nothing going at all and Jalen started picking
up full court, Jeremy gave us a lot of energy and I think we all fed off of
that and it was really the energy that got us going and the shots just fell
later, but the energy really started it and I think the coaches really told us
we need to pick it up and that's what we did.  
  
DEVIN WATSON: Basketball is a game of runs, and then when you're just out
there not thinking just flowing and living in the moment and playing freely
that definitely helps us out.  
  
Q. Devin and Jordan, Nathan comes in, he subbed in, he was a disrupter
for you guys. Talk about his ability to kind of get you guys on that run and
to kind of seemed like once he came in he was disruptive and was able to get
you guys on those pushes to kind of start cutting the lead down.  
JORDAN SCHAKEL: Nate played really big minutes for us tonight. I'm really
happy for him. He's been playing the same way in practice, it's really nice to
see him play that way in the game. He gave us great energy and his length and
athleticism gave us the different aspect that we needed in this game.  
  
DEVIN WATSON: I agree with Jordan, when Nate gets in he's going to play with
energy, he's going to be energetic on the defensive end, block shots, yeah. He
played well tonight.  
  
Q. They make five of seven threes to open the game and yesterday it was
six of eight. What's going through your mind? Do you just start thinking oh
they're eventually going to miss or did you have to change something
defensively to -- I mean they missed 13 straight after that.  
JALEN MCDANIELS: I feel like it was just ball pressure, pressuring the ball,
not giving them no room to shoot the ball and just keeping the hover hand. I
feel like when they hit them first threes I feel like we were late, and they
were kind of open, so in the second half and later in the first half we fixed
that.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. I think there was a point there in the first half where you actually
played zone for the first time this season. Did you figure we had nothing to
lose and did that kind of help flip the momentum a little bit?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, our man defense was doing so well I thought we better try
some zone. So we played a couple possessions of zone. I thought it was fine.
They brought Welage back in and so we got right out of it, because he's such a
dynamic sure. But once he came back in we got out of the zone and it just gave
us maybe a little different look, a different feel. Sometimes a zone doesn't
have to get stops, sometimes it just changes the momentum of the game, so I'll
have to go back and watch the tape and see if the momentum changed at all.
Sometimes they get the same baskets but the feel for the game is different and
sometimes a team will say they will get out of rhythm as to what they were
doing and then they have to re-invent themselves sometimes. But I don't know
that for a fact until I watch the game but we are definitely going to zone
more this year and more so when Nathan is in -- Nathan had a great first half,
sensational -- and then he made a couple freshman-type mistakes early in the
second half and I went with Nolan and Nolan played a great second half
defensively. So I finally had a true five man in the game for most of the game
and I think it helped us out defensively.  
  
Q. After a tough struggle yesterday and beginning of this first half
these are the kind of games you learn something about your team. What did you
learn about them today?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: That they're not pointing fingers at one another. That they
come and they pay attention in the huddles they want to be coached, they want
to be told what they have to do to help turn the tide of the game. We're not a
blue blood, but our crowd travels like one. I thought the crowd was great for
us today. Once we started some momentum, we had great Aztec support, they were
loud, they were into the game and I think they really helped our energy level
too. You're talking back-to-back games, I looked at the minutes and Devin
played 39, Jalen played 36 or something, Jordan 30 some, and that's back-to-
back games and to try to put that kind of energy and effort out there at the
defensive end was really attribute to the kids and then attribute to the Aztec
fans to keep that momentum going for us the way they cheered us on.  
  
Q. What happened to the mentality of a team you lose by 26 yesterday I
think it was your worst loss in 10 years, most lopsided, you're down 19, you
know, 10 minutes into the game today. What happens with the mentality of
players, they just decide that's enough or what goes on there?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: That's where you find out about your team. You don't know until
it happens. I thought we played a pretty good first half against Duke. We had
it hovering around 10 or 11 and they hit back-to-back threes to end the game
and it's 17. That's like every game I watched them play. You think you're
playing pretty good and you lose a segment by five points, well that was a
pretty good segment. Well, the next one you're down 10 and the by halftime
you're down 20 and you've been playing pretty good basketball. That's how good
they are. And so to get 19 today, at the start of the game when both teams go
out to mid court to jump, jump ball, the coaches are like, well that looks
more normal and that's the size kids we normally play and that's a very good
team and they got big kids but Duke is just so much bigger than everybody
else. So it shows, you come here to learn about your team and we learned that
I have attempt that doesn't give up when they get down, that they play hard
all the way to the end and I'm proud of them for that.  
  
Q. There is a lot of focus obviously put on playing the No. 1 team in
the country but in a tournament like this you have a chance to get out of here
with two wins, just talk about the importance of that possibility.  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Out of the last seven, eight years I think every event we
played in we come out with a minimum of two wins. I think we won the
Diamondhead a couple years ago and last time we played in this event we lost
to Arizona in the championship. So I wish we were on the championship end of
the thing, but this is the bracket we're in, and we will go home and prep like
crazy and try to come out of here with two wins tomorrow against very good
Illinois and Iowa State teams.

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Trent Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34688)

### [Giorgi Bezhanishvili](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36248)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Gonzaga - 84, Illinois - 78  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for the players first.  
  
Q. Giorgi, as Trent was going off in that second half just what was
going through your guys' heads?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: Oh, at the halftime Trent said we have to turn up, I had
to turn up, and I was waiting on that moment from Trent. And then he just
started going, he just started to heat up, he was on fire, and we just said
hey, give Trent the ball, make him do his thing and he was hitting threes, he
was on fire, and we were excited for him but unfortunately we lost the game.  
  
Q. Trent, the game seemed to be slipping away a little bit and in the
first half maybe getting some rust out or whatever, but what were you feeling,
and what did you think tonight showed?  
TRENT FRAZIER: I would say me last year that wouldn't have happened. I kind
of, I was letting those shots get to me but the coaching staff and my
teammates helped me get through that first half of just missing shots. And
just I decided to do things where I could help my teammates like getting
rebounds, getting assists, just doing other things instead of scoring. But
second half I found my rhythm.  
  
Q. Trent -- actually Giorgi, answer this one first and then Trent. What
combinations of Illini guys were most effective tonight?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: All combinations. All combinations. With coach whatever
lineup coach puts in, that's the best lineup, I feel like. And you guys saw
it, we were down, we came back, everybody was fighting, everybody played for
each other, that's what we are about, we are every day guy. I feel like every
lineup was the lineup that should be in the game.  
  
TRENT FRAZIER: Oh, yeah, piggyback off that. Whoever coach put out there
that's the guys he trusts at that time. Doesn't matter from walk-ons to
starters, we're going to do what we do, whether it's rebounding, getting to
the line, just doing our principles and doing them, playing your role. And so
combinations, I don't really look at that. Whoever he puts out is going to
play hard, doesn't matter.  
  
Q. Trent, can you talk about when you started to feel it and when you
kind of thought, hey, we're back in this game?  
TRENT FRAZIER: I started feeling it, we started getting a few stops, I seen a
few balls go in, obviously I got going. But I didn't think the offense was our
problem tonight. We could score easily on anybody. Down the stretch we didn't
get enough stops and I think that was the problem. We kept fouling and so we
kept putting them to the free-throw line where they kept getting free points.
So I think that's where we beat ourself up right there.  
  
Q. Trent, what did you think of the atmosphere tonight and the
electricity in the Arena?  
TRENT FRAZIER: Felt like State Farm in here tonight. These Illini fans are
amazing. It doesn't matter, we're in Maui they're going to be here. It doesn't
matter where we're at in the country, we have a strong supporting cast and
it's a blessing to have so many, so much orange up there in the stands to come
support us, play all the way down in Maui. And I think that's just the
greatest feeling, just to play out there and play so hard for them. But we
came up short, but we got a game in 15 hours, so we're not going to let that
game bother us. We're just going to prepare for tomorrow.  
  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: Yesterday the coaches meeting or whatever, I think it
was Gonzaga coach who was talking about they have Top-5 fan base in the
nation. I can say probably we have the Top-5 fan base in the nation, just from
this game. And then the game before. So I think we have Top-5 fan base in the
nation. They're just great. A lot of teams don't have it and we really
appreciate it.  
  
Q. Given that atmosphere do you feel like you're fighting for respect,
and how are you battling that? Y'all played hard tonight, but obviously the
Zags were seen as the top billing for the night, but it felt like you were
playing with a chip on your shoulder, how does that feel to kind of really try
to establish that culture for your team and to really kind of get that respect
that you all think you deserve?  
TRENT FRAZIER: Being a sophomore I'm used to this. It's like that in State
Farm every night. We have 15,000 people in there screaming and yelling,
rooting for us. It doesn't matter we're down 30 or up 30, it's still a packed
house. So to have so many, so much orange up there in the stands, it's
incredible. Like you said I think we have the best supporting cast in the
country and I wouldn't want to play for any other school.  
  
Q. For both you guys, how do you turn this into something? How do you
turn this into tomorrow, the next day, being able to close out a win?  
TRENT FRAZIER: We go win tomorrow. We forget about this game. This game's over
with, we're going to start preparing for tomorrow and we're just going to go
out there, same energy, same intensity, go out there and try to get a W.  
  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: Coach talks about light switch mentality. We forget
about it, this is over now, we have to think about next game, get the next
win, that's our goal, we go step by step. So that light switch mentality we
forget this game and we go to the next one.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach now.  
  
Q. What would you like to say about the defensive intensity that
manifested that comeback?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think there were some positives. I was really pleased the
first half. I thought the first half we were sensational. I thought the second
half we got complacent and sloppy and Gonzaga does what they do. You look at
their numbers, what they have done to opponents in the second half, that's all
we spent a lot of time this week talking about that. And it was foul, foul,
foul, foul, foul. And again give them credit, it's what they do. They just
slaughter people at the free-throw line and we didn't help that. I do think
the changes our, little three quarter court press, our little half court 1-3-1
seemed to disrupt the rhythm. We had two or three stops and we felt like we
could really turn them over. We felt like that was something that would be a
positive. We turned it over 14 times the first half. The second half they just
came in a different method with our a, little more of our zone.  
  
Q. On that point, Gonzaga entered with I think the 8th best offensive
turnover percentage in the country. They do not turn it over regularly. How
much of that, what you were able to do to them especially in the first half,
is the by product of Killian Tillie not being involved?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: That's a great question. I don't know. I think it's more they
had, I think Perkins was eight and a half to one assist to turnovers coming
in. He had 25 assists or 26 and three turnovers. We turned a senior elite
point guard over, I don't know what did we turn him, seven times? I'll take
that every single night. We were turning a high major elite point guard on a
top-5 team over seven times. Now he got his. He got his assists, but the thing
was that number became half their team assists and that's something that we
strive for a lot. But again give them credit. I haven't seen them play enough
with Tillie to know what dimension he gives them. I know this, there's not a
better defensive player in the country in my opinion than the Clarke kid. And
he's sensational. We tried everything we could do to get him out of the action
and to get him as far away from it, and he's a terrific shot blocker, we were
effective early, we did exactly what we wanted to do early, which is go right
at him. And Giorgi put a couple fouls on him and but he was, he impacted the
game a great deal in the second half.  
  
Q. What do you make of the plus minus figures that you get in this box
score? You get Ayo's minus twenty. Alan Griffin is plus seven. Does that mean
anything?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Those fluctuate from game to game. We pay a lot of attention
to it. And Ayo had a tough night early. He got going, he, he'll bounce back,
he's a really, really good player and just had a tough night. And I'm really
proud of Alan. That's a young man that missed a game, missed our first game of
the year due to injury and has bounced back and sort of getting his feet wet a
little bit and to see him step up, we know he's an elite shooter. And but to
make some plays defensively was, I'm really excited about that.  
  
Q. Did you not like the matchups with Kipper? Did you not like something
that you were seeing specifically?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: No. Kipper just played in foul trouble tonight. Kipper was in
no flow, no rhythm. He had two fouls in the first two minutes and then picked
up a third. And we like that small lineup. You start looking at our rebound
totals, Aaron had to know and Da'Monte had nine. Those guys go chase a lot of
balls. And it wasn't anything that happened with Kipper tonight other than
just some foul trouble and we got in a pretty good groove with some other
guys.  
  
Q. Last game you didn't have full team. Didn't have Frazier and
obviously you had a fantastic second half. What do you think your team showed
and how do they translate this into tomorrow and the next day?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: We're going to see. That's the great challenge. We have got a
mantra that we use that's all over our locker room, every day guys and
tomorrow's another day. We do this every day. We practice -- I try to be the
most consistent head coach in the country in what we do in practice every
single day. It doesn't fluctuate. We're going to go two and a half to three
hours and we're going to go. And we're going to tape on the day of the game
and we're going to work so there's no surprise. And we know that whether it's
this tournament or it's a post-season tournament or it's the NCAA tournament
you got quick turns, this is no shock. And we practice in the morning so we
get done at night, we practice 7 o'clock every morning. So quick turn and
we'll throw it up and go against a very, very good team, against a team that's
extremely well coached.  
  
Q. What did Giorgi show you again against high major competition
tonight?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: That's really good player. He's really a good player. And I
think once he -- I was disappointed in his four turnovers the first half.
Couple of them were really sloppy. He got a little bit tired, a little bit
fatigued and missed a couple chippies that he usually makes. But he's got
unbelievable footwork, he's a great pivot guy. I would like to see him get
fouled more with some of those and that. We have all seen him knock down
threes, which he's done very, very consistently and I thought he took a bad
one late I didn't want, but I didn't want to -- I'm not going to handcuff him
because's very good player and he's extremely high IQ and he's got a bright
future.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Travis Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36242)

### [Ryan Welage](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30504)

### [Paul Scruggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35160)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Auburn - 88  
  
Xavier - 79  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll have an opening statement by coach, please.  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: First off, this is why we come to Maui, we want to play against
great competition. And obviously Auburn's a tremendous team. They got a great
back court. They do, Harper and Brown really controlled the game I thought on
both ends of the floor. I thought our guys really competed though. And I think
we got to make better decisions. Obviously I think the tale of the game was
turnovers. We got to make better decisions with the ball and not make rushed
decisions, because that's what Auburn does great, they're really good on the
glass, which I thought early on in the game that's where Auburn was scoring a
lot of points on second chance points. And then I thought we really limited
that as the game went on, which I was really proud of our guys for doing that
because they're fifth in the country in offensive rebounding percentage. But
it was turnovers and I thought we took a few rushed shots, but again, really
proud of the way our guys competed. Obviously we have another, we're going to
have another big time game tomorrow and we're going to have to get ready for
that.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Thank you. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Paul, obviously not the ending that you would have wanted here but
your team played better than it had in the first three games. What do you
think you guys did well today or where did you grow today do you think?  
PAUL SCRUGGS: I feel like we grew on our defensive end because that's what we
emphasize in practice. So I feel like we took that to heart and put it in
play.  
  
Q. Paul, at the end of regulation you had two kind of big plays back-to-
back there, the three and then down at the other end you make the save going
out of bounds there for the steal. What was that like at the end of the game,
the feeling the momentum there, I mean?  
PAUL SCRUGGS: Just trying to do whatever possible to help my team win.  
  
Q. Ryan, this team as a whole has trouble from the free-throw line in
this young season but in the second half today you were like 19-20 from the
line. Is there any reason why you think that there was such great consistency
in the second half from the line?  
RYAN WELAGE: We just work on the basics like shooting free throws every day
and I think we have been getting better in a lot of areas throughout the
season and we improved in this game, that was one of the areas.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for coach, please.  
  
Q. What are you going to impress upon to your guys after this game?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I think, number one, I think Auburn's a tremendous team,
they're a Top-10 team in the country for a reason. We can compete with
anybody. I really believe that. I told our guys that going into this game. I
knew the last war -- because we break that game down into four minute wars --
I knew it was going to be close. I told those guys, like going into it, it's
going to be a one or two possession game and we're going to have a shot. I
wholly believed that. And we just got to be committed to the process. We're
not where we want to be, but we're not where we were as well. I thought we
grew a lot in the last week out here in the last three days of practice
leading up to Auburn, I thought we cleaned up a lot of things, but we got to
be able to turn the page pretty quickly because we're going to play against
another tremendous team tomorrow whether it's Duke or San Diego State we got
another great opportunity out here.  
  
Q. We talked about Quentin before now he's kind of struggled since
coming back from injury and certainly Auburn's pressure had a lot to do with
his performance today, but what can he do to turn the corner? I think he had
like seven turnovers today and took a couple shots that maybe you wouldn't
have wanted.  
TRAVIS STEELE: Again he hasn't practiced for a month and it's hard, it's hard,
like and then all of a sudden you get thrust into play Wisconsin, and Auburn,
two really, really good teams and I think it's hard to find his rhythm. He's
going to figure it out. We're going to rely on Q heavily, obviously, he's a
tremendous player, I believe in him. Auburn, that's what they do though, they
turn teams over at a very, very high rate. They're going to put pressure on
you the entire game. He's going to get there though, I believe in him, our
teammates believe in him, he's going to figure it out, and we just got to keep
showing him film because he's thrusted into a different role than he was last
year. Last year we were able to rely on J.P. and Trevon Bluiett to make all
these shots from 30 feet. We don't have that any more. And so now it's a
different team, and guys are trying to figure out their role within the team
and we're going through some growing pains with that. But that's okay. I
believe in him as a player, he's a tremendous player, and we're going to keep
on learning and growing kind of moving forward.  
  
Q. Last two games, two losses against quality opponents but in both of
those games they could have very easily gotten away from you, but your guys
kind of fought. Did you anticipate in preseason practice that you were going
to have a team that fought this way, that kind of a never say die attitude or
is it surprising to you?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I don't think it's surprising, it's who we recruit. I think we
have tough kids, we have winners, Paul, Tyrique and Naji and Q and Elias were
on team last year where we were a one seed in the NCAA tournament. So they're
used to winning. And we had a lot of close games last year. But again we got
to learn how to be able to execute in those close games, how to get a shot,
who we're going to go to, different things like that. And then again we're I
think our guys, like I said, are learning kind of who they are and kind of
within our team concept and going through some growing pains with that. But
we'll get there and I'm really proud of the way our guys competed today
against a tremendous Auburn team.

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Nick Weiler-Babb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36247)

### [Marial Shayok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30844)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Arizona - 71, Iowa State - 66  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Start with an opening statement from coach then we'll take
questions for the players.  
  
STEVE PROHM: First off the atmosphere was terrific. Our fan base traveled
incredibly well, but it was an electric environment. And I credit Arizona the
second half and we talked about it at halftime. We had to be disciplined
defensively and then if we're fundamentally sound offensively we'll have a
great chance to come out of here with a win. 44 points in the second half is
too much. But credit Arizona, they made big plays down the stretch with some
threes by Coleman, some big offensive rebounds by Luther, that was the
difference.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. What were the last 11 minutes, you guys had a 10-point lead, 11:02 to
go and then what happened there after that?  
NICK WEILER-BABB: I mean it came down to they made big shots, we couldn't get
a stop, and we got, they got a couple of offensive rebounds late in the game
that really hurt. And I think our shot selection really needs to improve and
it came down to little plays like that.  
  
Q. Nick, can you expand on the shot selection. What looks did you think
you guys needed to improve upon down the stretch there?  
NICK WEILER-BABB: I think mostly just like in transition we took a lot of
shots after they got layups and we maybe could have got a better shot. It
might have been a good look, but at that point in time we needed a great look.
There's nothing really specific but just the early shots in transition.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: All right, take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You seemed to have them under control a little bit in the first half
defending the three-point line. What did you see change in the second half
when they were getting little better looks than you were allowing in the first
half?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, I think that the second half they were 6-14 from three and
it started really with the first possession of the half. We're up nine, we've
guarded down to the last two, three seconds on the shot clock and we help off
the corner, which that's our rule is to stay at home. So we give Luther an
open three there. I thought Coleman, we wanted to go under some ball screens,
but the one time Tyrese really went way under we gave Coleman a really good
look and then he made a couple big threes too. But that was the challenge in
the second half, can we be as fundamentally sound defensively. We held them to
27 points, we really competed. They had other at the other end of the floor,
you really can't hear, and so we just got to continue to grow from that. But
we can't give up 50 percent, almost 60 percent from three and expect to win.
Too many points. And then obviously we struggled the last 10 minutes with
getting good shots and then finishing some plays too.  
  
Q. 4-24 from three, obviously you're not happy with that but 24 threes,
is that a number you're comfortable with this team that you have currently?  
STEVE PROHM: Yes and no. Because I don't think all -- I bet a third of them we
didn't need. Too many quick contested threes, I thought, to where I thought
when we really got good ball movement we really opened up gaps, I thought we
really got good things. We were on a good pace, we had 54 points with 11
minutes to go, so we're, we have got a really good chance to maybe mid 70's, I
don't know, 72 I think, that's where mathematically it would end up. But it
was just too many contested, too many quick shots and then we were back on
defense. We have got to be more fundamentally sound offensively. Again, I had
to tell them all the time, you give them freedom, we got to make good
decisions with that but we got to know time and score at times we got to make
sure we're working them. And they did a good job to hedge ball screens, but we
talked about how we wanted to attack that, we talked about how we wanted to
move their gap help. When we're locked in and we're playing good I told the
guys in the locker room, I think we have a chance to be a really good team,
I'm really excited about our team, we just have to do our habits, our good
habits we have to just do them for longer periods of time.  
  
Q. What did you think of the pace early in the game? I mean it was
quick, was that good pace for you?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, I thought we got a lot of good things in transition. But
the thing is, is when you don't have it in transition, when we fill into a
drag screen or we get ball reversal, we got some good things off that, and to
where I thought there was a lot of times where we pushed it in transition and
really tried to force the issue to where, hey, if it's not there, let's get
good ball movement and let's really move the defense. And that's, we're going
to grow from that, we're going to keep harping on it and once we get that
completely fixed I think this team can really make some really good strides. I
like this team a lot, like I said for a long time.  
  
Q. One more thing along that line, is it just me or does Talen sometimes
get out of control or do you want him being like that or how do you control
him?  
STEVE PROHM: You know, he's a freshman, he had some great moments, but we have
got to, we got a couple guys that we got to continue to preach, hey, ball
movement and shot selection at times. You don't want to take away their
aggressiveness, you don't want to pigeon hole them, but we do, there's some
times where we got to make sure we're getting a good shot because bad shots
nine times out of ten are going to lead to easy offense. And Arizona's got,
Sean does a great job, Arizona's got a very good team, their guards stepped
up. I thought Luther -- and then our fires on Jeter, as good as they were in
the first half we let him out in the second half. I mean we didn't jump
baseline, slide in the fire, he got a jump hook. They split the trap one time,
he got a layup. Coleman got in the paint. And so we just got to be smarter and
this one hurts because you're up 10, 11 to go, fan base unreal in there, we
got to finish that game out.  
  
Q. You had a few missing players tonight but you played hard. I mean one
of the things you said in the opening press conference was that your fans
travel. So it seems like you're creating a culture. What do you hope to have
happen over the next few days? What do you want to build on in terms of that
culture that you're building with this energy that you have following you?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, well our fan base is incredible. I said it last night at
our event, I mean, we probably had three quarters of the arena. I mean they're
loud, they love their program, they love their school, they got an immense
amount of pride in Iowa State and what it's about and what it stands for and
so I can't thank them enough. What I want to see over this weekend is just we
got to continue to compete and we got to continue to get better because all
three games are going to be resume building wins. If you can get them. But we
got a quick turn around and so we got to respond, this is the first time this
team's had to bounce back from a tough loss to where we think we -- give
credit to Arizona -- but it's one that we probably let get away at the end.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off that, when you lose a game like that and then
probably whatever happens the next two days, the refrain is going to be, well
if they had those four guys. What do you do with that, with your team or
anybody saying that to you?  
STEVE PROHM: We don't have them. They're gone. We got two injured and two that
needed to make better decisions. So we have got eight and I jokingly call them
the Rocket 8. We got eight guys, they asked me yesterday in the press
conference who is number nine. We got eight. So that's what we got, that's
what we got to go to work with. While the other four guys are out the one
thing I thought they did a great job of being encouragers on the bench and
being really supportive and so there's no excuses, we have got eight guys, we
have got to get better and we got a great opportunity tomorrow and it's a
quick turn around, it's two different styles, Gonzaga is one way and then
Illinois, if you play them, we played Brad's teams before, you got to prepare
for their pressure and that will be new for a lot of our guys.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [Jared Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35147)

### [Bryce Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35076)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Auburn - 88  
  
Xavier - 79  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Coach, start with an opening statement.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: Great win for our program. Xavier is very talented, Travis is one
of the bright young coaches in this country, runs brilliant stuff offensively.
My guys will tell you, they're good. We rely on each other. It's as simple as
that. We won the game because in the over time period in deep foul trouble we
had some guys step up and make plays. But we don't even get in that situation
without these two guys without Jared and Bryce. They're terrific back court
players, you can see the difference that experience makes. You just can't be
afraid to fail. You just got to go out there and put it on the line. I thought
these guys both did that, they both competed and the difference obviously was
their outstanding play.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Thank you coach. Questions, please.  
  
Q. When you have a guy like Jared playing that way in that situation,
how much of that is coaching and how much of that is you just letting them
kind of do what he can do?  
BRUCE PEARL: I'll answer that one, but the next one is all players. Coaches
get way too much credit when things go well, maybe a little too much when they
don't go well. These guys are self-made players now. These guys are in the gym
all the time. They're in the gym with my assistant coaches and with their dads
and their families. And they just have paid the price. They came to Auburn to
train, they came to Auburn to make history, they came to Auburn when Auburn
wasn't very good. It's all about the players. It's all about them, not about
the coaching.  
  
Q. Obviously we don't know the outcome of this game that's happening
right now, but how much have you thought about the potential of playing a team
like Duke tomorrow in this tournament?  
JARED HARPER: I kind of lost my voice a little bit but I would just say that
we're just taking it one game at a time. We just knew if we want to play
schools like Duke and Gonzaga and Arizona, everybody else on the other side,
we had to win the first one. So we took control of the first one, we were able
to win the first one and just ready to play tomorrow.  
  
BRYCE BROWN: Same thing. Coach preaches take one game at a time in this
tournament here. Every team is talented. You got to win the first one to get
to the next one. Of course Duke is a target for us, we're looking forward to
that, hopefully, depending upon how this matchup goes today.  
  
Q. How ready are you guys for three straight games like this? That was a
signature Maui invitational type of battle.  
BRYCE BROWN: I feel like we're more ready than anybody to be honest with you.
We have an extremely deep team so I feel like with guards and the bigs we have
a lot of depth, so me and Jared played heavy minutes today we're going to
depend on our other guards and other bigs to step in and probably play a few
more minutes tomorrow just to help with that fatigue that we took today.
That's what I like about this team, just the depth. So I feel like we're more
prepared than anybody with the experience and the players we have.  
  
JARED HARPER: I want to say like during this off season and during our first
couple weeks of the season we just been, coach has been preparing us for just
playing three days in a row. If you win, lose or whatever you're going to play
three straight games, so we got to prepare our bodies for that.  
  
Q. For both of you, you guys studied Xavier obviously leading up to this
game. Was there anything in this contest that surprised you based on what you
had seen on film of them?  
BRYCE BROWN: I would say yes. I didn't feel like they could shoot the ball
that well, they shot pretty good, had to extend our defense a little more. The
guards are really good, had a few different actions that we didn't go over.
But we had to just adjust and stick to our principles, so I feel like we did
pretty good though.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: We didn't go over them enough.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You guys both had a couple of big dunks. With that dunk late
everybody's talking about Jared.  
BRYCE BROWN: I tried to come back at Jared with a Top-10 one but it's hard to
top one like that. That was crazy.  
  
Q. What impact does that have on a team when he makes those explosive
plays?  
BRYCE BROWN: Game over. Game over. I already knew it was over after that.
Jared, he's a phenomenal player, I really enjoy playing with him this pass few
years. So when he makes plays like that it just gives the whole team
confidence knowing on both ends of the court.  
  
Q. If it is Duke tomorrow, how much better do you guys have to play and
in what areas do you have to improve?  
JARED HARPER: We just know that if we can defend and rebound we can play with
any team in the country, so I know that's going to be a focus for us. We
didn't rebound the ball today like we wanted to or how we expected. So I know
we're going to go back and look at just check it out and just, if we're able
to defend and rebound, like I said, we're going to be in good shape.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: All right. Take questions for coach, please.  
  
Q. I think a lot of people expected certain players on that team to do
well, but six, seven guys are doing things that maybe you didn't anticipate.
Do you think that was sort of a wake up call early, the early success they had
and how many guys were stepping up for them?  
BRUCE PEARL: For Xavier?  
  
Q. For you guys and adjusting to that. How many of their guys were doing
so much early on.  
BRUCE PEARL: Depth is a strength of ours. And yet we got, our bench got
outscored 31-16. So I'm glad the kids gave the bench credit, we rely on the
bench, we need more from the bench. There was some guys that come off the
bench that can't be afraid to make plays. When you play teams like this you're
not going to get stops unless you make plays, they're just not going to miss
shots or not going to go an escrow the offensive glass. Now to our credit we
turned them over 22 times. An area that Bryce Brown does not get enough credit
for is his defense. Goodin's a terrific player, he shot 3-19 and he had seven
turnovers. I give Bryce Brown a lot of credit for that. Goodin's a heck of a
good player. That was a big factor in us being able to win the game. You see
their offense, a lot of times it was their defensive plays. The kids are
right, we got to do a better job of rebounding all across the board. Because
way too many second chance points for Xavier. But that's one of the things
they do really well.  
  
Q. They shot pretty well in the second half, and then you the team
locked in in overtime. What did you say to them? A lot of times you have to
get a team to regroup, what did you say to them to get them refocused in
overtime because they locked in defensively.  
BRUCE PEARL: I thought both teams early, remember the first several
possessions nobody could score and I thought both teams did a good job
defensively. You have to think at some point that fatigue had to be a factor
late in that game. We made a couple shots, got a couple of rebounds, we didn't
give them the offensive rebounds that they had early, stopped fouling them
quite so much. They went to the foul line a little bit and so I just think it
was just we sucked it up and I give our coaches and our trainers credit for
our conditioning.  
  
Q. The SEC championship last year, but maybe not a lot of the popularity
that might come from that for most people. Just your team still have sort of a
chip even though you won a championship of maybe not getting the recognition
that maybe it deserves?  
BRUCE PEARL: Well I think we feel like we have unfinished business and the
reason why, at the end of the year we were down to seven scholarship maybe
eight scholarship guys. We were hurt. We limped into the tournament, had a
heroic win against Charleston and got blown out by Clemson. We didn't have
Austin Wiley. Samir Doughty was sitting out. And so I think all those, all
those factors -- and you got to remember there's not a McDonald's All-American
on that team, only two five stars in Wiley and Okeke and the rest of those
guys are threes and fours and got chips on their shoulders and feel like they
got overlooked. So you have an opportunity to come to Maui, again I give Dave
Odom credit for trusting me, having been a colleague of mine in the SEC, I
mean he took a real chance inviting Auburn into this field because number one
if we weren't competitive it would not look good, and number two Auburn
doesn't travel in basketball we travel in football and yet we had a great
turnout -- I think the combination of Maui and our team playing well and the
real honor that we feel about representing the SEC and being in this amazing
tournament, so I'm proud of Auburn for representing this morning.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Justin Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36245)

### [Chase Jeter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36246)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Arizona - 71, Iowa State - 66  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
SEAN MILLER: We feel really good about our win. You come to this tournament,
you don't want to be the team that heads home 0-3. We experienced that last
year, and there could be a really good team that is 0-3 when they leave Maui.
That certainly wasn't our goal but every win here is a very hard one to get. I
give our guys a lot of credit. Chase and Justin, neither one of those guys
played in games for us last year, they're our captains. They have been through
a lot in their careers and I think they give us some experience and character
that we're going to really rely on and I thought both guys did a tremendous
job in tonight's game.  
  
Also, in terms of Iowa State, when we lost a couple early last year, I know
there was a parade that was thrown on a number of different levels because we
lost, but we were playing without a starter and a really good player. Look at
Iowa State. They're missing not only an all Big-12 performer, but a number of
other players that didn't play. And I think it's to their credit that they're
as good of a team right now without them as they are. And when those guys get
back, I would fully expect them to make a run and be in the NCAA tournament.
So for us beating a good team, a team that we really respect, here in Maui and
having these two guys with us I think really allows us to feel good and get
ready for tomorrow's opponent.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. I just heard it's awfully loud up there. I know you guys had a ton of
support from your guys, but seemed like the Iowa State folks were really,
really loud. If you could just describe each of you, just describe what the
atmosphere in that game was like.  
CHASE JETER: I think initially the young guys on our team kind of got a little
intimidated by the atmosphere, so going into the second half we had to kind of
take a step back and look in the mirror and know that we were going to be okay
and not to let the crowd kind of take direction of the game. So in the second
half it was just the most important thing for us was coming out strong and
getting stops and getting buckets.  
  
JUSTIN COLEMAN: I want to thank my Lord and savior for the opportunity to play
here in Maui, my teammates, great coaches. To answer your question, I played
Iowa State my freshman year on the road so I kind of got a feel of how their
fans, they have one of the best fans in the country and it was a great
experience for our young guys, freshmen and sophomores to get that atmosphere
and to get that experience to grow and get better each and every day.  
  
Q. Justin, this is for you. You struggled a little bit in the first half
but then came out in the second half putting it together, feeling it. What
were you thinking about at halftime? How did you get yourself going in the
second half?  
JUSTIN COLEMAN: I just had to get a feel of their defense, what's open, what's
not open, how to get my teammates shots. Get Chase the ball, he's one of the
best big men in the country. And I was looking for my teammates and things
just opened up for me as well so I just took the shots that were open for me
and they just happened to fall for me today.  
  
Q. You guys trailed by 10 with 11 minutes left. How were you guys
feeling in the moment? How did you hold it together in what was obviously a
fairly dire situation at that point?  
CHASE JETER: It was just about getting stops, really. We knew what we had to
do defensively, we knew what we had to do from the jump. I think we came out a
little bit lax in the beginning and then kind of we got caught up in the
atmosphere. But moving forward I know that our biggest goal was just to kind
of get stops and take it from there and the offense will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Justin, I was wondering if this is the kind of game you envisioned
when making that grad transfer move that you could play on this stage and do
these things and if so, did that maybe help your confidence level out there
tonight?  
JUSTIN COLEMAN: I put a lot of work in my game and I trusted my teammates a
lot, so when I started transferring I just took a leap of faith and Coach
Miller was one of the first people to call me and he said he liked my game and
trusted my talent. So I decided to take the offer and come to Arizona and it's
one of the best decisions I made.  
  
Q. Chase, you guys were out rebounded throughout the game today, but can
you talk about those two late rebounds with less than a minute to go? You had
a timely rebound and so did Luther and players, if you can just comment on
just the plays you guys made down the stretch whether it be those two rebounds
and also the free throws?  
CHASE JETER: Yeah, well we had our guys step up big at the free-throw line
late in the game. And then those two rebounds you spoke of, I think that was a
big turning point in the game for us. We were down two with three minutes left
and it wasn't in the game. And after that we kind of just when we, after we
left that last huddle we didn't look back. So the defense leading up to those
two rebounds and guys being ready and guys being aware is what made that push.  
  
Q. For Chase and Justin, what did you learn about your team today?  
CHASE JETER: Just proud. I'm just proud of these guys. Coming into this we had
some good games, 3-0, but we knew once we got to this field that the
competition was going to rise. And I think like I said earlier, I think we
came out a little bit lax and kind of intimidated a little bit by the
atmosphere maybe. But once our guys, we took a deep breath and guys we got our
feet under us, I think I'm just really proud of my teammates and how we
performed out there. Especially the way we finished the game.  
  
JUSTIN COLEMAN: I can say the same as Chase. I'm just proud of our guys. I
feel like today just showed how we loved each other as brothers. I'd go to war
for Chase, I'd go to war for any of those guys. Down the line even the
managers and the coaches. So it just shows the connection we have as a team
because like you said, we got out-rebounded, we got down 10, but it showed the
effort and the togetherness we had through adversity to get back and win the
game.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. What did you learn about your team in those final 11 minutes after
y'all were down by 10?  
SEAN MILLER: Well we didn't panic, we hung in there. Listening to Chase say
maybe coming out at the beginning of the game that we were tentative, that's
what happens to a team that hasn't been in this environment before. Everybody
who is out on the court, including those two guys, didn't play for us a year
ago. So we're very new to each other and in an environment like this, a game
like this can really bring you closer together. I think you learn what it
takes. Each of these guys is in a brand new role. Some things as simple as
free throw shooting. Lonzo Trier, he's one of the best free throw shooters
late games that I've ever coached. You take it for granted in the three years
that he was with us, late in the game and the ball got to him and he made them
90 plus percent of the time. Well even tonight who is going to be that player
that you're going to want to put on the foul line. And you saw Brandon
Williams as a freshman go 9-10 from the line. So there's always things that
you learn in November, but you can't learn them unless you really are
challenged. If we would have lost tonight we would have learned a lot. The
fact we won is great, but I think more than anything it's just us having an
opportunity to grow, keep getting better and if you can win while you're doing
that, then obviously that's what we all want to do.  
  
Q. It looked like your defense and ball handling kind of held up against
this competition and did that surprise you at all, or did you think that that
and maybe the heart this team kind of showed maybe made a difference?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, I believe in our heart. I think that we learned that we got
a group that really cares about winning and I've mentioned that almost in
every interview that I've done. It started in the spring, through the summer,
and certainly this fall that we practiced very hard. We have great leadership
with Chase and Justin and I think we got a really hungry group of guys that
are trying to prove that maybe we're a little bit better than people have
given us credit for. That remains to be seen, but I think that motivation has
been really healthy. And when you're around our team every day you really get
the same look. We have very few ups and downs and that consistency, if we can
keep that up, that will take us as far as we can go. And that's really what
we're trying to do, can we become the best team that we can be. This isn't a
year ago, three years ago, five, six, years ago, when we were here fours years
ago, all that we were asked about was National Championship, Final Four. And I
think we were 33-4 and lost in the regional final game. That was much
different. For us right now it's can we get better, what will we be like
tomorrow, and can we stay on the right track.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't know yet who you're going to play officially
tomorrow, but if it is Gonzaga, what kind of challenge do they present? What
do you see in their squad?  
SEAN MILLER: Well we have had some great battles during my 10 years here at
Arizona with them. And before I showed up, Arizona and Gonzaga had some real
epic games. So they're one of the premier programs in the country. Mark Few
and his staff are the best of the best and what you see is what you get with
them. From one year to the next it doesn't deviate a whole lot. The faces may
change but their style, their system, it's really held up for a couple
decades. So we know that they love to push it in transition, they're going to
be very well coached. But I also know Illinois is really tough, they play in
the Big Ten, they pressure the ball and force a lot of turnovers, and so
either game when you come here you know you're going to be tested. So I know
that we're not going to be 0-3, so I'll take that off the plate.  
  
Q. One what are the advantages and disadvantages of having 24 hours, if
that, to prepare for an opponent in a tournament like this?  
SEAN MILLER: Well one thing about our team this year is we're not like an iron
five. We do like to play our bench. We didn't play our bench as much tonight
because a couple of the guys, they didn't seem to be as confident as they had
been. I'm hoping that now we have got one under our belt here that they can
return to form. But part of what we like about our team this year is guys
nine, ten, six, seven, and eight have really contributed. They have a role and
we can play through long stretches because we're going to sub. So I hope that
helps us. That's what we're going to do tomorrow. But that's college
basketball. If you get into a PAC-12 tournament you're going to have to win
three games in three days. The NCAA tournament, sometimes you play an evening
tip and then with the one day in between and noon tip. So I think all of us
have gotten used to that and we'll do the best we can.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Tre Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36243)

### [Cam Reddish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36244)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Duke - 90  
  
SDSU - 64  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, we played well. I thought San Diego State was really
ready for us. They have their veterans and their starting five. They're an
outstanding, they're a really good team. Obviously Brian does a great job.
They have a terrific program.  
  
In the first half, one, just adjusting to the environment that they're playing
in. It was really hot in there and for both teams, but it's tough to simulate
that. So I thought the end of half was crucial. We got a perfect two for one.
We had six points and ended. And then we started the second half poorly, then
all of a sudden we rebounded and our transition game got going and we kind of
exploded. But it was a good win for us, we beat a good team, and on to the
second game.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. For Tre and Cam, obviously you guys were big stars in high school but
what has it been like dealing with just the buzz and the popularity and the
hype since you've arrived at Duke?  
CAM REDDISH: For me I tried to really just ignore it. Just continue to just
work hard, listen to coach, and basically trust my teammates and get better
every day. Really just ignoring all the press.  
  
TRE JONES: Like Cam said, trying to ignore it. We've got a lot of hype going
around right now and the coaches been trying to keep us real humble, just
trying to have us keep working hard and improving every single day so that
we'll be ready for our next game.  
  
Q. Tre, tonight you had season high points. Early in the season you were
kind of more of a distributor and a setting up for your team, but tonight you
really started to cut to the basket and score lot. What kind of went into your
mindset in terms of just becoming the go-to scorer in the first half?  
TRE JONES: Right. I was just reading the defense. They were helping a lot off
of me, trying to plug gaps on RJ and Cam and Zion's drives and that left open
lanes for me to either attack or cut, and my teammates did a great job of
finding me so I was an I believe to make those plays.  
  
Q. For both guys, coach told me yesterday that you guys not really aware
that Duke came in here 15-0. You're now 16-0 in this building, Duke is. Were
you guys aware of that, and what was it like to play in that atmosphere that
coach was talking about in a gym that you probably watched games on before?  
CAM REDDISH: Yeah, it was a ton of fun. We went out there just played super
hard like coach told us to do and I think as simple as that.  
  
TRE JONES: Right. We don't really worry about the record. We worry about just
ourselves right now and trying to come into every game ready to play. And so
the coaches did a great job in preparing us for today's game and we're going
to go back to the hotel and probably get prepared for tomorrow's game as well.  
  
Q. There seems to be such an effortless flow with you guys, not a lot
that's forced, nobody seems to be worried about how many shots they're taking.
Where does that come from and how much of that was based on the relationship
that particularly the four freshmen had prior to getting to Duke?  
CAM REDDISH: For us the main goal is just to win. We all just want to win.
We're going out there playing together trusting the coach, trusting each other
and basically just playing together.  
  
TRE JONES: The coaches do a great job in making sure that we're not worried
about those things. We're worried about things that will actually make us
better. So there's a lot of little things like playing defense, talking,
getting back in transition, rebounding, things like that that will actually
make us better rather than worrying about personal stats.  
  
Q. You guys you do move the ball fluidly. Obviously you as a point
guard, that's expected, but there's some guys on this team that pass the ball
so well and seem to find each other really well so early. Why do you think you
guys are so interconnected in terms of your offense?  
TRE JONES: Right. Like Cam said, we all just want to win at the end of the
day. So I mean we're going to come in to every game prepared, but I mean we're
going to do everything we can just to win. And so making that extra pass and
passing up on good shots for great shots is a thing that we're going to be
doing a lot.  
  
Q. For both players, Zion got in foul trouble a little bit early. You
could see him a little frustrated. How do you kind of keep each other going
when you get into those moments even though you were able to overcome it? How
did you two kind of support him when he was clearly frustrated early on?  
CAM REDDISH: We talked to him, support him, encourage him. Obviously you guys
know what he's capable of doing and we know what he's capable of doing, so
just encouraging him and keeping his head up.  
  
TRE JONES: It's a long game, and we just know that the next guy up is always
going to be ready. So I mean we got Jack and Jav that came off the bench and
gave us great minutes for Zion when he was in foul trouble, but coach doesn't
sit anybody when they get two fouls. So Zion was still able to play some
minutes there in the first half and contribute Ted really well.  
  
Q. You guys have seen Zion do some pretty crazy stuff. Do you ever get
used to it? That windmill dunk today, how does that juice you guys up, and
what do you think when he does something like that?  
CAM REDDISH: You know, yeah, you don't know what to think. It's crazy. Yeah,
he's different and it's really fun to watch.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. What did you like about the first half, the way you guys played
offense to get all those open 3-pointers and take advantage of that?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, they clogged the lane. By the way, I didn't notice it
until they were asking questions, brought a smile to my face to see the chair
for Jim O'Connell and God bless him. This was one of his favorite, favorites,
and he was the only guy to ever come here and never see the beach. And even
coaches on the day off or something, we walk the beach, he would, he wouldn't
do that. So that's a cool thing.  
  
Repeat your question. I was in a different mood. Oh the first half?  
  
Q. The first half the way you guys moved the ball on offense to get all
those 3-pointers?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well they clogged the lane. They did a little bit like what
Army did to us and tried to get -- not less us penetrate completely to the
bucket. And the one dribble penetration, as long as our guys were ready to
shoot, they were ready to shoot and they knocked them down. I thought that was
the differential in the first half. And it was, it, the last two possessions
made it even more, because the two for one were the two threes. So the three-
point shot was really the differential in the first half.  
  
Q. One of the things I've heard from coaches for years is that
regardless of how talented your freshmen are it can be difficult, especially
early, to rely this heavily on first-year players. Why do you think this is
going so well?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well it's gone well. We have had to rely on young players for
a few years now, so we're accustomed to doing that. I'm not saying we're as
advanced as this group is, but that's our culture right now and these guys are
really good kids. They're really good basketball players. So because they're
not positional, they, if you're positional you usually get anxious to touch
the ball to score because you don't know how many times you're going to touch
it. When it's position-less you're touching the ball and you're playing
basketball and that's, that's our team this year. It's, so the ball finds the
best shot and they like that because they're basketball players and their
futures will be fine whether they average 18 or 14, as long as they keep
learning how to play. So that helps us, the fact that we have four guys who
can bring the ball up the court on a defensive rebound or steal. We talk about
Zion and the windmill dunk, but, to me his lateral movement and the steals and
his hands are more, are bigger than that. I mean that's a bang that he had
five steals today, you know, and when he gets his hands on the ball he makes
plays. And that's what Jack White did today. Jack got us about 12 to 14 extra
possessions with eight rebounds and loose balls. So right now we have a team
that has really good hands, really good hands. We just have to keep building
our team on those strengths.  
  
Q. What are both the advantages and disadvantages of having such a short
amount of time to prepare for a team like Auburn?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's for both teams. They have more veterans, but Maui
puts you in unusual situations. I think overall those situations, if you
handle them well get you better. If you don't handle them well, you lose. But
you learn why you can lose. So it's the way it is. And everyone, some people
say it's like a conference tournament, and it's not like a conference
tournament because you're not on a beach, you haven't flown 11 hours, you
haven't, it's not a conference tournament. The other thing is, by the time you
have a conference tournament you know the guys, you don't need a scouting
report as much, you've played against that team probably twice. And so it's
unusual. And so we get to see how our young guys do in that situation against
a Top-10 team, a very well coached team.  
  
Q. You said you felt like you played really well. Can you get a sense
winning about --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know, what do you think?  
  
Q. I thought you did too.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Okay, good.  
  
Q. But the question is can you get a sense of how good the other team
is, how good San Diego State is?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, yeah, because, look, we had two plays right at the end
of the half or else it's a 11-point game. And they started off the half,
second half great, and then we do have explosive ability. If we can get a
steal or get the defensive rebound, with our ball handlers they're very good
in transition. They make, they almost always make the right play. I'm not sure
how many teams have that many ball handlers. I hope we can get that in every
game that we play. But, so then it's over, you know what I mean? It's over. So
our team, if they do, that has the ability to knock a team out. And we're
fortunate we did because if it keeps going they're well coached, Watson,
McDaniels, Mitchell, those guys are good players. They won their league.
They're an NCAA, those kids played in the NCAA tournament and almost beat
Houston. I saw Watson knock down two threes against Houston to almost win that
first round game as a 11th seed. So they will be good and their young guys are
going to continue to get better because they have a program there. Steve and
his staff, they have been there for 20 years, I think 20, yeah. And so they
just play good basketball.  
  
Q. Many teams don't start the season looking like a well-tuned machine
like your team. What is it about this crop of gentlemen that it appears that
they have bought in and they have bought in early. What's so special about
them?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well they're over themselves. It's not about them.
They're very secure and they have been parented well, they have been coached
well, and so they understand being part of something bigger than them, but
still being really good. The spotlight is bigger, their stuff will show if the
spotlight's on the whole team. And their a pleasure, I mean they're really a
pleasure to coach. They get along so well. Hopefully we can stay healthy, do
well again tomorrow, and continue to advance. But we recognize that the team
we play tomorrow is capable, definitely capable of beating us and beating
anybody, really. So that will be a good test for us.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about the security that your upperclassmen have
as well. Is there a way that you can talk to them? I mean, it's a big role for
them to not be, to be deferential to the talent that they're up against, but
also be leaders. Do you talk to them about handling that balance?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, we actually started that this summer, where every time
we watched tape, and I told them we're going to elevate the role of the role
player and the importance of that role player. And giving them examples. There
are academy awards, Tony's for best supporting actor and Beyonce has a
background group that all of a sudden they get really good, you might have
your own group. And but -- do what Coach Wooden said a long time ago, do what
you're capable of doing at the highest level and don't let what you don't do
that well get in the way. And it's really simple great advice. The Canadian
trip helped Jack find himself in that way. Javin, Marques, did not have a good
trip, but he learned from it. And we need Alex, the other guys, Jack, Alex,
Javin, Marques, Antonio, when you watch them, I think you can see they feel
good about themselves and they have great interaction with their teammates.
And their teammates applaud them. So it's a good thing. I mean it's one of
those things we have great, great chemistry. And with secure people it's a lot
easier and we have a very secure group in that way.

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Jeremy Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36249)

### [Rui Hachimura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36250)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Gonzaga - 84, Illinois - 78  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Let's start with questions for our players first and then we'll
take questions and a statement from coach. Questions for our players.  
  
Q. Jeremy, you really seized the opportunity tonight, you played with a
lot of confidence through the first four games of the season. What has been
your development path your time at Gonzaga so far after you transferred from
Rice?  
JEREMY JONES: As a lot of people know Gonzaga has done a good job with red
shirts as far as player development and that's the main reason why I decided
to come here. And just doing my job, I know what my job is, just offensive
rebound, we knew Illinois was going to muck a lot of things up and play high
so just cutting to the basket and stuff like that.  
  
Q. You guys pulled it out, but 22 turnovers, definitely got a challenge
tonight. How do you guys characterize, for both you guys, how do you
characterize how that game went and what that win means for you guys?  
JEREMY JONES: I mean 22 turnovers is definitely the most we have had all year.
But right now we're going to focus our sights on Arizona. And when this is
done we'll go back and look at it and address those things. But, yeah, it's
something we definitely have to clean up and it's definitely not our goal. We
have a goal and we didn't reach it as far as turnovers today.  
  
RUI HACHIMURA: Oh, yeah, I think we had like many turnovers today, but I think
I got to take care of the ball more and just have to be like a strong and
finish. And we have to play the next game tomorrow, so we have to focus on
that.  
  
Q. How worried were you guys getting as they were getting within two
there down the stretch. A couple times Frazier goes off for 27 in the second
half. Was there any concern when it got down to two there late?  
JEREMY JONES: Obviously we had miscues as players when a guy gets going, can't
let him shoot threes, you got to make him do something other than shoot
threes. But these coaches put us in situations in practice all the time, four-
minute game, two-minute game, one possession games at the end of practice, so
situations that we have been in so we just have to go out there and execute.  
  
RUI HACHIMURA: We practice those like a stretch but he made like two or three
threes so we had to guard more well and then we just had to, yeah, but I made
a bad decision in the last minute too, so I have to improve that part.  
  
Q. Jeremy, the last two free throws I don't know if either one hit the
sides. What were you feeling at the line to try to put it away?  
JEREMY JONES: I mean well, two free throws I guess ice the game is definitely
thoughts going through your mind, but I shoot free throws all the time, work
out all the time, so I mean it's just a matter of going up there and doing
what you've done so many times. So that's the only thing I was thinking about.  
  
Q. Was there any particular guy on the scouting report that concerned
you or surprised you that you were worried about?  
JEREMY JONES: Yeah, we were worried about all of them. They run that high
spread action so everybody's on. Obviously you saw Frazier got it going
tonight and I mean we knew that he was capable of that and didn't do a good
job, so I mean, yeah.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. These are the kind of games that you learn something about your team
when you're like in a dog fight. What did you learn tonight?  
MARK FEW: I learned we got to clean up some things at the end of the games, as
they said. We spend a lot of time in practice, but when you're under the
bright lights and playing against a team that is built to bring a lot of
adversity, I mean that's what Illinois does a phenomenal job with. I think
somebody was asking us about 22 turnovers. All you got to do is watch all
their games, I mean they force a high number of turnovers. But when you're
strong with it and then when you do get through that wave then you shoot a
high percentage at the other end. So looking at the stats and we shoot 53
percent from the floor, you know, so that's kind of what ends up giving it.
It's a high risk defense and they put it on you sometimes, put you in some
very uncomfortable positions. And they had played two possessions of 1-3-1
this year and they jumped in that 1-3-1 and we made some really poor decisions
at the start of it and I think they gained confidence as it kind of went along
in the second half.  
  
Q. The progression of Rui from last year to this year, his level of
aggressiveness and how much you push him to be assertive in that way.  
MARK FEW: Yeah, hey, we're pushing him to be the man and that's why I didn't
use a timeout there in that second to last possession. We had Rui with the
ball on the wing and I'm feeling pretty good usually when that is the case.
But this is a great learning opportunity for him here to be in those
situations like that and we were able to find a way to win, which is kind of
all that matters in a tournament like this. But he continues to grow because
we do lean on him so much. The ball is in his hands, we really initiate
offense with him a lot, if you watch, it's definitely the initial action that
our offense we usually come off, pop it to him and then we gotta play through
him a lot. So he continues to get better and better and better and that's a
tough game because there's a lot of guys taking charges and trying to take
charges. Because he's so effective everybody's kind of flying around and
trying to pin fouls on him in one way or the other. So by and large I thought
he held up pretty well.  
  
Q. I thought you guys were about to deliver a knockout blow and Illinois
battles back and Frazier kind of puts them on his back. What did you learn
about them, and what did you learn about Frazier specifically?  
MARK FEW: Them meaning Illinois? I don't know that I learned anything. I --
watching them on tape I was extremely impressed with just how hard they played
and how purposeful they played. They, they're going to deny and make you
uncomfortable. I mean I tried to tell everybody, it reminds me of West
Virginia in the half court and you just you don't really run your normal
offense, you just kind of got to put the ball in -- and that's why you saw a
lot of those downhill drives by our guards that sometimes led to lanes and
sometimes led to some pretty crazy turnovers. But very impressed with how hard
they play and the tough thing for us was they played a non-D-I and then a
pretty noncompetitive other Division-I with Frazier and then he was out in the
Georgetown game and we watched that pretty heavy, but we obviously saw what he
did last year shooting the ball. But he made some big shots tonight, some
really, really big shots. And I was really impressed with the freshman post
kid, he went to work on us also. So I think that there's a lot to build on
with them. They're a hard prep. They run a really, really unique offense that
nobody runs in college basketball. I haven't seen it in all the years I've
been a head coach and then that defense. So you got two different things
you're trying to prepare for so it makes for kind of a unique game.  
  
Q. How big was the bench, Jeremy and Filip especially in that first half
coming in for the guys with foul trouble?  
MARK FEW: Hey, Jeremy was fantastic, just phenomenal. That's the story you
literally root for and want when you're a coach. That senior -- I always
preach to our guys, every dog has his day in our program, he literally does.
I've just seen it time and time again. He might have had a frustrating career
up to that point, but if he would just hang with it, that moment's going to
present itself. And we have had so many guys over the years do that. So I
couldn't be happier for Jeremy. He just stuck with it and he just did with
Jeremy Jones does, he goes to the offensive boards, he cuts, timely cuts, off
the ball, that's how he's getting all those lay-ins. He's an opportunistic
defender and that's what he does and he basically won the game for us tonight.  
  
Q. Brandon Clarke struggled with fouls early, also some other things.
Pretty important to your attack, especially on defense really kind of showed
down at the end, didn't it?  
MARK FEW: Yeah, he is important and we just got to do a better job of keeping
him out of foul trouble. I think what's lost and we all have such short
memories is that without Killian, we're smaller and lighter and less, and less
of a factor with our rim protection right now. So a lot of it ends up on
Brandon and then we're trying to bring Filip as best we can up to speed to
keep him aggressive. I thought he did a nice job in the first half, that
little bit we had him in. The second half he just wasn't quite aggressive
enough, we didn't really have time to wait for him.  
  
Q. Gonzaga and Arizona have had some battles over the years, tomorrow
presents some intriguing individual matchups as well. What do you anticipate
in that?  
MARK FEW: Well any time you play Sean's teams, I mean they're tough. They are
tough, they're going to get right up in your grill and they're going to guard
you and they're going to guard your first action really well and your second
action really well and they're physical. And it looks to me like they seem to
really be playing well together and have a lot of nice flow on the offensive
end. I think I remember this summer when people were starting to write them
off and I kept telling the staff, like I mean they have like six or seven five
star guys, just because they played behind upperclassmen last year doesn't
mean they lost all their ability. And Sean's done a great job putting it
together, the transfer kid, the point guard played phenomenal tonight and hit
some big shots, much like Frazier did. So he's obviously on a roll, we'll have
to deal with him tomorrow. But I've been in this thing enough, it's kind of
like the NCAA tournament, all these games take on a new life of their own and
hopefully we'll be better down the stretch tomorrow and we're looking forward
to playing Arizona.

## November 19, 2018

  

### [Brian Dutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33374)

### [Devin Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34926)

### [Jeremy Hemsley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32925)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Duke - 90  
  
SDSU - 64  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: We'll start with an opening statement for coach, please.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: First of all, I thought our Aztecs competed at a high level in
the first half. A lot of the threes that we gave up were scouting report
threes. I told them that. That was a coach's decision. We tried to pack the
paint against Duke, tried to play that top nail help side, tried to collapse
and make them kick and shoot perimeter threes and to their credit they made
them. We watched the Army game, we thought they did a lot of the same things,
tried to make it tough for them to penetrate and to their credit they were
able to kick the ball out and shot the ball at a really high level from three-
point range. When they did that, obviously they were tough to compete with. I
told our kids at halftime we had to find a way to get three stops in a row. We
got two to start the second half and then they went fast break, fast break,
fast break. So our defense wasn't good enough today against a very, very good
Duke team.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. For both guys, what were you guys impressions of the, of their four
starting freshmen.  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: They're good players, it is plain and simple. They know how to
play the game of basketball, they play it at a high level. I think they did a
good job of just staying true to themselves and just playing their game, but
they're good group of freshmen for sure.  
  
Q. For both, could you talk about what happened there at the end of the
first half? It was, you had a guy on the line to make it a single digit game.
You had kind of been trading baskets with them and then all of a sudden you're
down 17.  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: I think we just had some defensive lapses there, the last
three minutes or so in that first half and I think some guys just fell asleep
a little bit. We just lost track of guys and we just -- simple mistakes, silly
mistakes, and I think we just, it was just a little mind lapses and things
like that. It wasn't really anything like the game plan. It was really just on
us as a team, the players on the court.  
  
Q. Devin, just talk about the same thing. What happened there at the end
of the first half and at the beginning of the second half when you seemed to
get back into it a little bit and they just put a big run on you.  
DEVIN WATSON: I would say I agree with Jeremy, just mental breakdowns, yeah,
they hit shots and they got on a run. We got on a run too, but they hit shots,
got to the free-throw line, so...  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Some of the half court baskets we can live with because like I
said we put them in the position -- yeah, we were slow on a close out or two,
but the thing we wanted to do was prevent a lot of the fast break baskets
which we knew would open the game up. And then they had that string where they
had fast break, fast break, fast break, we didn't get all the way back and
protect the rim and that kind of broke the game. It was, you know, they were
always up double digits, but it kind of made it go from 15, 16 all of a sudden
to 20, 21 and then the flood gates kind of opened from there.  
  
Q. Jeremy, how do you sort of process a game like this? You lose by 24,
26, do you live feel like you guys played reasonably well? Or do you feel like
you guys played terrible and got what you deserved?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: I don't think we played terrible, obviously there's a lot of
things that we have to work on on the defensive end and I know the coaches
will do a good job of handling that and telling us what we need to do better,
but I don't think we played terrible at all. I think Duke just did a good job
of being Duke and they knocked down a lot of open shots and we have to do a
better job of just making it harder on guys and following the game plan that
the coaches give us, whether it's hard or not.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. You got a quick turn around, so what are the things that you're going
to try to do to kind of get focused back on their feet getting ready to play
tomorrow?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: When you play in under 24 hours it's all about mentality.
You'll find out how tough your team is mentally. Because there's not going to
be a lot of X's and O's. We'll give them a simple game plan like you would in
a conference tournament where you play back-to-back-to-back. And we'll meet as
coaches, we'll give them something before they go to dinner tonight real quick
on personnel, then give them a final game plan before they go to bed tonight,
and then we'll come out and play tomorrow. So I like the way my team played
the game in the first half. I thought we really attacked them on the bounce.
Obviously they got a lot of fouls, we put a lot of fouls on them, we got to
the foul line a lot and really spread the floor. And I thought we played the
right way, we drove and really moved the ball. I thought Devin Watson was
sensational in the half and lot in the second half, he just seemed to find
open areas, find open people, he got in the paint. So I liked the way we
played offensively, I liked we made a few more shots, open shots that we got,
but obviously they're long and athletic and tough to score over at times. But
I liked the way we played offensively as far as sharing the ball, playing the
right way and hopefully we'll carry that over into tomorrow. The danger I
wanted, you know, I know my kids wanted to play against Duke, so I always ran
the line of saying how long do I leave them in. They're young, it's early in
the season and I felt like they wanted to be out there, so maybe I left them a
little longer than I wanted to. But I got a real good group of kids and I
think they will bounce back and be energetic and ready to go tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. A little -- expanding on that a little bit you talked about at the
press conference wanting to, you didn't want to come here and not face Duke.
After having experienced all that Duke is are you happy that you did get that
chance to play them?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, I mean, it's the ultimate measuring stick for us. We
played the No. 1 team in the country, we did some things well, obviously
there's some things that they do way better than we do. Sometimes that's just
talent and it's obviously good coaching, Coach K knows what he's doing. I
thought they played the game the right way, they moved the ball, they shared
the ball, they executed their game plan and so I'm glad we got a chance to
play them and obviously you want to come here and win this event. Last time we
were here we played in the championship game against Arizona. I think I have
been here five times. I came in 1988 with Michigan with Glen Rice and Terry
Mills and Loy Vaught and we won it. So I've been here quite a bit and I've
seen a lot of good teams and Duke's a very good team. But our task now is to
find a way to win two games, to leave here with two wins, and that's what our
goal is.  
  
Q. Late in the first half in that section that Jeremy was talking about
I think he had two fouls and Jordan had two fouls and you decided to both put
them on the bench. Do you regret that, do you second guess yourself on that,
seeing as sort of the defensive mistakes that led to those two threes?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, I wish we would have kept it around 10 to 12. Then they
hit the threes and they really expanded it, that last one in the corner. But
that's just a case of Adam Seiko being six feet tall closing out a six foot
seven guy in the corner. So he tried to get there early, but that lack of
length in the close out and the contest -- he was there but he wasn't there
because he wasn't tall enough to really contest that shot. So, he has to get
there quicker if he's going to be smaller. So I thought our kids, the guys off
the bench played hard, they tried to make the right plays, but Duke made a
couple plays at the end of the half, I would have liked to have stayed closer
in the game at a halftime, but they got comfortable and in the second half we
got back-to-back stops and scored both times. I felt we could run Duke if we
could get stops, but we couldn't get enough stops so they had us in a half
court offense almost the entire game.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
DAVE ODOM: Good morning, everyone. Aloha and welcome to our head coach press
conference and our charity free throw conference, which will take place after
our coach's interview.  
  
Excitement reigns everywhere over the islands as well as beyond. We're
delighted to be the host, KemperLesnik, for the 35th year here on the island.
The tournament just continues to grow and get bigger and more exciting as we
go along.  
  
This morning we're going to hear from all eight coaches. It will be followed
by photo op and a press conference with the media over by the stations over
here. Each coach will find a table, and the media will be available to come
and visit with them.  
  
But this morning, before we get to that, it's my pleasure to introduce a
friend of the tournament, a friend of college basketball, a voice that you
hear often on all of the big games that ESPN does.  
  
Every year when we get our field released, we start thinking about staff, one
of the next things is, are you going to send our guest over to do the games?
Of course, we're always delighted when he's included in the tournament itself.  
  
So I want to turn the microphone over to a person who I used to describe as
the hardest working voice in all of sports, because he did baseball, Sunday
night baseball, the World Series on radio, ESPN radio. But he now is focusing
pretty much on college basketball. He lives in Toronto, Canada, so he gets a
lot of air miles in. But he really studies the game of college basketball.  
  
We're glad to have him. He knows these coaches personally. I'm going to turn
the mic over to him and let him answer the questions. I think you'll enjoy his
conversation and exchange with the coaches.  
  
A nice round of applause and welcome to Dan Shulman.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Thank you, Dave. Believe me, it's my pleasure to be here, much
more than it's your pleasure to introduce me to be here. This is the fifth or
sixth time I've been lucky enough to be here. You can see the field for next
year. Every year we're excited, who is coming next year. Last year when we
found out who was coming this year, it was even an more exciting event,
obviously to see the quality of the programs that are here. We're going to
talk to all of the coaches who are participating here.  
  
Before we get to the eight coaches who are playing the games here, we want to
talk to Eric Bovaird, the host of the tournament, and obviously I think
everybody is familiar with the history, the victory over Virginia in the early
'80s. Really led to this tournament being created, and Chaminade beat Cal last
year in a game here on the islands.  
  
This year, the SilverSwords played games against San Diego State and Arizona,
had the opportunity to go to the mainland and play a couple of games.  
  
Eric, I shouldn't say welcome to you. This is your turf in a sense. Thanks for
being here. Tell us a little bit about the two games you played against
Arizona and San Diego State.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, it was a remarkable experience. Typically we play in front
of maybe a couple hundred fans. To go into both of those very unique arenas
and play in front of close to 10,000, 12,000, what an experience. We walked
out, I was a little bit star struck myself, when you walk out and see all the
names up on Arizona's rafters.  
  
But it was a really neat experience. We cherish that experience. Hopefully it
was good for them, preparation for their season. I know it was really good for
us. Thankfully it helped us. We're 3-0 right now.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Next year you'll be back in the games here. It's an alternating
situation. I looked at that banner when I went into practice yesterday, saw
Kansas, UCLA, Michigan State. I'm sure the kids you have next year are already
excited about that.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, without a doubt. I know Coach Odom is probably going to
put us up against Kansas again. A few years ago, that was one of the worst
losses we've ever received. Hopefully we can give them a better game.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Let's get to the games. We're going to go in order of the games
as they will be played tomorrow.  
  
The first game we'll see tomorrow will be Auburn against Xavier. If you know
anything about Bruce Pearl, you know he doesn't need to manufacture the
energy. It comes naturally. He's got an energetic team, one of three top-10
programs that are in this tournament.  
  
Coach Pearl, tell us a little bit about the group you brought to Hawaii this
year.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: John, I'm just blessed to be able to be here, bring our Auburn
basketball team to Maui. When I talked to Dave Odom several years ago about
trying to get Auburn in the field, he was honest with me. He said, Coach, the
program just isn't up to snuff. I don't know that you're going to travel and
be competitive. I was so glad that we were able to travel and we are
competitive, able to represent Auburn here and the SEC.  
  
I really like my team. Kids have really worked hard. I think they're trusting
each other, trusting the system. We know that this weekend we're going to get
exposed. I mean, three nights in a row. But it's going to help us get better
because once we get through this tournament, we will have seen just about
everything that there is to see.  
  
So our kids are excited about playing against the quality of the players, and
I personally am excited and incredibly challenged to go up against Hall of
Fame coaches, guys that I knew when they were assistant AAU coaches or players
or assistant coaches along the way.  
  
The only thing I can say is when I first walked into the meeting of coaches, I
said, There's a lot of miles up here, guys, a lot of miles.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: A lot of great qualifications for the coaches up on the podium
today.  
  
You had a pro day today, you have terrific guards, a lot of interest in them.
Tell us a little bit about the guards and how instrumental they are to the
success of your team this year.  
  
BRUCE PEARL: I think sometimes coaches get too much credit when kids develop.
I've got a terrific backcourt in Jared Harper and Bryce Brown. They were not
highly recruited kids. Think just worked so hard. They just put the time in
the gym. Their dads are in the gym with them, not always the assistant
coaches.  
  
They probably didn't get highly recruited because they're a little bit on the
smaller side of things. But they got a big heart, they're tough. I think they
play the game the right way.  
  
So we've got some good quickness on the perimeter, and we have a little bit of
size now on the inside with Austin Wiley coming back.  
  
You hope that you can be a tough matchup, yet at the same time I look at the
things that these coaches do, how in the world are we going to guard that, you
know. But it makes you better.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Your first challenge is Xavier. Let's go to Travis Steele now,
the first-year head coach at Xavier, after being on the staff the last 10
years, an assistant coach for the last nine years.  
  
First of all, congratulations. To be at a program for 10 years, then to take
over as the head coach, Xavier has always been a program of continuity and
culture and tradition. What does it mean to you to be in charge of that
program right now?  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: It's an honor. Obviously I always say thanks. Sean Miller was
the guy who brought me to Xavier 10 years ago. Then I was lucky enough to work
under Chris Mack the last nine years. So very grateful, honored for everything
that Xavier stands for both on and off the court.  
  
Obviously we've had a lot of success on the court, but we're even more proud
of our graduation streak. We've graduated 109 seniors straight in a row,
dating all the way back to 1986. We try to do things right both on and off the
court.  
  
So very honored to be here. Obviously this is the tournament that growing up
you watch every year. Almost the kickoff of college basketball in a lot of
ways. Been a lot of great players to come through this tournament, a lot of
great coaches. Really honored to be here.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us a little bit about your team so far this year.  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: We got a lot of new faces, got guys in new roles. We lost a lot
off of last year's team. But I think we have a good crew of guys returning
with Quentin Gooden, Naji Marshall, Paul Scruggs, Tyrique Jones, guys who
played big roles on our team last year, on a very successful team, a team that
was a 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.  
  
We have a lot of new faces as well, three grad transfer guys that are really
impacting our team on both the offensive, defensive end. Think we got a
talented group. Still trying to figure ourselves out, but it's obviously early
on in the year.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Good luck. First game tomorrow is Xavier and Auburn.  
  
The second game, the noon game, is Duke and San Diego State.  
  
Coach K is obviously no stranger to coming here to Maui. The Blue Devils have
come five times and are undefeated out here, 15-0 in Maui, won the
championship all five times.  
  
Coach K, maybe before we talk about this year's team, what has this tournament
meant to you and your program, the kids, the fans, everybody over the years?  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think it's a tournament that gives every program amazing
visibility. People watch this tournament. They watch every game. They get a
read on many of the top teams in the country. So just from a visibility
standpoint, I think it helps. It helps our sport to have this level of
tournament at this time of the year.  
  
As far as coming here, it's been an honor to come here. We're fortunate to win
some very close games here, and hopefully we'll be fortunate to win a few
close games here this time.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: The game against Kentucky a couple of weeks ago, it was kind of
like the college basketball season got shot out of a cannon in that game. Your
program always deals with a lot of attention, probably even more so now with
what's happened so far now. We've seen the players, tell us a little bit about
the kids themselves, the people that you're coaching right now.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We've been lucky that we get a lot of attention. It's
extreme, one way or the other. It goes the other way, too, just the other way.
So that's part of the game.  
  
If you're playing in our program, you have to keep balanced. We have a lot of
good, young players. But our upperclassmen have really been the key for us in
developing an atmosphere where the younger guys can be themselves.  
  
I think our upper class is very secure. Our freshmen are secure. So that
creates a good environment to get better. Hopefully when we get on the plane
on Thursday, we'll be secure, too.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Good luck this week, this season. Duke taking on San Diego State
in the second game tomorrow.  
  
Brian Dutcher is the head coach of the Aztecs, a program that was here four
years ago in 2014. You were the associate head coach then to Steve Fisher.
Tell us a little bit about what your team is like, what you're hoping to get
out of this week here in Maui.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Well, I was going to complain we're young with three sophomores
in the lineup, but we're playing a team with four freshmen in the lineup, so
that won't work.  
  
But I like my team. It starts with my two senior guards, Devin Watson and
Jeremy Hemsley, if you're going to be old at the guard position. I think this
is my fifth trip to Maui. I came in 1988 with the University of Michigan as an
assistant with Steve Fisher. Worked with Coach Fisher for close to 30 years. I
feel blessed to take over a San Diego State program with a really good
foundation and a really good young team.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Jalen McDaniels is a guy that I think a lot of people are excited
to see. For people who haven't seen that much of him, what are we going to
learn about him in the next few days?  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Jalen plays with a high motor, which just means he plays hard
all the time. He's a little bit thin, but he makes up for it with energy and
effort. He rebounds the ball at a really high level. He has improved three-
point shooting. Will just be fun to watch. Excited to get him on a national
stage where he can continue to grow his reputation.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Maybe just one quick thought, if you could, about the challenge
of playing the No. 1 team in the country in your first game out here.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I said before we came, we didn't want to come all the way out
here and not play Duke. I would have preferred it be in the championship game,
but part of what we sell our team on is that we're going to play a national
schedule. To have an opportunity to play a Duke on national TV is just a great
honor for us and our team. I think we'll be up for the task.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach, thank you. Good luck.  
  
The third game tomorrow features Arizona taking on Iowa State. The Arizona
head coach is Sean Miller.  
  
Welcome to Maui. You were here, we were talking yesterday, in 2014, won the
championship, beat the Aztecs in the championship game. You've been through
this before. What does this tournament mean to you because of that experience?  
  
SEAN MILLER: Well, you're right. I think the biggest thing about us being here
is it's quite an honor. We're one of the lucky programs that I believe from
day one of this tournament, Arizona has been a fixture every four years.
Obviously Coach Olson brought some great teams to this tournament, had a lot
of success.  
  
This is actually our third time. Last time we were here we won the
championship. I think more than anything you learn a lot about your team. It's
a great experience, win or lose. If you win a championship, great. But when
you leave here, you know a lot more about the group that you have. I think
you're a lot more prepared to move on and improve.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: A lot of new faces for you this year. Tell people a little bit
about the players you have this season.  
  
SEAN MILLER: We're really a blend of like three different groups. We have a
group of transfers, a lot of guys that you haven't seen coming from other
programs. We have a group of guys that are kind of throwbacks, guys that were
here last year as freshmen, didn't have as big of a role, but they've all
worked very hard to return as sophomores, much improved. Then we have an
incoming freshman, Brandon Williams, who I think is a very exciting player,
off to a very good start. Put it all together, that's our team.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: I'm sure you're looking forward to see how it all blends
together.  
  
Steve Prohm is the head coach of Iowa State. Steve and Brad Underwood and I,
we're the guys that are benefitting the most from a weather perspective being
out here in Maui right now. It's the Iowa, the Illinois and the Canadian guys
who are happiest.  
  
Tell us a little bit about your team, coach, what you're looking for out here
in Maui.  
  
STEVE PROHM: I told our guys it's a great privilege and honor to be here. We
have a lot of new guys in our roster over the last two years. We're here
because of the past success. Fred did an amazing job in his time here. We've
had a great run of guys like Monte Morris, Abdel Nader, Deonte Burton, Naz
Long, the guys that put this program on the map, kind of back on the map, to
get this program here.  
  
Now it's our job to go honor those guys the right way and play the right way.
I like our group. We have a couple starters right now injured with Lindell
Wiggington and Solomon Young are out, a couple of out due to suspensions. But
we have eight guys, we'll play a lot of young guys, some freshmen.  
  
But I like our leadership. I think the biggest thing we're doing a better job
this year of being selfless, playing together, really sharing the ball. That
starts with our point guard, Weiler-Babb, then a senior transfer from
Virginia, Marial Shayok.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: When you saw your draw, what was your reaction to what you were
going to experience this week?  
  
STEVE PROHM: Regardless of your first draw, everybody is good. Like Coach
Pearl mentioned, you have Hall of Fame coaches, coaches that have won at a
high levels, been to Final Fours. Every game Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday is
going to be a great draw.  
  
The great thing for us is we have an amazing fan base that is going to travel
out here extremely well. The environment for all of our games will be
terrific. Hopefully we'll play well.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: A little Hilton magic out here in Maui?  
  
STEVE PROHM: Hopefully it will be Hilton far west.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: The fourth game is Gonzaga and Illinois.  
  
Let's welcome in Mark Few, the head coach of the Zags. 19 years as head coach,
19 trips to the NCAA tournament. You were saying yesterday that people in and
around your program say, When are you going to Maui next? This is like a
constant major thing within your program.  
  
MARK FEW: Yeah, I mean, I think this is a big thing in all our programs. I
think it's one tournament that really moves the needle with your own players,
obviously with your fans, at least ours are always asking what year are we
going back to Maui. I think even in recruiting. I think if you mention Maui in
recruiting, even at the highest level, the kids are very excited about getting
over here because they know the type of games they're going to be in, the type
of attention, like Coach K referred to. It's the one tournament you want to be
involved with.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell people a little bit about your team, maybe for folks who
haven't seen much of Rui Hachimura as they should have, what they're going to
see with him in the next three days.  
  
MARK FEW: We have a great blend of some guys that have been in some big
moments, in some big games, dating all the way back to the national
championship game. We got a starting point guard, Josh Perkins, that started
that game. Obviously we're leaning on him.  
  
Both Rui and Killian Tillie is not going to be playing this tournament. Very
important part of our team. When they opted to come back this year, we knew we
were at least primed for a pretty special year. Then to throw in Zach Norvell,
who started pretty much all year for us last year, kind of a blend of
experience and some youth that hopefully we can put it all together.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Mark, good luck.  
  
Coach Few knows he'll be up against the pressure that Illinois is going to
provide with the style that Coach Underwood plays.  
  
Brad Underwood evidently will only take a job if he gets to Maui shortly after
getting the job. Took a job at Oklahoma State a few years ago, now here in his
second year with the Illini. Welcome back to Maui, coach. Tell us a little bit
about the team that you're bringing here.  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: First of all, it's very, very exciting to be back. This is the
elite event. As Mark said, this moves the needle. We feel honored. Illinois is
a special place. It's a program that is very rich in tradition. We're excited
to be back in this event, especially in this field with all these teams and
great coaches.  
  
But we're young. We've got two freshmen in the starting lineup. We're a heavy
guard-oriented team. We like to play up-tempo and fast. I think we're a team
that can be a very good shooting team.  
  
Again, we've got a nice blend of four or five guys back in the program who
were parts of what we did last year, who are leading. Then we have six
freshmen who are all getting minutes. They're finding their way. Two of those
guys are in the starting lineup, Ayo Dosunmu and Giorgi Bezhanishvili, I'll
have everybody have fun pronouncing his last name. Those two guys are very
good basketball players. We know we have our hands full with a great Gonzaga
team, but we're excited for the opportunity.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Brad, with the style you play, obviously the kids have to be in
great shape, with the pressure you put on other teams. Are they excited about
three games in three days, really finding out about how deep they can dig here
in this tournament?  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, this is a unique opportunity. Really the only time that
you get to do this again is in the post-season, in your conference tournament.
We've talked about that a little bit in conditioning, taking care of your
body, recovery, so on and so forth.  
  
But we go, we practice hard, and we get after it. We look at it as an
advantage for us. Hopefully it will be.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach, good luck.  
  
Good luck to all the coaches. Going to be a great three days, 12 great games
at the Civic Center. We wish you all the best of luck this week and this
season. We look forward to seeing you out at the gym.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 82, New Mexico - 75  
  
PAUL WEIR: Obviously I thought San Diego State did a tremendous job. I think
we played a pretty good game. But I think to win tonight we would have had to
play a great game. And unfortunately, particularly I think offensively there
in the middle, the end there of the second half, San Diego State did a great
job defensively and we didn't take the greatest amount of shots or the shots
that sometimes go down don't. And we just couldn't get in a groove and they
went on a great run there. Kell was terrific.  
  
And you have to tip your cap to San Diego State. It's a great team. They
deserve to win the championship and they did. Unfortunately for me and for us,
that means the end of an amazing run with a tremendous group of young men that
I'll never forget. I wish I could give them a different ending because they
worked so hard and they gave so much and you always -- like your kids, you
want to reward them for things like that. Unfortunately I couldn't reward them
tonight. And you have to give San Diego State credit for that.  
  
Q. You guys did have that lead about the 8-minute mark down. Were you in
the huddle? Was it more of a Boise State feel when you guys weren't able to
close, or were you poised like you had been the last 7-game winning streak?  
ANTINO JACKSON: It was about 6 minutes not 8.  
  
I don't think we thought about Boise State in the championship game. They were
fortunate enough to make a couple of shots and get on a run, and we didn't
make shots.  
  
Q. The memory of the season, you have talked about it with senior night
being recently and stuff like that. What are you going to take away from this
week, not as much the whole season, but this week, what are you going to take
away?  
ANTINO JACKSON: Well, first and foremost, as Paul Weir is the head coach, at
the end of the game I'll be a different type of person. I just felt like
tonight I just fought. And there were times in practice where we go through
stages like that, I just feel like all of us just kept fighting. I won't
forget this the rest of my life, just trying hard to the very end and not
giving up.  
  
JOE FURSTINGER: I just love my coach so much. He's given me everything. I'm
very thankful for him now.  
  
Q. Obviously down the stretch Trey Kell starts hitting free throws and
starts kind of taking over at the end. Do you feel you did a great job with
Trey up until the final six minutes or so?  
JOE FURSTINGER: He just made a few plays, and we lost the game.  
  
ANTINO JACKSON: I give credit to him. He's a good player. He did a really good
job in the middle pick and roll. He was just fortunate enough to make a couple
shots. We tried hard on defense.  
  
Like Coach said, you have to tip your hat to him.  
  
Q. Down the stretch they had both Pope and Jalen McDaniels on the bench.
Had Kam Rooks and Max Montana, two guys who for long stretches in the season
didn't even play in games. Were you shocked by that? Did you notice that? And
how did you think that might affect the game?  
ANTINO JACKSON: Honestly, I didn't notice that at all. And I don't think that
affected the game.  
  
Q. I don't know if the final decision, Paul, you kind of mentioned maybe
this was over before the game, sounded liked maybe there was still a
possibility for postseason. If there is a possibility I'll ask, is it official
that there is no postseason?  
PAUL WEIR: I don't know yet, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. If there is any possibility that there is postseason play beyond this
in any tournament, would you guys want to go play in a tournament that
possibly is a pay-for-play kind of tournament?  
JOE FURSTINGER: I'll leave that up to Coach.  
  
ANTINO JACKSON: No comment.  
  
Q. I'll go ahead and continue where I asked them: Would you want to
continue with this group of guys or is this more of a fitting end for what you
guys went through?  
PAUL WEIR: I wish it was a single question. There's a lot that goes into it;
financially, logistically, arenas. There's a lot of different layers to it,
and I haven't spent any time going through that. I know we have facility
issues back home. I know there's financial considerations for different
things. And I don't know, I'd have to go through those with Eddie and see what
he thinks, and see if it even fits with all those other things. It's not
really just the heat-of-the-moment kind of emotional thing right now.  
  
Q. I know you're proud of your kids, press were raving about the
execution of your team. But the Aztecs, you've played TCU, Arizona, Nevada,
you played big-time tournament teams. How dangerous do you think San Diego
State is moving on into the big dance?  
PAUL WEIR: When I went to Mountain West Conference Media Days and I saw those
guys walking around for the first time I thought to myself, This is an
impressive-looking team. And I think the way their season started they showed
tremendous potential. They had a couple of bad losses early. I think they had
one to Cal, I think one to Washington State. If you eliminate a couple of
those, they're better than Nevada. They are good.  
  
I think they have the best center in the league. I think they have the best
point guard in the league. And Trey Kell obviously think he could be the best
two guard in the league. They have a tremendous group of players. They have
great length and size. And Coach Dutcher, the way he managed his team and got
through things, whatever they were going through to get to this point and
playing at this time, you have to give him a lot of credit.  
  
I said in the handshake he's coach of the year as far as I'm concerned, the
way he managed this season and get his team playing well and get all those
kids bought in. Their body language I think has changed drastically to what it
was earlier, and you can see a different vibe about them.  
  
We gave it our best shot. I would have loved to play the perfect game, because
it would have taken that to probably get them. But capable, very, very capable
basketball team.  
  
Q. I want to ask you the same thing I asked the players about not having
Pope or McDaniels out there late. You've probably watched tons of film on
them, how surprised were you? You've been a rookie head coach before, he's a
rookie head coach in the biggest game of his career as a head coach. How much,
for lack of a better term, balls does it take to make that move in that
situation?  
PAUL WEIR: You know, I thought Montana being in the game was actually a really
slick move. It really allowed them to spread the floor in the ball screen
coverage, we couldn't pack anybody in because they were doing a really good
job of spreading the floor. Putting Kell on the ball screen and then they
kicked out and Montana made the big three on the corner on the end one, as
well. I think the Montana one was great.  
  
Pope, to be totally honest with you, when he's not on the floor I'm happy as
can be. He is such an impressive, physical specimen. Rooks was terrific, and
played a great game. But to me, just watching Pope move around, I think he's
the best center in the league. What some other people see, they must know a
lot more than I do. I just think he's a very influential player on both ends
of the floor.  
  
So any minute he was out I felt was potentially beneficial. But at the same
time Rooks was terrific. Dutcher is terrific, and their team did everything
they needed to do to win.  
  
Q. You just said so many great things about San Diego State and all
their great players. What does it say about your team that you guys were six
minutes away, you were right there with them basically the entire time. Talk a
little bit about the heart and will and desire of your team.  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, it was pretty special. I told the guys in the locker room, I
have a two-year-old, I don't know if that makes me a good dad or I a bad dad,
but I get proud of my two-year-old. I'm just watching my two-year-old and
interacting. I was proud of these guys. And I don't really have that emotion
very often, not even just today, just the last six weeks or so they've made a
lot of people believe. And I think in the process they even made themselves
believe. And to do that in today's day and age is really hard.  
  
I think even Dutcher will probably attest to how hard it was for him to get to
this point. But to get a group of young men 19 to 22 years old to kind of form
as a unit is a challenge. And it was amazing to kind of watch them do that.
And I think there's power in that, and I think that's what allowed us to
shrink the gaps between us and all these tremendous teams like San Diego
State.  
  
I'm happy for them that those things work and still matter and got to this
point. I would have loved the feeling for them to obviously get it. But San
Diego State was just too strong.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if there's one play, obviously, that you can pinpoint or
that there was, but to feed off the question about Montana, the three-pointer
was big. He had a blocked shot and for a moment, your players almost looked
briefly deflated. Was there ever a point in the waning moments that you have
to remind them we're still in it? Did you notice any body language?  
PAUL WEIR: No, we talked throughout the whole game. The last time we played
them we finished the game on a 13-2 run. Let's keep going. Let's keep going.
Eventually we'll be able to punch back in this thing.  
  
I thought there were a couple of critical plays. Kell's deep three was a
dagger. He made it over Joe from about 25 feet. I thought that was a big shot.
Thought whether it was a charge call or not at center court on Watson, I
thought that was a big play, because it could have gone from a charge at
center court to him making a floater in the lane. And it seemed like all those
kind of critical plays it could have gone one way or the other, whether it's a
deep three or charge or whatever.  
  
We had a couple of layups rim in and out. That just kind of happens in those
games. Fortunately those plays went our way a lot this year. But tonight, to
San Diego State's credit, they went their way.  
  
Q. Going back to the question about you had an end-season turnaround.
Can you comment on the way their character grew as young men, not just
basketball players throughout the season?  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, incredible. And I learned a lot, myself, as a coach this
year. You talk a lot about culture and the culture you want to instill in a
program. And when I got here there was a culture I wanted to put in place. And
there was a lot of things we had to do differently. And it's easy to do that
in April through November when there's no games, there's no adversity,
everyone is all in. They'll put on the "believe or leave" shirt, they'll do
all that stuff April through November. But when you're 2 and 8 and 3 and 8,
that shows a lot of resolve. And our culture was really challenged at that
point. And fortunately we were able to work through it.  
  
It was a bumpy road. There was unfortunately a lot of guys that had to go
through some things to get where we wanted them, but really thankful they did,
and they ended up getting to reap those rewards.  
  
Q. At the eight-minute mark they had gone in a bit of a scoring slump,
Makuach at 7:39 hit the bucket and you have a 7-point lead. I'd asked the guys
at that point when you guys were in the huddles, and you've referenced the
Boise State game a lot and how things changed from that moment on and how you
guys were in timeouts down the stretch, was tonight more of a Boise State
timeout?  
PAUL WEIR: I don't think so, because the Boise State was 28 seconds. The Boise
State was really like a snapshot right at the end of the game with six or
seven minutes to go that we're not even talking like that. We're just trying
to keep the game going. Like I said, the last time we played them we finished
on a 13-2 run. We kept saying, this is where we want it, this is hopefully
where the game is going to continue to go. There was nothing that like that
that came into my mind.  
  
Q. Because you didn't have that 13-2 run, and you didn't close like you
had done lately. Are you surprised that you weren't able to close out, that
they did have the energy that you guys hoped they wouldn't? And do you have
any regrets about sprinting on the day of the championship game, the day of
the semifinal game, any regrets?  
PAUL WEIR: No, I think you have to give Trey Kell credit. He made a 25-foot
shot that was big and Montana made the and-one in the corner. They made some
big plays, and unfortunately we just had a couple that so far this year in
those games have gone down. The open looks, the layup around the rim, the
charge at center court, those are kinds of things that if they go the other
way we're not having that conversation. And those probably two or three plays
in the stretch turn into a six-point run. Unfortunately in a game like this
there's not a big swing. The game was going to be so tight anyways, when you
give up a swing like that it's hard to come back from.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 82, New Mexico - 75  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: First of all, I want to say that New Mexico was the one
opponent I didn't want to play in this thing early. Paul Weir has done a great
job with that team, they've gotten so much better. A team on an 8-game winning
played a team on a 7-game winning streak. It was the kind of game I thought
we'd see, right down to the end. So I want to congratulate Paul on the job
he's done with New Mexico.  
  
I want to thank Steve Fisher for leaving me such a great team. Not many first-
year coaches get a team like that. I want to thank Steve for all he's done to
build this Aztec program to what it is today.  
  
I want to thank my seniors, Trey Kell, Kameron Rooks, Malik Pope, they've
provided everything I thought they would. And they weren't afraid of the big
moment. That's why you have seniors on your team for these big moments, and
they all delivered. I'd like to say Devin Watson's like a senior, he's a
fourth-year junior. I have him back for one more. I don't want him to get too
full.  
  
Congratulations to my Aztecs. Thanks to Aztec Nation for following us. Two of
the greatest fan bases in this conference were here tonight, New Mexico and
San Diego State. And I thought it was a great environment for a championship
game. And we're grateful to be moving on to the NCAA Tournament after
suffering disappointments in the conference tournament in the past, to get
back on the winning side of that. We're grateful for that.  
  
Q. Trey, you got hurt and looked like Coach wanted to take you out. You
indicated you wanted to stay in. Can you talk about how important it was for
you to finish the game and how you were able to respond in that moment.  
TREY KELL: I felt like I was rolling at the moment. And I saw that we were
down about like six or something like that. So for me, coming out because of
an injury wasn't an option. I didn't want to go home. It was just a simple as
that. They asked me if I wanted to come out and I told them no.  
  
Q. Trey, to feed off of that, did you personally feel it was on you, the
senior leader, all due respect, to continue and take over at that point and
lead your team?  
TREY KELL: A little bit. It was just like I was saying, I felt like I was in a
little bit of a groove at the moment. And I felt like what we were running, I
felt like they couldn't -- they didn't have an answer for it. So the main
thing I just wanted to keep running and see if they made an adjustment. And
I'm glad it worked out for us.  
  
Q. For the seniors, San Diego State has had so much success in this
building, in tournament in the past. Did you feel like there was a lot of
pressure for you guys to come out and win, just to carry on the legacy of
having success in this tournament?  
MALIK POPE: We kind of had a stable focus and controlling what we could
control on the court within the team and just kept on with that.  
  
Q. Devin, when you guys played here the first time during the regular
season, obviously the team was struggling at the time. Can you just talk about
where you were and what was it that kind of turned around to play the way you
are now?  
DEVIN WATSON: We were just tired of losing. We knew we had way too much
potential to be losing games like that. And mentally from then to now I feel
like we're on a whole another level.  
  
Q. How are you feeling right now?  
DEVIN WATSON: Not itching anymore. We won it. I don't got to itch no more.  
  
Q. What was going through your minds when you were down by six late in
the game?  
MALIK POPE: Stay focused. It's a game of runs, you know what to do, lock in.
We knew stops and rebounds were going to seal the deal. And guys locked in and
we followed through with that.  
  
Q. Moving on to the NCAA tournament, how excited are you guys?  
MALIK POPE: I don't think words can describe that right now, to be honest. You
can just see the smiles on our faces. We're not content, we're not really
satisfied, we're definitely happy with the outcome, but we're still hungry.  
  
DEVIN WATSON: We're still hungry.  
  
MALIK POPE: It's not over.  
  
Q. Trey, obviously amazing performance. What did this mean to you, after
this whole season, the injuries, everything, just you did it?  
TREY KELL: Yeah, it means a lot to me. Being there my freshman year in the
tournament and seeing what it's like and everything like that, I wanted to get
back so bad. And we came in wanting to win three, and we just needed one more
tonight. And I tried to do whatever I could to make sure that happened. And
I'm glad we came out on top.  
  
Q. Kam, late in the game when you guys were down five, Coach put you in
and Max in. Was that unexpected, did he tell you that was going to happen and
what were your thoughts, Okay, I'm in this game in crunch time?  
KAMERON ROOKS: I was just going to always be prepared, regardless of if I went
in or not. I just wanted to stay ready. I know Dutch is putting me in the game
and he's giving me an opportunity. And he trusted me and I'm just glad I was
able to go out there and be able to get stops and help this team win.  
  
Q. And Trey, it looked like on that foul a couple of minutes, maybe six
minutes to go, when you got a long rebound and took off, and got fouled and
took a bit of a bump, what happened to you there?  
TREY KELL: I don't know what exactly happened. It kind of felt like I got like
kicked or kneed in the shin. And the longer the game went on, it felt like
there was a timeout every ten seconds to me, and it got tighter and tighter.
But it wasn't a big deal.  
  
Q. The one part of your body you haven't hurt this year?  
TREY KELL: Yes. Like I was saying when I was walking over here, it's a new
week, a new injury for me. I'm just used to it at this point.  
  
Q. So it's nothing lingering?  
TREY KELL: No, I'll be all right. Get some ice and treatment and I'll be
straight.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned there was the two fan bases here today, it was a
great atmosphere. What was it like for you to play in this type of environment
with the NCAA tournament on the line?  
TREY KELL: It was a great environment, like you said. It's always fun to play
in a game where one team scores, their fans go crazy, the other team scores,
their fans go crazy. It was the type of game every player wants to play in.
And like I keep saying, I'm glad we got the victory.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit more about that decision to put Kam and Max in the
game and take Malik and Jalen out, and talk about tactically, but also in the
context of rookie head coach in your biggest game down five with four minutes
to go and having the guts to do that?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I don't even remember that happening. I don't know what the
score was when I put them in. I know that this is New Mexico's style, they
wear you down at the end. And so I know Malik and Jalen, I was going to give
them one more blow and come back with them to finish the game.  
  
But that crew came in with Max and Kam and they did a great job. They got us
back in the game so I rode with them longer. You know what I've said, I'm
going to play the people that are playing the best at the time. Those two
played really well. I told Max that I thought he was going to do something
special in this tournament. I don't know where or when and I thought he would.
He hit the big corner three and got fouled, attacked the offensive glass, and
he had his moment.  
  
The key to basketball is not being frustrated when you're not in, so you're
ready for your moment when it comes. And I've talked all year about developing
my bench. And counting on my bench. And I could count on it here in the
tournament and it helped me win tonight.  
  
Q. What tactically did they both bring? Coach Weir talked about Max
spreading the floor. He said that was a key there because they couldn't help
on the ball screens. And it looked like Kam was setting all those ball
screens.  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, absolutely. Jalen is dynamic attacking the glass. And is
going to be a very good 3-point shooter, Max already is a very good 3-point
shooter. With all the high ball screens we were setting, they were switching
and having to deal with it, that I needed shooters around the ball screen so
they couldn't helped in on the rolling post.  
  
Max stretched the defense for us a little bit, he made that timely three. And
he did run in to rebound from the corner or the perimeter, he just didn't stay
there. When he saw the shot go up, he ran in and was aggressive on the glass.
Real pleased with his performance tonight.  
  
Q. When you lost to UNLV here, that was obviously during the time the
team was struggling, did you do anything at that moment with the players to
keep their head up? How did you turn it around?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: That was Trey Kell played one minute or two minutes into the
game and got hurt, and didn't play the rest of the game and didn't play the
next two or three. So I don't think it's any surprise that our nine-game win
streak started when Trey Kell came back into the lineup.  
  
This is what I envisioned for Trey all year long, senior guard with the ball
in his hands with the game on the line. Devin was sensational, too, good guard
play can make a coach look good. And they made me look good tonight.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, now, what is it going to take this team to
legitimately have a shot and make any kind of run at the NCAA tournament?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: We're on a nine-game win streak. I told them four weeks ago,
when it didn't look like we were going to avoid a play-in game, that I thought
we were the best team in the Mountain West. And that's motivation. That's
trying to tell them. But they have to believe that. And they have that kind of
swagger. They believe they're the best team in the Mountain West. We had to
win nine games to cut nets down and prove that we are.  
  
And so I don't think this team is satisfied at all. I think some teams are
satisfied to get in tournament. This is the second trip for Malik and Trey,
and Kam's been there with Cal, and so I've got veterans that played in this
environment before and are ready for this moment and are going with no other
intention other than to win games in the NCAA tournament. And I wish we were
playing at Viejas, but we can't.  
  
Q. Just a little bit more on Trey. You've said you wanted to have him
with the ball in key situations. Did you sense that entire season a
frustration finally coming out? He's almost like he willed you guys to this
win.  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I don't think it's frustration. Trey is just such a smart
player. If he doesn't draw a double team, you can see how he scores. If they
put two on him, he gets the assist. So he's is smart.  
  
When you run a ball screen, you don't feel he's going to shoot whether he's
open or not. Trey takes what the defense gives him. There's been players like
that with Coach Fisher. A guy you give the ball to, that if they don't double
him he's going to get a good shot, if they double him, he's going to get a
really good look for someone else. That's Trey, Devin tonight too. Both of
them like that high ball screen. Veteran guards that made big plays at big
moments, and that's why we're advancing.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Paul Weir](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33103)

### [Sam Logwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28480)

### [Troy Simons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34935)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 83, Utah State - 68  
  
PAUL WEIR: I can't say enough about what I think about Coach Duryea and Utah
State, they have a great team. They wouldn't go away tonight, they kept
fighting. You have to give them a lot of credit.  
  
Right now we're moving forward, on to the next game. San Diego State is a
tremendous team. We're in a really good place. I picked these two guys to come
up here on purpose because they both have been through a lot this year, with
me and with themselves. And they're kind of symbolic of our team.  
  
And we never gave up. And Sam never quite gave up on me, and I never quite
gave up on Sam. And Troy never quite gave up on me and I never gave up on
Troy. And our team at the end of the day, even though we were 3 and 8 or
whatever it was, never quite gave up on itself. And that still counts for
something.  
  
Chris Murray might not think there's a game tomorrow night, but we do. We're
excited to be here. We're going to give it everything we've got. We've battled
back from a lot, and that's America. And if Chris Murray doesn't want to
believe in that, that's fine, but we're really looking forward to just giving
it everything we've got tomorrow night. We've come a long way and we'll keep
fighting.  
  
I'm really thankful for these guys for sticking with our team. And I'm really
happy to coach this basketball team.  
  
Q. This being your senior year here, you've been through a few one and
dones here at this tournament. What's it like now to be at this point with a
shot at the championship tomorrow?  
SAM LOGWOOD: Definitely one of the best highlights of my career. Probably the
best. It's just a great feeling, like just fighting through adversity and
finally getting what I've worked so hard for, just my teammates, as well.
We've been through a lot. I've personally been through a lot, Troy has been
through a lot and the returners, as well. And we're seeing the work pay off
and it's a blessing to be able to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for both Troy and Sam. There was a moment when Troy was going
to the foul line and I see both of you guys with a smile on your face. And
seeing what you guys have gone through this year and how you guys are enjoying
playing basketball and you guys have a chance to go to your first NCAA
tournament, what's going through your head right now?  
TROY SIMONS: I'm just happy to be a part of this team. Like Coach Weir said,
we went through some things with the team. And they accepted us back on the
team and we came together as a family. And we're playing as a family now.  
  
SAM LOGWOOD: Same thing as Troy said. It's just we're enjoying playing
basketball again. There's times where you don't really enjoy playing it and it
really gets to you. And just actually having fun playing basketball was really
helping us win a lot of these games. We're really enjoying each other as a
team and enjoying playing together. And I think that's the biggest thing for
us right now why we've been so successful recently.  
  
Q. In the first half I think Utah State was up 20-12. And then after
that there was about like 8 minutes where they didn't score a field goal.
What, if anything, changed with your defense or with your mindset out there to
make that happen?  
TROY SIMONS: Basically we wasn't speeding them up at first. And then once we
got in the huddle Coach Weir said, We got to speed them up, make them turn it
over. So we started speeding them up and making them turn it over.  
  
SAM LOGWOOD: I wasn't too worried about it. It kind of goes back to a lot of
the lessons we've learned earlier in the year, we've just got to stay poised.
Coach Weir tells us if we're up 20, down 20, we've just got to stay the course
and keep grinding it out, and that's what we did. And it worked out for us.  
  
Q. Coach referenced the back and forth. In your words, each of your
words, what happened? And why do you think you were allowed back on the team
and how thankful are you that you are?  
SAM LOGWOOD: Personal reasons. And when I kind of figured it out, dealt with
what I was dealing with I was very blessed and excited to be back on the team.
It kind of changed my mindset.  
  
So I think it was something that I needed, not as a basketball player, but as
a man, just to kind of sit back and look at reality. And I think it's helped
me a lot.  
  
TROY SIMONS: The same as Sam. I just had to be a man and get through what I
was going through. And the team never gave up on me. So basically, yeah.  
  
Q. You mentioned that for a while there basketball wasn't fun. When was
the last time you've had as much fun you've had lately playing basketball?  
SAM LOGWOOD: I can't even remember, to be honest. But I'm just happy to be in
the situation. I've learned to let go of the past, and we're very happy to be
in the moment.  
  
PAUL WEIR: If you're not here at a certain time, you can't ask questions.  
  
Q. Troy, Sam, you are in the tournament, playing in the semifinal games.
This morning Coach tells you you're running anyway. What did you think?  
PAUL WEIR: I know what Sam thought but I don't know what Troy thought.
(Laughter.)  
  
SAM LOGWOOD: I mean, I didn't personally want to do it, but like Coach Weir,
he's hard-core, so nothing is going to change no matter, rain, sleet, snow,
championship game tomorrow, it doesn't really matter, we're going to stick to
the course. We've just got to grind through it. And we just got it done.  
  
Q. Did you believe him?  
SAM LOGWOOD: No, I didn't, until he told us to get on the line and we started
running.  
  
Q. Is there something to be said for the fact, though, that all year
long he's had the believe-or-leave kind of mentality and even in this moment
he's not letting you guys change your mindset of the consequences for things
like offensive rebounds against Wyoming and stuff like that.  
SAM LOGWOOD: Oh, yeah. Honestly, I just think that little phrase is deeper
than basketball. I think that phrase is more towards like just us growing as
men. We've got to believe in what we're in or not do it. Because if you're not
fully, whole-hearted into something, it's not going to work. You're not going
to be happy. And I think that's something I've learned, if you're not all the
way into something you're not going to have fun, you're just going to make
yourself miserable.  
  
TROY SIMONS: Same as Sam. You've got to believe in yourself and believe in the
system that Coach Weir set up for us, and if you don't, adios.  
  
Q. Coach is going to love this one. What do you guys think of the
fashion that he's doing and the sweater now two games in a row, 5-0 in the
sweater this year?  
SAM LOGWOOD: It's unique. It's different. Hey, we're winning when he wears the
sweater, he can keep it on all day.  
  
PAUL WEIR: They know more about fashion. I'm not great.  
  
Q. I know you gave me a long look last night when I asked you if you
were serious about the running. Were you considering at all not making them
run because you guys did just play a quarterfinal game last night?  
PAUL WEIR: I think as a coach you're challenged with those things every single
day. I think as a leader of an organization you are what you tolerate,
whatever those things may be. If we have a rule that you have to tuck your
shirt in and there's one day someone doesn't tuck their shirt in, are you
going to always hold people accountable every single time? And that's
something I've tried to stick to.  
  
No matter the time, no matter how serious the consequences may be, playing six
players at Utah State, whatever it happens to be, our principles are our
principles, and we have to stick through them no matter when that happens to
be.  
  
So, yeah, we had to do it.  
  
Q. Any runnings for tomorrow?  
PAUL WEIR: Yes.  
  
Q. Did they do anything in this game they have to run for?  
PAUL WEIR: Yep. Offensive rebounds, we gave up five.  
  
Q. You're going to sprint before a title game?  
PAUL WEIR: We always have sprinted for every offensive rebound we gave up. So
we had 13 offensive rebound game, that was probably our roughest postgame.
This morning we had seven and tomorrow we'll have five.  
  
Q. Early there when I think Utah State was up 20-12 and you called that
timeout, what exactly was it that you were trying to convey to your guys to
get things turned around?  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, I think it's been an interesting kind of journey with Utah
State. We went up there with the six guys and McEwen just murdered us. And we
really keyed on McEwen going into game two and Merrill really hurt us. And we
went into this one really kind of focusing more on Merrill, and we didn't come
out at the start of the game doing anything we were supposed to be doing on
him. It was a lot of similar stuff with James the day before. He kind of got
loose and made some shots. We just had to kind of clamp down on him.  
  
We knew McEwen had played a lot of minutes and had kind of been shooting a lot
more 3s lately. We felt good about how that matchup would be. But I thought we
had to key in on Merrill. After that first couple of possessions -- not first
couple -- first few minutes, we did a much better job with him the rest of the
way.  
  
Q. So after running, what kind of pep talk are you going to give your
team before the game?  
PAUL WEIR: We're not really big into the pep talks; we just get ready for the
next game. We've done it all year, we've never talked about seeding. Right now
we have to get ready for San Diego State and give it the best we can. It's one
game at a time mentality, and at 3:00 tomorrow we'll just give it the best
shot we have.  
  
Q. San Diego State is on this little bit of a roll where it's sort of a
redemption tour. They have played in the last three weeks, four teams or five
teams that beat them earlier in the year, and they've beat every single one of
them. And you're the only team that they have not beaten, because you've only
played once. Knowing that and knowing you're playing a team that has a little
bit of extra motivation, does that change how you approach a game or do you
have to be aware of that heightened motivation?  
PAUL WEIR: Not really. I think it was so long ago that we played San Diego
State, I think we're both different teams right now.  
  
The one thing I will say, I think we're both the freshest teams right now. I
think when you look at this tournament and you look at maybe some of the great
players that didn't play as well or some of the great teams that didn't play
as well, I just think they're out of gas. And they've been grinding and
grinding and playing guys 40 minutes a night and it just took a little bit of
a toll. And I think when we got to March that showed up a little bit on some
really great players and really great teams in our league.  
  
But I feel like San Diego State and us, it's like we're still on an upward
trajectory. I feel like that way just watching them. I watched their UNLV
game. They have a lot of energy. The two teams left are the teams that seem to
be the freshest right now.  
  
They're obviously enormous, they're big. It's Ivan Drago, whatever you want to
say. That's what they are. They're special. When I did my all-conference
awards they were drastically different than some of the ones that showed up.  
  
I think Malik Pope is the best center in the league. I think Devin Watson is
the best point guard. They're very talented, very good. We're going to have to
play our hearts out. And we're going to have to give it everything we've got
to close whatever gaps that happen to be there, whether it's size, talent, or
whatever, and give ourselves a chance to win a game.  
  
Q. You've been preaching about kaisan all year long, about how to get
better every single day. So what can you do better tomorrow to give you the
best chance to make the NCAA tournament?  
PAUL WEIR: At this point all I can control is the 16 hours that we have. And
we have to have a better 16 hours than them, whatever that happens to be. We
watched film in the locker room as soon as the game ended. We have to manage
and manipulate the next 16 hours better than they do. That's all we can do.
Then once the ball goes up, you are who you are, both them and us. And what
happens at that point, we'll see how it goes.  
  
But again, all I can do as far as the leader of our organization is just
manipulate the next 16 hours as best I can, and that's all we're going to try
and do.  
  
Q. I know you're not too reflective. I won't ask you to be overly
reflective. But the two guys sitting with you, getting to the championship
game, the two guys sitting with you this postseason, were two guys you
suspended for various reasons this year. Is that as unlikely a duo of guys be
the two you invited after a semifinal win?  
PAUL WEIR: If you showed up on time, Geoff, you know what I mean, my opening
statement would have reflected that.  
  
I think it's very symbolic of our team. We've never given up. We were 3 and 8.
I never quite gave up on Troy or Sam and they never quite gave up on me, and
our team never gave up on us. As bad as it got, as many losses as piled up,
losing by 30 at Boise, whatever had gone on, no one ever quite threw in the
towel.  
  
And that's why I'm really glad to have these two up here tonight. I'm glad our
team has got to this point. Because we never gave up. And there's some
satisfaction in that. When you're a great team, when you're picked first in
the league or second in the league or you have NBA prospects and you're
successful, that's amazing. I'm happy for people like that.  
  
When you're picked 9th and put a bunch of new kids together and you go through
the trials and tribulations that we did and you can get to this point now,
it's refreshing and comforting. We're not done, we have to give it everything
we've got tomorrow afternoon.  
  
But for them in particular, I'm very happy for them.  
  
Q. In the specifics of this game, and Anthony Mathis was a double-digit
scorer, scoreless tonight, didn't score much yesterday. If teams are going to
take him away, are you okay with that because it's opening other things, or
are you going to do something different to get Anthony more looks?  
PAUL WEIR: I thought he got some good looks tonight. We hadn't been able to
get in the Thomas & Mack, I think that affected us a little bit. We weren't
able to shoot in there today. We got 20 minutes the day before. We like to
shoot the ball. We spend a lot of time in the gym shooting. And unfortunately
we haven't had a lot of access to get in and get shots up. I think that might
have a little bit to do it.  
  
Hopefully tomorrow night Tone will be able to make some shots. I thought he
had some pretty good looks tonight. They just didn't go down. Especially there
late, shots that he usually make. Tomorrow afternoon hopefully he's able to
make them and our team can prosper off of that.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Jordan Caroline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32865)

### [Hallice Cooke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34929)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 90, Nevada - 73  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Thought San Diego State came out from the get-go the first
half, played phenomenal basketball. We didn't defend like we're capable of in
the first half. Free throws attempted is the difference in the basketball
game. It was from the very beginning of the game.  
  
Give San Diego State a lot of credit for putting pressure on us and drawing 34
fouls attempted to our 17. And surprisingly we took 14 more shots and still
couldn't get to the line.  
  
Having said that, San Diego State played really well. Our teams played well
not just in March, we played well for an entire season, which is why you have
30 games on your schedule, 31 games. We got beat tonight. Obviously San Diego
State played much better than us, not just better. And give credit to the
Aztecs.  
  
Q. You guys have been able to come out of deficits. You did it
yesterday. What was it about this game where you just couldn't get any
traction or make a run to dent into their lead?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: You just had to be ready to play from the get-go, and since
we weren't, we couldn't fight back from a 30-point deficit at the half.  
  
HALLICE COOKE: You've got to be ready to play when the ball goes up in the air
from the jump. And tonight we didn't do that. And we kept fighting hard. We
didn't start playing really hard until the second half, and we were already
down 30. And you can't make up for that many points in 20 minutes.  
  
Q. San Diego State is not a team that, at least for long stretches of
the season, made a lot of perimeter shots. Did that surprise you and get you
off guard when they started hitting the 3s and making everything they put
up?  
HALLICE COOKE: We helped give them confidence by giving them open shots early.
And as the game got on their confidence kept growing and growing. And they
were able to make shots. And we dug ourselves into too much of a hole. And
then we were down, they were getting run-outs and fast break points.  
  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Yeah, I agree with that. We let them get easy shots, get into
a rhythm early. If you let them get in a rhythm early they're going to hit
shots that they normally wouldn't hit.  
  
Q. Did they play you as a team any differently than they did last
Saturday when you played them much closer down there?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I think it was just we weren't prepared from the get-go and
that's what happened.  
  
Q. You haven't played your last basketball, obviously. How do you
rebound from this going into the next tournament?  
HALLICE COOKE: Every game you lose is an opportunity to learn something. And
we've got a lot of guys hurting right now. And to be a person who faced a lot
of adversity, this is the first time this season, losing with double digits,
I'm sure we're going to bounce back in practice. Coach is going to come with
that same energy and enthusiasm and passion that he brings every day. We've
got to believe what he tells us and go out and execute like we did tonight.  
  
JORDAN CAROLINE: We can learn something from this, and our next opportunity as
a team we have to be ready to play. And we can't take anything for granted.
From here on out it's one or done, we do or die.  
  
Q. This has typically been a tough team for you guys to play. What is it
about San Diego State that's given this team fits over the last couple of
years?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I really can't tell you. They're a really talented team. I
just don't think we came out to play each time we played them as we should. I
think that's the biggest thing. I'm not taking anything against them, they
have great players, but the times we played them we haven't been prepared.  
  
Q. You guys didn't start playing really, really hard until the second
half. Were they a more desperate team from the get-go?  
HALLICE COOKE: They had a deeper team. And I feel like playing three games in
three days, we did everything treatment-wise, but a lot of our shots were
short. Guys weren't using their legs. So I think that had to factor into it.  
  
There's no excuses. We work hard all summer. We push each other so hard. So
games like this shouldn't happen. And you have to learn from it and get
better.  
  
Q. You mentioned the free throw disparity and the foul disparity. Did
you feel like the officiating was inconsistent tonight?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I'm not going to comment. We had more blocks than San Diego
State, we had five more steals than San Diego State, 27 field goals to 28
field goals, seven 3s to eight 3s.  
  
There's one glaring stat -- you guys all have the stat sheet, you can see it.
And there's one glaring thing, they out-rebounded us, too, significantly.  
  
Q. You talked earlier this week just about how proud you were that you
hadn't had any double-digit losses and been able to be competitive. What kind
of happened in this one?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: We lost. They played better than us. We had obviously our
worst outing of the year not at a good time. Having said that, we're not a
team that lost three out of four or anything like that. We played an entire
season of college basketball and a ranked team for five weeks, whatever, the
last five weeks, and seven total weeks. We've had an incredible season and we
didn't play very good tonight. And we played against a good team that I think
is extremely talented. And, you know, they won the game. It's quite obvious.  
  
Q. You played these guys on February 10th at your place, outscored them
by 25 points in the second half. They were 13-10 at the time, in 8th place.
What's the difference between the team you saw that night in Reno and the team
you saw today?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I mean obviously I think every game, and all of our local
media has heard me say it over and over, every game has its own theme, it's
own identity. And San Diego State played great tonight. At San Diego with 50
seconds to go it was a two-point game. And we didn't play very good that
night, either. And you can certainly attribute it to San Diego State.  
  
So I don't want to take any credit away from them whatsoever. We were bad
tonight and they were really good and that's why you see the difference in 55
to 25 at halftime.  
  
And having said all that, our guys did not quit in the second half. We
outscored them in the second half by 13 or whatever. And we didn't quit.  
  
Q. You said earlier this week that you felt you had done enough to get
in the tournament irregardless of what happened here. Do you still feel that
way? Do you feel the tournament committee will feel that way?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: We certainly feel we're one of the best teams in the country,
without question. And if we just got hot recently or something and then lost,
maybe not, but we've been so consistent from the very beginning. We put
together an unbelievable non-conference schedule. We won on the road at a
high, high, high rate. And so we certainly think that the NCAA Tournament
Selection Committee looks at the entire body of work.  
  
And so, yeah, we feel like we've done more than enough based on how we played
an entire season, not getting hot during a stretch or anything like that.
Yeah, we do feel like we have done enough.  
  
Q. Kendall turned his ankle early in the second half. Is that something
that you feel could stretch into the next game?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: We don't think so. It's just precautionary, we were down and
went with some guys that could trap and press. Up to that point in 20 minutes
Kendall hadn't hit a three and hadn't gotten a rebound. We wanted to just play
Josh, because we thought he'd give us a little more activity.  
  
Q. Was it frustrating that you have to defend a 27-7 record?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: No, I don't think we're defending. Like I said, we're coming
in tonight 22 ranked team in the country and we've held that top 25 for quite
some time. And you guys are asking the question.  
  
I'm not really defending it. We went out and did what the committee told us,
which was to schedule as many road games as you could. And we went out and won
on the road. 12 road wins is a lot of road wins. And we didn't stay in our
region and play a bunch of local games at home. We didn't do that. We went out
and played. We have no Division II teams on our schedule. And we have
confidence that a body of work that we've done, we'll be playing -- find out
who we're playing on Sunday, that's how we feel.  
  
Q. You mentioned the rebounding, I think in the first half, you missed
12 shots, got eight of those back on offensive boards. Was that something that
you weren't doing as a team?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought Jalen did a good job and Kameron did a good job,
too, on the glass in the first half and their activity. Playing UNLV and San
Diego State, both teams that have length on the inside, playing them back-to-
back nights, you know, certainly affected us on the rebounds, I thought. We
knew when we saw the brackets the way they came out that San Diego State and
UNLV were really, really talented and matched some of our athleticism and
such.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Brian Dutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33374)

### [Matt Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34889)

### [Devin Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34926)

### [Jalen McDaniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34927)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 90, Nevada - 73  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Just real happy to have found a way to beat a really good
Nevada team. They're an NCAA tournament team, there's no question about it. We
definitely benefited from having the numbers they had versus ours, that they
had to play back-to-back.  
  
I thought that our guys did a really nice job in the first half and built a
lead and then the second half was tough. They were coming at us hard, forcing
us into playing a tempo we didn't want to play with a lead. We knew that was
going to happen. We wanted to take care of the ball, I think we got cautious
against the pressure, but they never gave up.  
  
Nevada has a very talented, very tough-minded team. We very fortunate to have
beaten them today. We're excited to have a chance to play for the conference
championship tomorrow and get a chance to get in the NCAA Tournament Sunday on
selection time.  
  
With that being said, we will take any questions.  
  
Q. What did you learn, if anything, from playing Nevada and beating them
last weekend at your place?  
JALEN McDANIELS: We learned that we've just got to play hard all the time.
They're a tough team. We've got to be tougher than them. Stick to it on the
defensive end and just get stops. And we get stops converts in the offense.  
  
Q. Talk about coming out like you did with the first three 3s you took,
kind of set the tone for the team at the very beginning, you guys kind of took
off from there. What were you seeing out there on the court?  
DEVIN WATSON: They kept going under me. So as they kept going under me I just
had to be aggressive and take my shots and they went in. Just being
aggressive, taking what the defense was giving me.  
  
Q. What were you guys seeing out there like on the court, like
everything you were throwing up pretty much went in? What was that feeling
like, and how did it all come about?  
DEVIN WATSON: Just momentum. Seeing the ball go through the hoop. Everybody
making shots and it was just a great feeling, just momentum.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel like there was a little bit of extra stuff going on
in this game? It was really physical in the beginning, bodies hitting the
floor. Did that motivate you, you really wanted to put it to them?  
JALEN McDANIELS: We knew they were going to have to come out like that. We had
to match them and go beyond them and I felt like we did it.  
  
Q. Matt, you hit the deck a couple of times and then came back, and you
were going pretty hard. What was going on out there with you?  
MATT MITCHELL: It was just physicality, just competitiveness. That's really
all it is. Nothing more than that. And just two teams wanted to win, and win
the Mountain West Championship.  
  
Q. How much momentum do you feel you have going into the final game
tomorrow the way you're playing?  
MATT MITCHELL: I feel like we have a lot. Winning the way that we did, and
doing what we did, just playing like a team and really defending hard and
getting after it. I feel like we have a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence
going into tomorrow's championship game.  
  
Q. They always say you want to play your best basketball at the end of
the season. You guys seem to be firing on all cylinders. What point during the
season did it click, eight in a row you guys have won?  
JALEN McDANIELS: I think after that last Nevada game at their place, you know,
we put a stop to it. We just had come closer as a team, play hard every game,
every possession. Every possession counts, especially on the defensive end. I
feel like on the defensive end we've been getting stops and it's been
converting to easy offense. I feel like that's the difference.  
  
Q. As freshmen are you surprised that you guys have been able to be so
productive, not only throughout the season but obviously late and through this
tournament so far? You guys are young, you're freshmen, you've come in and
played so well. Is that surprising to you? What was your attitude coming into
the season and as the season started progressing?  
JALEN McDANIELS: It's not surprising. We've been playing basketball for a long
time. We just want to go out there and compete, play at a high level. And I
feel like us two, we've been doing that. And the freshmen, okay, we're not
freshmen anymore, the season is almost over.  
  
Q. You go to halftime with just a 30-point lead. First of all, I'm sure
you didn't expect to be up by 30 against Reno at the half. But to come into
the second half and not left down.  
MATT MITCHELL: Really, it was just listening to the coaching staff and
sticking to our game plan was what kept us going. Knowing they were going to
come out harder than they did in the first half, came out harder in the second
half. Just going into halftime we were just sticking to the game plan, keep
getting stops, keep rebounding, playing hard, and just finish the game out.  
  
Q. Before the game I noticed you and a bunch of other players, you
finished shooting really early. You were like ready on the bench, ready to
play. What was that feeling like? Did you have a calm over you or did you just
know you were ready for this type of game?  
DEVIN WATSON: It was the calm before the storm. We wanted to go out and play
and handle business, and get to the next one, get to the championship.  
  
Q. How hungry is this team to win tomorrow and go to the NCAA
tournament?  
DEVIN WATSON: Very hungry. I'm itching right now we want it so bad.  
  
Q. Eight games ago did you guys think that you'd be in this position?  
DEVIN WATSON: Yeah, we knew it was going to start clicking, we definitely knew
it.  
  
Q. What do you think was the main reason for the change? You touched on
it, but if you could put one thing, what clicked?  
DEVIN WATSON: Tired of losing. We knew our potential. We knew how good we
could be, we just wanted to prove it to ourselves and to everybody.  
  
Q. You've been on the bench for a lot of basketball games in your
career. Where does the first half of this game rank as far as a half a
basketball that you've been on the bench for?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: You know, when you start making shots like that, the basket
gets the size of the ocean. And when that happens everything seems to be good.
Devin started us. They ducked under some ball screens. He made some early 3s.
And obviously we did a good job sharing the ball.  
  
Nevada is a very good team. And we were very fortunate to get off to the start
we did, and then we just continued to play upon that momentum. And we took it
into halftime, told them at halftime, Don't give up any 3s, don't turn the
ball over, rebound the ball, and share the ball. And we did that for most of
the second half. Down the stretch they really bothered us, jumping up into us,
trapping all over the place.  
  
As a coach I don't want to finish the game like that. I told them in the
locker room, I don't want that to diminish how great I thought they played
this game and how proud I was of them and that we're one game short of our
dream, which is to go to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. You've been around for a long time. You don't think this loss will
jeopardize their chances in terms of getting in?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Absolutely not. They've got as good a résumé as anybody out
there. And I would hope that they would look at us as a quality loss. That
we're a pretty good team ourselves. And it's not a bad loss in March. We've
got a good team. And by beating them that's our -- I know they're talking
tiers. That would be our third tier 1 win, with Gonzaga and beating Nevada
twice. We're quietly putting a pretty good résumé together.  
  
Q. Might it cost them a few seeding spots?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I don't know, I don't pay too close attention on that, so
focused on my own team.  
  
Q. You've had good success getting to the finals but recently you've had
not very much success in the finals. You've talked about that all season,
wanting to reverse that. You've been on the bench the last four finals that
you lost. What have you learned from that that you might apply heading into
tomorrow's final?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Everyone is so different, the game tomorrow will be so
different just based on who wins this second game. The tempo of it, the way
it's played, the strategy. And so it's matchups.  
  
So I remember back when Wyoming beat us, Coach Shy did a great job controlling
tempo. We played Fresno and lost in the finals. Marvelle Harris put on a
magnificent performance.  
  
It's one play, one rebound, I know we will compete at a high level. But so
will the other team. It's a one-and-done situation. I know our team will be
ready and so will our opponent. It will be a great matchup, whoever it is.  
  
Q. Back to the whole freshmen thing. As a coach, is it exciting to have
young players be so composed and play so well on the bigger stage here and
throughout the year? How exciting is it to have that on the team?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: It's great. And they're playing pretty free, because a lot of
the plays we're running through Trey, we're running through Malik. And we run
plays for those kids, but they're playing off the others. And if you're going
to be good in March it's great to have great senior play.  
  
And so we're finally healthy. Trey is healthy, Malik is healthy. And that goes
a long way with how we're playing. Trey coming back started this 8-game
winning streak. Trey's contributions have been enormous. Malik is playing his
best basketball now. Kameron Rooks, our other senior, has come on since Senior
Day against Nevada and given us three really good games.  
  
And so the freshmen, all they have to do is follow the senior's lead. And if
they do that they'll continue to have that kind of success.  
  
Q. Kam gave you a big lift against Nevada like he did six days ago. And
he was in that stretch when you really started to pull away. What is it about
him and his game that you think causes them problems?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Someone once told me you can't coach 7-1. He's a big man. And
he uses his height and his physicality to his advantage and our advantage.  
  
So I know he didn't want to get all the falls he got today, but he's a
presence underneath there and it makes a difference. We're real fortunate
having him playing his best basketball in March. And hopefully he will
continue to do that tomorrow in the game.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2018

  

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Koby McEwen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32795)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 83, Utah State - 68  
  
TIM DURYEA: Credit to New Mexico. I thought they were obviously extremely hard
to play against, as we know. And put a lot of pressure on you and we're a
pretty good offensive team in the half court. They do a great job of not
letting us execute. And we had a 7-, 8-minute stretch there where we probably
played about as badly as we can play. And we just could not overcome that
stretch.  
  
Second half I thought we were a lot better in terms of attacking the pressure,
attacking the press. Got a lot of shots right at the rim, still missed an
inordinate amount of two- and three-foot wide open shots.  
  
But I thought we looked like a basketball team in there for about seven or
eight minutes in the first half. That's probably the worst stretch of
basketball we've played all year. So credit to them. A lot of credit goes to
the pressure they put on you.  
  
Q. Stat-wise it seemed pretty even between you two teams for most of the
game, except layups was a real struggle today, I think 12 of 24. Was there
something that New Mexico was doing defensively or a mindset problem? What
went into that struggle today?  
KOBY McEWEN: You know, I think we were playing real timid to start the game.
After we broke their press, we weren't attacking it after that. I think we did
a better job in the second half of trying to get to their basket after we
broke the press. But we can't start off games like that. After we break their
press, we have to be aggressive in the lane.  
  
On the other side when they came down, they put pressure on us, got our guys
in foul trouble. So they were the aggressor tonight and we weren't. They hit
first and we reacted.  
  
So credit to them. They were really aggressive tonight and they threw the
first punch.  
  
Q. You heard Coach talk about the eight-minute period where you guys
didn't really get a field goal. What happened there? Was it something they
sort of ramped up or something you weren't doing, what happened during that
stretch?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, they play that pressure defense. And it started with one
turnover and then we just got sped up. And that's exactly what they want you
to do and that's what you can't do. And then once you get sped up and have a
couple of turnovers it all turns mental. And that was our issue. We had
probably four or five turnovers in a row that had nothing to do really with
their pressure, but we were so sped up and so flustered mentally that we fell
apart for that stretch.  
  
And we got in more of an attack mode later, but that stretch was too much to
overcome.  
  
KOBY McEWEN: Especially being the point guard, I've got to do a better job of
just controlling the tempo of the game. A lot of that I could put on myself,
just trying to control the offense and handling the pressure. I've got to do a
better job of that. A lot of that falls into my hands.  
  
Q. Last night you said you weren't here just to win quarterfinal games.
How has this experience helped you these last couple of nights to build for
the future and advance and not just win quarterfinal games?  
SAM MERRILL: I think our whole season has been big for us, with all the
adversity, with all the injuries we had early and the losses that we shouldn't
have had and how we've grown. I think they were all big steps for us.  
  
Obviously this is disappointing, and this isn't our goal and we want to get
better. But hopefully we can take what we've learned from these situations and
apply it into whatever we do going forward to get better and to, like you
said, be able to move forward next year and be playing at 3:00 next year.  
  
Q. There's only two seniors on the team. How excited are you for the
future of this program?  
KOBY McEWEN: I'm excited. We are a young group and a lot of guys that work
hard every single day, that want to get better and be coached. For the future
of this program I'm really excited. It's fun playing with these guys, just
being around them every day at practice. They show up and they work hard. And
we never hung our head this season. It was rough for us, like Sam said, we had
a lot of injuries, but the young guys grow up real fast. And I'm one of those
young guys.  
  
So I'm real excited for what's to come. We've been through a lot. And there's
a lot to learn from it and I think it will benefit us in the future.  
  
Q. On that same note, you just mentioned all the injuries to the team.
How excited are you to get guys like Klay Stall, Norbert, Janicek back into
the weight room, gym and try to do this thing again next season with them?  
SAM MERRILL: And Brock, too, we had three guys that missed basically all year.
And three guys that we feel can be productive for us. We're excited for them
to get healthy, they're about there, and come together as a team collectively
this spring and summer. I think this summer is important to not only develop
our games individually but to come together as a team and develop that
camaraderie that we need coming March next year.  
  
Q. So with the two seniors, what did you see from them this season in
terms of trying to overcome and play well in their last season here?  
KOBY McEWEN: With those injuries that they had, they never hung their head.
They never had a bad attitude about it. When they got hurt it was about
getting better and staying positive, keeping the guys engaged. And that was
really big for us. They showed a lot of positivity during those moments of
them getting hurt.  
  
And when they came back, it took them a little while just to get their feet
wet and get comfortable again. But when they were back it helped us
tremendously. Just for them to set that example of getting hurt and being able
to take it so positively. It was good for our team. I think it helped
throughout the whole team and our coaching staff I thought the whole season.
Those two guys, the way they handled themselves this season really helped us.  
  
Q. If you guys receive an invite to any postseason tournament would you
accept that?  
TIM DURYEA: We're in discussions now, and I haven't had a chance to talk to
the administration or anything, but we have had a couple of tournaments reach
out to us. So I don't have any details or anything like that. But I know we've
got a locker room full of guys that would like to keep playing. So hopefully
one of those will work out.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on that eight-minute period of time. You were up
20 to 12 before that, you had to be feeling pretty good at that point.  
TIM DURYEA: Yeah, I thought that stretch, we were dictating to them in terms
of how we were going to play and we executed a couple of things, got a couple
of layups, got some good looks. And then when the pressure turned, which when
you play them for 40 minutes and they're playing 94-foot basketball for 40
minutes, the tide is going to ebb and flow little bit.  
  
When it started going their way I thought mentally as much as physically we
did not handle that very well. And again, it just kind of snowballed and give
them credit. They took that little period of the game and really made it the
difference. Because the second half I thought it turned our way a little bit
more.  
  
Defensively I never thought we got a handle on them inside. I thought Logwood
and Furstinger were very good and manhandled us a little bit in there. So when
we made a couple of mini runs in the second half we could never make them
stand up because those guys always kind of came through and stemmed the tide.  
  
Q. Back to the seniors. Talk to me about the senior season, considering
all the injuries they went through.  
TIM DURYEA: Yeah, they were kind of symbolic of what was happening there. It
seemed like for about two weeks every day I came to the office somebody was
hurt, sick, hurt again. And those guys were severely affected. And when
they're out for, especially Julion, when he's out for so long and then he
comes back and plays well. Like I said yesterday I'm really, really happy for
him.  
  
But you forget some of the things they do well that you're missing because
your team kind of takes a different shape and you start doing different
things. And then they pop back into the picture and it's like, those are some
things that would help our team that they do.  
  
Alex didn't get much of a chance tonight. But those guys, they just hung in
there. They're two really, really good people, and raised right and
persevered. I thought that was a good lesson for our young guys to learn.  
  
Q. I know Isby wasn't with the team tonight and there's a lot of rumors
floating around that. Were those distractions, did it affect the team
tonight?  
TIM DURYEA: Not at all. He left the team for personal reasons this morning and
had no bearing whatsoever.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Paul Weir](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33103)

### [Joe Furstinger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34902)

### [Antino Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34903)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 85, Wyoming - 75  
  
PAUL WEIR: I thought Wyoming really fought all game. I don't think the margin
between us is very big. We're two very close teams. I thought as great as Joe
played, Herndon played well. They just wouldn't go away.  
  
But fortunately we were able to get enough stops. And that is something we
haven't done a great job of particularly lately. But we were able to get stops
down the stretch and keep them at bay and thankfully come out with a victory.  
  
Q. Looked like a physical and mental and spiritual denial of not letting
them take the game from you. Accurate?  
JOE FURSTINGER: Yeah, just didn't want this to be my last college game. Me and
coach we've been close, Antino, we just didn't want it to be our last game
together.  
  
Q. It seemed like there at the end, especially, you were kind of trying
to rally the troops as much as you could in the huddle and on the floor. What
was your message to your teammates there?  
ANTINO JACKSON: Like coach says all the time, he tells us to be poised. We've
been in the situation a few times this year. I was just telling the guys to be
poised and pull out the ballgame.  
  
Q. James and Dalton, they're leading scorers, but you kept them at bay
tonight. Anything in particular that you were able to do to hold them in
check?  
ANTINO JACKSON: The past few days we've been watching a lot of film on them,
Coach has done a really good job of preparing us to make them do what they're
uncomfortable doing. And we was able to do that tonight.  
  
Q. You guys got stops when you needed stops. There's been close games
where maybe you didn't. I don't know if maybe shots didn't fall. Was it a
conscious effort? Was anything different in this game to get stops as it got
close down the end?  
JOE FURSTINGER: I feel like throughout the year we've improved on, like, late-
game situations and today it helped us.  
  
Q. The last time you played Wyoming Herndon was not in there much
because he was sick. Tonight did you feel like he kind of added something on
defense with being at full strength?  
ANTINO JACKSON: He's a really good player, and I've got to give credit to him.
Him and Joe was battling tonight. Them kind of playing another game, he was
more tired, they were more tired. And we were able to make him beat us and not
let the other guys beat us.  
  
Q. As one of the veteran players on this team, what does it mean to play
a large role in helping New Mexico get back to a semifinal?  
JOE FURSTINGER: It means a lot. Coach Weir believes in me, which I love. We
play as a team. Everyone believes in each other. We've got to help us again.  
  
Q. In that vein, what's it feel like to win a game in this tournament
and not be one and done?  
JOE FURSTINGER: It feels great. Feels amazing.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were able to frustrate Wyoming there. There were
some things they were throwing that weren't called as technicals. Is that
something you were trying to do is get under their skin and get them off their
game?  
ANTINO JACKSON: Everybody knows we're runners. So Coach just told us, we were
exchanging buckets. This is the game we want to play. They get frustrated and
worn down at the end, so we were able to do that.  
  
Q. How much time do you give yourself to celebrate before you mentally
start preparing for tomorrow?  
JOE FURSTINGER: We're already on to Utah State.  
  
ANTINO JACKSON: Zero.  
  
JOE FURSTINGER: None.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be able to show such great emotion in a game that
you had such a huge part of in a win or go home?  
JOE FURSTINGER: I play this game with so much passion, I take everything so
seriously. When we lose games I'm mad at myself. It just feels really good to
win.  
  
Q. How badly do you want it, Joe? How badly do you want it, Antino?  
ANTINO JACKSON: Like you said, this is my senior year. I don't want it to end.
I'm not doing this just for me; I'm doing it for a coach that believes in us
and for a team that's just together. Like everybody said, we got picked last
and we're here and we're not satisfied.  
  
Q. Sorry if this is repetitive. This is your first win in this
tournament and I know the people back in Albuquerque, everyone likes to call
this Pit West, but this is the first time it's been what it once was. You
never experienced Pit West. What did these guys tell you that this used to be
like?  
JOE FURSTINGER: I still talk to Alex Kirk, Cam, Hugh, and they said it was
crazy when it was one and done here, and just how we fill up the Thomas and
Mack Arena, all our fans.  
  
Q. You said in order to win this tournament it is going to take the best
defensive effort by New Mexico. How do you feel you're at defensively right
now is?  
PAUL WEIR: I thought it was pretty good. It's as good as it's been in a while.
We did a lot of time on how to guard Justin James. We did an excellent job on
him. We guarded him with three people and that was the idea. And we did a
really good job containing him.  
  
I thought our defense down the stretch in the second half, whether we missed a
free throw or we couldn't execute something offensively, we were going back
and getting stops defensively. Which was really big for us.  
  
At the beginning of the second half I think we gave up three offensive
rebounds in the first four possessions, that wasn't great. That's going to be
an issue for us with our size. But if we can find a way to get stops, man, it
gives us some balance, which we desperately need.  
  
Q. You got off to the big quick start. What do you tell the guys to keep
them from panicking? Is it sometimes bad to get off to a good start like
that?  
PAUL WEIR: I'll be honest with you, the last month or so as the gravity of our
games increased, I tried to take my foot off and be more relaxed and calm with
them. And the message before the game was: This is just the next game. I don't
care it's in Vegas or care what it's for. We have to stay relaxed and play our
game. The bigger the game, the bigger the moment, the more we have to run,
press, and be us. And I think as long as we can do that, we alleviate some of
that other stuff that can creep in.  
  
I think our style of play lends itself a little bit to that. We just get to go
out to run and press and trap and play, and we don't have to think a ton about
other stuff.  
  
Fortunately it got us off to a good start, which I think was big for us
tonight. It seemed like we were playing defense the rest of the way, but I'd
rather be doing that than being down after a start.  
  
Q. You were talking about your identity, you run press, all the
defensive identity stuff. Your identity on offensive is three-pointers. Is
there something to be said that you found a way to win with the point guard
play being what it is lately and your identity on offense? You didn't do what
your identity is tonight. You still found a way.  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, I thought they did a good job of really getting out on us,
and I think that was why we were picking up fouls. They were so out on Antino.
We were kind of picking up fouls in the drive. We had a lot of stuff around
the rim. Joe was terrific tonight. Not only getting the ball one-on-one in the
post but getting stuff off the glass.  
  
But I think it opened up everything else. Their defense was terrific taking
away our three-point shooting. That's the most we've gotten on the free throw
line in a while. We were good.  
  
Overall if you told me we were going to do what we did at the free throw line,
we were going to get 13 offensive rebounds, that's a traditional offensive
game. It's a little unusual for us, but maybe because they were taking away
all those 3s, it allowed us to be more basic.  
  
Q. I thought the composure down the stretch was very good. I thought
they were patient. I thought one of the biggest plays, Joe seemed like he was
caught in the post and hit Dane for a reverse layup, which was a momentum
stopper. Talk about the composure and the patience down the stretch and how
you saw it.  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, I think there's two things that go into that moment. I think
there's a physical component. I think you have to be, like, in shape to be,
like, mentally aware to execute what you're going to do. And then there's the
mental side of it as far as okay, here's the gravity of the moment, the depth
of what's going on. What do I need to do? How do I need to do it? Not the
score or the time or whatever it may be.  
  
And I felt all year long like we were physically ready for these moments.
We're not tired, ready to go. The most minutes anybody played tonight was 31.
Physically I think we're ready to go. It was just the mental side of it.  
  
I thought we got in really good stretch there through some of the games. The
Boise game was a letdown for us. It probably made us really go back and think
about coaching the mind, teaching the mind, putting us in a great space in
those places. And we've been able to close out games ever since.  
  
I think because we have both of those things I feel really good. There's never
a guarantee. Someone makes a great shot, misses an easy shot, sometimes those
things happen. But right now we have a good blend of physical and mental
acuity in those moments.  
  
Q. You mentioned it with the 13 offensive rebounds, overall how do you
feel about how your team rebounded tonight?  
PAUL WEIR: I thought it was great outside of those three offensive rebounds in
the first four possessions of the second half really bothered me. They don't
think they're running tomorrow, but they are, for the rebounds. That's
something that's a big key for us. We can't let teams hurt us on the glass.
Because they have an advantage there. We don't have a lot of size.  
  
Offensively for Joe and Sam and Troy and those guys to get in there and create
second shots, particularly early in the game, it gave us a nice momentum, a
nice flow. Even when shots weren't falling we were able to keep scoring and
feeling good about ourselves.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the ball movement tonight by your Lobos.  
PAUL WEIR: Pretty good. I think, again, we learned from that Boise game. Even
watching the game before us tonight I thought the last few minutes of the
game, it got really stagnant. There were two teams in the moment, not really
wanting to go out and win. We had that when we lost to Boise at home. I keep
talking about the gravity, but the seriousness of the moment can get to you.  
  
But I thought tonight was awesome. My favorite play of the game was them
scoring, us getting the ball out, throwing it down the other end and Makuach
laying the ball in. That's a commitment to our style, not getting worried,
just keep playing. Who cares the score, who cares the time, and keep going.
And that's what we have to do, even more so as the games go forward. This will
be Utah State's third game in three days. We have to crank it up even more;
even more pressure, even more running, even more 3s. That's why we've always
done what we've done, for these moments.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the importance of Troy's play lately, because he's
been very good the last five games.  
PAUL WEIR: He has been. You know, he's always been a very good defensive
player, particularly off the ball. He's a great steal guy. He's one of the top
steal guys in the country. He's great for our press off the ball. He's always
been a very good offensive rebounder. What's kind of come and gone with him
has been his 3-point shooting. For him to step up and make 3s lately has been
enormous for us. Because everyone has been keying in on the usual suspects.
His ability, because he's going to get open looks, to make 3s, really helps us
offensively.  
  
Q. Joe said there's no time to celebrate, on to Utah State. Taking a
look at Utah State, what do you see?  
PAUL WEIR: I haven't spent any time on them. We did a scouting report really
quickly in the locker room right as the game ended. We'll go back and get into
them tonight.  
  
Off the top of my head, like I told them, McEwen and Merrill, McEwen really
hurt us in game 1, Merrill really hurt us in game 2. We have to contain those
guys. We spent a lot of time working on James.  
  
I think going into game 2 we spent a lot of time working on McEwen. I thought
we did a good job on him. We have to go in and put the best game plan we can
in for tomorrow night. And for me that starts now. Obviously there's been
other coaches working on it, and the players, they're already into it. But now
it's time for me to dig into it, too, and hopefully by tomorrow at 8:30 we'll
be locked and loaded.  
  
Q. You're going to make them run tomorrow?  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, I am.  
  
Q. That's not my question. So you've talked all year, you haven't really
tried to put specific goals on this team, and you haven't tried to promise
anything to people, but the one thing you've consistently said is, We want to
be ready for March and we want to build this team for three days, three games
and three days in March. Did you feel pressure to get this one out of the
way?  
PAUL WEIR: Quite honestly, I didn't feel any pressure. I haven't felt any
pressure for the last month. Every time Snake comes around to practice, he
keeps telling me we're playing with house money. I don't know how appropriate
that is to say with gambling rules.  
  
We have no pressure, that's the beautiful part of it, we were 3-8. Part of the
reason I said let's worry for three games in March, because you can't really
say much else in the middle of November when things aren't going well. And
really, that's what we talked about through that, is this season was going to
be a war of attrition.  
  
I think college basketball seasons are way too long. That's a whole other
subject. But I thought by March if we stuck together and we did what we needed
to do, other teams would decrease enough we could catch them. I don't think we
can beat a lot of of these teams that we beat lately, I don't think we could
have beat them in November; San Diego State, UNLV. But my March, the seasons
are long enough that those teams maybe can chip away a little bit and have
chinks in their armor. And if we can keep grinding away and getting better and
getting more together and believing in our style, maybe we could get to a
point where we could catch those guys.  
  
And that's really the only choice we had, and now we're here. And hopefully we
can execute. There's no guarantees but I felt it gave us our greatest
probability of success.

### [Rodney Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24955)

### [Deshon Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32891)

### [Bryson Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34888)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 64, Fresno State - 52  
  
RODNEY TERRY: Don't mind my voice right now. We give a lot of credit to San
Diego State. They've had a great finish to their season. We knew we were
playing probably the hottest team coming into the tournament. Give their
seniors a lot of credit in terms of how they played down the stretch. Kell had
a big game today. Pope is always a problem to deal with. Brian has his group
playing at a very high level right now.  
  
Take my hat off to my guys. I thought my guys competed hard today, like they
have all season long. And we just lost to a better team today.  
  
Q. The stretch coming out of the under 12 timeout in the second half,
the five possessions.  
RODNEY TERRY: You had to take care of the basketball, and this team has done a
pretty good job. We felt good at the halftime, we only had four turnovers at
the half. You've got to value taking care of the basketball down the stretch,
especially in postseason play. And those possessions down the stretch compound
without getting a stop on the other end, and those guys got a chance to get a
little separation at that point. And we were fighting uphill from that point.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE)?  
RODNEY TERRY: I think that at the end of the day we always talk about
fundamentals is really important, that we stick to the fundamentals, and make
the simple play. And give them credit, their defense was in the right position
at times to take some of the things that we were trying to do away.  
  
DESHON TAYLOR: We just didn't execute our game plan, like late in the second
half, like you said, we turned the ball over like five times in a row. We were
trying to put the ball inside, but it wasn't going our way.  
  
BRYSON WILLIAMS: Yeah, we had five turnovers in a row. It was a real bad
stretch. We just didn't take care of the ball. And we have to do better with
that. And we really worked all year hard on taking care of the ball. And we
really take pride in that. And we just didn't do a good job of it tonight.  
  
Give credit to San Diego State, they're a real good defensive team. And we
just had the turnovers.  
  
Q. You have to play with who you have, but how much do you miss Jaron in
a game like this?  
RODNEY TERRY: Well, you can always have some injuries, and that's just part of
the game. We tried to not let it be an excuse or something that can hinder the
remainder of our season. We lost Jaron, who was playing probably as good as
any guard in the league at the time. We won five in a row, and the first ten
minutes in Wyoming and we're up one when he goes out.  
  
And it changes your team. You have to adapt and adjust. We had to do that. We
weren't able to play probably as fast as we were in the past. We relied on
getting transition baskets. He was a speed guy for us. A guy of size. And he
was our lead rebounder.  
  
So put all those together it was a major loss for us. But we never tried to
make it an excuse for us in terms of not having him. We always tried to say
next man up, and somebody else needed to step up for us. That's going to
happen in sports and also in life. Someone goes down, next one has to step up
and do the job better and try to do it at a high level.  
  
It was a huge loss for us size-wise, you play a big guard team like San Diego
State, they did what they were supposed to do, they ran sets where they tried
to isolate the ball, we would have done the same thing if we had the advantage
of guards in terms of size. With Jaron you don't have that mismatch. You
probably have one smaller guard on the floor as opposed to having two smaller
guys. And that's worked for us at times as well.  
  
It's a huge loss for us. We're not going to downplay like it wasn't. But we're
not going to make any excuses, because we played a lot of games this year
without Jaron.  
  
Q. You played San Diego State in February. They went after you. They
went up to Nevada and got drilled. And then they haven't lost since. The last
time you played them until now, why are they so much different or better?  
RODNEY TERRY: The senior players. You don't have a guy like -- you take Kell
or Pope off the floor, it's like taking Jaron off the floor for us. That's a
big piece you're missing. Kell is a good player. He was the First Team All
Season selection for a reason. He's a senior, he's a good player. He's made
big shots over the course of his career. You take him out of the lineup that's
a big piece. He had nine assists against Nevada. He's older, he's been through
the battles, he's played on good teams over there.  
  
We played him when he was a freshman to go to the NCAA tournament. You can't
put a price tag on that experience this time of year. And the urgency you have
to play with. Kudos to him, kudos to Pope, those guys are playing like seniors
down the stretch right now.  
  
My young players here are good young players, and they're going to have a
chance to gain valuable experience and hopefully be those type of guys as they
continue to get older as well.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Leon Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23356)

### [Justinian Jessup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34899)

### [Lexus Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34900)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 78, Boise State - 75  
  
LEON RICE: Well, thought Utah State did a great job of weathering some storms,
and started out really good. And they just kind of hung with us, hung with us,
and we couldn't break away from them. And they did a terrific job of making
some big shots down the stretch.  
  
Q. You just talked about this being a special group and you felt like
this was going to do special things. To have it end this way this early, what
are your thoughts?  
LEXUS WILLIAMS: My thoughts haven't changed. Still a special group. This isn't
our last game. Just trying to swallow this tough pill. But nothing about how
special this group is, it will always be that way.  
  
Q. What did go wrong tonight?  
LEXUS WILLIAMS: We just didn't get stops down the stretch like we needed to.
In the first half our defense was really good. In the second half they were
getting open looks and knocking them down like they were supposed to.  
  
Q. I know you kind of are the voice of reason sometimes to your team.
Was there a message that you shared after the game to encourage them to keep
their heads up?  
LEXUS WILLIAMS: Let them know we're not done playing. This one hurt us, but
we've still got a chance to compete in a tournament and that's what we look
forward to.  
  
Q. What did you see from their 3s, and from Merrill in particular? Was
it your defense? Were they just on fire? What did you see from them to make
that percentage from the three?  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: Yeah, I think it was part of both. Part of our defense. I
think we gave them some easy looks too much, and others he was hitting like
the last one, I thought it was a good contest, some others I thought were good
contest, too. Give credit to him, he made some tough shots.  
  
Q. You were able to get inside and force the ball inside in the first
half. I think you guys had 16 points in the paint in the first half. I don't
know if it was there in the second half. Did you notice it was there? Did they
do something to take that away from you or did you look somewhere else?  
LEXUS WILLIAMS: A lot of buckets in the first half were a lot in transition. I
don't think we ran enough in the second half. They hard hedge on ball screens.
It's tough when you coming off a ball screen and the big man comes out and you
try to get downhill.  
  
So I think it was a credit to them for making shots. We didn't even really
rebound that well in the second half. We didn't get a chance to get on a run
and make the transition buckets in the paint.  
  
Q. Is this hard for you guys to believe? You were up, they keep hitting
the shots. You had the lead. Just kind of like the previous question with your
guys, everything you thought this season was going to be, and even with this
game, is it hard to believe they came back and got you at the end?  
LEXUS WILLIAMS: It's a tough pill to swallow, it's frustrating. Credit to
them. They weathered a lot of storms during the game. They kept coming back
and coming back. They didn't lay down at all.  
  
Q. I know you think pretty highly of Chandler Hutchison and he had some
good looks. He's done a lot for this program. Deserving of those shots. And I
don't know if you had a moment to talk with him after the game, obviously some
big shots and tough misses.  
LEXUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I haven't talked to him. Those are the shots he is
supposed to take, and a lot of those are shots he makes. Tonight they just
didn't go down, and they're not going to go down every night.  
  
But just like I told him last time when we lost at Utah State, You did
everything you could do. And it's something that you have to live with, it was
a good shot.  
  
Q. We talked about it yesterday, but this team, you thought had the
makings to do some big things this year, and to have it end like that with a
barrage of 3s from Utah State and go down in the quarterfinals for the third
year in a row, how tough was that?  
LEON RICE: It was really tough. I thought we came out really good. Got in foul
trouble that we weathered and couldn't shake them. They hung with us, hung
with us. And made it -- we had a few big plays. We had a fast break to go up
ten, we miss the lay-in. There were plays like that all night that we just
didn't make that maybe could have put us over the top.  
  
It's a tough one for this locker room. Like I said, I've got a special group
that wanted to keep playing. And I thought, I really thought we were going to
do some great things down here. So it's a hard one to deal with.  
  
Q. Obviously you have seen Chandler develop tremendously since he's been
at Boise State. What was it like to watch him inside that final minute? Tough
missed free throw on the front end and a couple of chances after that, too.  
LEON RICE: Right. And as a coach you ride them for 30-something-odd games, and
he's won a lot of those for you. And so you feel like the team wanted to give
him those chances and he was right there. A couple of them just rolled in and
out. We made some tough defensive plays to get the ball back and another
chance, and just couldn't get it over the hump and a couple of crucial calls
down the stretch that made a difference.  
  
Q. I know it's not easy to talk about the positives tonight, but Lexus
Williams, he had a career high with 24 points and you've got to have him for 9
months now. How special was his joining the team this year?  
LEON RICE: All three of those seniors, I wanted it so bad for them, they
deserved it. They've done some great things. And I told them in the locker
room, it doesn't change how I feel about this team. They're all heartbroken.
We're all heartbroken. And wanted to keep this thing rolling.  
  
So that's the hardest part of only having those guys for the eight months you
get them because they're just awesome. You want them to go out with a big
bang.  
  
Q. I know that the 3s are what kind of scares you about Utah State. You
mentioned scoring in bunches. How do you feel defensively you did against
them?  
LEON RICE: Obviously not good enough with the way -- but part of it is them,
too. They're hard to guard. They put a lot of guards out there and spread you
out really well. Then you've got to make them, and they made some tough ones.
And when we contested a couple of them, then you foul. You're damned if you
do, damned if you don't. You want to contest them, want to be aggressive, but
you can't be fouling the 3-point shooters, as well. And there were a couple of
those that were tough.  
  
But we gave them some pretty good looks. And Merrill is going to make those.  
  
Q. What was it about this round that is just giving you guys trouble?  
LEON RICE: When you get to the conference tournament everybody is playing
good. And you've got to play really good. I think we played really good in
stretches and just down the stretch we didn't make enough winning plays to get
it done.  
  
Q. What is next for this team, NIT?  
LEON RICE: I have no idea.  
  
Q. The bigger picture is your success or lack thereof in this
tournament. And without you having a chance to decompress what happened
tonight, do you have any idea why you've had so much struggle of getting to
the championship game, of getting past the quarterfinals or semifinals?  
LEON RICE: Might be we overachieved during the season. Maybe you watch those
two teams, they're pretty darned close. And these guys played for three months
and finished second. So I don't think we roll in and out talent to everybody.
People just assume that, Oh, they're going to get to the championship and win
it.  
  
If you look player for player there's a lot of talent in this league. So maybe
it's a fact that we overachieve in the regular season, I don't know.  
  
But that team we played was really good. And their guards are really, really
good and they make shots and I knew that. So proud of what our guys do during
the season to compete for a championship and get second. It's disappointing,
though, because -- but you've got to play a great game, and you've got to play
great down the stretch and that's the difference, a couple of shots. And then
you feel completely different.  
  
Q. Just to get back to Hutch, I'm assuming he's got at least another
game in a Bronco uniform. How much has he kind of meant to this team?  
LEON RICE: He's been awesome this year. And he's carried us through a lot of
amazing performances that got it done for us a lot of nights. He just had a
few -- some of those bad luck rattle in, rattle outs.  
  
And then it's tough for a guy to get two fouls and sit the whole half. But we
were pretty -- had him at arm's length, you don't want him to pick up his
third and you're without him most of the second half. We felt like he would
get it going in the second half. It's hard to sit there that long and then
turn it back on.  
  
Q. Going back 30 years, you've only been here a short time of that, but
do you get a feeling that there's a ceiling over this program that you can't
bust through? You've had growth, I'm guessing you think it's frustrating slow
growth.  
LEON RICE: I don't know, I don't see that. I don't get that. We've been the
most consistent team in the league the last four years. We finished in the top
three the last four years. You're talking about San Diego State, UNLV, and New
Mexico. I don't understand where the slow growth is talking about.  
  
We went from the WAC to contending. We won the Mountain West. We contended for
a title four years. And so I don't get what -- I think it's ignorant to say
"slow growth." You're talking about a UNLV program that has won a national
championship, a national championship. You're talking about a San Diego State
team that's 18 straight years of being terrific, talented, toughest places to
play in this league.  
  
Slow growth is -- we're selling out Taco Bell Arena. We're 15-1 at home and on
and on and on. We're putting a guy in the draft this year.  
  
So "slow growth" may be the most ridiculous term I ever heard from anybody
about the basketball program and where we are. And you don't measure a program
by a three-day tournament. You measure it by how it does in the league every
year, because that's over the course of three months. And that's night in,
night out, for three months.  
  
One game, anything can happen in college basketball, unless you're by far the
most talented team. And that's not who we've been. We're not by far the most
talented team. We've got a bunch of tough kids that compete every night, that
battle and they're in every single game. You just didn't win the last four
minutes tonight.  
  
So that statement makes no sense.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Kendall Stephens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27911)

### [Jordan Caroline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32865)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 79, UNLV - 74  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought defensively we were pretty good the whole game. But
offensively in the first half the ball stuck. We didn't move it like we have
all year. I thought we did a great job again of taking care of the basketball
and not having turnovers and getting shots on goal.  
  
Eventually we talked about at halftime if we could just continue to have good
spacing and move the ball, we thought eventually our three ball would fall
down. And made an adjustment at one of the time outs against their zone where
we ran a double side pick and roll with some unusual spacing that we haven't
done all season long. And our guys did a good job adjusting to that set on the
fly. And we changed up a lot of things since our last regular season game. And
I thought our guys for the first time doing things, both offensively and
defensively, they did a great job.  
  
And the key tonight we kept talking about the rebounding. And I thought for us
to have one more shot attempt than them was really, really big, because UNLV
is such a great rebounding team offensively.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like at halftime? You guys were down 11 in the
same building against Fresno State last season, and came back and won by 11.
It was fairly similar.  
JORDAN CAROLINE: It was funny, when we were down I was just thinking about the
Fresno game last year, where we had to come out with a lot of energy to be
able to win it. And I think that's what we did. So I felt a lot reminiscent of
the Fresno game last year.  
  
Q. You were down 12 early in the second half and were able to come back,
and take a look pretty quickly.  
KENDALL STEPHENS: Throughout this whole season we've always been battle tested
so I feel like we weren't really new to it. We knew coming into it, it was a
tournament game, so it has a little different atmosphere as far as other teams
can play their best game. But at the same time, we have a lot of guys that
played a lot of big games in big moments. We handled it well.  
  
We kind of just got out of our game. Once we got back comfortable, shots
started to drop, we didn't foul as much. We started to get our identity back
and it was good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact Josh Hall had on the game tonight?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: It was crucial. Especially to start the second half, he was
really kick-started. He came in playing well. He was moving the ball. He was
finishing well. And he really helped to be a mismatch with our front court.  
  
KENDALL STEPHENS: It's amazing because you don't really understand how tough
it is to be in a role to where Josh has been up and down in his minutes, not
really consistent. And so for him to always have a good mindset coming in,
knowing to play hard and knowing his role, and doesn't play outside himself, I
think that's what winning teams need. And he's like a glue guy that we have.
And he was definitely a difference maker, and I think he was really the reason
why we won.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't know who you're going to play yet, but if you
play San Diego State, how badly do you want another crack at them after what
happened Saturday night?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I mean, they're a great team. I'll be happy to play either
one. They're both talented and tough teams. We have to be prepared for both.  
  
KENDALL STEPHENS: I'd like to play San Diego State, almost for revenge. But at
the same time we're going to be ready to play whoever. In tournament play
you've got to be ready to play, no matter who the matchup is.  
  
Q. You're known for your 3-point shooting, you did break the school
record in single season 3-pointers, five blocks for a career high, five
rebounds for a season high, two steals, took a charge. I guess talk a little
bit about your defensive game tonight and what you tried to provide on that
side of the court.  
KENDALL STEPHENS: It was the type of game we were in. It was the kind of game
where loose ball deflections, rebounds, everything mattered. I tried to do
what I can. And it just so happened I ended up having a decent stat line.
That's kind of the game. It was kind of a grind-out game so that's what it is.  
  
Q. The Martin twins have had great seasons, but a little bit off
tonight. What does it say about the team that two of your better players have
an off-game and you still come out and win a game like this?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: They're still crucial to our win. They played big in the
second half, especially defensively.  
  
It shows that the whole team can score. Josh came out and gave us 16. Kendall
went five of ten for three. It's not just one person you can take off the
floor offensively to stop us.  
  
Q. I assume you thought they would do different things when they came
out with the 2-3. How do you think they defended compared to last week, and
what you saw from them?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Obviously we watched -- I was sitting right behind you
yesterday, we watched the Air Force game. So they had their full quarter,
three-quarters court, 2-2-1, kind of a soft trap, tried to take time off the
clock, slow you down a little bit, and then fell back into the 2-3. And we
were discombobulated because of the fact that Cody got in foul trouble. And we
didn't move the ball like we're capable of and so I thought it played into
their hands.  
  
I thought Marvin did a great job of making an adjustment coming out with
something different. Although that is what they did yesterday almost
exclusively against Air Force.  
  
We were frustrated because shots weren't going. And like I said, we added
during time outs two different zone attacks. And it was really, really
effective for us when we ran the double-side pick and roll and spaced it out
with certain guys. And during time outs we would tell which guys to cut to
open areas. And I wish there was more time outs because we were scoring after
ATOs.  
  
But I thought Marvin did a great job of coming out and changing up what they
did from a week or two ago.  
  
Q. The benefits of your tough schedule, looking back, it's tougher than
I thought at the time, not just TCU, Texas Tech. The benefits of that as you
move through the season and some of these schools that might not want to be
challenged that much, what would you say to those schools to step up?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I don't want to speak for anybody but our program. I just
remember being in the Mountain West my first meeting, because I'm new to the
league, I'm still new to the league. And I couldn't understand why people were
playing Division II teams. And I was reminded in a tone that I could hear very
clearly that there's financial benefits. Because a couple of ADs spoke and
said, Hey, and a couple of coaches said, Well, it doesn't hurt you. And I'm
like, Well, I'm new, but we need things to help us, not that it doesn't hurt
you.  
  
And we spent a ton of time this summer looking at Radford's roster and looking
at these teams' rosters. We knew Davidson was going to be really, really good.
They had the 8-10 Larry Bird of their league coming back, and they had a
freshman that we knew was really, really good.  
  
And so for us, we wanted to challenge ourselves. We wanted to play as many
road games as we possibly could. For us to go to Hawaii is maybe the one game
that stands out because no one on our staff wanted to do it but me, nobody.
And at halftime of that game I thought I was crazy for doing it. To travel
that far and only play one game.  
  
But we have one more game than most programs in the country because that's an
exempt game going over there, because they need people to go there. And so I
think playing at Texas Tech really, really helped us to playing in an
environment like today. When we played at Boise, I thought the Texas Tech game
was really important for us.  
  
And you've got to schedule appropriately if you want to try to make the
tournament. Look, it's not easy in our conference to do that. We've got a game
tomorrow night we have to figure out how to win no matter who we play. Until
you see your name Sunday, like you're not in. And I keep telling the guys
every day that, my wife, my two sons, my daughter, We're not in, I don't want
to hear it. We've got to keep winning.  
  
But I think our non-conference schedule prepared us for games like today.  
  
Q. You guys were down 12 early in the second half and responded on a
22-6 run. What does it say about the toughness and character of your team that
you respond like you did?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think every game this year except maybe the TCU game is the
only game we didn't have a scoring spurt. And my junior in high school son
says it all the time, Dad, eventually you're going to go on a run. And our
runs have not been like 10-2 runs. They just haven't been that way this year,
we've within like 15-4 runs and 19-6 runs and a wider margin than a quick 6-0
run. And it's because we shoot so many 3s, and because we space the floor out.  
  
When we get defensive stops, when we get three or four consecutive defensive
stops sprinkled in with a couple of 3s, that's when we go on our scoring
spurts. But we didn't have one the first half.  
  
Q. Josh has been up and down all over the place this season. What did it
mean to see him step up in the game? Especially the first half.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah, Josh is so good at finding open gaps. And yesterday when
we practiced after watching UNLV play zone, we talked about playing cat and
mouse on the baseline and being a sneaky cutter. And he was our best sneaky
cutter tonight. And he has been, even dating back to, for whatever reason even
his freshman year, he was a guy that finds the open gaps, and you don't need
to call a play call for him. He was ready to play.  
  
Q. It was the best defense I saw Kendall play. Did that surprise you,
the impact he had?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: It didn't surprise us, it shocked us. For him to have five
blocks, somebody else might have blocked him. But he's got great length and he
used it today. And we backed off some guys that he was guarding and played
them for the dribble drive and they kept driving into him and he was there and
did a great job with his verticality.  
  
Q. Marcus Marshall set the 3-point record last year and Kendall Stephens
comes and gets that today. Your thoughts on how impressed you are with what
Kendall has done for your team this year.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: No. 1, we have to go back when I got the job and we were
literally the worst shooting basketball team between here and 6th grade CYO.
The first thing we had to do is get some shooters, like no matter what,
doesn't matter if a guy can't dribble, how tall, how short, we just had to get
some shooters. And obviously the focus recruiting-wise was to fill a gap that
we were so horrendous at.  
  
And we got two guys in Marcus and Kendall that can really shoot. And I told
the team in the locker room, like Kendall set a record for the least amount of
dribbles for a made 3-ball record. The guy has dribbled like nine times all
season long.  
  
Q. You were talking about the spurts and going on 22-4 runs, these huge
runs, because you have been able to do that, what has it done for the team's
confidence because you know that you can do that?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: At halftime they kept telling me that I was the one panicked
and not them. And they said, Well, all right, shots are going to start
falling. I think they really believed that. I think they're a confident group
and you can't be a ranked team for five straight weeks if you're not a really
confident team and you can overcome adversity.  
  
Having said that, tomorrow night, whoever we play is going to be a real
difficult challenge. It's not like we had the luxury of resting a lot of guys.
So it will be interesting from here on out.  
  
Q. The first half Mooring had 13, looked like he was on his way to the
game like he had in Reno. What did you do in the second half to rein him in?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: We put Cody Martin on him, and Cody was guarding the four man.
And not often you can put a four man and tell him to now guard a combo guard.
And we wanted to try to get more into shoot over an extended hand of a 6-7
player.  
  
And there's a reason that Cody is defensive player of the year. He understands
are spacing and he's really, really smart. And I thought he forced Mooring
into some really, really difficult shots, especially late in the game.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Marvin Menzies](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20785)

### [Shakur Juiston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34882)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 79, UNLV - 74  
  
MARVIN MENZIES: Well, congratulations to Eric. He's done a fantastic job in a
short amount of time with the paradigm that he's selected to go to, which is
transfers. And he's been successful with it.  
  
So I want to congratulate him and those guys for getting a win against my guys
that were really ready to play today, very feisty.  
  
I thought we took the fight to them, especially in the first half. And we did
some really good things to put ourselves in a position to win the game down
the stretch. Unfortunately they got hot from the three. And a lot of those
were contested shots, which good teams make.  
  
I'll leave it there and go ahead and open it up.  
  
Q. You said a couple of games ago when teams hit tough shots that it can
be deflating. Did you feel like you got deflated in that second half?  
SHAKUR JUISTON: No. In this case tonight I don't think any of us felt that
way. They're honestly a great shooting team when they're hot and when their
feet set. Tonight it was just like they're going to make some. But we can't
hang our heads, we've got to go down there and capitalize on offense and just
pound them aside, get our scores the way we need and then come back and try to
make them shoot tough 3s again.  
  
Q. JoJo said after the last game that it doesn't really come down to Xs
and Os when you play them. Did they do anything this meeting from the first
two meetings?  
SHAKUR JUISTON: No, they just played the way they play. I believe we did
things different from the second meeting than this time. We played with more
heart. We played more with a chip on our shoulder. We wanted to come out and
play for the fans, the coaches and the two seniors that we had. So we gave it
all we had.  
  
Sadly it didn't come out the way we wanted to, but I felt as though we didn't
leave nothing. We didn't second-guess or second chance anything we tried to do
tonight, we just played hard. And everything is out there on the Mountain West
floor.  
  
Q. Last three weeks you've often said that the group's been discouraged.
Did something competitively click today that made you compete with one of the
best teams in the west and definitely the country?  
SHAKUR JUISTON: I wouldn't say "discouraged"; we were just all question marks.
We were trying to figure out what was going wrong and how our season was going
downhill from when we were playing good basketball. I just felt when we got
the win yesterday afternoon it was just like, All right, we've got our groove
back on, we're still in the winning spirit.  
  
So today we just carried over and played with all the energy and heart that we
had stored. And like I said, sadly it didn't come out the way we wanted to,
but I believe we played hard.  
  
Q. The only other question I have is about the player Kris Clyburn, he
started earlier in the year, and went to a reserve position. Can you talk
about the excitement and energy you got from him tonight.  
SHAKUR JUISTON: Kris is a great player, even better person. That's what coach
recruited, he recruited personalities; and then if you've got talent, that's
even better.  
  
From him going to playing a lot last year and starting this year and then not
starting, he could have easily went to a bubble and had anger issues or could
have felt bad for himself. But he was in the gym. He was working on his game.
He felt as though one day his time was going to come. And tonight it showed
that he just stay poised. He kept hoping that one day he was going to come out
and make the shots that he usually made and did the things that he usually
did.  
  
Q. On the three that Jovan took at the end, what were you looking to get
out of that?  
MARVIN MENZIES: What was I looking to get out of it? A make? I don't know if
you remember, I called that timeout with like nine minutes or eight minutes or
whatever it was left in the game. Maybe not that much, but it was kind of
late. But it was my last one. And I messed up.  
  
I looked at the scoreboard, my own scoreboard, and I saw a 2. And I think it
was team fouls or something, I don't know what it was. But after I took -- so
I called it real quick. Then after I took it the assistant said, That was our
last one. What do you mean that was our last one? So I had a little slip
there. I think I could have scripted that better at the end.  
  
Cody was really good defensively the second half. And they didn't know the
play was coming, but he guarded it really well. And off the baseline he
trailed up, and he's just so long, he's got a good defensive position on JoJo.
And he knows JoJo could shoot it deep. So he went all the way out there and he
did a good job.  
  
The thing that I would have probably, in retrospect, 20-some seconds left, we
would have taken a quick two there, as well, but we didn't have an
opportunity. So I just put the options in to either go into low post or the
mid post off of that particular play. Neither one of those was there, they
guarded them pretty well. I wanted to make it, but unfortunately it didn't
come out.  
  
Q. I would assume in your mind you kind of have an idea what your roster
will look like next year, who's coming and who's going. If you had to say now
overall how to get better defensively, what is it that you want to change from
here to then?  
MARVIN MENZIES: Well, consistency. I thought that we played pretty well
defensively tonight, especially in the first half. So it's just the
experience. They just need experience. They need to have failures before they
have success. It's a part of any business, any corporation, any sport.
Failures are a part of growing and growth.  
  
So having gone through this as many years as I have now, I'm really proud of
the guys, really proud of them. I thought that they laid it all on the line
and did all the things that were necessary in the first half. Unfortunately,
the second half we had some breakdowns against a really good team, they
capitalize on breakdowns.  
  
Kendall was -- he might be one of the best 3-point shooters I've gone against,
coached against. He's lights out. If he gets a look, you're like, Dang it, he
got a look, because it's going to go down. He's a talented player.  
  
I think that's one of the things, though, specifically is taking care of the
three-point line, and defending the three-point line better. There's some
technical things we can do. And you've got athletes and players that can get
out there and do that. So we'll continue to teach and learn from that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the last game that some of the turnovers were fatigue
based. Is it safe to say that some of the turnovers in this game were a factor
of moving too fast at certain moments?  
MARVIN MENZIES: To be honest with you, I don't know, I'd have to look and see.
I thought some were trying to feed the post. Shakur had one when he had a long
rebound, he tried to throw it to Kris Clyburn and Kris stumbled. We had some
missed cues that I don't think were forced as -- they played well defensively,
don't get me wrong, they played smart. But at the end of the day, we could
have curtailed them. We ended up with 14 and we wanted to have 12 or less.  
  
Q. You guys seemed to have a difference in the energy and momentum
compared to last week what was getting you going tonight?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I think Shakur alluded to it, sometimes you have to get the
monkey off your back, against a feisty Air Force team, it shook them and
reminded them when we play together and do the right thing. Getting the win,
No. 1.  
  
And then the last loss we know we didn't have our best foot forward so that's
always disappointing. And I think any competitor will take that opportunity,
the next opportunity to prove that they're a better team than they showed. So
I was happy to see that.  
  
Q. Jordie picked up his fourth foul early in the second half. How did
that change the complexion of the game, and what you wanted to do in the final
15 minutes or so?  
MARVIN MENZIES: Obviously that was really challenging, because I had Jordie
and JoJo in foul trouble. Both were four, I think, for a large stretch of the
game. And I think they got on their heels a little bit not wanting to get that
foul.  
  
You can't take it with you, you still have to play solid defense, you just
can't gamble. We lost the full-court pressure we applied in the first half. It
hurt us a little bit. Fouls are part of the game.  
  
Q. Their decision to put Cody on JoJo in the second half, just how
crucial do you think that was?  
MARVIN MENZIES: Well, I'd have to really break down the film to know that for
sure. How many shots did JoJo take with him on him specifically and how many
did he influence and so forth. I don't want to speculate and say it was this.
I just want to be truthful, and I don't know that I could answer that right
now.  
  
Q. Do you expect Brandon to be back next year?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I haven't talked to him yet. We just lost. We weren't going to
have that conversation today, for sure. We literally haven't discussed it at
all. I have no idea. It will be a family decision on their part.  
  
We'll do some research and background from feedback that we get and we'll make
a decision -- the family will make a decision on whether they want to test the
waters, return or whatever that is. But I'll let you guys know as soon as I
know.  
  
Q. You talked about youth all year and young guys and learning and
everything, and I understand in the past the sort of decision-making when it
comes into tournaments other than NIT. But if you have so many young guys, why
would you not play another tournament if you were offered a bid in the next
few days?  
MARVIN MENZIES: It's a decision that's made by a lot of people. It's not, Hey,
I want to go play in this. It's a collective decision.  
  
So I would have to -- we would have to sit with my administration and my
bosses and decide. I don't particularly have those -- to be candid, I don't
have the zeal to play in those tournaments for a host of reasons. But just
depends on the team, the youth of your team and different scenarios, finances
involved, there's a lot of things involved, the state of mind of your guys,
the seniors, there's a lot that goes into it. So it's never just a cut-and-
dried deal.  
  
But as of right now I don't believe that's our intention.  
  
Q. I remember after the one-point lost against the Lobos a few weeks
ago, you said, It was good to see them fight back when we got down. What can
you say about the effort you guys displayed on the court tonight?  
MARVIN MENZIES: Overall I thought our team battled. I thought we took the
fight to them. I thought we played hard. I thought we gave it a great effort.
So I'm proud of these guys to do what we've done and put nine new faces
together and go out and fight and compete like this.  
  
It doesn't feel good after a loss. But I think after some time and you get to
reflect a bit we'll see that we moved the needle in a positive direction.  
  
So just proud of my guys. Proud of their fight. And you can't take anything
away from UNR, they had an excellent second half, shot the ball lights out.
Eric made some pretty good adjustments against the zone. I thought they got
good looks in posting up the guards. Then we tweaked it, then we got some
stops. It was a pretty close game all the way to the end.  
  
Q. You guys have faced Nevada more than anyone else this year. How good
do you think they are? Do you think they could win a couple of games?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I do, I think they're second weekend capability, for sure.
They've got to stay health. If they stay healthy, they make the shots from the
perimeter like they do, they're a tough out. And I definitely don't know who's
going to go from our conference but I think we'll be represented pretty well
by whoever that is.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Allen EdwardsI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34839)

### [Alan Herndon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30485)

### [Hayden Dalton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32800)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 85, Wyoming - 75  
  
ALLEN EDWARDS: First of all, obviously commend Coach Weir and New Mexico for
the job they did tonight. Obviously wish them luck going forward.  
  
I thought it was a hard-fought game. I thought both teams came out and played
with extreme energy. Both teams had some highs and lows throughout the game.
At the end of the day one team has to win and one team has to lose. We ended
up coming out on the wrong end of it.  
  
But love our guys and I thought they gave it all we had.  
  
Q. The last time you played in New Mexico they dictated the style, being
really up-tempo, high-scoring game. It seemed like this time around you did a
better job of keeping the pace of play where you would want it. Do you feel
that was the case, that you guys played a little more your style tonight?  
HAYDEN DALTON: Yeah, definitely. That was more of our game plan was to smartly
attack. I think we turned it over a little too much still, but I think we did
a better job, like you said, attacking them smart and knowing when to pull it
out and when not to.  
  
Q. You and J.J., two leading scorers, they kind of held you in check as
far as shooting the ball. Did they attack you differently or what did they do
to prevent you and J.J. from shooting the ball well tonight?  
HAYDEN DALTON: I mean, their whole team is all about pressure. No easy
catches. We weren't getting clean looks off, and they kind of just rushed us a
little bit.  
  
Q. Coach felt maybe you tried to do a little too much, tried to force
some shots that weren't there. Do you feel like later in the second half that
happened kind of again?  
HAYDEN DALTON: I have no comment on that.  
  
ALAN HERNDON: I can say we want him to take those shots, whether we're going
in or not, he's taking those shots all year. We're confident in him taking
those shots. Those shots he normally makes, they just weren't falling tonight.  
  
Q. Last time you played them you weren't playing a lot. How tough was
that for you to watch as a defensive guy and getting out there? How eager were
you to get another shot at this team?  
ALAN HERNDON: I was very eager. Last game I was dealing with some sickness,
and just had to sit there and just watch that score, it kind of hurt a little
bit. I just wanted to make sure I just went out there and just be more
effective. Wasn't that great in the first half, didn't contribute any
rebounding, was able to pick it up a little bit in the second half. That first
half dictates a lot.  
  
So it did hurt.  
  
Q. Was it just the way they were playing you or what worked for you?  
ALAN HERNDON: Coach always says all year, just attack. I can create a lot of
mismatches with what I can do. So I was just taking what the defense was
giving me, and making sure I was constantly -- my teammates were hitting me in
great positions, and I had an attack mentality. Sometimes it's the win or go
home that can do it for you.  
  
Q. A lot of good things, but doesn't look like there will be any
postseason. Can you put into words what this season has been like for you guys
as seniors and what you guys were able to accomplish.  
ALAN HERNDON: It's been a crazy year. And not even this year, just that's how
it's been here at Wyoming with these guys. It became a brotherhood and
something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. They meant a lot to myself.
Me, myself and H, I don't know how many college coaches looked at us and
thought we could become what we are today. This man to our right took a chance
on us, believed in us and gave us the keys and told us to go out and do what
you do best. And we have to thank him so much for that, I really cherish that.  
  
Q. Is this a tough matchup for you guys, because you like to play sort
of up-tempo but you have to rein that in and not play their up-tempo? Was it
hard to find the balance?  
HAYDEN DALTON: Yeah, a little bit. Like you asked before, I think we did a
better job this game, and I think this game it kind of came down to more on
the defensive end, doing more what we needed to do. We didn't get done what we
needed to do on the defensive end tonight. But I think we did a lot better job
controlling the pace this game.  
  
Q. What makes New Mexico so effective at what they do; coach, players?
What do they do that works?  
ALAN HERNDON: They just have a deep rotation. They bring a lot of guys in, and
with that pressure you kind of have to, the next sub coming in brings that
energy, brings that same pressure. They have a lot of guys that can come in
and do that same thing. You just have to prepare for that and just play your
game and try not to let them speed you up.  
  
I think this game we were a little bit better in the sense of turnovers, I
think before we had 20 or something, this time we took care of it better. It
was the rebounding and when we needed the stop that really hurt us.  
  
Q. You look back on your career, what are you going to think about
first?  
HAYDEN DALTON: I'm just very thankful, like Alan said, that I had the
opportunity to play here. Because I went the junior college route and they
took a chance on me. Just that I was able to play and step on the court and
put on the Wyoming jersey, just very thankful.  
  
Q. What does it feel like to look in the stands and see that gold and
brown filling the arena? You had more fans than just about anybody.  
ALAN HERNDON: It means a lot. It really felt like a home game, really, for
both teams. I think the fans really showed up for each team. But that brown
and gold really means a lot when you have Wyoming across your chest. It's a
sense of pride. And all the fans let us feel that.  
  
Unfortunately we were on the wrong end of that. But we thank them for coming
out and supporting us through the season.  
  
Q. You felt like getting into the title game is what you needed résumé-
wise to get to the NIT. Is that kind of what you needed to accomplish this
tournament?  
ALAN HERNDON: Even without -- say we would have won more games or anything
like that, our goal is to compete for championships. That's the culture we try
to cultivate here. We definitely had that on our mind, just go out there and
just compete and play our hardest. And just give ourselves a chance.  
  
Unfortunately that didn't happen. But that's just how it goes one time.
There's a winner and a loser.  
  
Q. You were able to get it, I think it was from 3 down the stretch, and
the last two or three minutes you weren't able to get a basket. Was it good
defense on their part, shots not falling, any observations there?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Probably missed opportunities. I think when we cut it to three
we were at the free throw line, missed I think it might have been the front
end of a one on one. Came down, got another stop, I think, and then took a
rushed three.  
  
We had our chances to put ourselves in position to win the basketball game. We
just didn't overcome that hump, so to speak, and put ourselves in position to
close out the game. But, yeah, you have to give them credit for staying the
course, with their game plan, as well.  
  
Q. The pace was maybe more what you wanted tonight. Is it tough
sometimes to have a loss where it seemed like you guys did do some good things
tonight? Is it tough when you do that and it still doesn't push you over that
hump?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: No, like I told them after the game, this will be like any
other game, we'll go back and watch film, and say if we did this better we'd
be in a better situation.  
  
In the first half they did a tremendous job on the offensive glass, they had
ten at halftime and we had nine total. We did a better job the second half
rebounding the basketball. But you go on with the game plan, and you go out
there, execute it to the best of your ability. And whether you win or lose,
you just got to stay committed to it, and I thought we did that.  
  
Q. I know that Coach Weir said with Justin, he put like three guys on
him during times. He struggled shooting the ball. Anything you noticed there,
anything against Justin defensively, and what about Hayden's shooting?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: No, what I think they do, obviously, when you don't have the
ball, make it tough to catch it. And like I told our guys, you've got to want
the basketball. You're not just going to cut and get open. And I thought the
way J.J. -- even when he broke to get the basketball, like any other player,
when you don't see it go in a few times your mojo ain't the same. Obviously
like it was yesterday. And I thought he was trying to play too much east-west
rather than north-south, after taking on a ball screen, which they switched.
But still the really good player just didn't have a great night.  
  
Q. I know the first game you talked about wanting to go into the first
four minutes being strong, and tonight they jump out to a 13-point lead. What
was different tonight?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Offensive rebounds. The offensive rebound hurt us, even within
calling a timeout early just to get our guys back refocused. It was about
being on the glass. And we found a way to obviously cut it going into
halftime. Cody came out at the half and I think he had a big three to cut it
to two or one. We had our opportunities.  
  
Q. If this is the end of the season, with this big senior class, what do
you feel is the impact they've had on this program?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Well, I told the underclassmen in there, they should go around
and thank those four guys for what they've done for this program. H, Al, Lou,
and Alex has done a lot in the sense of helping this program and helping the
last two years with me as a head coach and our culture and what we're trying
to do going forward. Those guys have made a big impression on it.  
  
And as we go forward guys coming into the program and guys that are returning
can look back on what these past two teams have done.  
  
Q. I know there will be time for reflection later, but there probably
won't be postseason for this team. How would you assess how this season went
and what the future looks like for the program?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: What I always try to do within even the game, I always try to
find what happened over the season. And like I told those guys, in the past 16
years there's only been two teams that have competed in the conference play
and came out with more wins and losses, and that's this team and the team that
won in '15.  
  
So when you look at the tradition of the program, in the last 16 years you're
saying, well, you were one of those two teams, I think that's a lot to speak
about. Because it is a tough conference, top to bottom. And putting yourself
in position to win 20 games with one of the toughest schedules that we've had
in the last 16 years. But all that was playing, and to me you put your better
foot forward. And I thought our guys did a great job, it just didn't turn out
the way we would have liked it to turn out.  
  
Q. Part of what they're trying to do both offensively and defensively is
get you guys in a frantic, almost panicked mode. You called two timeouts
early, one in three minutes and you score right out of the timeout, Alan gets
a dunk, you call another timeout after nine minutes and Alan dunked after the
timeout. After halftime you guys are executing. When you were setting things
up it seemed like you were executing, but as longer between stoppages and
play, the turnovers seemed to happen. Is that something maybe UNM was doing or
just some mental lapses on your team's part tonight?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: You've got to give them credit for their style of play at the
end of the day, because that's what they do. To be honest with you, if I was
to look at the stat sheet without playing, I would say we would lose the game,
because there were only 14 fouls called. But they are a team that plays
aggressive, they aren't going to call it all. I can complain as much as I want
to to the officials about reaching and grabbing, but at the end of the day it
doesn't matter.  
  
So care less about whether they call them, have our guys fight through and
play the game of basketball, execute. But like you said, even within going
back and forth, you can easily get caught up in what they're trying to do.  
  
When we were at our best is when we was poised and just played confidently,
rather than -- what I mean by that, like after H missed the free throws to cut
it to maybe 1, we get another stop. We come down. The ball is bouncing around.
It bounces to J.J., it dribbles and he picks it up and shoots a 3. Like that
to me is you're playing their way, rather than picking that up and saying,
okay, get my guys into something or move the basketball so we can get
something better.  
  
So you can get caught up in that style of play, but, again, give Coach Weir
credit and the program. Because obviously he's done a tremendous job in year
one with these guys.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Brian Dutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33374)

### [Malik Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28635)

### [Matt Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34889)

### [Trey Kell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27926)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 64, Fresno State - 52  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: First of all, I think the Aztec fans travel. What a great
turnout for us today. If history is any indicator, we'll have double that at
tomorrow's game. And they're important to our success. We want to thank them
for traveling and supporting the Aztecs.  
  
I think we saw the improvement is we're better defensively. We're harder to
score on. We look like Aztec teams of old, where we can struggle through an
offensive period or two because our defense is so strong. And that has kind of
spearheaded our 7-game streak right now. And we have to continue to defend if
we want to advance in this tournament.  
  
Defending the three was a big part of the game. I think they only had three
3s, we only had three 3s. It was old-fashioned basketball, it was slug it out,
nothing easy, two opponents that knew each other well, and both played well.  
  
We actually hit a spurt where we came away with a victory. So proud of both my
seniors. When I took this job I told them I could think of two better seniors
that I want by my side than these two with me, Malik and Trey, and I told them
that when I was named many months ago. And they've been the key to everything
for us and me to be able to rely on them on the floor over this last season.
And I just want to tell them how appreciative I am of them. Along with the
freshman Matt Mitchell, who he's learning from the seniors, I hope.  
  
So with that I'll take any questions.  
  
Q. They had a stretch there where they didn't score for six minutes,
they had five straight turnovers. What's that like on defense when you're just
getting stop after stop? Can you sense their frustration or does it energize
you to get those stops?  
TREY KELL: A little bit. I feel like the main thing you feel is the offense
starts to press. And with them I felt like they tried to -- during those times
they just try to give it to one of their better players and go one-on-one.
That's something we worked a lot on where we don't allow anyone to go one-on-
one against us. It's a team effort.  
  
So they made some tough shots. But at the same time, I feel like we did a good
job of playing one-on-one defense, but at the same time having the help side
ready and making plays.  
  
Q. Matt, you took two charges, talk about taking the charges, and Tim
Shelton is sort of the master of that. What did you see on those plays and how
important was that to you?  
MATT MITCHELL: I just saw an opportunity to take a sacrifice for the team, and
really just create more opportunities offensively, less for them, for us on
the defensive end. So really, it's just an opportunity to sacrifice my body
for the team and help out in any way that I can.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I had that on the board defensively, who is going to take the
first charge? I asked that question in the locker room and had four or five
guys raise their hand. We're not the shot-blocking team we've been in the
past. But we have to stop the ball somehow in the paint, and we've done a good
job over the last two or three weeks of sacrificing our bodies and throwing
them out there and taking charges to let teams know that it's not a free path
to the rim whenever they want.  
  
Q. It seemed like you got the ball early a lot and were doubling a lot.
Was that part of the game plan to establish that inside game with you?  
MALIK POPE: From the early get-go, yeah, just to put a little pressure on the
defense and see how they react. And luckily I was able to make good plays.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Both Trey and Malik do the right things. If they draw a double
team, they move the ball. If they play one-on-one, they're both capable of
scoring. There's great comfort as a coach to put the ball in their hands and
know the right thing is going to happen.  
  
Q. This is your 11th straight win in a quarterfinal in the Mountain West
Tournament. Were you aware of that streak and why is this team so good in
these games?  
TREY KELL: I had no clue about that streak. I just feel like we lock in really
well in the first game and we don't take any game for granted, no matter who
the opponent is. Tonight we played a really good Fresno team. And there was
some added motivation knowing we haven't beat them yet this year, especially
the last time we played them the way we lost. So I think we just, like I said,
we don't take anything for granted.  
  
Q. San Diego State has been known for how great they played defensively
the last several seasons. This season you started off and you didn't seem to
have that defensive prowess. What is it that turned on in the second half of
the conference season that you guys have really started showing up
defensively?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I think the two main things. We've been anchored by shot
blockers for a lot of years. We had Skylar Spencer who was the all-time shot
block leader in this conference; Angelo Chol; we had Valentine Izundu last
year to block a lot of shots. And we didn't have a shot blocker. We moved
Malik in the post this year. He usually has played stretch four out in the
perimeter. It took him a while to provide the help he needed to provide; ball
screen help, helping up early, baseline drive, shutting that down. And so as
Malik has continued to grow his game defensively, we've gotten better.  
  
And added to that, we didn't take a lot of charges early. So we've made an
emphasis that if we're not going to block shots, we have to take charges. And
over this last win streak we've taken quite a few. We had a few we tried to
take today that were blocked, but at least we're thinking that way, we're
throwing our bodies out there and trying to protect the paint area. And we've
done a lot of better job of that over the last seven games.  
  
Q. What was your sort of take from the sidelines watching that stretch
where they didn't score a basket for six minutes and kept turning the ball
over?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: You know, it's like anything, when you slide behind a little
bit you have a tendency to press, and that's us, any team in the country. You
keep looking at the clock and seeing you're just a tad behind. And they have
really good players. So they tried to press their game a little bit, which
they should have done. And they had a couple that wouldn't go in for them.
They got quality looks that didn't go in.  
  
To our credit, we didn't give them a lot of second shots. I thought we did a
pretty good job on the glass in the second half, we held them to one shot
pretty much every possession down the stretch.  
  
Q. So you get Nevada now. How hard is it to have to beat a team that
good, ranked team that quality, twice in six days?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: They're a fantastic team. We can all see that. What they've
done with their body of work this year. And it's going to be a real challenge.
But having just played them less than a week ago, the game prep is pretty much
the same for both teams, I'd imagine. There will be a tweak here or there, but
in playing in 24 hours, there's not a lot each team is going to do. We are who
we are.  
  
We'll come out and try to defend them at a high level and limit their three-
point looks, like we did tonight. And then hopefully do a little better job on
Caroline. He was sensational against us the last game. He had 29 and was a
dominant player in the game.  
  
The Martins are good, Caroline is good, Stephens shoots the ball. They've got
a lot of talent. They're shorthanded without Lindsey Drew. But what they have
is good enough to win this tournament and what we have is good enough. I think
it's going to be a real battle tomorrow.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2018

  

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Sam Merrill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34901)

### [Koby McEwen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32795)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 78, Boise State - 75  
  
TIM DURYEA: Proud of our guys. Didn't get off to a great start. I thought
Boise State was tremendous to start the game and was sharp as a tack. And we
kind of came to our senses.  
  
We weren't very good defensively. I thought offensively we did a lot of good
things and got a lot of good shots. Sam made a big three before the half to
give us a little momentum going into the locker room and came out the second
half, got a bucket the first possession. And then it was just back and forth.  
  
But proud of our guys for hanging in there, staying together. And Boise State
is tough. They are hard to guard. And probably the most effective zone that
we've seen this year.  
  
I thought the one area where we were as bad as I've seen us is in our press
breaker. Usually we do a fairly good job handling the press, but boy, we were
shaky tonight.  
  
So it's good to get past that one and not play your best and come away with a
win. So proud of these guys.  
  
Q. Can you talk about you had a slow start yesterday but really you
turned it around today. What was the big difference for you?  
SAM MERRILL: Like you say, I didn't shoot the ball very well yesterday but I'm
confident in the work that I've put in and I knew I had to play better today
for us to be able to win. I missed a few in and out in the first half. So
fortunately they were able to fall in the second half and throughout the game
and we were able to get the win.  
  
Q. In both games you guys have had big games, Sam, you had a big game
tonight and Koby had a big game the last game. What's it like for sophomores
to be playing such great basketball on such a big stage?  
KOBY McEWEN: Like Sam said, we put in a lot of work in the off season, and we
trust the work that we put in and it's showing in the tournament. The best
players have to play the best when it comes to surviving the event. I thought
Sam did a tremendous job today scoring the ball and defending well.  
  
Just going back to the work we put in in the off season.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about that stretch where you scored ten
straight points and the big three that ended up being the game winner.  
SAM MERRILL: I didn't know I scored ten straight in a row.  
  
Koby does a great job of finding me when he feels like I am making shots, and
I try to do the same with him when he's hot. So we feed off each other well.  
  
That last shot, I've taken that shot a million times, made it quite a few
times. We hadn't run it yet all game so I had a feeling it would be open. And
it came up and shot it confidently.  
  
Q. In the first half you were two of seven. What did you need to do to
stay in your game and find a rhythm there late?  
KOBY McEWEN: Yeah, in the first half I was getting good looks and a lot of
them were going in and out as well. But it's survive and advance, I knew that
I had to keep shooting. I was getting good looks. The second half, I had to be
more aggressive getting in the paint. Try to free up myself by getting guys
open shots. Once they start hitting shots the lane started to open up for me.
So I had to just stick with it. And it worked out for us.  
  
Q. You grew up watching this game. You dream about being a part of this
stuff and here you are as a sophomore, one of our local boys doing it now for
real. How exciting is it?  
SAM MERRILL: It's exciting. It's only the quarterfinals. We just talked about
it as a team, this is an opportunity to move on to the semifinals, and I
didn't grow up wanting to win quarterfinal games. I grew up wanting to play in
the tournament. We're one step closer and we have to bring it tomorrow.  
  
Q. Boise State starts that game just shooting lights out. You cut the
deficit several times and they extend it out a couple of times. How were you
able to keep composure throughout all that? Looked like Boise State might kind
of run away with it.  
KOBY McEWEN: It just started off with stops, one possession at a time. Once we
did that we kind of brought the game down, get one stop, get a bucket and get
another stop. Once we broke the game down like that the game started to slow
down for us and we slowly caught back up. Once we got the game in arm's
length, we were really confident that we could win the game, and that's what
we did.  
  
Q. What did coach say to you about getting to the free throw line at the
halftime? You go to it 18 times in the second half.  
SAM MERRILL: We just had to continue to be aggressive. They fouled us on,
what, two or three 3s, maybe two. But I don't think offensively there was any
different level of aggression from half to half. But we were able to channel
our aggression better and play smarter, and that's why we were able to shoot
all those free throws.  
  
Q. Both games you have been down at the half and have outscored your
opponents by double digits in the second half. What has it been that you've
been able to outscore your opponents in the second half?  
KOBY McEWEN: Both games we were getting good shots, they weren't just falling.
The second half they just happened to fall. But in both games, the first half
we weren't defending. Once we got defensive confidence and our offense started
to flow, we got in the paint and easy buckets. Then the basket started opening
up for us and then we stepped out and made our 3s.  
  
And that's what we've got to do to start the game. We've got to start inside
out. Like coach says, you have to play accordion basketball, go in and out, in
and out. And that's what we did in both games in the second half. And we've
got to do that in the first half. If we do that we'll be in good shape.  
  
Q. The last 24 seconds it was like three turnovers. That was kind of
crazy. What was the range of emotions going on?  
SAM MERRILL: I was disappointed, I told the coaches that I wanted to take the
ball out to secure inbounds, then I go and turn it over. That was frustrating.  
  
We were able to get the ball back and then they had the jump ball. And then
Koby gets a free throw. And our coaches did a really good job of keeping us
calm and knew that we had the lead. All we had to do was buckle down and get a
stop and fortunately we were able to.  
  
Q. You said best players need to play their best. But obviously that
wasn't the case on the Boise side. Chandler looked like he was pretty
uncomfortable, had a rough game. What did you do to disrupt him a little
bit?  
KOBY McEWEN: We played his drive first. We knew that he wasn't a great 3-point
shooter. He could hit a couple. So we played to his weaknesses, try to force
him to his left hand a little bit. And when he got into the paint we started
crowding him a little bit, take away his space. And that's what made him
uncomfortable. He had to finish over hands and make tough shots. If he made
tough shots we'll go back down and shake his hand, that's a good shot.  
  
He had to finish over our hand and during the game he didn't make a lot of
those baskets and we had to defend him without fouling. And when we did that
we were successful.  
  
Q. Did you guys notice the Wyoming fans and the New Mexico fans up there
to cheer you guys to beat Boise State?  
KOBY McEWEN: We know why they were doing that. They don't want to see us.
That's okay.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Sam and Koby, in both games you guys have been
down at the half. What has been the main difference between the first half and
the second half so far in this tournament?  
TIM DURYEA: We usually talk about both sides of the ball before the game, at
halftime, a couple of things on each side. We did not talk offense before the
game. We didn't talk offense at halftime. The question about what I told them
to get to the free throw line, we did not discuss offense; we discussed
defense or lack thereof in the first half and how that had to change.  
  
And a couple of adjustments on the defensive side that I thought helped us in
the second half. And then at this level I think there's very few teams that
not making shots doesn't affect your defense. Most teams, if you're not making
shots or getting hard shots, if you're not scoring, period, it affects you on
the other end. And I thought that happened a little bit in the first half. I
thought we jumped out to a little bit better start in the second half and that
bled over to the defensive side of it. And we just made a few more plays.  
  
And then we gave up some easy shots, too. I think we can play better
defensively than we did. Obviously they missed some shots in the second half
that a lot of times they made.  
  
But this game for us was all about defense. The defensive mentality. We talked
a lot about the first six seconds and the last six seconds of the shot clock,
transition defense against them is huge. If you don't get back, you have no
chance to win. And then they are the best rebounding team in the league. So
the last six seconds of the possession you have to handle your business and
get physical and block out and we did just enough of that.  
  
Q. What was it like for you to live through those last 24 seconds?  
TIM DURYEA: I was in disbelief at how bad we were against the press. We just
haven't been that bad. It was not like it was an all-out full-court press. But
we were shooting ourselves in the foot right and left. And Sam came over in
the last -- and he's as dependable as they come, and he said, Let me throw the
ball in. He plays that spot every now and then. So we made a switch and he
turned it over. This is Sam Merrill for you. Look who got the steal after he
turned it over. He's the same guy that made the defensive play that got us the
ball back. That's Sam Merrill.  
  
Q. Obviously there was a couple of plays in the game where you really
needed a stabilizing force. I think Julion Pearre was that. How big is it to
have him back from injury?  
TIM DURYEA: He has been a real shot in the arm for us. And we were talking as
a staff, if you look back every year of his career he's shot the ball really
well in this tournament his whole career. And like we talked about yesterday,
Julion had a nightmare senior year because of injuries. And it is awesome to
see him back.  
  
You always want your seniors to have a role, to be able to contribute, to go
out on a high note. And I was afraid for Julion and Alex that that may not
happen this year, but towards the end of the year they've been really key for
us.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sam already a little bit, but about the way he carried
you at points, and he hit the big three at the end.  
TIM DURYEA: Yeah, and Sam is a little deceiving with the ball. He's a little
bit better driver of the ball and finishes around the rim probably better than
what most people think. He's not just a catch-and-shoot player. He has a good
midrange game, he can finish at the rim, and obviously he's deadly at three.  
  
I thought he had good looks the first half. And we had some shots go in and
out. But we had the big possession there at the end of the game and there was
no doubt where we were going with the ball. We were going to put the ball in
his hands and get a shot there on the play we run or have him turn the corner
and drive it and make a play.  
  
Q. It was a really rough ending to the regular season, with a four-game
losing streak. A lot of fans were not expecting this kind of a run. UNLV, came
back against Colorado State yesterday and obviously today the win against
Boise State. Can you speak a little bit on how proud of your players for being
able to make the turnaround from the low point two weeks ago and be able to
get to the semis for the first time in school history?  
TIM DURYEA: Yeah, we had a rough last couple of weeks of the season for
different reasons. And I could tell when I came in Monday after the UNLV game
when we had two days to prepare for the tournament, they were in a great frame
of mind. Are they done? Are they counting the days? Are they sick of each
other or is there another feeling in the room? And I just felt like they were
not done. They wanted to play.  
  
I've said this a lot of times: They really, really like each other. And those
two guys right there enjoy playing with each other a lot and they have the
utmost respect for each other. When you have leadership like that and they're
bought in, everyone else kind of follows along. We had two great days before
we came down here and it's kind of showed up.  
  
Really proud of them to answer your question.  
  
Q. Sam was saying that this isn't the end goal, quarterfinal win,
there's more to be done. What is the mindset moving forward?  
TIM DURYEA: This is the farthest we've been in our five years in the league in
the tournament. It's been a grind for us. And we went into the locker room
after the game and basically we've got the days numbered. And the only thing
we did -- they were calm. We changed day 2 to day 3, and that's tomorrow. And
that's the next step.  
  
Like Sam said, the goal for us here is to win the tournament. That's the only
way we get to where we want to go. And winning a quarterfinal game is great.
It's a step in the process for us being a good team in this league but it's
not the end goal. So day 3 tomorrow.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Jean Prioleau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34837)

### [Ryan Welage](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30504)

### [Jaycee Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34838)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 74, San Jose State - 61  
  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: I thought we battled in the beginning of the game. It was an
offensive game in the first half. They were shooting the lights out. I think
they were in the 60 percent range for most of the first half. And then it
dipped a little bit to 53 percent. We were up in the 56 percent range and then
it dipped to 46 percent. Those are pretty high numbers. And we shot it well
from three. So it was pretty much an offensive game in the first half.  
  
I don't think either team was happy with their defense. They went on a 10-0
run to start the second half. We just couldn't stop them and we weren't able
to score, and that's when it went to 20. And we were never able to regain our
composure or just get back into the game.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned it was an offensive game in the first half. In the
10-0 run did you do anything different, what was the difference for you guys
not getting that run stopped until the lead was really extended?  
RYAN WELAGE: They just hit shots. Credit them, Justin James went 9 for 9 from
the field, Hayden Dalton hit some shots, Herndon hit some shots. They came out
and they hit like four shots in a row and then we weren't able to go down on
the other end and score. So, again, just credit them.  
  
Q. Jaycee, can you talk about just the way you finished this season, the
last five or six games and what that might do for you heading into your senior
season next year?  
JAYCEE HILLSMAN: It was definitely a confidence booster, playing well, seeing
all the hard work pay off. But at the end of the day it's about wins. And I
have to look inward and see what I can do better for us to get more wins next
season. And I'm sure we'll do the same thing.  
  
Q. What do you think this group can do looking ahead to next year with
you and Jaycee coming back? And what we saw from Keith Fisher, the way he
progressed throughout the season, what do you see for the future?  
RYAN WELAGE: Yeah, and again, Jaycee had a great finish to the season. Had a
great season overall. Keith had a really good freshman season that he can
build on. I thought Noah Baumann shot it really well from three, and that will
give him confidence going forward. Caleb played great for us down the stretch
at the end of the year.  
  
Everybody individually needs to add more to their game, everybody needs to
become better shooters. Everybody needs to become stronger, especially me.
That's going to be my main focus in the offseason. I think everybody can add a
little bit to the game, to their own game, then as a team we're going to get
more and more comfortable with our offense and our system, which will be nice,
have a full offseason to really work on our offense.  
  
Q. You were recently recognized for All District honors. How do you
think you performed this season and in this game, especially?  
RYAN WELAGE: Thank you. It was an honor to receive that. I just really want to
credit my teammates and coaches. Obviously without them none of that would be
possible.  
  
As far as for my performance, I think I played pretty consistently.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to do enough to get us a win in this game.  
  
But, again, I just want to focus on the offseason. I'm going to work on
becoming a better shooter, better ball handler, and getting stronger. That's
kind of my outlook right now.  
  
Q. How do you think the team's communication was today?  
JAYCEE HILLSMAN: It was definitely lacking, especially on -- they run a lot of
flare screens and back screens and we have to help and talk, and it was
definitely lacking. Something we have to get better at. We have to grow as a
team.  
  
Credit to coach. He came in in August and he tried to get us together as best
as he could, and we just have to learn on the fly. Like Ryan said, with the
whole offseason now, we have to learn and definitely become closer as a team,
I feel like the communication will come and we'll be older and more
experienced.  
  
Q. With the way James played, nine for nine, and obviously stopping him
from scoring was hard. Is there other ways he contributed? How tough was that
for you guys tonight?  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: Well, he's a really, really good player. He's a First Team All
League player. He had it going tonight. We tried to stay close to him, but
that opens up driving lanes to get to the basket. If we helped trying to stop
him he's pitching it out for guys to shoot wide open 3s.  
  
And that's what great players do. They make guys around them better, and he
does that, and he's just a tough matchup for us, especially when someone is
that hot during a game.  
  
Q. How well do you think you communicated with the team in today's
game?  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: I thought I communicated really well. I've been communicating
with them the whole year. Like the players said, I took over late. We had a
player leave three days before school started and I basically tried to put the
hole in. And it's been a communication process the whole year with our players
trying to figure out what's a good combination for us, combination of players
then style of play, defense, what works for this particular team, what doesn't
work for this particular team.  
  
At the end of the day the message was to just try and play as hard as you can
each and every possession.  
  
Q. You said a couple of times on the bench that you guys were getting
the ball right where you wanted to, especially in that first half.  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: Yes.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the nature of the offense and how you guys
were getting the looks you wanted.  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: Right. Absolutely. Well, first, Wyoming does a great job of
switching up defenses. They have a really good zone and then they switch and
go man a lot. But our offense is predicated on playing inside out. So we were
actually getting the looks that we needed, we just couldn't finish, which has
happened a lot this year. We are a work in progress, but we're getting better.  
  
Ashtin Chastain wasn't shooting the ball very well in the beginning of the
year; last ten games he's been shooting 57 percent from the field. There are
little things and spots that we are getting better at.  
  
And, again, we did get the ball where we wanted to. We even got wide open
shots, we just have to be able to knock them down, especially when another
team is playing as well as they were offensively. Sometimes your best defense
is your offense, sometimes. We don't live by that rule, our program is going
to be based on defense and rebounding. We out-rebounded them by two, but
couldn't stop them, so our defense let us down tonight.  
  
Q. Not being able to stop them, is that a tip of the hat to them how hot
they were?  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: Absolutely. And that happens in tournament play. I tried to
explain to our guys, even though we're a work in progress and we're trying to
get better each and every day, guess what, when it gets to the end of the
season everybody else is better. Every coach is telling their players, we have
a chance to win this thing, we're a good team. We beat such and such, either
the upper end of the league or beat teams in your league. Everyone feels they
have a chance.  
  
When you get into this type of environment it comes down to being locked in
and playing as hard as you can every single possession, a lot of energy.  
  
Q. Keith Fisher fouled out of the game. How tough was that to lose
Keith, especially the way he's played against Wyoming this season?  
JEAN PRIOLEAU: He's had a great season. We depend a lot on him. It is
unfortunate that he got in foul trouble. He picked up two, I had to put him on
the bench because I can't afford to have him in there in the first half with
two fouls and he picks up another one, that's three. I had to sit him the
first half. Second half he picked up another one, and then he picked up his
fourth and I had to get him out of the game.  
  
It's tough because he does a lot for us. He's a high-motor player, good kid,
plays hard every single possession. And after the game I told our guys in the
locker room, I said, you know what, even though he was in foul trouble -- and
tonight just wasn't his day today. And that happens. That happens sometimes.
But I told our guys, we need to have that type of motor and that type of
energy every single time you step on the practice floor and then in a real
game. That's how much he means to us.

UNLV - 97, Air Force - 90 (OT)  
  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: First and foremost, I'd like to say thank you to our five
seniors we have at the academy: Trevor Lyons, Jacob Van, Frank Toohey, CJ
Siples and Ryan Manning. What an awesome group. There were times I would like
our other ten coaches in the league to have an opportunity to coach -- they
all have great players in their programs -- to coach young men who go through
the academy. Just unbelievable character. And I think it showed today in our
game. The grit we had. The fight we had. What a game.  
  
And we've played some really, really good games with UNLV. We had triple
overtime. We had the overtime game today. And we took the first lead in
overtime, up three. And then I'll give you one name: Brandon McCoy. And
Brandon was very good, was very, very good for them. I thought our guys were
very good. I thought their guys were very good. And as of tomorrow morning I'm
going to start campaigning for Brandon to go to the NBA.  
  
Q. You were spending the whole game coming back from the deficit. Once
you got there and got the lead, did you feel like you had gotten over the
hump?  
JACOB VAN: Yeah, definitely felt confident taking over the lead, especially
late in overtime. We thought this was our time to step up and win the game.
But they had some great plays down the stretch that let them get the victory.  
  
Q. The four-point play, talk about how big that was at that point in the
game.  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: At that point in the game I felt like that was a very big
play to rally the troops. We fight hard and we're very resilient; so I felt
like that play played into bringing our energy back.  
  
Q. We talked on Saturday about maybe you had turned a corner and you
close with two 20-point games. Do you take solace in that? What's going
through your mind?  
JACOB VAN: It's tough that it had to come to an end that way. Played pretty
well, but obviously wasn't enough to win. But I wish I could do more for the
team to advance to the next day.  
  
Q. The layup you took, looked like it could have been goal tending.  
JACOB VAN: The ref didn't say it was so I guess it wasn't. I felt like I got
it up there, I don't know if it hit the glass or not, but I thought it did.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the seniors. When you look at what the sophomores
have accomplished this year, and even tonight, with your performance, Caleb
Morris, what does that do with you looking forward?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: Looking forward that brings a lot of confidence in the next
few years to come. I feel like we overcame some stepping stones in our path
and I feel like as the sophomore class, the next two years we're going to do a
lot of damage in the Mountain West.  
  
Q. What do you think about the foundation that you're leaving behind
here?  
JACOB VAN: I'm really proud of the young guys. They really stepped up this
year, and the program's in the right hands and has a bright future ahead of
them, no doubt.  
  
Q. In that overtime, there was missed free throws, there was two-on-one
or three-on-one blocks.  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: The three-point lead and then had a possession and didn't get
the score. Because you don't lead throughout the game, down 13 at one time,
and you come back and you tie it. And then you take the lead in overtime and
you're up three with possession. And they made a really good play. But you
always think if you can go to four or five, maybe put some more pressure on
UNLV, who played extremely well, and played hard, but maybe you turn the
tables a little bit.  
  
But it didn't happen and we came back and the game went here and there, and
they go up to 82-81 to take the last lead and they managed in the stretch to
lead.  
  
But we did some really good things. It was good to see. We fought from the
beginning to the end. We finished the half the right way, and just kept
battling.  
  
But Brandon was really good today. And he only blocked maybe two or three
shots but he altered so many. And it took Ryan Swan out of the game somewhat,
Frank came in to give us some great minutes. Brandon is really talented. And
then Juis played well, and Johnson was double-double with assist in the
points.  
  
To credit our guys, we came in and we just kept fighting. We finished the last
nine games four and five in the Mountain West. I thought we played our best
basketball at the end. The season is so long, we started our first game
November 13th. There's a lot of highs and lows and injuries, and mixing
lineups.  
  
But a sign of our team is we kept improving every day, we came to work and
practiced hard every day. And we got better as the season went on.  
  
I hurt for them that they're not going to have a chance to play anymore,
especially those five guys that did so much for us. And it starts with Trevor,
and what a leader he's been. His name is going to be etched in our record
books for a long time. They spun the program and flipped us trending the right
way. Now the young guys can continue to work and do the right things. We're
excited about where we're headed and who we're going with.  
  
Q. You said excited. What does the sophomore class, what would their
ceiling be?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Stay healthy. You've got to be lucky a little bit. Continue
the right thing as cadets. You never know, there can always be a hiccup along
the way. They have a strong bond. They love the game, they love the work, and
they challenge with each other. And with the freshmen and the guys coming in,
I think it's time for us to keep moving forward and we have some good
leadership and talent in that group. So it's fun and exciting and we're
looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Three of the last four games against them in this building have gone
to overtime. When you look at the program what are the little things that need
to change to flip those?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: We need to get Brandon McCoy. We need a seven footer in our
program. The last couple of games, the overtime games, it's like me sitting at
the blackjack table here; it always ends in their hands. Right?  
  
We just got to make a play. Maybe a loose ball, offensive rebound they get, a
shot that rolls in and out. We've been so close, we've been so close. But I
think the experience going through that will carry us forward.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Marvin Menzies](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20785)

### [Jovan Mooring](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32822)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 97, Air Force - 90 (OT)  
  
MARVIN MENZIES: These games are always tough to coach when you go against
really disciplined teams that have a very strong signature of how they play,
and that's what this team does.  
  
Air Force -- Dave just does a great job, I tell you. And they're in all their
games, and they just fight, they never quit. They made 16 3s in their last
game and 13 against us tonight. The ball started falling for them late in the
season from the three-point line. They would have had a much better record, I
guarantee you, if they were shooting up to their capabilities early.  
  
But they kept fighting, and we knew it was going to be a fight. We were very
prepared to play this type of game, especially after the two previous games
where they were both close games.  
  
We were happy to come out on the winning side. It's nice to advance. That's
where we're at and looking forward to getting our preparation in for the next
one.  
  
Q. Air Force finally took the lead in overtime a couple of times and
then you went on a 12-point run. What did you say to each other or did you say
anything to each other that triggered the run?  
JOVAN MOORING: There wasn't anything special. Coach gave us a game plan to
follow, and we kept reminding each other, We've got to get a stop. And we got
the stops when we needed them.  
  
They're tough to guard. They got a lot of easy buckets just because they play
hard offensively. But we got the stops that we needed down the stretch.  
  
Q. Early in overtime it looked like Air Force had a fast break and got a
block from behind and you chase it down and block a second shot. What made you
get back into that play and come up with that block?  
BRANDON McCOY: I just wanted to win. And there was plenty of time and Shakur
blocked the shot and I knew No. 12 was going to get the rebound, Scottie was
going to get the rebound, and I went in contention and luckily I got the
block.  
  
Q. The first two meetings Air Force did a good job on you and Shakur as
far as keeping you guys from scoring a lot, and you combined for 44 today or
something like that. Was there anything that you did strategically that was
different than the first two games?  
BRANDON McCOY: I think the guards did a really good job of penetrating and
finding the open man, and I feel like me and Shakur were a good receiver on
that. Also most of the time people stop me and Shakur because we stand in one
place the whole game. I try to make sure that I just look for open spots to be
at for my team to kick it of out to me, as well as Shakur, and go to the
glass. We have just really been focused on rebounding the ball more and
playing harder.  
  
Q. You guys have got Nevada tomorrow, you split the regular season with
them. Your thoughts going into that game and just playing them again.  
JOVAN MOORING: It's no accident. When we go up against them, it's just about
who wants it more. And they know us pretty well and we know them pretty well.
So whichever team comes to play is going to win the game.  
  
Q. About McCoy and Shakur being more active offensively, is it that they
just made sure they moved around?  
MARVIN MENZIES: A little bit more detailed in terms of what we were trying to
do just from an offensive standpoint, we tried to keep them around the basket
a little bit more with some of the sets that we ran. We felt like if they
didn't get the ball then we would have them in good rebounding position if we
did that. And that helped a little bit.  
  
We got some good put-backs there, timely put-backs during the stretch there,
down the stretch.  
  
Also, just getting them more engaged earlier in the possession. I think there
was some times that in the few times we played there, the couple of times we
played them before, they were drifting out a little bit in the offense when
they should have been more engaged with deeper touches.  
  
Q. Air Force closed the second half on a 13-5 run. There was a lot of
missed free throws by your team. How does that get corrected moving forward?  
MARVIN MENZIES: In 24 hours? I have no idea. We've got to concentrate. Free
throws are what they are. Our guys do a decent job when they're locked in. I
was kind of surprised we missed so much down the stretch there. You've got to
get the right guys at the free throw line, too, that was part of it.  
  
I probably could have helped the team with some subbing there down the stretch
that might have been more conducive when we know they are going to foul. I
might have been able -- not might have -- I should have had better free throw
shooters in during that stretch.  
  
Q. On that play in overtime where McCoy and Juiston got the two chase-
down blocks, what were your thoughts? Did you expect McCoy to get back in the
play? What did that mean for you guys?  
MARVIN MENZIES: Just happy that we're back. Where have you been? It's like,
okay, I know you.  
  
But, seriously, I was glad they were playing like it was one-and-done time.
Those were energy plays, those were effort plays. A little additional passion,
understanding the dynamics of what is necessary to win in this kind of
environment. And they showed it. So that was good.  
  
Q. At the end of regulation, coach, what were you trying to do at the
end to get the final basket?  
MARVIN MENZIES: We had a call on the previous timeouts so we wanted to just
calm down and run the play. Every time we called a timeout they were changing
the defense, they were putting a 1-3-1 on us. But I didn't want -- Dave is
such a good coach, there was a little bit of a chess match there. People sit
back and say, Oh, you should have called a timeout and set this up. Okay, no,
not against Dave. You needed to make sure that we got the play executed the
right way. We didn't do that.  
  
At the end of the day maybe I should have called a timeout, but that was the
logic for not calling it, No. 1.  
  
No. 2, we had called the play. They started to run it too early. And so then
we tried to get them to slow down and run it again a little bit later. And
then it got messed up because the timing was off on the play. So that was the
one that JoJo took the long three. That was on me. We probably should have --
I don't know that we informed them when to start the play, does that make
sense? And I think there was -- like they're right in front of our bench,
we're like, Not yet, wait until 12, and they started already. Then it was just
a debacle that we can learn from. So that was it.  
  
Q. Did you feel like this was one of Brandon's best games in terms of
protection?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I don't know if it was one of his best, but he was obviously
getting better at challenging shots late. I think both he and Mbacke are
pretty good shot blockers when they challenge it late and be the second one to
leave the ground. And we're still teaching them that technique.  
  
So Brandon did a good job and got a couple late.  
  
Q. Talk about the preparation that you did with the guys over the past
week, both mentally and physically, especially considering how the regular
season ended to get ready for this.  
MARVIN MENZIES: Right. That's a good question, because I was concerned,
obviously, we lost five in a row. And how do you get your boys back? What do
we do to get them ready to play in this environment?  
  
So I leaned on staff and experience and put together a schedule that was
conducive to them staying together a lot so that they could talk and dream and
kind of engage with each other instead of being distracted. We got a hotel --
thanks Desiree -- and we got a hotel, which we hadn't had in our plans before.
But we were able to do that and that was really good for us.  
  
I thought that those guys being able to lock in and watch extra film, eat
together, just the whole schedule. I look back at previous years at what we
did and some of the other years that we were successful and I keep those
schedules. And so I just leaned on some of those and it worked out.  
  
Q. You played them last week, obviously did not go well here. How much
will you talk about that game? And is it good that you only have 24 hours that
you just go forward instead of looking back now?  
MARVIN MENZIES: Yeah, it's good for us in the sense that we're on a schedule
now that's very concise and like they're doing what they're supposed to do to
rejuvenate their bodies right now, both mentally, physically. They're on a
very tight schedule. They won't have the opportunity to be distracted because
we're going to be hands-on until this journey is over for us.  
  
So I think playing them as recently as we have, they won that game and we won
the one before, and that is what it is, you know. We talk about that game, the
first one there, being a big win for us. I know Caleb was out. But that was a
big win for us, it was a win on the road against a top-25 team. And they
played like a top-25 team when they came here, with a man out, with Lindsay
out. Give them credit for that.  
  
Tomorrow we'll lace them up again and let the best team win.  
  
Q. It seemed like the defensive intensity was up the first five minutes
of the first half. Did you sense that and how do you get your guys to play
that style of defense for an entire 40 minutes against Reno?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I leaned on some guys a little bit that fatigue started to
kick in. I think Jordan had a couple of turnovers that were fatigue-based
turnovers.  
  
I think the other thing that we need to do going forward is making sure that
we get their bodies ready for tomorrow. And then when you're in one-and-done
time, there's a lot of guys that play a lot of minutes. Reno has 7 guys they
play or whatever it is. So they're conditioned to do that well or play that
way, as well. And these guys, Jordie plays a bunch of minutes and some of
other guys. I don't think it will be too big a problem in the second game.  
  
Q. Your big guys have done really well again Nevada in both games.
Amauri only five last week, and he's been struggling from the field. Does he
hold the key for you tomorrow?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I think they all do. I think this has got to be a team win.
We're not going to beat Reno if we come in here and rely on the bigs or rely
on a guard; they're too good. They're one of the top teams in the United
States. And we're building. And we're trying to figure out what bricks need to
be in what place to build a foundation.  
  
It's going to be a challenge. They're a really, really good team. I don't
think it's going to be a game where you have to rely on a particular position,
if that makes sense.  
  
Q. Emotionally, can you approach Reno as the rival or redemption game or
are you treating it as like a survive and advance?  
MARVIN MENZIES: I think typically you approach all of these games like they're
rivals when you get in a one-and-done team. Because you want your guys playing
at their top, right? So at their maximum level. And you do certain things
against rivals to do that. Anytime you play a rival it's going to be a rivalry
game.  
  
But these are obviously weighted a little bit more heavily based on the
circumstances that it ends that team's chances of winning the Mountain West
Conference Tournament if they lose.  
  
I think it's a little bit of both.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Jase Herl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34830)

### [Nico Carvacho](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34831)

### [Prentiss Nixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32912)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 76, Colorado State - 65  
  
JASE HERL: We got off to a really good start. I was really proud of the focus
these guys came out with. I thought they executed exactly what we wanted to do
early. We knew Utah State was going to make a run, they've got good guards,
they're a well-coached team, they run good stuff. It was a matter of them kind
of waking up.  
  
Couldn't be more proud of these guys. They've battled adversity all year. It's
something that they're going to be better for in life moving forward. That's
what these experiences are about, it's not necessarily about this basketball
game today. It's what they get out of this experience moving forward. I
couldn't be more proud of the way these guys and the way they have handled the
situation.  
  
Q. Nico, you played every minute of the game tonight. What does that
confidence from Jase do for you when you're in a game that's so tight?  
NICO CARVACHO: It means a lot because you know he believes in you, he put me
out for a reason, gave him the best way I can.  
  
Q. How tough was what you guys have gone through the last month?  
PRENTISS NIXON: It's been crazy tough. I don't think anybody expected what
happened to happen, especially not so fast. I think we were looking for
answers for a long time and we weren't getting them. But at the end of the day
that door was closed. We just had to get out and play basketball at the end of
the day regardless of how hard the situation was or how tough it was on
anybody.  
  
Q. Along those lines, how important was it to finish with this kind of
an effort versus what we saw against Boise State and New Mexico, where it
looked like you guys' hearts weren't in it?  
PRENTISS NIXON: I think we competed for 40 minutes today. That was the
emphasis. That's what coach said, compete for 40 minutes with heart. That's
exactly what we did. We came up a little bit short. Credit Utah State, they
made some good shots down the stretch. We live with it at the end of the day.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of these guys for how hard we competed today.  
  
Q. Jase mentioned he hoped you guys learn something from this whole
experience. I know it's tough to reflect now, but what are the things you'll
take away from this season?  
NICO CARVACHO: Playing through adversity was the thing. Going to every game
and not knowing who the coach was. Playing through it all. Playing for our
guys. Playing for the names on our backs and the front of our jerseys. Just
trying to go out there and play for ourselves, for each other as a team.  
  
Q. In that 20-5 run at the start of the game you guys were playing
really well, defending down low, and they ended up with more points in the
paint than you guys did. What did you feel like changed? It's been something
you wanted to focus on improving?  
NICO CARVACHO: In the second half I think we were playing so hard and trying
to put pressure on the good guards that they had that they got in the paint,
guards, everybody got in the paint, drove the paint, made some tough shots,
all of them. We just applied pressure, some of the times they got by us and
that happens.  
  
Q. Just what was that feeling like in the locker room when you realized
this was it, this team is done, given all the emotions you guys have been
through this season?  
NICO CARVACHO: You know, it's always tough to finish the year, especially the
year we had. We weren't expecting to have this type of year, we had All-
Conference coming into the season.  
  
It's just sad because I love these guys, the person next to me, everybody as a
teammate. And it's tough. It's the last game we're all going to play together.
I know Jase is going to do great things when he's done here.  
  
Q. Seemed like you played with a lot of pace to start. Was that a key in
you guys getting off to a good lead in the game? And was it hard to maintain
that throughout the game? I think you only had eight players left.  
PRENTISS NIXON: I think we were just playing basketball. We just played free.
We had nothing to lose. Just come out and play basketball, and that's exactly
what we did.  
  
I think the tide turned when they started rebounding us. As guards we didn't
do our job. We can't leave it up to the bigs to rebound. So that's where
everything changed, when they started rebounding the ball, and they
capitalized on it. For the most part, we just had to play basketball.  
  
Q. Sounds like Joe Parker met with you guys, to talk about what you
wanted out of the next head coach. What did it feel like to express your
opinions to him, and what are some of the things you're looking for?  
NICO CARVACHO: Like we said when we did the practice, we didn't go, he stuck
to his word and said he was going to talk to us from now on first. That's
exactly what he did. We appreciate that.  
  
Just voiced our opinions on what we wanted, how we see it in a coach. And went
through the room and asked all of us three qualities we want to see in a
coach, and we all did.  
  
Q. You and Anthony combined for one assist today. Do you credit Utah
State's defensive effort more for that or do you believe you and Anthony
should distribute the ball better?  
PRENTISS NIXON: I think we were playing basketball at the end of the day. We
lost by 11 and were down 4 with two minutes to go. Whether one assist or no
assist, people still made plays to be in this basketball game regardless. So
we played basketball, and Anthony can distribute the ball, I can distribute
the ball. That's not a question. There's no doubt in anybody's mind about
that.  
  
It just happened. This is what it was today. They made shots. It wasn't about
our assists or anything like that. They made good shots down the stretch, and
rebounded and that's all it came down to.  
  
Q. We saw Anthony become more aggressive. How big was it? With how close
you guys are, was it cool to see him really come alive this year?  
PRENTISS NIXON: It was good to see him go out and do his thing. I'm proud of
him from where he started to where he is now. And he has so much farther to
go. He's a great player, but he's going to be even better when he comes back
next year.  
  
Q. Did you leave everything you had on the floor tonight? Can you go
away feeling that?  
PRENTISS NIXON: Yeah. I can go away feeling like if this was Boise the first
time, I'd probably be disappointed in our efforts, but tonight, this
afternoon, we left it all on the court. I just couldn't be more proud of these
guys.  
  
Q. You had a chance to see Jase in action as a head coach. What do you
think of him and his prospects to be head coach some day?  
PRENTISS NIXON: No doubt Jase will be head coach some day. When that time
comes, time will tell. He's going to be a great head coach. He's going to lead
a team to great things. The players are going to play hard. He reaches players
on a personal level. Those two combinations are big for a team.  
  
Q. Becky Hammon has been mentioned often for this next job. What are
your thoughts on perhaps playing for a female head coach?  
PRENTISS NIXON: It's no different if it was a male head coach. We've got to
respect her, listen to what she has to say, listen to her philosophy, play
hard when you step on the court. No matter if it's male or female, you still
have to go out and play basketball at the end of the day.  
  
Q. You guys had a really good start to the first half. It kind of
dwindled a little to the half. What was kind of your message at halftime with
only a two-point lead?  
JASE HERL: I thought we finished the half okay. We talked about that last four
minutes, wanting to go in with a lead or be right around there, because in the
past the last three- or four-minute stretch at halves has kind of doomed us a
little bit.  
  
I felt like we were going to come out with a lot of energy, we did. Eventually
that wears off, we're a little thin on the bench and that type of thing. I was
proud of those guys. Halftime we talked about just constant effort, multiple
efforts, those kinds of things and going out there and competing. Too often
we've competed for 20, 25 minutes and not 40. And like I said, I wrote it up
on the board and they did that, they competed for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Che starts the game 4-4 from the field, and then picks up the second
foul about five minutes in. Did you consider keeping him in?  
JASE HERL: Yes, and then we went back to him and he picked up his third. All
three of those fouls were him playing hard. I couldn't ask more from that for
Che. He's made a few plays here and there, where you scratch your head like,
What are you doing, Che? On his fouls he's had that since he's been there. I
thought every foul he had in the first half was just from playing hard, which
is what we asked him to do.  
  
Q. How much did it limit you guys to have him and Deion both be in foul
trouble, especially late in the game when you saw him attacking the rim?  
JASE HERL: It's something we've dealt with off and on. Those guys have been in
foul trouble throughout the year. We had nothing to lose tonight, we were
going to play them, we needed those guys on the floor. Utah State did a really
good job of putting their guys in places to be successful and take advantage
of our guys not necessarily wanting to foul.  
  
Q. Obviously it's not your decision at the end of the day, but do you
feel you have proved that you deserve to be in the conversation, at least, to
be the next head coach of CSU?  
JASE HERL: That's not my decision to make. I'm confident in my ability to lead
a team and I've done it before. But at the end of the day I trust Joe and
those guys, but I feel confident in what I can do.  
  
Q. You guys went with a really small rotation today. Was that more of a
product of the game plan or was it just you saying, If I'm going to go out,
I'm going to go out with my best players on the floor?  
JASE HERL: We wanted our best defensive team on the floor, and that's kind of
what it came down to. We got together and talked about what are the best guys
that we can put out there to execute our defensive game plan. I thought we
could score enough points, but we've been having trouble stopping teams. So we
wanted to get the best defensive team out there, so that's the short rotation.  
  
Q. What can you say about this team and kind of the way they've handled
what you guys have gone through in these last five weeks or so?  
JASE HERL: I think there's been ups and downs with it. I think they're
frustrated. I think they found their voice a little bit. And I think they've
just -- I think they've started to grow as young men, which is what this whole
experience is about. What they went through in a short amount of time, a lot
of people don't go through in, say, four- or five-year span, let alone a one-
or two-month span.  
  
So I think that's part of life. And I think they figured that out and they've
grown from it.  
  
Q. For Nico, he got ten boards but only eight points. How hard is it to
see him struggle a little bit?  
JASE HERL: Thought he got good looks, I think he got frustrated. But with
Nico, he's always going to rebound the ball, and play hard. Sometimes the
shots go in and sometimes they don't. Same thing with Deion. But they both had
ten rebounds, and those guys went out there and competed and I'm proud of them
for that.  
  
I wish we could have figured out a way to get Nico some more touches, credit
Utah State for that. They did a good job. Because he's been on such a hot
streak, he's like Prentiss now, he's moving up the list of guys when they're
preparing for a team that they're going to talk about.  
  
Q. Obviously you would have wanted to win tonight and make a run this
week and shock some people. Now that everything is over, is it a little bit
nice, a little relieving, after everything you've been through the past
month?  
JASE HERL: No, I wanted to go back and practice with those guys tomorrow and
be back in the locker room talking about Boise State and tonight at the hotel.
It's always tough when it ends. You never look forward to that. And like I
said, I wish we were heading back to talk about Boise right now.  
  
Q. You mentioned defensively, they started at 1-11, and shoot 50 percent
in the field. Where did things go wrong there?  
JASE HERL: They started hurting us in the middle pick and roll, they got some
good action going side to side, and started hurting us. Koby started making
shots. He's a good player. We held him down, basically the last two years we
made him take a lot of shots, to work for it. We did a good job at their
place. A player like that, you can only hope that you hold him down like we
have before.  
  
So once again, they put their players in good positions to make plays, and
they made them.  
  
Q. Jase, you had double the turnovers, but you were only able to conjure
up two fast break points. What did they do in the transition?  
JASE HERL: We had a stretch there where I think it was 20-5, and it felt like
we were on a fast break every other play and we never scored. I think they did
a really good job of converting back and getting on defense. I think they
found our shooters, they spaced out. They played off our drivers. So they did
a good job of playing the personnel, and I think that played into it.  
  
Q. Toward the end there did you get a sense there that your team had run
out of gas, when they're starting to go inside and driving on you in those
final two minutes, looked like maybe finally that everything this team had
gone through caught up to them a little bit?  
JASE HERL: I don't necessarily think it's the situation that's caught up to
them. I think it's the 39 minutes, the 36 minutes, I think that's what it was.
They competed.  
  
I mean, like I said, that's what we talked about in the locker room
afterwards. For those guys to step out there and do that, Deion 32 minutes. I
wish Che could have played more, because he was effective in the minutes he
was in there.  
  
Q. J.D. or Robbie today, is there any update on either one of those guys
as far as going forward?  
JASE HERL: No.

## March 7, 2018

### [Alan Herndon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30485)

### [Justin James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32801)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 74, San Jose State - 61  
  
ALLEN EDWARDS: We went into the game with the mindset of the first four
minutes kind of setting our tone, playing Wyoming brand of basketball. I
thought we came out with that. So obviously moving into the second half was
the same message, playing the first four minutes, and then having to carry
over.  
  
Thought our guys did a great job of doing that, and because of it we took the
lead and gave ourselves an opportunity to rest some guys, obviously getting
prepared for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Justin, 9 of 9 from the field. Perfect. Just feeling it? Talk about
that. Ever had a game like that?  
JUSTIN JAMES: I wouldn't call it perfect. I was just taking what the defense
was giving me. And my teammates trust me to take and make shots. And
thankfully I did. I was getting nice open ones. And there were moments that I
would drive and collapse and then kick it out so other players would get open
ones.  
  
We played a good all-around game. We'll be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Justin, how much did that spark the team or did you think it did
spark it?  
ALAN HERNDON: I definitely think it sparked the team. Just his energy that he
come out with, and just leading us, like he has this entire season. It's
always great to see that. I looked up and I was like, Okay, he's definitely
going. The rest of us kind of got to get going, too. So he definitely was.  
  
Q. I guess you guys got out to that ten-point lead at the half. How
important was it to come out in the second half and make sure you had that
same energy level?  
JUSTIN JAMES: Like the coach said, we pride ourselves in the first four
minutes of the game, and the first four minutes of halftime coming out. Our
goal was to come out and give them no hope and play as hard as we possibly
can. And that's what we did. We did have some mistakes, but we played through
them and we kept playing Cowboy basketball, and that's why we won.  
  
Q. Quick turnaround, obviously, in these tournaments. What do you need
to do to make sure you have that same sort of energy against New Mexico?  
ALAN HERNDON: I think partially we were able to do it tonight being able to
rest a few of us, myself, HD, and J.J. and even the other guys getting the
full rotation and getting those minutes.  
  
I think we're prepared for this. We opened the season in the Cayman Islands
where we had to go back-to-back games. I think we understand as a team what we
have to do to be prepared to come out tomorrow and give it our all, because
it's win or go home.  
  
Q. You've won games here, it's been a while since the team won games in
this building. To get the first one the way you did, is that nice to get the
first one out of the way and move on to the next one?  
ALAN HERNDON: It's definitely nice to get the first one, and of course it
always starts with that. Just looking back on those years, we just feel like
we didn't come out with the best product. This time we were all about what
coach was giving us, and this time it showed and we played Wyoming basketball
on the court tonight.  
  
Q. Big game from Justin, you finished 6 of 7 from the floor yourself.
How big is it to have so much depth, and especially in a game where you're not
getting some scoring like guys like Hayden?  
ALAN HERNDON: I think it's our team in general. Teams have to prepare for us,
because in any given night it could be any guy. So we always play like that.
We share the ball like that and we just always try to lift each other up.  
  
Even though tonight HD didn't shoot it well, he was still out there
encouraging guys and being himself. We still want him to take those shots and
give him confidence.  
  
Q. You were fighting for the first-round buy at the end of the year, and
it didn't work out for you. Is this the ideal way that it could have gone to
play a first-round game to get the confidence back?  
JUSTIN JAMES: The confidence was always there. It was nice to play in the 20's
in the minutes. We know what happened in the regular season against New
Mexico, we'll be thinking about it and we'll be ready to play.  
  
Q. Following up on New Mexico, the last time you guys got together,
extremely high-scoring game. How do you slow down an offense like them?  
JUSTIN JAMES: You be patient, you take what they give you and you make smart
plays. We don't play New Mexico basketball; we play Wyoming basketball. Take
what they give us, obviously take care of the ball, and be smart on defense
and just play our game, and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Are the Lobos a team you had your eye on coming into the
tournament?  
JUSTIN JAMES: We don't really see it like that. We just play whoever is in
front of us. But like I said, we weren't sad that we're playing them.  
  
Q. How big was it not just to get this win but to come out strong in the
second half and kind of put them away, so to speak? We've seen teams this year
would make a run. How big was that for this team in this tournament to put
them away early?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Again, like the guys were saying, the message was our only
focus was San Jose State. We didn't care about after. And we entered the game
with the mindset of the first four minutes, putting our stamp on the game in
the sense of energy, effort, and playing well in basketball. And then let it
carry over. And I thought the same message came out in the second half.  
  
And what was great about it, especially when you start getting into
tournaments like this, is being careful of trying to wear your guys down just
to win a basketball game. So the fact that we had an opportunity to extend the
lead gave us an opportunity to put some guys in the game that didn't play as
much, but more importantly rest the guys that we do look for to play a lot of
minutes.  
  
Q. Not Hayden's best night shooting from the floor, but he's a guy
that's been able to rebound consistently throughout his career and come back
from these type of performances. What's your message going to be to him going
forward?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: No different than what I said to him at halftime. I thought he
was rushing and trying to will his shots. And like I told him, he's one of our
scorers so it's not like I'm going to sit up there and tell him not to shoot,
just let it come to you.  
  
But outside of the shots, was he doing a lot of the other things? And we look
at the stat line, I was really impressed with the fact that he had six
assists. And we actually tried to go to him early in the first half to try to
get him some easy ones before the big ones would come in. But I thought his
second half was better. I thought he was a little bit more composed.  
  
At the end of the day with the type of player he is, it's hard to say that he
would have the same type of night two nights in a row.  
  
Q. J.J. hit three 3s tonight but overall it looked like he was taking a
lot of high-percentage shots. Is that something that's contagious when you
have a guy out there taking good shots and making them?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Well, just getting prepared for the tournament I had a good
sit-down with J.J. And I actually wanted to play him a little bit more at the
point so that he could have a little bit more of a Magic Johnson mentality
versus, say, Michael Jordan mentality. Getting guys going and letting the game
come to him. And I actually thought he did that. Even though he had 20 points
in the first half, I didn't think it was rushed.  
  
I didn't think it was, I'm trying to find my offense type of a night. I
thought he really tried to get the other guys involved. Did a great job in the
first half rebounding the basketball as well. And then like Al said, when you
see a guy playing that way, and doing that type of damage, then you as a
teammate, you say to yourself, I have to step my game up a little bit, just to
help out with what's going on.  
  
Q. I know the 3s haven't necessarily been there all year percentage-wise
for him. He said he's going to keep shooting them. Has that been your
mentality toward him?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: J.J.?  
  
Q. Yes.  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Yeah. Last year he was shooting the three ball over 40 percent.
And what I tried to get him to understand was that you're taking different 3s
than what you took last year. And what I meant by that was you're just
settling, the guy is just standing right there in front of you and you're
jabbing shooting 3s or shooting 3s with a late hand.  
  
My thing has always been with any of our guys, if the ball is moving and it
touches the paint whether off the drive or in the post and it comes out to
you, I would take those 3s all night. But to pop it around the perimeter and
nobody is being aggressive and just shoot it, those are not good for us. And I
think he understood that a little bit better tonight as well.  
  
Q. New Mexico you played twice, put away the one in Laramie at least
defensively. But obviously it's hard to get caught up in the way they play. Is
that the major message to the team going into this game, or what are some of
the other keys going into tomorrow?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Again, a lot of people looked at the score and said it was
defense. I thought it was our offense that really hurt us in the sense of
quick shots and turning the basketball over to where they got a lot of
breakaway layups or advantage breaks against us.  
  
But even coming into the San Jose State game, my main message to our guys was
our best defense is taking care of the basketball and shot selection. It
wouldn't be any different getting prepared for New Mexico, because they do
want to speed you up. And we're a team that likes to play with tempo, as well.
We have to understand at the end of the day advantage versus disadvantage.
There's going to be opportunities, just like I told them about this team. They
want you to pop it around the perimeter and settle for 3s. Like watching Utah
State, they had 40 3s in the game today and ended up losing.  
  
New Mexico is different in the sense they just want to pressure you and get
you going fast and then you shoot the ball in 6 to 8 seconds, and was it
really a good shot for us? And I think that's what we have to figure out when
getting prepared for them. Because if it's not then we have to make them play
defense in the half court.  
  
Q. I guess how was Hunter feeling coming into this one? He got in there
in the second half.  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Just needed to warm up, he's been a little sore. He or actually
Lou didn't practice either the couple of times before getting out here.  
  
But there was a point in the game I went down and talked to Lance and see if
it was okay to put him out there just to get him going. I thought he looked
pretty good, to be honest with you, moving-wise.  
  
But, again, you know, move on, do a lot of preparation for New Mexico tonight.
And that will present a different challenge in the sense of style of play is
different from San Jose versus New Mexico.  
  
Q. What does it say about Wyoming athletics that both basketball
programs have been able to advance to the semifinals now?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Well, I bragged on just the athletic department in general last
year. I do believe we do have something special going on at the University of
Wyoming, not only just mens and women's, obviously football has done a great
job, wrestling has always been good, volleyball has done a great job, swimming
and diving has done a great job, as well. Track. If you go down the line
there's something about each program -- tennis -- there's something about each
program that you can say, Man, they're doing the right thing. And that should
be recognized with our fan base, as well.  
  
Excited for Coach Legerski, he comes to my office but I go to his office, he's
like a mentor to me, and I was just excited that his staff got Coach of the
Year for what they did. And then the performance that they had last night or
yesterday coming back from 17 down. I thought that was really, really, really
good.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2018

  

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Dwayne Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34827)

### [Koby McEwen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32795)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 76, Colorado State - 65  
  
TIM DURYEA: Obviously not how you draw it up. We were sluggish to start. I
don't know if it was nerves or what it was, but we were flat. No energy on
either end of the floor and they took advantage of that. Got off to a great
start, credit to Jase and his guys.  
  
About halfway through the first half I thought our defensive activity and
intensity picked up and that really kind of bled through the rest of our game.
We started getting some stops, stringing those together. We got out on the
break, we had a little more life to us offensively. And just chipped away at
it.  
  
Rough start. You don't get away with that too often but we slipped by today.  
  
Q. Julion Pearre was one of the stabilizing forces in the first half.
How important was he to you?  
KOBY McEWEN: He was great. We needed it, especially because a lot of us
couldn't seem to make a basket. He came in and hit those 3s. Those are big 3s.
He kept us in the game, really.  
  
I'm proud of Julion, I'm happy for him. We needed that really bad.  
  
DWAYNE BROWN: With the only guy probably, one of the few guys on our team with
experience playing in the tournament and stuff like that. And the way we were
going in the first half, it was really big for him to step up and for the
season he's kind of had for a senior year. So really proud of him and happy.  
  
Q. On rebounds, especially early on Colorado State was having a lot of
success, especially on the offensive boards. And then there in the second
half, especially, you guys really clamped down on that and won the rebounding
total 40 to 31. Was there a change in philosophy or what was the reason for
that dramatic shift?  
KOBY McEWEN: There was no change in philosophy. Our job -- well, our coach has
preached to us every day we have to rebound, especially because we're
undersized.  
  
For us, we just have to clamp down and block out the guys who really crash
hard, which are Carvacho, Che Bob, and James. They go hard to the glass. They
play big. They played big this game. We knew we had to block out and get
rebounds.  
  
That was one of the only reasons why they were up so much because we couldn't
get a board. And our coaches got on us and made us get rebounds because that
was the only way that we were going to try to come back in this game.  
  
DWAYNE BROWN: On the defensive side we had to lock in on rebounds for them
because I felt like a lot of the second chance -- a lot of their points came
off second-chance baskets because of their offensive rebounding.  
  
So the philosophy on rebounding has always been the same; you've just got to
do it. So we just basically had to listen to our coaches and do what we were
told to do throughout the whole game and get it done.  
  
Q. You've had some real struggles in some halves. Did that help you not
panic tonight with the way things started the first half, you couldn't buy a
bucket at all?  
KOBY McEWEN: Yeah. You know, I wasn't really worried in terms of not just
making baskets, because that's going to happen in games. This is the
tournament. We can't give up. We have to keep grinding it out. We were getting
good shots and running in transition, they were going on their ball screens,
guys were taking their shots. We just couldn't make any.  
  
But I feel like clamping down defensively and getting rebounds helped us make
more shots. Trying to match them going back and forth wasn't really working
for us. On the defensive side, it helped us get out in transition and get
stops and get easier baskets, then the baskets really started to come.  
  
DWAYNE BROWN: I wasn't really worried, either, because college basketball is a
game of runs, and we weren't hitting shots early. All we had to do is make
sure we stayed together as a team, lock in on the defensive side, because the
game is scoring more than they do. If you stop them from scoring, it would be
easy. We just had to get stops, kills, and make good plays for each other. We
had to make plays for each other, and I think we did a great job on that side.  
  
Q. Outside of Julion, you struggled for 3 of 19 from 3-point range. Is
this something you're going to want to focus on in the next game?  
KOBY McEWEN: If they're there we'll take them. It's not really anything we're
focusing on. We take the shot that's available. We're a good 3-point shooting
team, especially Sam is going to make more shots, I know that for sure. So I'm
not really worried about our 3-point attempts and makes and stuff like that. I
know next game, I know we're going to hit shots, I know we're going to get
good looks. So this is really up to us to knock them down.  
  
Q. What's going to be the key to carry this momentum into that Boise
game? Are you really familiar with them? There's limited energy, back-to-back
games can be tough. What's the key to staying as sharp as you were the second
half today?  
DWAYNE BROWN: Really, it's just playing hard, just playing harder than they
do. Whoever wants it more. And I feel like on the rebounding side we have to
stay locked in on that part, box them out, securing the rebound, and out-
hustling them on the offensive side for our offensive rebounds so we can get
second-chance points. And we need that to carry over into the game because
that's how we need to play all the times.  
  
KOBY McEWEN: We're pretty familiar with Boise. They're a good team. We scout
them really well. We know how to guard them. And all we've got to do is
execute the game plan, make sure that whoever needs to get taken out we take
them out and force them to do what they don't want to do, rebound the ball and
run. Just play free, just play good basketball, move the ball, and I think
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. When you guys beat Boise State at your place, you almost beat them in
Boise, what is it about the matchup that you feel good about when you play
against them?  
DWAYNE BROWN: I think it's just the whole fact of they have Chandler
Hutchison, we have Koby McEwen, and that whole matchup thing. That's how it
looks in my eyes. I'm new to the Mountain West and everything. That's all you
hear, when you hear Boise, you just hear his name.  
  
So that matchup is very real because we're a really good team. We're playing
good. We're altogether and everything like that. And they're really stacked
down the line; they've got point guards, shooting guards, Hutchison plays the
three, he's 6-8. They have a 6-9 power forward, and 6-10, 6-11 center. Down
the line it looks like a great team. But I think we're a very tough team
throughout working through all summer, from our first year being here. I think
we're a very tough team. And I think that's what helps us out when we play
them.  
  
KOBY McEWEN: Yeah, what really helps us out is we know we can play with them.
And we have the utmost confidence in ourselves that we can be on the same
court as Boise, no matter what the standings are. Our guys know that and
believe that, and when we play they play like it.  
  
So like I said, coaches gave us a good game plan for Boise. And once we
execute it we usually do well against them, especially at home this year. So
all we've got to do is do that again, play a little harder, play a little
smarter, make more shots. I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. So you guys definitely got off to a little bit of slow start, 21-7
run and all of a sudden you're back in it. Koby, you had a couple of big shots
in that. Was there something about the timeout break? What was the mentality
during that run?  
KOBY McEWEN: We stayed together. We were poised, we weren't worried about what
they were doing. There were more of us. We were beating ourselves more than
they were beating us.  
  
Once we clamped down on the turnovers, once we started getting rebounds, and
started making shots, stopped turning the ball over, once we did those things,
you know, the game started to slow down for us and we slowly came back in and
it was manageable from there, from halftime on.  
  
So that's really what it was. It was just us being ourselves. And we can do
that at tournament time. Like coach said to us before the game, we've got to
eliminate free points. We gave them a lot of free points. Tournament time
especially, we've got to eliminate that.  
  
Once we started eliminating their free points, and getting kills and stops and
running out in transition, the game started opening up for us.  
  
Q. It's been an up-and-down season, just a big roller coaster. How did
it feel for you to come down here on the biggest stage and lay down 25 points,
6 rebounds, 4 assists, and have the game that you did?  
KOBY McEWEN: Ask the question again.  
  
Q. It's just an up-and-down season, injuries and everything with the
team. How good does it feel to you to come down and put down the game that you
did?  
KOBY McEWEN: It feels great. Coaches and my teammates put me in a great
position to be successful. I did the easy part by just hitting shots. Finding
my teammates, they did great screens for me. I was usually taking what the
defense gave me. And usually when I do that I'm pretty successful.  
  
But all credit to my teammates and my coaching staff. They did a tremendous
job today just helping me out and being successful.  
  
Q. The two-point shooting percentages for each team were quite diverse.
What did you do to execute so well and defend inside so well?  
TIM DURYEA: You know, we've tried to make a bigger emphasis of throwing the
ball inside, and we have some stuff in our package that gets us pretty good
two-point looks. And sometimes we are such a perimeter-oriented team that
sometimes we forget about Alex Dargenton down there at the block. We probably
need to throw him the ball even more. And when we do that, when we did that
today, it was very productive.  
  
I think our guys do a good job of executing in the half court. We have a
pretty diverse set of things that we run, and like I said, try to give us easy
looks. When you run a set play I think you need to look at a layup if you can,
and if the defense makes a mistake, our guys are getting pretty good at
identifying that and taking advantage of it. It's game 32 today and they're
getting a pretty good feel for that.  
  
But I wish we would do a little bit better job of throwing the ball to Alex,
especially Alex on the block. He's gotten better and better, even though he's
fought injuries all year, but he's really pretty confident down there. We need
to get him the ball more.  
  
I thought we did a good job of crowding the ball, changing shots without
fouling. They didn't convert, maybe something they usually do. And then I
thought we did a good job of not letting them get a second shot, which they're
really good at. When they did miss we usually secured the defensive board. I
thought that was huge.  
  
Q. So you were down 20-5, and then Julion hit his first of four 3-point
shots. How big was that, his performance, in helping you get back in the game
the first half?  
TIM DURYEA: We had to have it from somebody. We talked before the game as
coaches, we identified four guys and said two of those four need to shoot it
well today because we know the way Colorado State guards us. They do their
best to take Koby and Sam out of the game. When they do that it opens up some
things for other people; guys like Dwayne Brown, Daron Henson, Diogo Brito,
Julion Pearre. We talked about we need some production from at least two of
those guys. And we had really nothing going, we just didn't have any movement,
any sharpness to what we were doing there at the start of the game.  
  
And Julion popped open a few times, which is kind of the look that they're
going to give us. And he capitalized. So kind of moved the chains for us a
couple of times when we didn't have much going.  
  
Q. Just curious, your thoughts on Boise State, you beat them already
once at your place almost beat them in Boise. What is it about the matchup
that you guys like?  
TIM DURYEA: Yeah, it's hard to say. I don't know what it is about the matchup,
really. I think we play a similar style, maybe explains it as good as
anything. It's not like one team is a power basketball team, the other team is
a finesse team. We both play four out, we ball screen a lot, we rely on ball
movement, screening, playing together, really five-man type basketball. And I
think Boise tries to play the same way. They're up-tempo, we try to be up-
tempo; they're a little better at that than we are, a little deeper.  
  
Maybe the similarities in style result in close games. And you could look, not
only this year, but you can go back three or four years in our games with
Boise and almost every game is a three-point, four-point, five-point game. And
this year in Logan we kind of flipped the script. Usually in the past games
we've led for most of the games and lost the game. In Logan I think Boise led
for as much or more than we did, and then we ended up winning later. It was
probably one of the better games that we've been involved with all year. It
was close the whole game. And I thought it was a great college basketball game
in Logan and was good to finally beat them.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 29, 2018

  

### [Larry Krystkowiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22745)

### [Sedrick Barefield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35219)

### [Justin Bibbins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35213)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State 82, Utah 66  
  
Q. The obvious question: How did this thing escalate? Pretty close game
for a while and you made a run in the third quarter and then what happened
after that?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: They are a good team. I mean, they made plays. We missed
shots, and, you know, it was kind of a home court for them and that's the way
it goes. It's a game of runs and they hit shots and we didn't.  
  
Q. Sedrick, do you have any thoughts on that? Said said no, I agree with
what he said. They made shots. They went on a run and you know, they had their
little MoJo going, especially with the fans. I'm not making any excuses but
they definitely had some great energy today.  
Q. That's your last game --  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: It hit me walking in the tunnel with Sedrick, knowing it's
your last game, last time on the court with this team. We love each other.
It's just the next chapter, though. This chapter ends, another one opens. I'm
excited for the future, but I'm always going to look at this team as family.  
  
Q. Did they do anything different or was it just a matter of trying to
spread the ball around?  
SEDRICK BAREFIELD: I think my teammates did a good job of finding me and Coach
had the confidence in me to shoot it when I was open. That's all really that
happened.  
  
Q. At what point do you think the game turned for you? Obviously it was
close as was mentioned but what happened that you thought it kind of slipped
away?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: I think there was a point in the third of turnovers. I had two
-- they got a lot of those 50/50 balls and scored off of them, and can't do
that when you're basically playing an away game because the fans get going. I
would just say it's turnovers.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the journey of getting to the NIT Championship
game? Or does not winning overshadow that at the moment?  
SEDRICK BAREFIELD: Well, I think it's a great feeling because there's only a
few teams playing at this time of year, no matter if you're in the NCAA
Tournament or the NIT. Playing with this group of guys, probably the most fun
I've had as being part of a team and a culture. It mean something to me, to
us, and I'm sure to everyone.  
  
Q. Is the New York experience a nice way to finish?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: Win or lose, you want to win the game but losing it doesn't
take away from anything. You know, you get to come to New York with your boys.
You've been practicing since August, grinding with them, so nothing is going
to take that away from you, especially playing this deep in March.  
  
Q. You talked early in the season about the adjustments and ups and
downs. What do you think you'll take from this going forward with obviously
another season to come?  
SEDRICK BAREFIELD: Just confidence going into next season. I want to learn
from the guys that are leaving, as far as what they brought to the table, try
to come back next year and improve.  
  
Q. At what point do you think there was a shift where Penn State just
seemed to be running away with it?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: It doesn't just happen. It not like flipping a
switch on, two points, add another two points. You know, for us, in that case
it was all about defense. You know, you've got Stevens is 11-for-15. Got their
point guard, Tony Carr, that almost is one rebound away from a triple-double.  
  
They have some good players and those two are top players in the Big Ten. Give
credit to them. You play the game, only one team is going to win and I've
always all along, ^ defense wins championships. It's been a long time since we
let a team shoot 50 percent from the field. We led the Pac-12 in defensive
field goal percentage. We did a really good job with game plan and preparing
our guys and our guys did a nice job of getting stops.  
  
I don't care if you're in the NIT, the NCAA, baseball, football, whatever it
is, defense wins championships. Plain and simple, they had guys that stepped
up and made plays and when you're taking the ball out of the net and you're
not scoring at the same clip, you can do the math, and that becomes a run.
That's what happened.  
  
I thought there was a difference in -- as one of the guys said, some of the
50/50 balls, loose balls. We got two defensive rebounds in the first half,
clean and then they popped them away and scored. It's just a little bit more
physicality. They have got extra possessions, extra baskets at the rim and we
were flailing around at the rim. There was a lot of baskets from close
proximity that we should have finished and that ends up being a significant
difference I think in the basketball game.  
  
So, you know, it's not that complicated in my mind, but our hand on it.  
  
Q. What happened with David Collette, and obviously he came in for about
two minutes and checked back out. Was he just not able to sustain that?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: I didn't really talk to him. I mean, he got
whacked pretty good. You know, hurt his neck. They were fearful initially of a
concussion and he passed all that, came back in the game. Didn't quite look
like he had it.  
  
Jayce had been giving us some good minutes, but we threw him back in there in
the second half and made a decision for his own health and the betterment of
our team to play with Jayce. I thought Jayce did a good job. It was
unfortunate. We've had a hard time staying healthy at various points with
different things, but no excuses. It was just having a man down was a little
bit difficult, especially with the physical nature of the game I thought.  
  
Q. I think you've talked a little this year about the chemistry and
dynamics. Wonder if you can put into words what this senior group that's
leaving, what it's meant to you and the program?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: I spoke to the team after the game and I can say
without a doubt, I might have had some times at the Milwaukee Bucks as a
player, but there's a lot of years of playing and coaching that I've never
enjoyed the year more from start to finish.  
  
We've been practicing since the end of July because we went on a foreign tour
and that might have been beneficial for a guy like Justin coming into the mix
and needing to get his feet wet with our guys, so it was very beneficial. But
that's a long time, you know. Ten practices, ten days abroad, come back, a lot
of practices here. We've been grinding and we're one of the last teams
standing, still playing and I loved every minute of it. I'd keep going.  
  
You know, it was a testament to our guys. They were enjoyable to come in and
practice every day, and I would say, if we had 100 meetings this year,99 of
them with our coaching staff, involved how to get better as a basketball team,
not how we were going to fix mistakes, problems, guys stepping out of line,
not going to class, getting in trouble, whatever it was.  
  
So it was a real dang good year, and nobody's going to take the fact away that
we got on a nice roll. I think as a coach, you always want to be playing your
best basketball at the right time of year. I think our team improved
throughout the course of the year. I think we were playing real well going
down the stretch. We just ran into a really good team. Could have been one of
those Cinderella finishes, but it wasn't.  
  
We got beat. We got beat. I have no problem when you lose a game. I've told
our guys that for years. I've always felt that way. If a team beats you, shake
their hand and congratulate them, and they outplayed us. You know, we needed
to play better in order to win. But I take a lot of solace in the fact that we
didn't beat ourselves and I really think that guys maximized it and it was a
great college experience. It was a great year to be a part of.  
  
Q. Was there anything in particular about Penn State's guards that you
didn't see in the Pac-12 that was different from what you usually see in your
own league?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, you know, not really. I mean, if you do --
if you're in the middle of a boxing match, we're not exactly in the same
weight class but I'll take Justin Bibbins any day. Although I wouldn't mind
having their point guard, either.  
  
But that's significant, and he took advantage of us in the post, I thought.
You know, seeing over our guys. So there's teams in the Pac-12 that are plenty
big, but this Penn State team, I noticed when I came out after the Western
Kentucky game to watch, they are 6-5, 210 guards and we have Justin and said
Rick who are smaller guards.  
  
We tried to find a way to combat that but weren't able to do it. It was a lot
the same; short time to learn personnel. We've always depended I think a
little bit on game prep and personnel and we made a lot of personnel mistakes
in the game that I think if obviously we were more familiar with them,
hopefully we could have been smart mentally. Sometimes that makes up for some
of that physical difference that we don't have. But it was similar.  
  
Q. I know you dedicated the season to Mr. Huntsman and all that and you
wanted to get this one, but can you talk about getting here and the things
this team accomplished and how you're feeling at the moment?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: It's the time of my life, actually. I talked
about it, how great the season was, and to be able to do this, to be a part of
it. I've always been on the outside. Never been in the Final Four of the NIT
but I've talked to coaches that were here. I talked to a coach that's -- I
won't mention his name; he's actually gone to a Final Four NCAA Tournament,
and went to the NIT one year and won it, and said of all his experiences, the
NIT was the best experience.  
  
Looking from outside-in, you're always kind of watching the NIT, and maybe you
think of it as the consolation prize or whatever, but man, when you're in the
middle of it at a competitor and a coach and you're winning games and you're
in the Garden, and some of the tradition that's been around here, people on
the outside writing articles, have comments, opinions about what's going on.
They have no idea how cool this was for us.  
  
Again, nobody's going to take it away and it was an absolute highlight and
especially being with this group.  
  
Q. For a guy like Sedrick, I think early in the season there was talk
about expectations and him adjust to go playing off the ball more and off the
bench and he's had a lot going on this season, to finish strong, do you feel
like you've seen some growth or development or value that's going to carry
into next season for him?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: I hope so. It's part of the process. It's
written all over our practice facility. You know, you don't just flip a
switch. These kids are young. Sedrick just finished a year and a half of
college. He's going to be a senior next year but he's competed for a year and
a half. He was with us at Christmastime last year. I would expect him to be
better. He was one, like a lot of guys, that started to figure some things
out, some roles.  
  
I told him when I met with him two weeks ago before the NIT Tournament, "We
can't go to New York without you." Put him in the starting lineup and things
changed. Certain kids respond differently. But I would hope he's ready. I
don't expect him to get home and start working right now for next year. We
need to decompress.  
  
But being one of the seniors for next year, and us knowing some of his
limitations and strengths, gives us the opportunity to work with him in the
off-season and I would expect some big things out of him and a number of our
other young guys, so that's all part of it.

_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State 82, Utah 66  
  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: What an incredible year, you know, 26 wins and to
finish on such a high note for this team and staff and program, credit goes to
these guys. We had a foreign tour. We've been gone for a long time. There's so
much love in our locker room and within the program in general, and that's why
you're able to rebound from not hearing your name on Selection Sunday. The
guys came out and competed for the last few weeks.  
  
And think about the teams we lost to: Michigan and Purdue, one is at Sweet 16
and one is at the Final Four. I think we've proven to a lot of people across
the country that Penn State basketball is here to stay. It's not just a
steppingstone, it's a destination.  
  
Q. Was there any sort of point in the season where you thought you guys
really started playing together as a team and it really got rolling, and was
there any reason for that?  
LAMAR STEVENS: I think think we really found ourselves, when Josh Reeves was
out -- when he came back, it added more to the team. With his leadership and
his ability to impact the game, I think that's when we really realized how
good of a team we could be. I think from then on, our confidence was high sky
and we were playing at a really high level.  
  
Q. Tony, this NIT run, you guys have had a pretty decent run, just the
margin of victory, have you been surprised at the lack of resistance or the
dominance?  
TONY CARR: No, I definitely wasn't surprised. We're a great team. We have
great players and we play great defense. So once the defensive end is taken
care of, the offense just comes and it's kind of hard to stop us because we
have so many great players and shooters. We're not surprised that we can be
dominant.  
  
Q. For the three, you all came from the same AU program in high school
and now you won a championship here at Penn State. How does it feel?  
SHEP GARNER: It feels great. It feels great to know that we all come from the
same place and we end up playing together in college. We did something
special. You know, it's a great team. It's a great team. It's the most
connected team I've ever been a part of. You know, this group of guys, I
wouldn't pick another group of guys to do it with, another coaching staff.
This is definitely special.  
  
Q. Do you think you guys have the foundation going forward as far as
Penn State basketball? You had a great run postseason wise but now you guys
are rocking and rolling like Coach said, 26 wins, sky's the limit. What do you
think?  
SHEP GARNER: I think we do, we set the standard. We preach, you know, defend
and rebound, but now we have something that we can always go to, you know, to
say we won something, we're champions.  
  
We can still always go back to say, you know, we still didn't make the
Tournament, so you can always go back to something. If you ever need any
motivation, you can always go back to this or that. This is definitely going
to be something special moving forward with this program.  
  
Q. Tony, you heard the chants, I'm assuming of one more year. How will
you handle the process from here in?  
TONY CARR: I'm talking to the coaching staff and talking to my family, and
just make the best decision going forward.  
  
Q. Lamar, how do you feel scoring your thousandth point in the Garden?  
LAMAR STEVENS: It was a great feeling, you know. It was better just winning
this championship, though. It's a great accolade but I'd much rather have the
Championship any day.  
  
Q. What worked in the second half that enabled you guys to pull away
after a five-point lead at halftime?  
LAMAR STEVENS: I think we really started focusing in on the defensive end.
Barefield he really had it going in the first half, and we really focused in
on shutting him down. We were able to get stops and get out in transition.  
  
Q. You all had a great run -- this is for any of the players -- you had
a great run over these last few weeks. Going back to the Temple game in the
first round, you were down for a lot of the game and it was a hard-fought game
going into the fourth quarter. You held them to single digits over that fourth
quarter. Can you talk about that? Was that a source of momentum? That was the
most competition you've faced for the whole tournament.  
SHEP GARNER: All year, we've been figuring out ways to win. Coach always says
great teams, elite teams, figure out ways to win, and over and over, we were
doing that.  
  
That game, it was tough for us, but again, we found a way to win. That's what
great teams do.  
  
Q. Tony, you guys in the semifinals, you went on a 24-0 run. Tonight you
went on a big run late in the third quarter. Just what caused the spurts for
you guys?  
TONY CARR: Defense. You can't go on a run unless the team is scoring -- we
just locked down on defense.  
  
Q. Shep, there's -- I suppose there's a process that teams have to go
through mentally when they don't get in the tournament and they think there
might be a chance. What happened during the fourth quarter of the Temple game,
and then afterward? Did you guys come to a resolution that this is where we
are, so we're going to do the best we can? That's what it looked like.  
SHEP GARNER: Yeah, you know, that was Coach. Coach told us, we're here. We've
got to come out and compete, compete and win a championship. From first day in
practice, he said New York in the huddle and that was our goal. Any time we
were a little sluggish, he always went back to New York. You know, we've got
to get to New York; we've got to win a championship in New York. You can
always go back to that, and to see that we achieved the goal that we set out
to get, great.  
  
Q. What about that? The Temple game, it just didn't look -- until the
end of the Temple game, it didn't look like they were into it and after that
they were gangbusters --  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I think Temple is that good. Fran Dunphy is a
Hall of Fame Coach in my opinion. Temple is really long with Quinton Rose and
Josh Brown. I thought they really did a great job on Cody. That was Tony's
probably worst game of the entire years he's been here; you would agree with
that.  
  
I think they did a good job on Shep, too. If you go back to that game, Josh
Reeves was our leading scorer. He was really good from three-point land, and
then we got some stops late we turned them over late and we were able to step
up.  
  
So I don't want to put that on these kids. I'd rather take, Temple played that
well. That was like a big five game. It reminded me of a big five game through
and through where nobody is going to give up an inch and it was very physical
and it was going to be tough to score and we knew that.  
  
I felt like by winning that game, that was huge, on so many levels, but I knew
it was going to take us into the next opponent, which turned out to be Notre
Dame. We were going to feel really confident because we knew that was going to
be so difficult.  
  
Q. You mentioned about Purdue and Michigan, but it seems like your whole
conference prepared you guys for this tournament.  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I'd agree with that. It's a shame the Big Ten
didn't get much respect on Selection Sunday but playing on the road in the Big
Ten is brutal. They are sold out everywhere. I think the Big Ten, once again,
41 and 42 years now, leads in attendance, so everywhere you go, it's packed.
We got to a point where we started feeling more comfortable on the road; and I
think you see that, beating Notre Dame on St. Patrick's Day; and Marquette in
the Al McGuire 3700 and we were able to get some big time wins.  
  
We love this place. We came here a few years ago against Michigan; St. John's
last year, and then played really well in the Big Ten Tournament. Trust me, if
I can get back here next year, I'm going to try.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense. The game you had against Utah tonight, what
was the key to the success?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: You know, I watched as much film as I could, and
they scared me. They reminded me of Northwestern, a little bit of Michigan, a
little bit of Wisconsin, usually take care of the ball. Don't really foul. I
mean, the one quarter they had zero and we had five, and they usually don't
hurt themselves and they drill threes. They made 14 in a game; they made 12 in
a game. Watching that St. Mary's overtime game it was amazing. To play at St.
Mary's, I see how difficult it was, I've never been there personally but Fran
Fraschilla talked about it, really hard to beat St. Mary's.  
  
So we knew it was going to be a really difficult game. We wanted to take away
threes and make sure we limit them to one possession, and we wanted to take
care of the ball, and I think we did that for the most part.  
  
Q. You mentioned you felt this program was now a destination after
tonight. Considering where it started the season and there was talk about
maybe being on the hot seat and possibly not being able to really get it
going, how much more validating is it to bring a championship back?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I've been on the hot seat for seven years. So
you've just got to try to do it the right way and you've got to try to bring
in big I'm players and you've got to have an administration that support you.  
  
When all that is aligned and you partner up and you just keep working, you
know eventually it's going to swing your way and it finally did. If I didn't
have my family, who is back over there to the right, and my wife, you know,
she is amazing to support me the way she does. I can't thank her enough
because being the wife of a coach, is absolutely brutal, because the losses
never leave us and the wins are just not gratifying enough.  
  
But this one, this one's going to be gratifying.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the maturation of Tony since he came on campus till
now? Early on people labeled him as a high-volume shooter but tonight, not his
best game shooting-wise, but 14 assists and nine rebounds. Can you speak to
his overall development?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: He worked so hard in the off-season. He put on 25
pounds and he needed to begin to trust and he started to trust. He started to
believe and he trusted his teammates. You can see his assists have
skyrocketed. He really shared the ball. You go back to the Ohio State game in
the Garden on that Friday night where you know he wants to take the shot, I
want him to take the shot but doesn't take the shot, and that's a kid who has
grown. We talk about growth mindset. We talk about growing and emerging
leadership, and I think Tony embodies all of that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the significance of winning this tournament and
what it means to the program?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I think it's a springboard for us, to win 26
games, to cut down some Nets, that means winning. You're winning; you're
finding success, and that helps everything out. That helps ticket sales. That
helps recruiting. That helps so much and I know ticket sales are already up
for the bjc next year. We have created a lot of excitement but it's definitely
a validation of how hard the staff has worked, and the risk and the
trailblazing that a lot of these players took to say yes to us.  
  
Q. Tony has grown an awful lot in the last two months, and now he's all
over the draft lists. What are you going to tell him?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: You know what, I've been collecting a lot of
information and I'm going to do what's best for Tony, and whatever that is.
Talk to his family, talk to him, and if he thinks it's best to go, I'm going
to encourage him to go. If he thinks it's best to stay from the feedback that
we get, then he should test the waters. So he's got a couple different
options.  
  
Q. That's never happened at Penn State where anyone had to worry about
an early entry.  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Exciting. We haven't had a pro since Calvin Booth
in 1999 --  
  
Q. I think Joe Crispin played a little bit --  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Drafted. I'm talking about drafted.  
  
Q. No. He played.  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Was he drafted?  
  
Q. No.  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I meant drafted.  
  
Lamar, I think with the way he played, too, he should think about testing the
waters, as well, and if Mike wasn't hurt, I would tell him to do it.  
  
It's exciting what we have coming about a being and how About big John, not
saying he's a pro but he just got us 12 rebounds. We've got ourselves some
good big men.  
  
Q. What I was getting at, is this some sort of positive?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Absolutely. It's only a positive. It's a win/win
for everybody. If he stays it's a win. If he goes, it's a win. What he has
done for this program; if he goes, we can say we finally developed a pro and
it's recruiting. So people are going to want to come to Penn State.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 28, 2018

  

### [Larry Krystkowiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22745)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: We're thrilled to be a part of the final. We
certainly didn't out of the gates in a positive fashion. We had a number of
mistake, mental mistakes, physical mistakes early in the ballgame and dug
ourselves a pretty significant hole and then I think once we were able to make
a few shots and kind of get the jitters out, did a much better job from a
defensive standpoint holding that team to I think it's 38 percent, and then
winning the rebound game was huge.  
  
Got tremendous leadership I think, again, from Justin Bibbins, able to make
all 12 of his free throws. We did a nice job sharing the ball, and as a lot of
the games, when you get to maybe the 16 of the NIT, NCAA Tournament, whatever
tournament you're in, when you get to this point, it really has gotten down to
one or two possessions in a lot of our ballgames and Western Kentucky's
ballgames, we've managed in the St. Mary's game and then last night to make
plays at the right time.  
  
It's something we've preached all season is that there are no little things.
We took a couple big charges late in the game and managed to hit our free
throws. So proud of the guys, but we're going to have to be significantly
better.  
  
Penn State is a really good team. I have a lot of respect; I sat and watched
last night's game and we're getting after some film, and they are playing real
well and firing on all cylinders. We've got to be markedly better tomorrow
night to be competitive.  
  
Q. Your feelings to being in the finals at the Garden and what is your
feelings about that?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: It's an unbelievable experience for our guys. We
have four seniors who have played an awful lot of college basketball, and each
step of the way in this NIT process, from the opening game against U.C. Davis
at home where you still -- there's a little bit of, you know, residual
disappointment from not being in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
You get through that game, you take care of LSU, and the closer you get to New
York, the more exciting it becomes, and then obviously when you're able to get
the win in the semifinal game and you're one game from being an NIT champion,
I think it's a tremendous feeling.  
  
But at the same time, you know, looking ahead at our opponent, you've got a
little bit of time for prep. It's an uneasy feeling at the same time but we're
really proud of our guys and we're having the time of our life, and we need to
try to be that team that's cutting the nets down at the end of this thing.  
  
Q. You said you saw Penn State last night. What did you think of No. 10,
Tony Carr?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, you know, I happened to see him live last
night but I've watched some of the teams, Marquette game was one of the ones I
remember seeing. Reminds me of Damian Lillard to be honest with you, who was
at Weaver State in our home state of Utah, watched him kind of grow up.  
  
You know, a big guard, tremendous passer, tremendous scorer, three-point
range. It's a little eerie, really, when you look at him and you see the kid
live to make that comparison. But he's certainly the head of the snake, and a
leader on that team and quite a playmaker. So we're going to have our hands
full.  
  
You know, he's got the rare combination I think of the three point range. He's
shooting about 44 percent from three. You know, the mid-range game is there,
and then his assist to turnover ratio is tremendous, as well. Plus he guards.
He guards and they control the ball in the post, so extremely versatile and
can see why they are where they are at.  
  
Q. Looking at Penn State, what kind of challenge does Lamar Stevens
present as you're getting ready for tomorrow night?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: It's not just Stevens. It's a handful. They have
so many weapons. You look at their team and they have so many guys scoring in
double figures. You know, he's a physical presence, I think at 4-man, 3-man,
slasher. Been playing really well.  
  
Been playing as well for them in the NIT as anybody, and that's one of the
things you look at is the last five, the conference, as a player, that has
gotten better as the season has gone along. He got in a little bit of foul
trouble last night but you know, it's a little bit of a mismatch.  
  
He can shoot threes, but I think his physical presence, his rebounding
ability, blocking shots, you know, blocking over a shot a game. So he's kind
of the prototypical Big Ten player that you think of, you know, and when I
walked out on the court last night and was watching the game, it looked like
an NBA style team. There's some big bodies and they spend a lot of time in the
weight room and he's definitely a physical presence that sets that tone for
them.  
  
Q. You mentioned at the top of this call that you think if you guys want
to compete tomorrow night, you have to be remarkably better. What are the
things that you kind of want to see from your team tomorrow night that you
know you've got to do against this Penn State team?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: There's just so many facet in the scouting
report, and we had ample time last night. We had four days plus to get ready
for Western Kentucky and we've always taken a great amount of pride in the
detail we put into a scouting report and trying to get tendencies and actions
and different things to give ourselves a fighting chance.  
  
You know, the game is a lot of the physical side of it as much as anything,
but especially at this time of year is your mental preparation. Let's face it,
us and Penn State aren't going to be able to go into the gym today and
practice for two hours, so it's a little bit like an NBA season where you've
got to digest as much of the preparation, the film work, the walk-through as
you can, and I was extremely disappointed with our guys last night with the
way that game started. We.  
  
Made a number of errors in how we guarded Johnson on the perimeter. We gave
him two threes where nobody was within distance on him. We were out on the
perimeter guarding slashers, drivers, real close and letting them beat us and
when we did get them to miss shots early, we didn't rebound.  
  
So it was a disaster, and that would have been the message. If we don't win
that game, it really wasn't about anything physical as much as it was mental,
and when you play this Penn State team, it's such a challenge from a physical
point of view, you know, that if you don't have the mental side in
preparation, I think that's probably my biggest point is, you know, here we
are, now we've got a shorter amount of time to prep. We're going to give them
some stuff in the cliff note form, and if we don't digest that, we're going to
be in big trouble. That's going to be a key for us.  
  
Q. Pat Chambers was asked this last night, a hypothetical: Would you
rather be winning the NIT or going to the NCAA and losing in the first
round?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: I'd rather be where we are. I've thought about
that a lot. Some of it, it's easy to talk about in a hypothetical, because we
sign up for this, No. 1, to compete and to play, and I've been on the other
end of it where you lose the first round. And there's so much emotion built up
into a season.  
  
The goal is getting to the NCAA Tournament -- and you lose a first round game.
You know, it's great, but that's really not the feeling you want to have,
either. There's a lot of failure built into that. This is about experiences.
This is about competing.  
  
And for us, you know, to get the additional five or six -- I think it's five
games, and have an opportunity to win and continue to bond; I love this team
and this team loves playing with each other, so I get it where a basketball
purist junk key would say, gee, we should fire our coach is he says that
because this is the consolation prize; how dare he say that.  
  
Until you're in our shoes, coming to New York City and being in the Final Four
in the NIT in a city with so much history and tradition -- look, I got an
e-mail from Arnie Ferrin who played on Utah's team in 1947 when they won the
NIT Championship, and there's still three living members on that team and we
were all on a big thread.  
  
When he says to me, "Coach, one more, man, bring home the trophy" and the
pride in all of that, to me, that is much more significant than getting to the
NCAA Tournament and losing your first game.  
  
You know, if people want to run me out of town for that answer, I guess I'm
going to live with it but they are not in our shoes and this has just been a
great experience for us, and I don't think we'd trade it for anything in the
world to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Coach Chambers said basically the same thing.  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Yeah, you know, it's a little bit of a loaded
question, but I do know this: I know there's two coaches, two teams, that
finish their season without any disappointment, right. In my mind, it's the
NCAA national champion, and if we are fortunate enough to cut the net down
tomorrow night, nobody is going to take that away from us. There's going to be
far more disappointment in any of those other situations than having an
opportunity to do that.  
  
So you know, I just love the fact that we've got a chance and we've got a lot
of respect for Pat, and I think as coaches and players, we're all kind of
wired the same way.  
  
Q. Do you have an update on Jayse Johnson and his ankle, if you think
he'll be ready to play tomorrow?  
HEAD COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: I don't yet. We've been meeting as a coaching
staff and I know our training staff, I tell you, I'll put them up against
anybody at the country, having a chance to get him back. He unfortunately
sprained his ankle in our shootaround practice Monday.  
  
It wasn't a severe-grade ankle sprain, but so much of that is kind of
dependent on how the first 48 hours go and we're almost to that point, so we
should know a little bit more here in the next hour or so. I'm hopeful. I'm
hopeful.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 28, 2018

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: We're obviously very excited to be playing in the
championship game, to be able to beat Mississippi State last night, a very
good SEC team, a well-coached team. Ben Howland is one of the best in the
business, Hall of Fame coach. Our guys were ready to play. They competed at a
high level.  
  
I thought we did some good things on the defensive end that really dictated
the offensive end for us. So as long as we can do that -- now, Utah can make a
ton of threes; they have had 12 and 14 in some NIT games this year. We'll have
our hands full. We'll watch some film, break it down, prepare, and we'll be
ready to go at 7:00 tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I wanted to know, in reference to Tony Carr's performance last night,
he had a good game. What do you think about his performance in the game last
night?  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: Yeah, I think him and Shep really set the tone in the
first quarter. I mean, Tony ended up with 21-5-6, which is great. He played
great defense, as well. He's been an emerging leader.  
  
You know, I think since the game at Ohio State, he really came into his own,
and he stepped up last night. Like I said, with his energy and shot-making
ability and facilitating, I really felt like he dictated the pace in tempo for
us.  
  
Q. How well prepared are you for Utah tomorrow night?  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: We're going to break down film as much as possible. I
had a lot of guys play critical minutes -- I'm looking at it now: 40, 37, 30,
30, so that's a lot of minutes for our starters.  
  
So we're going to prepare. We're going to be smart. We'll go through a walk-
through today and get rest and then do a little bit -- get some shots up, free
throws, things of that nature but make sure we rest our bodies and minds for
sure.  
  
Q. When you recruited Tony Carr, did you expect what you're getting from
him? Is he exceeding it?  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: For me, it's got to go to his IQ. He's got such a
high IQ. He really sees the floor. He's every bit of 6-5.  
  
I knew we were getting a good player. I knew he could make shots, but I think
his shooting from three has really impressed me the most. He put in a lot of
work in the off-season to improve his shooting. Obviously he was in the low
30s last year, and you know what, he fell in love with the weight room.  
  
So really his work ethic overall has really been impressive, his high IQ. He
makes everybody around him much better.  
  
I think Shep Garner has been the benefit of Tony Carr being on the floor,
having seen Shep Garner with a school record from three. And Lamar Stevens is
five points away from scoring a thousand; I think Tony Carr really set those
guys up for success.  
  
Q. How have you seen Lamar develop this year?  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: You know, the Lamar Stevens I think we all want to
see is the one from last night. He was really efficient: 17 points, eight
rebounds, six assists, took care of the basketball, played very good defense.  
  
I mean, if we can bottle that up, we can really move Lamar around, he's a real
perimeter threat and he showed his ability to pass and rebound last night.
Without Mike, for him to get eight rebounds is big and he's going to need to
continue to do that and definitely going to need to do that tomorrow night for
us at 7:00.  
  
Q. For you guys, with as many young guys as you have playing big minutes
for you, is the motivation you feel like in the championship game, and maybe
some of the carryover, a little bit different than, say, a Utah where they're
talking about the seniors and talking about sending them out the right way.
How do you feel that's different and how is the motivation for you different,
carrying some of this over into next year and future seasons?  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: Yeah, I think our goal was to get to New York and our
goal was now to get to the championship game and obviously cut down nets;
that's the same for Utah and Larry.  
  
Shep Garner has been an incredible leader over the last 60 days. I think we're
playing for him and Julian Moore. I know there's four seniors on Utah, but we
have two that play critical minutes for us, and we need to remember who we're
playing for and what it's about.  
  
As far as the young guys, the sophomores, these experiences are critical in
our development. These guys are really beginning to grow and find success and
winning really helps because prior to that, we only won 15 games last year.  
  
So for them to be at 25, second-most wins in the history of Penn State
basketball, which is 122-year history, is terrific. So this has got to be a
springboard for us, but as long as they continue to compete, continue to grow,
continue to embrace these experiences, it can only help us for our future.  
  
Q. On the call a couple minutes ago, Larry said that the biggest thing
he was aggravated with with his team was mentally they just weren't prepared.
You can't say that about Penn State last night. Do you think that's where you
have a big advantage in this one?  
HEAD COACH PAT CHAMBERS: I don't think there's a big advantage at all because
he's got four seniors out there and they want to go out on a high note.
There's only going to be two teams or a couple teams in the country that are
going to end their season with a win.  
  
I think the Big Ten Tournament being at Madison Square Garden has given us a
little -- a slight advantage. Our fans, our alums, Penn Staters, the
administration coming out the way that they did last night and I feel good
that they will be out again Thursday night. That support is going to be huge
for us. We also try to get Penn State basketball into the Garden over the last
few years.  
  
Obviously the Michigan game a few years ago, St. John's last year; so that's
really helped us I think in the Mississippi State game because a lot of those
kids have never been to New York, they never played at the Garden and so it
was all very knew. Utah has a game under their belt. They will be prepared for
Thursday night.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Rick Stansbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13776)

### [Justin Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35212)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Utah 69, Western Kentucky 64  
  
COACH COACH RICK STANSBURY: Well, first off, give Utah credit. They made the
plays in the last minute of the game that you've got to make sometimes to win
games, and they stepped up and made their free throws and hit the big three to
kind of give them a little bit of separation.  
  
You know, these kind of games, it's a fine line, winning and losing. And
again, we can all look back on different plays that we could have and should
have made and we didn't make, or a call here or there. When you're playing
good teams, you know, like Utah, this late in the year, all of them are fine
lines. Like I say, give them credit making the plays.  
  
But I'm also proud of our team. Like I said, we didn't win the basketball
game, but it doesn't take away or diminish what these young men did this year.
I'm all of proud for them. I know it hurts right now, three seniors, but these
guys can all walk away and hold their heads up high. Western Kentucky won
because of them and all three of them won individually, too. Proud for them.  
  
And again, there's not going to be but two happy teams. Everybody is going to
have this feeling. The team that wins in the NIT National Championship and the
team that wins the NCAA Championship.  
  
Right now, I guess there's six teams left that's going to have this feeling,
and that's it. Again, we're not going to let this feeling take away what these
guys accomplished this year, and all of proud of them.  
  
Q. What did you see on the last play with about 40 seconds on the
drive?  
JUSTIN JOHNSON: Coach, we scored on the play before. Coach puts the ball in my
hands to make a play, and I don't think it's a charge. That's about -- I
thought it was going up. I thought he slid under me. I had already left my
feet.  
  
The call, you can't change a call. We still were up one, and you get a stop,
you still have a chance to win a ballgame.  
  
Q. I know it's obviously fresh on your mind with the loss, but can you
just sum up just how much your career has meant how, these four years, how
much you'll remember these for the rest of your life?  
JUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, I wish I had another year in a Hilltopper uniform.
This year has been by far the best year of my career. I mean, coming here four
years ago, if I had the chance to come here again and go through the same
thing, I would do it over again.  
  
It's been nothing but good to me, even with the ups and downs, I've loved
every minute of it. And like I said, I wish I had redid this year and had
another year with the same group of guys in that locker room. I've made best
friends for a lifetime in that locker room this year, the fun we've had and
the memories we've made. Like I said, you wish you had one more go around with
those guys.  
  
Q. You got off to such a hot start, 18-5 and offensively things were
clicking. Did they do anything differently to slow you down? What were the
offensive struggles after that hot start?  
JUSTIN JOHNSON: They stayed in the zone pretty much the whole game. Nothing
really changed. Just we missed some shots around the basket and we took too
many threes early in that game. You know, we got kind of out of rhythm a
little bit. We let the offense affect our defense in that second quarter when
we had that lead, and then we had a couple costly turnovers that led to easy
baskets for them.  
  
You know, but nothing they did really sped us up. They stayed in that zone the
whole game until probably about the last couple minutes.  
  
Q. I think I recall you saying once that you wanted to leave this
program in better shape when you came and when you left. Do you feel like
you've done that, especially after this season?  
JUSTIN JOHNSON: That's one thing I told Coach, too. In years to come, I still
want to be involved with this program, when I'm back in town and everything.
That was my goal when I came here. You know, you want to leave something
better than you found it, and leave an impression on it. I hope to have done
that and help those young guys in that locker room, along the way, whether
it's in life or basketball.  
  
You know, I hope that I'm leaving it in a better spot.  
  
Q. Seemed like the last few minutes, guys had trouble with the shots.
What was the offensive break down at the end? It was right there for you it
seemed like.  
COACH COACH RICK STANSBURY: Well, everything gets magnified towards the end.
You can go back -- one of you guys asked a question early. Sometimes when you
shoot a lot of threes and make some, it can be fool's gold a little bit.
That's not our strength.  
  
You know, we shot some threes early, made some, got some separation, and
probably fell in love with it a bit too much early and shot too many threes.
That's not who we are.  
  
And again, you know, the game probably in that second quarter is when they
made that run and got back and tied it backup. Again, everything is magnified
towards the end. You know, but toward the end, all these plays you look back
on. There's always some fouls that you don't need to commit that leads to
bonuses, two shots, and there's always going to be plays throughout 40 minutes
that you're not going to like the call.  
  
But that's where it is. It comes down; winning and losing is a fine line. If
one of those plays goes the other way, you know, it may be different. And give
them credit. They made those plays and they made the two free throws on that
foul and you know, 4-man steps out and majors a huge three. He was 1-for-6
till he makes one, and so he stepped up and made a timely one.  
  
We didn't do a good job -- the wide lane is probably not to our advantage
against the zone because it stands our post guys away from the basket a little
bit farther. Dwight needs to be around that rim as close as he can and it
probably affected him some.  
  
But still, with all that, we didn't shoot it great, Darius goes 1-for-10.
Darius goes 1-for-10, Taveion goes 3-for-10, and we still, under a minute to
go, it's a one-possession game and that probably hurts more than anything
because we know there's a lot of plays we could have gotten that we left on
that floor that we didn't make. But again, Utah is a very good team, and they
are not the No. 2 seed for what they have done for no reason. They jumped up
and made some plays.  
  
Q. How much were these last two and a half weeks and what you did in the
NIT something that you can really build off of and take into next year and
beyond?  
COACH COACH RICK STANSBURY: You know, we always want to be on a platform where
you're competing for championships and creating some excitement. I think the
biggest thing, besides the experience these young men have had, I think it's
just not for them but for our league. I think people look at our league again
and understand how good our league is, and our whole university, Western
Kentucky. You like seeing that town turned upside down with excitement. That's
the way it used to be. That's the way it needs to be. That's what it's about.  
  
You love to see the excitement of coming here and playing. Everybody benefits
from that. You know, we want people feeling good about Western Kentucky. We
want to believe when we get off that bus to come here and play, we've got a
chance to win, and that was the belief. That's what you want as a coach and as
a player.  
  
Now, doesn't mean you're going to win every one of them. All you can ask for
is an opportunity. We had an opportunity tonight; we didn't finish it off.
Utah finished it off. Like I said, there's going to be two happy teams; those
two teams that win a national championship. Everybody else is going to have
some disappointment.  
  
But we are not going to let any disappointment, after we can reflect just a
little bit, take away from what this team accomplished, the kind of people
they were. They are sure not about a W or an L. I have some high-character
guys, like Justin said, that have fought, overcame a lot of different things
and put themselves in this position.  
  
And again, there's eight teams left in America playing, eight teams. And
Western Kentucky is one of those eight teams. You know what's good about it?
We're disappointed. We're disappointed we're still not playing. I like that. I
like that. That means there's some expectations, there's some feelings; how
good we are and how good we can be.  
  
Q. Can you summarize what Justin has meant in the two years you've been
here and the four years he's been here in his career?  
COACH COACH RICK STANSBURY: You know, again, last year, didn't know what we
had, and you guys understand the situation. Kind of what we had last year. You
know, coming back this year, kind of a whole new group. You know, we didn't
have Justin until August the 5th, as you guys know. And like I said, he was 30
pounds heavier and had a bum knee.  
  
But the one thing he's been able to give us because of his character is great
leadership. You know, when you get guys lead by example -- and he's really
changed who he was when I first got here. You know, I think his first year, it
was hard for him to really lead by example because he probably took a shortcut
as much as he could.  
  
But he matured through that. He grew up through that and he got better through
it. When you get your best player being one of your hardest workers every day,
then you've got some leadership.  
  
And when you got good people then around him, you get them to follow a little
bit. That's kind of what this group was. Let's start with Justin. I put a lot
of confidence in him and he never took advantage of that because he's a high-
character guy and again, you know, just what he accomplished tells you just
how good a player he was.  
  
We all can see -- I remember this. His first two years as a player, I think he
made one three-point shot and everybody said he got lucky on that. Threw it in
against somebody. But he deserves a lot of credit for getting in that gym the
last two years, made 40- or 50-plus each year and that's a huge improvement,
and that's enabled him to be a better player, it's made our team better and
it's helped him long-term, too.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Larry Krystkowiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22745)

### [David Collette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28553)

### [Justin Bibbins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35213)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Utah - 69, Western Kentucky - 64  
  
Q. Coach, how did that feel? How did that feel here in New York?  
COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: That was a great experience. That was awesome.
Nothing like it.  
  
Q. For both Justin and Dave, what do you feel like early on, was it just
a matter of getting into the flow of the game and what changed as you guys
went along for you to get going offensively and tighten up defensively?  
DAVID COLLETTE: I just feel like we came out flat with no energy. Biggest
thing was just getting our guys going, getting some more energy, flying around
out there. That's all we needed.  
  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: Just like Dave said, we came out flat, I think just to get the
jitters out a little bit. Once we got going, it was fine and we played our
type of basketball and we knew, you know, if we kept chipping away, we'll be
fine.  
  
Q. Justin, you came up huge at the end with the offensive foul you drew.
Have you felt like you've had to take the team on your shoulders?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: No, I wouldn't say take it all on my shoulders because the
Saint Mary's game, Sedrick had a big game, and I didn't play that well.  
  
But late in the game, I just, you know, was trying to make a play. Coaches was
telling me when I drove on the paint, people were opening on the outside, and
I looked out and Ty was wide open and I just tried to make the right play and
I was happy he knocked it down.  
  
Q. Did you guys do anything different on the Johnson kid there, or was
it just a matter of executing a little bit better because it seemed after the
first quarter, you had like ten and then you guys were able to tighten up a
little bit and make make it a little more tougher for them.  
DAVID COLLETTE: Our game plan was kind of the same on him but we decided to be
a little more aggressive with him and work on not letting him get the ball
more. We were letting him get too much touches down there, so we were trying
to be a little bit more aggressive and keep him from getting touches.  
  
Q. Justin, 12-for-12 from the line, can you talk about hitting key free
throws down the stretch, too.  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: They were fouling. You know, the new rule, you get two shots.
So I was happy to go to the line and get those two and just take my time, and
once I got into the flow and made four in a row, I tried to get there more
because my shot wasn't falling on the outside. I just went to the basics and
knocked them down.  
  
Q. For both you guys, what does it mean to know that you're going to be
playing for an NIT Championship in a couple days here?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: It means the world to us. We're seniors, this is our last go-
around playing with the guys, and you know, I love this team. I keep wanting
to play with them every day, and to extend the game won more day. And to do
shootaround and another game with them, this just means the world to us.  
  
DAVID COLLETTE: Yeah, I mean, just excited, couldn't go out any better way,
you know. Disappointed, obviously, wanted to make it to the NCAA Tournament,
but making it to the NIT Championship, I'll take that any day.  
  
Q. For either player, how do you prepare for tomorrow's game? You don't
really know the opponent yet. How will you prepare? Will you watch or how will
you get ready for tomorrow's game?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: Just like any game, we're going to enjoy this win and get some
good food in us. Just like any game, we're going to prepare the same way and
take it one game at a time and watch film on them, whoever wins, and just
focus on what we can do to win the game.  
  
Q. Dave, before you left Salt Lake, you said you were going to bring a
trophy back home. Can you talk about being one step closer? It was a battle,
wasn't it.  
DAVID COLLETTE: It absolutely was a battle. That's the whole goal we've had
the whole time is come to New York and enjoy ourselves and we thought the
whole time we could win this thing and bring back the trophy, and we're there.
We stick by our word this time.  
  
Q. You got the win a little differently than normal, you out-rebounded
your opponents and didn't really hit a lot of threes. Do you feel like you're
diverse enough that you can do whatever you need to to get that W?  
JUSTIN BIBBINS: That felt good that we out rebounded a team and found a way to
win. We're trying to find different ways to win games, and that was huge for
us to outrebound them. They are a great rebounding team and you know, threes
aren't falling, that just shows the maturity of this team that we can find a
different way to win the game and go inside and, you know, hit free throws.
We're piecing it together now and for the final game and it feels really good.  
  
COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Fire away, I think I know your question.  
  
Q. Considering, I think Josh mentioned, out-rebounding them, and then
the key charges at the end. To win in that sort of fashion, does it mean
anything different? Does it have anything more on it, just the way you guys
won that?  
COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, it's interesting because there were some key
components I thought. You know, and to get -- to answer your first question
about the slow start, we gave Johnson two threes, which we knew we couldn't
do. That's six points. And then I think they missed five shots and they got
all offensive rebounds.  
  
And then we're sitting there at halftime, we turned the ball over eight times
and they scored 15 points off of our turnovers, so they basically got two
points for every turnover; we really felt like if we would quit turning the
ball over, those pick-sixes are impossible to defend if the half ended.  
  
And then once we got rebounds, and had a little bit better idea with
personnel, gave ourselves a chance. You know, you make enough shots with the
lead changes back and forth.  
  
This time of year, it's funny, because you watch NCAA games -- and I've told
our team since the beginning, you watch NCAA games, NIT games, whatever it is,
and the concept in my mind is that there are no little things. You'll see a
missed block-out, free throw block-out, something that everybody perceives as
little, that ends up changing the trajectory of the entire outcome of the
game. It could mean a team advancing to the Final Four with their first game.  
  
So the thing that was cool is we take a lot of pride in taking charges, and
this was a team that got a little thirsty to get their feet in the paint at
the end, you know. Not necessarily a big three-point shooting team, but to
have two guys. We had two charges in the last three minutes. It wasn't just
Justin's at the end.  
  
So that's one of those things that on the outside, everything thinks, well,
that was a little thing, but that was a key point in the game.  
  
And then Justin's ability to make 12 free throws. I don't think there's a
college team -- I may be wrong -- that shoots more free throws in practice. We
have fun little competitive games with our teams and we talk about how we
wanted to lead the Pac-12 in free throw shooting. You know, that's a little
thing, right.  
  
But if you don't practice it and find your rhythm; we've got some guys that
really shoot a high percentage of free throws. You know, Justin goes 9-for-12,
we're not sitting here at the podium. We're in consoling each other.  
  
It was neat, a couple of the key elements, the rebounding, obviously is a
little thing but it's been a big thing for us. So those were real keys in the
game.  
  
Q. Seems like Justin Bibbins is a really tough player. How much does
that rub off on the team not just tonight but the entire season?  
COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: It's pretty neat. There's a lot of different ways to
lead, and Justin has led the -- the best leaders are the guys that do it
through actions. He's a very vocal leader, as well, and very upbeat kid,
mature, understands it.  
  
So I don't know how it can't help but rub off. I always think point guard
position is such a key offensively and defensively. When you see somebody out
front that's really the head of your unit, you know, and how it couldn't be
contagious.  
  
You know, he's a kid that's undersized but has really, you know, in the old
saying, his heart is as big as anybody's. You know, he's a point guard that I
think our players I know, and most players, would want to play with. He stands
for a lot of what's really positive about college basketball and it's been a
thrill for us to have him for the period of time that we have him.  
  
Obviously a sense of urgency with the game Thursday to try to finish this up
on a high note. There's only, in my mind, there's really two teams -- and I've
said it for many years before we were involved in the NIT. In my mind, there's
two teams that end their season on a note that they are really happy about.
There's a lot of disappointment along the way, and I consider this tournament
one of extreme value, and to be able to go on a little streak at the end of
the season would be special for us. So that's what we're shooting for.  
  
Q. It's Utah's first NIT Final since 1974, and I'm sure you've seen the
banner, the 1947. Can you expand on having this opportunity?  
COACH LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: It's pretty neat. I got an e-mail last night from
Arnie Ferrin, who my office is named after, 1947 Champs, and there are three
guys that are still alive from 70 years ago that have that banner and that's
back when the NIT was the banner. That was the one you wanted to have. Not
that it's diminished anyway but things have changed.  
  
I mentioned to our guys at breakfast this morning and I wore a shirt that
said, "Play for more" and that's one of those things, I quizzed everybody in
the room, and I had about eight things: Who could we play for? Who could we
play for? And they don't need any motivation at this point because they are
pretty self-driven, and I went around and guys threw out past players.  
  
I said, "Well, here's the text, here's e-mail from Arnie." We could play for
Jas who sprained his ankle in practice yesterday. He couldn't play today but
if we win, there's a chance he could play on Thursday.  
  
You know, Dr. Hill, our athletic director, longest tenured athletic director
in college sports of 32 years has been a basketball guy through and through
and he just coincidentally come back home for the NIT.  
  
As you know, we've had a big emphasis in really committing and dedicating our
season to Jon Huntsman, who is one of the best individuals I've ever met on
the planet for many reasons, and we've talked about, go big; let's go big like
Jon did. We heard that message at his funeral. So that's been a bunch of
things that we're trying to gear up for and trying to make it a special
ending.  
  
Thanks.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Aric Holman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35214)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State 75, Mississippi State 60  
  
HEAD COACH BEN HOWLAND: We really came out and got off to a horrible start. We
haven't been down that big at halftime the whole year. Credit Penn State for a
lot of it, and you know, I just don't know if it was anxiety, playing the
Garden, I mean, what it was. But that's not the same team that just beat
Louisville at Louisville, the play we played in those first, ten, 12 minutes
of game, and really got behind.  
  
I thought that, you know, Carr showed why he is, you know, considered one of
the best players in the country. He really controlled things for them. Stevens
was terrific, and it's a tough way to finish your season because I felt really
good about our season this year and what our players accomplished. Really
proud of them. Proud of the 25 wins; that they helped this program, putting it
back in the right direction.  
  
Excited about our future. For our nucleus that returns, this is an important
lesson for us. I'm very excited about these young kids. I'm a team that we
have high expectations for in the future and excited about the young men we
have in our program.  
  
Q. Overall, your thoughts on the game tonight? I know it was
disappointing, but the experience of being here at the Garden and playing at
the NIT.  
ARIC HOLMAN: Obviously I agree with Coach. We came out flat tonight. I would
blame that on me and some other guys for the leadership, just getting us
prepared. We thought we were very prepared and I would just say, it was a
great experience playing in the NIT, showing how competitive and how
trustworthy, I guess, my teammates are to each other and to this program.  
  
You know, so like Coach Howland said, it was a bad way to end it, but you
know, isn't an L. This is a learning experience, and we're going to improve
and get ready for next year.  
  
Q. Is there anything you can pinpoint exactly from where it goes from
9-9 and they scored like 21 straight points?  
HEAD COACH BEN HOWLAND: First of all, we were really impatient. Once we
started falling behind, we got anxious and we were shooting quick, bad shots
and it just like snowballed. You know, we didn't have the ball moving at all
in the first half from side to side. It was the -- you know, I thought icing
the screens may have bothered us a little bit.  
  
We had turnovers. We had a lot of self-inflicted turnovers in transition. We
got sped up, playing too fast. Not being in control.  
  
Q. They don't seem to be very somber about this; I think the
anticipation for next year. Seems like they are ready to get back to work and
get ready for next year.  
HEAD COACH BEN HOWLAND: Yeah, you know what, this experience, first of all,
being in the NIT was really good for us. You know, we got three opportunities
to get wins and we got the opportunity to come here to New York. This is an
experience that many of these kids have never had before.  
  
Obviously, No. 1, being in New York City, and No. 2, playing in the Garden. I
thought maybe we were a little awestruck with that. The blue line being out
there, everybody wants to play behind the blue line. And it's not that line;
it's the white line, and we saw that today at the shootaround.  
  
But this will be a growing experience that will help this team as we return a
lot of these kids for next year, and I think they are excited. I think they
really like each other and love each other and play for one another. That's
why it's so frustrating that we're finishing the season feeling this hallow
about how we played. We played so much better here, especially the latter half
of our season, after starting 2-5 in the conference. I feel really good about
these kids and where we're headed. Thank you.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Tony Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32878)

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Shep Garner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28486)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Penn State 75, Mississippi State 60  
  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Really proud of my team. We came out, we competed
hard. I thought the defensive end really set the tone for us offensively. We
got stops. For the most part we got rebounds, we were able to push it.  
  
To have seven days off, that's a great challenge for any team. I'm sure it's a
challenge for the other three teams that were here, how to conduct yourselves
what to do, when to push, when to pull back. These guys were receptive and
really responded over the last four or five days to prepare ourselves for a
great SEC team.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago, you were here hoping you had done enough to make the
NCAAs. Obviously that didn't happen. How is that motivation for coming back
here and what's it like to be able to go back on Thursday night and play for
another championship?  
SHEP GARNER: Of course we were a little disappointed not to make the
tournament but we made another goal. We saw we were in NIT and our goal was to
get to New York and win it. That's what everyone wants to do. We put ourselves
in a good position to do so.  
  
Q. Shep, early in your career, there was so many of these effort --
bouncing off the floor, trying really hard. That three that you made where
Josh dives and he gives it to Tony and Tony gives to Lamar and then to you.
That's a prototypical Penn State basketball play. Is it fitting to make that
three that gave you that record? I know you don't care about individual stuff,
but to have a moment in your career that happened on a play that sort of
typifies what your career has been like, what's that sort of mean?  
SHEP GARNER: They say the record is an individual record, but I've had a lot
of teammates that had a lot to do with that record: A lot of people that set
screens for me to get me open, break passes to them, they put it right on the
button for me and I just finish the job. That's a team record. It's a lot of
people that had stuff to do with it. I tip my hat to my teammates and my
coaches to put me in a position to do something special like that.  
  
Q. You guys are 4-2 in New York City, 3-1 at the Garden. What's it like
having that success here and just playing here overall?  
TONY CARR: It's definitely great to come play at the Garden. I think this is
the best gym in the world and it's even great when we have such great fan
support that come out and just make the win even more special.  
  
Q. Shep, you had 12 three-pointers at Madison Square Garden your last
two games. Is there something about this building?  
SHEP GARNER: I enjoy playing here. Playing here, it's a lot of fans, and we've
been here in a tournament, so it's big games, win-or-go-home situations. I
mean, I'm going to play big in the Garden.  
  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I want to go back to the play you just talked
about. That's the essence; that play embodies Penn State basketball. You know
how hard we've worked over the last seven years to even put plays like that
together, dives, deflections, extra, extra, hockey assists, hockey assists. I
mean, just fantastic. That possession, we're going to watch that possession as
a group, as a team, for the next 24 hours, but definitely for next year.  
  
Q. Talk about being here a few weeks ago in the Big Ten Tournament and
doing fairly well and doing what a lot of people thought was enough to get
into the NCAA Tournament and now being back here for the Championship?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I really think that prepared us for this game.
You know, Mississippi State, I watched a ton of film on them. That's a good
basketball team. But we've been here before. That was their first time here
this year I think, right?  
  
A lot of those kids, I remember Ben saying at the press conference that three
of the kids have never been to New York. This is very new for them and I know
Ben very well, so he will utilize this experience, and it's only going to help
them for next season.  
  
Again, being in the Big Ten Tournament, having it here; playing St. John's the
year prior; playing Michigan the year prior to that, we wanted to get in here
and play as often as we could and now you're starting to see some of the
benefits from that.  
  
Q. I know you haven't seen the film already, but how does it feel to
have all facets of the game working, inside, outside, the post? How does it
feel as a coach to get the win, so dominant?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Our identity is to set and rebound (ph). Our
foundation is attitude. And you're concerned going into that game because of
the layoff; are we still going to be rolling like we were at Notre Dame and at
Marquette and against Temple. That was my biggest concern but these guys are
ready to go.  
  
Defensively we knew the game plan and we knew what we had to execute and they
executed as well as you could. They scored 11 in the first quarter, 12 in the
second quarter. We did a really good job on that end.  
  
I tell them constantly, you take care of that end; the other end's going to be
a lot easier because you're going to get easier breakouts and you'll see the
ball go through the basket and that really helped us.  
  
Q. Hypothetically, do you think it's better for you guys if you win
tomorrow than if you had made the Tournament and maybe lost in the first
round? Sort of like that ongoing debate, which one of these is better for
you?  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: Yeah, I've shared a few stories, talking to Jay
Wright and John Beilein. They have said it, sometimes it's better winning,
continue to win, and get this experience and play in a championship game,
because that means we're winning and there's success and guys are getting
amazing experiences. Again, at Notre Dame, at Marquette. We can try to
schedule that but that might not work out for us, home and home. So those
experiences have really helped us.  
  
So to be able to play in a championship, Penn State Basketball, where we
started and now where we are, I think for me right now it's playing in the NIT
and trying to cut down some nets and put a banner up in the BJC because that's
going to be a huge steppingstone for us.  
  
Q. Wondered your initial thoughts about the matchup with Utah were.  
HEAD COACH PATRICK CHAMBERS: I didn't get to see a lot of them. I was so
focused on Mississippi State, I probably over-watched film. But I know Larry.
I've watched his teams. Obviously I'm up late at night so I throw them on.
They are well coached. They are very skilled. They are very tough. They run a
million sets.  
  
So we're going to have our hands full. We'll watch some film, get our guys
together and we'll be ready to go for Thursday.  
  
Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Nate Oats](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30683)

### [Dontay Caruthers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35148)

### [Wes Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27920)

### [CJ Massinburg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35020)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 95, Buffalo - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Buffalo to the stage.  
  
NATE OATS: You've got to give Kentucky a ton of credit. They shot it well from
3. We needed them to shoot a little more like Arizona did. They shot 7 of 15
from 3. So part of our game plan was to try to get them to shoot 3s and keep
the ball in the lane. I didn't think we did a good job.  
  
They're pretty good athletes and pretty good players. There's a reason three
of those guys are supposed to go in the first round. Probably some more that
are going to be pros. They have more length all over the place. And I think it
affected our shooting. Usually we shoot a lot better. We were 7 for 31 from
the 3. A lot of that had to do with Kentucky's length and just challenging
shots. We had 8 assists, usually we're pushing 20 assists. Our turnovers
weren't bad, but didn't get the ball moving.  
  
They're a great team. They're a great defensive team. Cal has them playing
really well at the right time in the year. They've won 10 of their last 11 and
we ran into a buzz saw tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously a tough game, but you guys gained a lot of fans while you
were out here in Boise. How would you hope that people that might be new to
watching you guys remember this team?  
DONTAY CARUTHERS: The type of guys we have and the coaches and the program we
have. We're unselfish guys, and play really hard. And things happen, because
we're a good team. And we felt that we could have done better. But things
happen.  
  
WES CLARK: On top of us being good looking, we did play hard and we got some
great tools. So it's fun. We're a fun team to watch. And we appreciate Boise
coming in with true blue.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: I just want to say thank you to all the Boise fans. We felt
they welcomed us really well. When we pulled in for the game, they were lined
up out there, they were waving at us. Boise has a lot of friendly people.
We'll definitely come back. And I want to say thank you to all the fans.  
  
Q. Dontay, given the matchups, you had to guard 6-9 Knox, you didn't do
bad. What did you think? It was tough matchups. Have you ever guarded a 6-9
power forward?  
DONTAY CARUTHERS: Not somebody his size. I think last year I guarded a forward
from Nevada. But I know he's a great guy. He's a great player.  
  
Q. What was your mentality really between Bonaventure, Buffalo, and
Syracuse putting western New York on the map, and UNGC beating No. 1, then you
guys going up against Kentucky, what was that like knowing that it would be
yet another upset?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Well, western New York has a lot of good basketball. We came
into this tournament to make some noise, trying to be remembered. We felt like
we could play with a lot of High Majors, and we showed it. But, yeah.  
  
WES CLARK: Western New York, I think a lot of people overlook some of the good
players, just because we come from Mid-Majors or lower division schools.  
  
DONTAY CARUTHERS: We just show what kind of program we have, coaches.  
  
Q. Knowing what you guys went through this year and where you got to,
it's hard to do right now, but how fantastic was this ride to get to the first
NCAA Tournament in program history and do it the way you did it?  
WES CLARK: It was phenomenal for me. I know we had a loss right now. It was
definitely a win for me. I've never been to a NCAA Tournament, and to get here
and win a game, it's phenomenal, it's a great feeling. It's exciting. I'm glad
to wear the Buffalo jersey.  
  
Q. I guess CJ or anyone who wants to take it. You lost the game tonight,
and there's a lot of happy talk about putting Buffalo on the map. You expected
to win this game so how disappointing is it to not go any further?  
CJ MASSINBURG: It's very disappointing. Trust me, we didn't go back in the
locker room and it was all happy talk. We were down on ourselves. But at the
end of the day, after all is said and done, we can be proud of what we did for
Buffalo and as a collective group.  
  
Q. You've got another year here with the Bulls. So what does what you
guys have built up over the last couple of years, what does that say about how
much there is to look forward to next year?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Man, this program was just trending in the right direction,
even our women's team, they just got a win today in the NCAA Tournament. This
whole school is just trending in the right direction. After we get a couple of
weeks off we're going to get back to work. And we say a term of: Making our
ceiling our new floor. This is our ceiling; we won a game in a NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. After that dunk from Hami that put them up 20 you called a timeout,
about 3 minutes left to go, and then you went back on the floor. Cal
apologized to you. Was he apologizing because Hami posed in front of the
band?  
NATE OATS: I don't know what he apologized for. He didn't need to do that.
They're playing basketball. At first I thought he was telling me they were
going to a zone. And then he apologized.  
  
I'll tell you this, I apologized to him before the game. I used the word
"whining," that's a bad word choice of him talking about their youth all year.
I don't know why I chose that word. Big Blue Nation certainly let me know
about it, don't want to let them mad, they're tweeting all day long.  
  
I apologized to him. He said he didn't take it the wrong way. I've got a ton
of respect for him. Used to go to his program in Memphis, we ran the dribble
drive at Romulus, basically because of what he did at Memphis. We had a good
talk before the game. I don't know what he felt bad about. He's a good guy. I
appreciated it, but he didn't need to.  
  
Q. I believe both teams ended up making 7 3s, and it took you twice as
many to make those.  
NATE OATS: It was huge. It took us longer. They were 0-6 against Davidson. We
wanted to make them shoot a lot more than six. But we did not want them to
make half of them.  
  
Jeremy has been our best shooter, him and CJ. But Jeremy has been on fire
these first two tournament games. I think their length bothered him a lot.
They're great defensively. I talked to Sean Miller after our game, he said
they guard way better, and it's true. They're unbelievable defensively. Cal
gets them to play hard. And they were playing with a chip on their shoulder.  
  
They have a great chance to make it. I think they play Cincinnati if they can
get by the next round. But they have a good shot to go to the Final Four. And
they've got a chance to win these next two games.  
  
Q. Two things. One, could you just talk about the problem of defending
Shai? You did move CJ on him, but that meant you had to put Dontay on the 6-9
guy. And comment on Wes Clark's performance and his season.  
NATE OATS: I told the guys, there's a reason this guy is projected to be the
lottery pick. He's the best point guard we've seen all year. He passes it,
scores it, he's 6-6, he's long. They can usually take other guards out of it,
but we started out trying to deny him the ball back, once he gave it up.  
  
But he's so long at 6-6. He gets open. And then he gets it. I saw some teams
try to trap him; he throws over the trap, they dunk it. He throws it, they
dunk it. He finishes at the rim. We really didn't have an answer for him
tonight, that was a major problem for us tonight defensively. We were supposed
to be loading up and tightening the gaps, then they start making some 3s. We
cut it to four or five -- was it four -- four or five, and then they hit back-
to-back 3s, if I remember right. That kind of killed us right there. And then
they got some dunks at crucial times. To me, Alexander makes them go.  
  
And what was the question about Wes? Listen, I told him I'm so proud of him.
We've got a history. I coached him in high school. But for him to come in with
the one semester. He took this program to new heights, we don't do what we did
this year without him. I think the guys welcome him in, if guys were selfish,
they would not have welcomed him in. They wanted him and he showed up in a big
way. He's 0 for life against Kentucky, he didn't beat Kentucky or Missouri. He
was trying to make this his first. But it's a good program.  
  
He had 26 and six assists. I thought he showed he belonged out there.
Alexander is a pro, I think Wes is right there with him. He's pretty dang good
tonight.  
  
Q. 22 dunks and layups. Were you a little worried about that, because
your post defenses --  
NATE OATS: We gave up 22? I wouldn't doubt it. It was bad. They got it in the
lane too much. They hit the 3s. They didn't shoot enough of them. We wanted to
keep it out of the lane and make them shoot more 3s. We got out-rebounded by
12, too.  
  
Three things had to happen: We had to keep turnovers down, keep them out of
transition, but defensively we had to keep the ball in the lane, keep them off
the O boards. They were in the lane all night. We didn't do what we were
supposed to. They're just that good. We're a pretty good defensive team, but
not -- we weren't good enough tonight and they are a great offensive and
defensive team, as well.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Kam Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35077)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Gonzaga - 90, Ohio State - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ohio State.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Give Mark and his kids a lot of credit. I think they're really
good. I think they can make another really deep run. He's got a phenomenal
program. We begin by just giving Gonzaga a lot of credit for making the plays
down the stretch.  
  
I was really proud of our guys' spirit, competitive spirit. It's been that way
all year. We've got a special bunch, and it's disappointing to see it end
because we have such a special group of guys. We'll leave it at that.  
  
Q. Obviously not the ideal start to the game. They scored the first 15
points. What was going on that allowed you to get off to a slow start there?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: It wasn't how we like to be. But we tried to stay calm. I
was proud of how we fought.  
  
Q. On the flip side of that, how were you able to fight back after being
down by so much early to get back a lead and be able to maintain it, although
it obviously didn't end how you wanted it to go?  
KAM WILLIAMS: It's a long game, 40 minutes, it's a lot of possessions, you've
got to keep chipping away and keep staying positive. You have to believe in
yourself and your brothers. Anything is possible.  
  
Obviously we didn't come off with a win. I couldn't be more proud with our
coaches and players the way we fought today. We're just extremely proud.  
  
Q. Zach and Rui both had big games. How big were those two? How many
issues were they giving you defensively?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: They gave us a lot of issues. They got some easy baskets.
Give them credit, they made some tough shots especially down the stretch. They
both made their free throws down the stretch, too. They're great players, a
good team.  
  
Q. I was curious, have you made a decision yet on your future in terms
of what your plans are? And if not, what will go into that decision in terms
of potentially going into the draft?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I haven't thought about it. I want to spend this time with
my team.  
  
Q. Seemed like the momentum was swinging, but they had a 11-0 run. What
did you see during the run? What happened down the stretch there?  
KAM WILLIAMS: We got beat on the 50/5 balls, on the glass a little bit. Just
tough plays we didn't have at the most crucial point in the game and it cost
us.  
  
Q. If you could talk about Zach and Rui, those two players. It seemed
like they were the difference makers. Talk about those two and what kind of
issues they were giving you guys.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Their two 3s were really the difference. Zach's 3 in the
corner off, it looked like, a step-back corner 3 that was really well defended
by Andre Wesson was a crushing blow. And then obviously 21's 3 there -- I
think it's the first one he's made since December. So I just was told that.
It's nice to hear.  
  
But, yeah, those were crushing.  
  
Q. Certainly you're talking about how much different this team was than
when you played them before. It was pretty evident out there. Seeing that game
transpire, is it everything you hoped as far as seeing where this team has
come?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, obviously you'd like for it to end differently,
obviously. But we've evolved as you hope a team has evolved. It's hard when
you take over a program. And obviously took it over midsummer. You're trying
to figure them out. They're trying to figure you out. You're also trying to
figure out your guys' strengths and what triggers to pull with guys. And just
what guys you can challenge in what areas. And you're learning their
strengths, too, strengths and weaknesses, and how to put them in the best
position and I think that took some time for us.  
  
This group really turned a corner at some point. And I think it was maybe
after the PK-80. And after the Clemson game it turned a corner and flipped the
switch and we were really never the same. And it was all positive. We just
kept growing together. I've been proud of a lot of teams but this one is up
there.  
  
Q. It certainly didn't start off that way. They scored the first 15
points. Were you having flashbacks to that first game? What did you see that
made you guys have a little bit of slow start at the beginning of the game?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Missed layups. And maybe nerves. Maybe nerves. Or I think we
missed four point-blank layups that we don't normally -- we're going to miss a
few in the game, but not four in a matter of the first four minutes.  
  
They were making plays, too. Gonzaga was good, too. I think Gonzaga can get to
another Final Four. I thought they were really good. After we played them once
we said that, and I just think they're really good. Mark does an incredible
job with them. He does an incredible job with them.  
  
Q. What is kind of the challenge in defending Gonzaga, because they can
throw so many options at you?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It's their balance and the number of weapons that they have.
Williams is a load but we handled him okay. Tillie can make obviously open
shots and you have to know where he's at. We really struggled with Perkins in
game one. Really struggled with him. And we handled him a little bit better in
this game. But then you have Norvell that goes off to 26, 28.  
  
They're what you want a program to be, and that is year after year after year
they have good, young players, or players sitting out or whatever. So there's
never going to be a significant dip in the program. It's what you want in an
elite program. A good recruiting class and a system in place and culture in
place, and Gonzaga has all that. And that's a credit to Mark and his program.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Johnathan Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33110)

### [Josh Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30801)

### [Zach Norvell Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35061)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Gonzaga - 90, Ohio State - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Gonzaga.  
  
MARK FEW: Well, what a great weekend for us here in Boise. Just what a great
performance by my guys. We beat a heck of a basketball team in Ohio State
that's got a ton of fight and so well coached. And the run they made at us in
that second half, that had us back on our heels. Just like these guys have
done all year, they responded and were able to figure out a way to get some
stops down the stretch, the real stretch of that game. And then had some guys
step up and made some big shots on the offensive end.  
  
But, Ohio State is good. And just so impressed with how much they've improved
since the PK-80. We couldn't be happier. There aren't many things better in
life than winning one of these games in the NCAA Tournament in March. I tell
you, they are something special.  
  
Q. I know yesterday was a special moment for you hitting that three. But
you had a season high 28 points, double, double. Do you like this game better
or what were your thoughts on that performance from your team today?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: I like this one a lot. Getting 12 rebounds is a big thing
for me.  
  
MARK FEW: He goes a month sometimes without getting a rebound.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: That was big for me. I always have confidence on the
offensive end, but helping the guys on the board was big. Ohio State is a
great rebounding team. Helping the bigs was great.  
  
Q. It seemed like the entire stadium was cheering for you guys. How does
it feel to have your fans travel so well, and the neutral fans seemed to be
cheering for you guys?  
JOSH PERKINS: As we all said before, we have the best fans in the country. For
them to do that for us, especially when that run hit, we heard it, they stuck
with us and we fed off the crowd. We stuck together, and the crowd was a big
reason.  
  
Q. Coach did a handstand in the locker room to celebrate. Is that a
regular occurrence in a NCAA Tournament or all games?  
JOSH PERKINS: When he does it, we're all happy. We want him to do it again so
we can keep winning. He did it a couple of times last year, when Coach pulls
out a handstand, it's a good performance team-wise, and we need to see it at
least four more times.  
  
Q. How are you enjoying this run now, these two games? How much are you
enjoying being a part of March Madness?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Sitting last year was big. Behind great guards, I learned a
lot from those guys, and to be in the moment, to be out there is huge, being a
competitor, and also being surrounded by a lot of guys that want to compete as
well, is great.  
  
Q. I have to know about the nickname "Snacks." Where did it come from,
was it something when you were little and you told your teammates? How did
they find out about it?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Growing up all I wanted was candy and chocolate. Everybody
called me "Snacks." On my recruiting visits my dad called me "Snacks." The
coaches took it on and campus and everybody around the country calls me
"Snacks."  
  
Q. A lot of foul trouble for the bigs to get through. Looked like Rui
played a big role.  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: Yes, our bigs have been doing a great job all year. Corey
came off the bench and Rui did, too. They came off the bench for us.  
  
Q. You guys were down 67-62, the game seemed to be swinging a little
bit. But Zach hits that big corner 3. How big was that? That seemed to get you
going.  
JOSH PERKINS: That was a huge 3. This guy's making tough shots for us day-in
and day-out. You saw one yesterday. But I've been seeing it the whole season.
He hit that corner 3, and that was the spark plug we needed to get that run.
I'm glad he took it and hope he takes some more in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Zach red-shirted last year. How happy are you to have him on the
team?  
MARK FEW: It's not just because of that it, it's because of the whole package,
he's got a persona that we really need in our program right now, quite
frankly. We have an overabundance of introverts, and that's one thing he's
not. And so I call him our spiritual leader, he gets us going every practice,
even the ones they don't want to be at.  
  
And he's just a firey guy with some swag from Chicago, and we need that. And
then you add in the fact that he's right there with probably one of the most
clutch players I've ever coached, going back to Dan Dickau or Adam Morrison,
he's got an amazing ability to -- the shot before the 3 missed by eight feet.
I don't know if you remember that one. And to come back and swish the next
one. That's like me shanking two into the water hole and then hitting a hole
in one or something, which doesn't happen.  
  
So he's got an impressive fortitude about him. And there's so many things to
like, we're very blessed to have him.  
  
Q. It seemed that you were able to sway a lot of neutral fans to cheer
for your team. What is it about your team that makes them so likable and gets
people behind them?  
MARK FEW: I don't know, the neutral fans. Boise is a Zag-friendly place. We
have a bunch of former players down here. I have tons of family down here. It
meant everything to me to finally get my team to come down and play in Boise.  
  
My father-in-law was a basketball player himself, played at the College of
Idaho, and was just kind of a legendary humble man around here, and just
absolutely loved the Zags more than anything. He passed away this summer. He
missed it by six months. But I could feel his presence, looking down on us and
smiling when Snacks and Rui hit that big 3.  
  
It's special to do it in front of our family and former players. And like I
said, this is definitely a Zag- friendly spot for us.  
  
Q. What's up with the handstand thing? I've never seen that before.  
MARK FEW: I did it a couple years back. It's not quite as prevalent as it was
after I hit 50. And there's some rotator cuff issues that I worry about. But
in the moment and the guys motivated me enough, I lose my mind and attempt it
once in a while. This happened to be one of those times.  
  
Q. It wasn't just Zach, Rui had a tremendous game, 25 points after the
bench. How big is it to have a guy like that come off the bench and score that
many points for you?  
MARK FEW: It's a luxury to have. We have seven guys score 20 points this year.
Again, I thought Corey Kispert came in and gave us good minutes. It was great
to get Rui going again. I think he was disappointed with how he played
Thursday.  
  
Obviously I think we all knew he was going to play better, but for him to play
this well was huge. We needed every point. We needed every rebound. And lost
in all this was Perk. Josh Perkins has put two really, really solid games,
kind of managing the throttle of our offense, and taking great care of the
ball, two assists, two turnovers tonight, and he had a big shot.  
  
Everybody hit the floor for us. We needed every basket, because they
definitely pushed us to the limit.  
  
Q. You mentioned Josh Perkins. How has his game evolved and improved
over the course of the year as your point guard? He had struggles early on.  
MARK FEW: Again, with Josh, Josh is as high a level shooter I think in the
point position in college basketball. Him and Joe Barry are very similar to
that. He's always had a little bit of flash and stuff to his game that he
values probably more highly than he needs to. And I think he's really been
able in the last -- since we dropped that home game to St. Mary's he's came
eons from where he was as far as understanding winning plays and just figuring
out who to get the ball to at the right time, when that guy is going or what
the matchup is or hunting his own shot or getting us in the right sets at the
right time and place.  
  
That's been as big a key for this run we've been on is him understanding
winning basketball as opposed to just and-one stuff.  
  
Q. It seems like we're talking with streaks, four straight Sweet 16's.
How much does that mean to you?  
MARK FEW: Like I said, certainly there's some personal things out there in
your life and family. But as far as professionally I can't think of any better
feeling than winning games in March.  
  
I was telling -- Leon Rice and I went out to dinner, the head coach here in
Boise, any win in the NCAA Tournament I think is the hardest thing you do.
They're harder than road games in league. They're really, really hard to come
by.  
  
And to be able to advance now to that second weekend, to get another -- we're
guaranteed of at least five days more with our team with the hope of getting
to that next week that many of us have experienced how special that is.  
  
Along with that, somebody brought to my attention in the locker room that
we've got two guys in Perkins and Silas that have made it to four straight
second weekends. And with all this day and age with people leaving early and
doing this and doing that, I don't know how many players in college basketball
can say they've been a part of four straight second weekends. I know there's
obviously some. But that's got to be some elite company.  
  
Unbelievably proud of not just those guys but the whole team, but our whole
program, the administration and everything. We've built this thing the right
way. And we do have followers all over the country and it's because my guys
are what college basketball is all about.

## March 17, 2018

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Shai Gilgeous-
Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34914)

### [Wenyen Gabriel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34479)

### [Hamidou Diallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35117)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 95, Buffalo - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Kentucky.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: My comment to the players after the game was the reason this
has been the most rewarding season I've had in over 30, or however many I've
done this, is because of what's happening for Wenyen, what's happening for
Hami. You saw what he is and what he's capable of today. Let me say this, you
may say that -- I was trying to learn about him and he was trying to learn
about me. We were trying to figure this out. Everybody said, Why are you
starting him? Because he deserves it, I love him, and he's going to do it. It
just took us a long time.  
  
Wenyen, the same. He had to conquer himself. When you're not playing well you
have to kick out of it and go.  
  
And Shai, I didn't really enjoy coaching Shai, but he's a good kid, I guess
(laughter).  
  
Q. What I asked Hamidou yesterday about whether they were overestimating
the importance of experience. Do you think you answered the question today?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: The same answer yesterday. We just try to come out and try to
prove everybody wrong, and that's what we did today. And can't feel better
about this one.  
  
Q. At one point after you hit a 3-pointer, you turned to the crowd and
silenced them. Do you enjoy when you have a crowd against you? Does that feed
you guys?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: This whole group is a bunch of competitors, we go
after it every day in practice. We love proving people wrong, and that's what
we did today.  
  
Q. I'm sure you saw that Virginia lost yesterday. Is that a wake-up or a
reminder to see when a huge upset happens? Is that something that reminds you
that anything can happen in March Madness and makes you play more on your
game?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, Coach has been telling us this whole week, You
never know what can happen in this tournament. And you have to step up and
make plays. And we don't focus on any team but ourselves right now. We try to
get better each and every game.  
  
WENYEN GABRIEL: Definitely. I don't watch too many of the games, but when you
hear about the upsets, it tells us to lock in more and focus on anything can
happen.  
  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: It makes us play with a little more chip on our shoulder
because we don't want to end the season now, we want to play to the last game.
So we're coming out there with more chip on our shoulder.  
  
Q. Coach Cal frequently jokes about all the players that he sent to the
NBA, telling them that he's held them back when they've been in college. We
know we haven't seen all your full games yet. What parts of your games has he
been holding you back on?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Hami has a list.  
  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: We're just trying to get better every day. We know there was
going to be a lot of adversity. We're playing with a bunch of talented
players. Every night can't be your night. And that's what we knew when we came
here, and that's why we chose to come here.  
  
WENYEN GABRIEL: Just try to go out and play the game and show our strengths,
and the other stuff will come. Right now we have to focus on what makes us
look good out there.  
  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Myself, including this whole group, has probably felt
like he held us back at one point in the season. If you really know the game
and you watch the game, when we do what he's asking us to do, we're a much
better team than you've seen in the past couple of weeks.  
  
Q. You made it tough on them to start the game defensively, you jumped
20-10 you were up. Was there any talk about your focus, defensively, to start
the game? They're the underdog, was there talk, don't let them get hope or
match their intensity or anything like that?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Our identity is defensively. So that's the first
thing we focus on going into every game. We know if we shut down the other
team we're capable. We just go into every game trying to lock up the other
opponent.  
  
Q. You show up with obviously the reputation of excellent defense.
Clearly the last few games you have been a huge factor offensively. What point
along the season did the offense open up for you in the sense that you saw
where your shots were going to be and what you could do at this level?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: About midpoint during the season. I watched a lot of
film. I was really taking what Coach was asking of me, what this team needed
me to do. I just tackled it. Once I cleared that role out and stuff like that,
I worked on my game and got better every day.  
  
Q. Obviously the freshman thing gets played and played and played.  
JOHN CALIPARI: And I whine. Coach and I talked about it before the game, Nate
and I talked. There's nothing there. He's a great guy and a heck of a coach
now. What he's done and how that team plays and what they've done in their
league, amazing. It's amazing.  
  
Q. But what I wanted to ask you was -- (laughter) -- sorry. Obviously
today was a game with a ton of peril and the other night was a game that had
all kinds of things that could have happened. Would you say your kids might
have graduated to the next class now? Are they beyond your regular freshmen?  
JOHN CALIPARI: There will still be experiences in this tournament as we go
forward that they've never faced and I have to try to talk them through it. I
told them at halftime Buffalo is going to make a run. They may tie the game
up. So what, just keep playing. They made their run and got it to six, they
may have made it to four. I said, This is what happens in this stuff, you've
got to keep playing.  
  
I think, again, we are inexperienced and all that stuff. But I've got good
players, and my challenge was they had to establish themselves first. Hami is
still figuring it out.  
  
Second thing is, they had to change how they thought about training and
working and preparation. I talked to them today. We had a great shoot-around
today. And I said, the beginning of the year -- Sean Farnham watched this in
South Carolina, and he said that was the worst shoot-arounds that I've ever
seen one of your teams have. We had guys laughing and joking, and I had to
stop and scream. It was an hour and 10 minutes. My shoot-arounds are 40
minutes, 42, 45 minutes.  
  
Today they were good. It takes my team a year to really learn how important it
is to use the entire day to prepare for a game. It's rewarding to see
individuals do what they're doing. But it's also rewarding to get them to
understand they need each other, because this is a team sport.  
  
And I said this before, Pat Riley said to me, one of the best compliments:
Your players are all good teammates in this league. They come in this league
and they understand. They share.  
  
And you're right, they've all had to give up something, and I held them back.
You ask DeMarcus or Anthony, ask Devin, he's still mad I didn't start him. Am
I going to start now? Devin Booker had 78 in a NBA game and I didn't start
them. Eric Bledsoe, You held me out. You're doing all right. I said, Will you
buy dinner?  
  
Q. You've come a long way with these young men. You decide now going
into the next round if you can name one thing, just one thing that you would
like to instill in them as a team or as individuals for the next round, what
would it be?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, let me take that back, I need -- Nick is the only one
that isn't breaking through right now. For him personally, I want to see Nick
Richards step up and dunk and block and play. He's kind of holding himself
back right now. And I start him just like I did Hami every day, because I want
him to break through.  
  
As a team, the biggest thing is everyone is connected. Everyone is for each
other. And we still have a couple of guys that aren't quite the servant
leaders that they need to be. Like I'm playing for everyone else. Well, if
I've got a whole team of guys doing that, I'm not playing for me, I'm playing
for everybody else, that's when this thing takes off.  
  
We're getting closer, but that's probably the one thing I hope.  
  
Q. Shai has the early morning sessions. Do you see any MKG at all in his
habits?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had the morning breakfast club. This kid
goes at 7 a.m. But he also watches tape. He'll go up and show me turnovers,
show me what you want. What he was missing was any kind of skip, he couldn't
see it. And so you've got to keep showing them. Then when he does it you have
to reward him. Now you see him come down and throw skip passes. But it took
two months.  
  
And he has a spirit about him, a smile. Every Canadian kid -- I don't know why
I don't get every Canadian kid, Jamal Murray, Trey, Michael, they all like
have smiles, and they have -- when Jamal would come and practice he'd look at
me and go, Coach. Like, I wasn't smiling. Smile. And so his spirit starts
moving us that way. He was the one guy that was having fun. The other guys on
this team two months ago, everything was a struggle. This kid was just smiling
and laughing.  
  
I kept bringing it up, Be like him. Happy-go-lucky. But he's working. On time
for everything. Never late for anything. Goes to class, does all that he's
supposed to do. And look at him, he's playing himself into being one of the
best players in the country.  
  
Q. Very efficient today, 7 of 15. Seemed like every time UB put a little
bit of run on you, one of your guys would come up and hit a big 3. How big was
that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: The last 10 games we're shooting 40 percent from the 3-point
line. Against Davidson we only took six. And I'm still trying to figure out,
how did we only take six? Was it their defense? Was it what we did? Was it
that we were trying to be aggressive? I don't know.  
  
But we want to take between 15 and 18 3s. We're not taking 30. Any time in the
history of my career my team takes 30 shots from the 3, we lose. We don't win
those games.  
  
We're not relying on 3s, but we shoot 40 percent. It's a different -- I mean,
some guys are going to shoot 30 and that's how they coach and that's great.
It's not what I do.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Buffalo.  
  
Q. Have you heard back from former President Obama yet? Any apology for
him picking against you?  
CJ MASSINBURG: No, I haven't heard any response from Obama yet. We actually
haven't had our phones, we got them back this morning. Coach took them last
night, just so we could get some rest.  
  
Q. You guys, I was really impressed with the confidence you had after
last night's game against Arizona. What do you have to do to keep that going
against Kentucky? And what do you expect from the Wildcats, the second
Wildcats you're going to face in three days?  
NICK PERKINS: I would just say it's really a focus thing. I think with some
people they get a little success you start to get out of what you've been
doing from the jump.  
  
Really just staying focused. Kentucky is a little different team from Arizona.
They've got more guards and more perimeter-based team. The scouting report is
going to be a little different.  
  
We've just got to come ready to play and stay focused.  
  
Q. The crowd was pretty well behind you last night. I'm assuming it will
be the same tomorrow night. Did you feed off that energy?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I'd say we did feed off it a little bit. Like I said last
night, I felt like we were in Alumni Arena in Buffalo. Shout-out to the fans
out here in Boise that supported us, and the Buffalo fans that traveled out to
see us.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: At the beginning of the game we got a couple of buckets, you
could hear the UB fans cheering and stuff like that. When we went on a run at
the end and everybody seeing what we was made of, we had the whole arena
erupting, and it was a great feeling.  
  
NICK PERKINS: That second half was something crazy. We started hitting all the
shots. Things really started going our way, I could hear the crowd behind us.
It made us feel good. It gave us a little bit of confidence to finish the
game.  
  
Q. Their players don't buy the idea, and your coach is definitely
selling it, they're all freshmen and your veteran experience will benefit you.
Do you think your veteran experience will be a factor in this game?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I mean, Kentucky is a very good team, as we all know. But I
think experience should give us just a little bit of an edge. I think the team
that plays the hardest is going to come out with the win.  
  
Q. From the film that you've seen so far of Kentucky, I don't know how
much you've gotten to see yet or if you saw any of the game yesterday, where
do you think you match up well against Kentucky and what areas are going to be
the hardest to defend?  
NICK PERKINS: I think we match up pretty well with their guards. They've got
some guards who are pretty good on the ball screen and stuff like that. But I
also think they're lacking on the inside with defending and stuff like that.  
  
One strength I think they have is pretty much their size. They're a good
rebounding team and stuff like that. But I don't think they can stay with us
in transition and stuff like that. They've got a lot of big guys, they play a
little bit too much, and I think that will play to our favor.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: I feel like this game is going to be a little different than
last game. Last game we wanted to shoot all the 3s to like kind of expose
their 7 footers. But this game I feel like my big guy, Nick Perkins, is going
to get a lot inside and dominate and play his game how he's been playing the
whole year.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: Could you repeat the question? I forgot it.  
  
Q. From the film you've seen so far of Kentucky and if you got to see
any of their game yesterday, what areas do you match up and what areas will be
a struggle?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I think we match up with them pretty good. I mean, they've got
players on the boards, we know they can play. They're real good. But they put
on their shorts just like we put on our shorts.  
  
Like I said, I feel like the toughest team and the hardest-playing team is
going to come out tomorrow night, or afternoon.  
  
Q. How do you keep that energy going? Yesterday, especially the second
half, you outscore Arizona by 18 points, you snagged the momentum and never
gave it back. How do you keep that going on Saturday night against Kentucky
and maybe getting into the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Just sticking to how we play. We came into yesterday's game not
really changing too much of how we play. We're going to come into the game
with Kentucky not changing anything. We want to stick to our base. We always
want to be the hardest-playing team every time we step on the floor, no matter
who we're playing against and stuff like that.  
  
Q. From being around you guys the last couple of days, it seems that
Nate has really created a culture where you guys are free to say what you want
and be confident and speak your mind, and he clearly does the same thing. I
was curious how that has helped you guys develop both the playing style you
have and the confidence to come out and play last night and hopefully for your
sake tomorrow?  
NICK PERKINS: I feel like it's big. I feel like we have a good relationship
with Coach and you know who he is as a person, he know who you are. I think
you want to play harder for him. And he wants to go harder for you. It makes
the program so much better. We're comfortable with each other and you get to
be yourself.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Coach is definitely a player's coach. He basically asks us what
we want to do. Today we have a practice in a few. And he asked us, Hey, you
want to go live or walk through and get a lot of jump shots up? And that's
really big, when you have some coaches it's really a dictatorship in the
program, they say, Their way or the highway. That's not like it here.  
  
You always want to play for a coach that has the utmost confidence in you and
listens to you as a player.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: Yeah, when the head man of the program is the hardest-working
man in the program, it's easy to follow. So like they said, he's a players'
coach. He gives us tons of confidence and that's why we play how we play.  
  
Q. You're the Cinderella now officially, I think. I wonder, when you
were growing up watching the NCAA Tournament did you have a favorite
Cinderella team?  
JEREMY HARRIS: No.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: No.  
  
NICK PERKINS: I can't even think of one, to be honest.  
  
Q. Jeremy, you didn't seem to like that I called you "Cinderella." Is
that accurate, you don't like that label?  
JEREMY HARRIS: Everybody thinks we should be here. And yesterday's game wasn't
like a fluke or whatever you call it. But I think we have a very confident
team. And I don't really like the term "Cinderella team."  
  
Q. What do you think that you showed to the rest of the country that
might not have heard of you before or watched you before?  
JEREMY HARRIS: We're a team that plays very hard. We've got some tough guards,
Dontay and Vonta, they started it last night. I told them after the game,
Ya'll started the game very good on the defensive end. And CJ hit a couple of
3s early, and we just feed off of each other. We give each other confidence
all the game.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Just kind of saying after last night you guys are on a national stage
now, you guys are getting so much national attention. What do you think that
you have shown to the rest of the country that maybe has never heard of you
guys, never even watched you play before?  
CJ MASSINBURG: I feel like the way -- not only the game last night but the way
we won, showed everybody that it wasn't a fluke. Sometimes teams can, like,
stick around with a High Major and come down to the last shot and hit a lucky
buzzer-beater, and go crazy. But I feel like our win wasn't like that
yesterday. Our win showed that.  
  
You heard Charles Barkley, you hear people saying that we dominated them. And
that's not really a fluke, you know. And I feel like the best team isn't done,
and we're going to show you tomorrow.  
  
Q. I would put this to all of you: How did you end up at Buffalo? What
was the recruiting process like? Were there other schools in the mix?  
NICK PERKINS: Well, coming out of high school, I'm a native Michigan guy, so
I've known of them for a while. Me being from Michigan, when Nate came to
Buffalo -- I think I committed here when Bobby Hurley still had the head job.
When Coach Hurley decided to leave, it was only right for me to stay with
Nate. Me and his relationship was to strong and all that, that's how I got
here.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Our story is a little bit different. I was playing AAU
basketball as an unsigned senior in the adidas Circuit. And I actually got
referred to Buffalo by Dusty May, who was at Louisiana Tech, he's not there
anymore, and they referred me to them.  
  
Then one of our assistant coaches, Jim Whitesell, he came and saw me in
Indiana and he liked my defensive game. They didn't know that I had the
offensive game. They recruited me for defense. When I got here and they seen
my offense, they were really shocked.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: I'll just say I was recruited right out of junior college, but
Coach B and Coach Oats recruited me the hardest, I believe, and I trusted them
the most. And I felt like I have made the right decision.  
  
Q. I was just asking the players how they ended up at Buffalo and I was
wondering how do you recruit to Buffalo?  
NATE OATS: Who wouldn't want to come to Buffalo. Go look now, it's about 8
inches of snow. You get all the skiing in during basketball season.  
  
Honestly, we try to just build relationships and sell our style of play and
sell the program. When I first got to Buffalo as an assistant, they didn't
have a name, nobody knew about them. I was selling Coach Hurley, Bobby had a
name, he was the best point guard ever in college basketball, we got Lamonte
Bearden then. So I recruited Bobby's name as an assistant.  
  
We got the program in the NCAA Tournament the second year. And then you had a
bit of a name and then we started recruiting, we go back to the NCAA
Tournament, and now you've been there two years in a row. Kids want to play in
the NCAA Tournament. Right now I think we're 5th in the country in length of
possession on offense. Our tempo is fast, we play spread out, wide open. Our
style of play is one that guys want to play.  
  
And then I think really the biggest thing in recruiting comes down to
relationships. There's certain places, if it was all about weather, everybody
would go to Miami. But I think Kansas gets some pretty good players, Kentucky
gets pretty good players; it's not on the beach.  
  
Honestly, the first thing I ask some of these kids is, Listen, we're up here
in the north, it snows little bit. But winter is during basketball season. So
let me ask you right up front: If you're one of those kids that's worried
about the weather outside the gym during basketball season, let me know up
front, because the weather inside the gym is the same in Miami as it is in
Buffalo. And we have gym rats that live in the gym. If you're worried about
the outside weather, let me know, you're not the type of kid we want. They all
say, No, that's not me. We get that right out of the way right up front.  
  
Q. I know you said that you made it. Has this win been everything you
imagined it would be?  
NATE OATS: I didn't imagine what it was like. I guess I was too busy trying to
prep to get the win. I don't have a very good imagination anyway. It's been
pretty crazy. They've had me on every radio show I've ever listened to, I
think, when you're trying to kill time.  
  
It's been great. Honestly I didn't want to turn too many of them down, because
I want the program itself to get -- like I said, we never had a name. We've
never been to the NCAA Tournament before Coach Hurley got hired and I came as
an assistant.  
  
Now we finally got a win. Let's build the program, and let people know what
Buffalo basketball is about, let's keep the snowball going. It's been great.
You get live on Scott Van Pelt, you get live on all these national television
shows. You talk about the kids. The kids are great. I didn't get to listen to
this. I'm assuming they gave you good answers. I love the group we've got.  
  
Q. How do you move on behind the best winning program in history and get
your team mentally ready against a hard test against Kentucky?  
NATE OATS: It's not the easiest. We've got a mature group of kids. We've got a
lot of juniors. Wes is a 5th-year senior. The maturity of the group, just
knowing that we want to get to the second weekend. I told them, Look, nobody
can ever take this win away from you, you beat Arizona. That's one of the best
programs in the country over the last 30 years. Unbelievable job.  
  
But listen, if you get to the second weekend of this tournament, you have no
idea. Like, this is almost a life changer. As far as your basketball career it
is.  
  
So our SID told me we had something like 1800 articles written about us since
last night. I told the guys, Those articles will be on the Internet for the
next year, ten years, let's concentrate on what we can do right now in the
next 24 hours to get this next win. Then go Twitter search and Google search
your name after the season, and you can spend all the time reading all the
articles you want. Reading all those articles right now helps us zero getting
the win against Kentucky. Forget it, let's move on, let's figure out how to
beat Kentucky, and after the season go and do all that other stuff.  
  
Q. What was the key in your opinion to the second half? You were locked
in for 20 minutes. It was 40-30 at the half. You missed 3s, turned the ball
over a little. You had 9 turnovers in the half. You come into that second
half, seemed like everything was clicking for you guys. What was the biggest
change from the way you played the first 20 and the last 20? And how does that
transition to Saturday night playing another good team in Kentucky?  
NATE OATS: I think part of it it's the first NCAA Tournament for most of these
guys. There's a little bit of jitters. And I told all of them going in, if we
take care of the ball and that our defense is where we need to be and rebound
it, we'll win the game.  
  
We had nine turnovers in the half. If you go to the second half the biggest
difference was we only had one turnover. I think calming down, taking care of
the ball. Our defense was a little suspect at the beginning of the second
half, we gave those three layups up, I was ready to kill some guys in there.
Ended up calling a time out, we were hitting 3s, and they were only hitting
2s. He was mad, called the timeout. We've got to get on them, and after that
we just locked in. Our defense for the last 17 minutes of the second half is
as good as it's been all year.  
  
Q. How about a job where coaches and players never say anything? And
here you are talking about Cal's whining about his freshmen, your players say
it's an advantage to have experience. Do you care about the idea that they put
it on their bulletin board and use it against you?  
NATE OATS: It is what it is. If you look at the roster, Wes Clark, senior,
their team, freshman, freshman. Their players are going to play in the NBA for
a reason. There's a reason that three of these guys are in the first round and
I'm going to show you. The talent level is absolutely there. And when they go
win the lottery, I'm going to agree with NBA teams that took them, they're
that good. They're still freshmen.  
  
No disrespect to our two freshmen, they have lapses. We're experienced.
They're inexperienced. It's no disrespect. It is what it is. It's facts. I'm
going to tell them, they're not freshmen? You are freshmen. Just like Cal's
been saying. Cal's been saying it.  
  
I will say this, when you play freshmen as many minutes as they've had to play
all year and you get to this point in the season, they're pretty seasoned
freshmen. They're not the first ten games freshmen. So they're almost
sophomores, but they are still freshmen, so it is what it is.  
  
We've got a 5th-year senior running our team. I like the way Wes is playing
right now. I think his experience and all that can be big. Now, he's 6-6, the
point guard they have, it's probably a lottery pick, but Wes has played
against some NBA guys and held his own. He's a pretty good player.  
  
Q. The players almost grimaced at being called "Cinderella"? Is that
something you instill in them to make them believe they deserve to be here?  
NATE OATS: If you look at the games we played, from Cincinnati to Syracuse and
Texas A&M, when we went to Syracuse and lost, the better team lost. We really
felt like we screwed some stuff up in the last three minutes when we had a
lead in the last three minutes of the game, it cost us.  
  
So we felt like -- when we played Cincinnati we didn't have Wes. And he makes
a difference. Now, Davonta was great, but Wes is experienced, 5th year. So we
got Wes just in time for the Syracuse and then the Texas A&M. Those were his
first two games. We didn't have Caruthers.  
  
I told them, this is the first time we have a full roster available to us.
We're going to get a High Major on a neutral floor. So this is what we've been
waiting for. Because we only got one High Major on a neutral floor in
Cincinnati.  
  
Now, I think we just instill in them from day 1: This is where we belong, this
is what we're going to do and this is what we're going to get. When we get the
next High Major on neutral floor in a NCAA major, we're going to take care of
business.  
  
Q. How is this different than preparing for Arizona?  
NATE OATS: They're similar in some regards, but much different. They both
don't get a lot of their points from three. Kentucky is 312 in the country in
percentage of points from 3 -- or Arizona was. Kentucky is 344th. They really
don't get -- they went 0 for 6 yesterday. The first time in years that
Kentucky hasn't had a three.  
  
The difference is Arizona pounds it into two 7 footers and gets their paint
touches. Kentucky takes you off the dribble and runs off of ball screens and
really plays off their athleticism. Their spacing is a little different. You
want to keep the ball out of the lane with both teams, but you have to do it
different ways. And then rebounding, Kentucky is 8th in the country in
offensive rebounding percentages. If you look at the defensive numbers, too,
Kentucky's defensive numbers are much, much better than Arizona's were.  
  
We're going to struggle to score a little bit more against Kentucky than we
did against Arizona, I think.  
  
Q. You're up here talking about Calipari whining, talking about the
weather, you've got Bulls fans going through tables. Your guys are talking
about how handsome they are. How are you able to be so loose right now and
have that --  
NATE OATS: Let me clarify, when I said Calipari whining about freshmen, I was
maybe -- it was a misuse of the word. He's a pretty dang good coach. He's made
known the fact that he's young all year. It's a fact. It is what it is.  
  
We both want to win. We both won nine of our last ten games. They lost four in
a row before they went on a run. So I think he finally broke through and got
through to his freshmen and maybe he'll say that -- I don't know what -- I
tell our guys, I'm not going to lie to you, I don't go into scouting reports
and blow some team up that's not very good to tell them that they're great.
But I also don't go the other way, either.  
  
So let's say it like it is, let's be real. I'm not going to try to disrespect
anybody. But our players -- you can talk to them, too, they're a little older,
they're good guys. Wes has two kids. He's trying to catch up to me. I've got
three. We can trade parenting stories.  
  
Q. You guys are up there talking about this stuff, how are you able to
have this mindset? You seem pretty loose right now.  
NATE OATS: Here's the other thing, like I've been through a little bit here in
the last few years just on a personal level; my wife's cancer and everything.
The game of basketball is big and it is my job and I need to win games to keep
my job, but it's not -- I tell our guys all the time, if all I do is teach you
to play basketball, I've failed miserably.  
  
We have a training -- we bring a guy in at least once a week. We talk life a
lot of times, too. We don't just talk basketball. Basketball is big and we're
going to play as hard as we can, and if you don't give max effort you're
letting the whole program down. But it's not the end-all. We're all going to
be fathers and husbands and let's be better men than we are when we started.
So I think it gives you a little perspective of life, too.  
  
Q. There has been some joking around about the fans of Buffalo and
tables and whatever. But what is it about the sports community of Buffalo that
makes them so passionate about not just Bulls, but it seems every sport
there's so much passion for their sports teams?  
NATE OATS: It's a great question. Had I lived there my whole life I could
probably give you a much better answer. He could probably give you a better
answer, he should come up and answer the question instead of ask the
questions.  
  
Look, from my five years in Buffalo, my experience -- everybody wants to talk
about the Super Bowls that almost were. Was it wide right or wide left? Wide
right, my bad. But it's almost like they've had some really good teams that
have almost got there and they -- shoot, I live in a neighborhood, like they
literally shut down -- you don't do anything during a Bills game. They've got
the tailgates going. Everybody locks into every single Bills game all the
time. They're good. Like the playoffs, that was great.  
  
I don't know, it's a blue collar town. I grew up in the midwest. I tell
everybody, Buffalo is way more midwest than it is east coast. We're four hours
from Detroit, and six hours from New York City. It's blue collar, hard
working, really good people that get behind their sports team that like to
have a good time and support them.  
  
Did you see the kid breaking the table and running through a foot of snow?
That's one more motivation for us to win last night, so we could stay in
Boise. It was like 70 the second day we're here. And it's snowing 8 inches.
Let's work on our tan in Boise while we're here.

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Ohio State.  
  
Q. Now that you've had time to digest the win a little bit, what are
your thoughts and emotions about being able to hold off a late comeback
attempt by South Dakota State?  
C.J. JACKSON: It's always good. We were going against a good team. The way
they shoot the ball they were never out of the game. Just to come away with
the win and get that first game out of the way is a good feeling.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: We know we played with a team that are so efficient
offensively. No matter how far they get down, a couple of shots can come back
and be right in the game. I think the guys did really well down the stretch of
just overcoming those comebacks.  
  
Q. What has the addition of Andrew Dakich meant to the team? Since he
did come from Michigan, how much trouble did you have to give him for that?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Like you said, first it was like, Who is this guy coming from
Michigan as a walk-on? They don't really like those guys up there. Dak is one
of those guys that came in and has the personality that you've got to love.  
  
And he was a great addition to our program, just because he's been on winning
teams in his time at Michigan. So he brings a lot of advice to us other guys
who have only been here one or two times. Just to pick his brain and see what
the winning teams did, that's a great contribution.  
  
As far as what he does on the court, he keeps our huddles close, and does a
lot of little things. Like last night he had some key steals and key rebounds
that really won us the game.  
  
C.J. JACKSON: In the beginning it was a little rough, just kind of he came
from up there. So we don't really like those guys, as he said. But as the
season went on he's really grown on us, personality on and off the court. We
kind of do things more as the season went on. And how he handled last night we
needed him. He came on with big plays down the stretch and those were game-
winning plays that kind of decided the game.  
  
Q. You played Gonzaga in the PK-80 in November. What do you remember
from that game? How have you grown since then?  
C.J. JACKSON: We're a completely different team. We're a lot better now. And
as they are, they're a lot better team. We have to play a full 40 minutes, and
just be ready for, like yesterday's game had its ups and downs, and tomorrow's
game is going to have the same. We have to be ready to play the full 40.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: We were kind of trying to find ourselves the first time we
played them. Now that we have our culture and we know what winning looks like
and what -- things we need to do to win. I think this is going to be
completely different matchup than it was earlier in the season.  
  
Q. We heard you guys are staying in the same hotel as Gonzaga. Have you
had any interesting interactions with those guys?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: No, I think we ran into a couple of fans, but we haven't really
seen them. I didn't even know that until you told me, honestly.  
  
Q. What do you think specifically changed from November to now? What
kicked into place?  
C.J. JACKSON: Just our roles defined are a little bit better. Chemistry is a
lot better. In the beginning of the season that was like our 6th game together
with all of the new faces, the new coaching staff. So we didn't really
understand each other very well. And now it's a whole new season basically,
and just understanding what we need to do, who we need to be together out
there is much better.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: I mean, just like C.J. said, we had a whole -- Gonzaga, I think
personally that was our first test of the season.  
  
So just seeing us early on, we're just a completely different team now. We've
been through so much adversity, ups and downs throughout the season. We're
looking forward to facing a great opponent.  
  
Q. I'm just curious about your thoughts on Coach Holtmann. What was he
like when he first came on board and how has your perception of him changed?
We won't tell him what you say.  
C.J. JACKSON: It's like we met him for the first time, I knew nothing about
him personally. We knew he came from Butler, a good program, had a great year
last year, making it to the Sweet 16. That was about it.  
  
In the beginning we had our doubts and questions just because that's when you
come into a new situation and it happened so fast.  
  
Now today it's the perfect fit. We're kind of taking after him as a team. He's
a tough guy. He works hard, hard-nosed worker. As a team we're taking after
him and that's huge for us.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Like C.J. said, at first, definitely you don't want to see your
old coaching staff go, and it happened so suddenly. I think Coach Holtmann did
a great job of taking us older guys under his wing. And he let us know when
you see college coaches get a head coach change, they use the first year to
recruit and start over next year.  
  
But he definitely made it -- obviously he wanted to hit the ground running.
And at the beginning of the year we would go over to his house, it seemed like
we went over to his house like every weekend, just to get that chemistry and
get that closeness. It's paid off a lot. He's one of those coaches who wants
the best for all of his players and he's going to go to bat for us. He's going
to fight for us every step of the way. I couldn't ask for a better head coach
for my senior year.  
  
Q. How tough is it to balance playing Kaleb Wesson who is one of your
better offensive players, but also playing small ball for defensive purposes?
Is that difficult sometimes?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: As a coach you have to make those judgments on what's best for
your team. What gives your team the best chance to win. And that's what we've
done.  
  
He's played consistent minutes for us, certainly as a freshman throughout the
year. The other day was just a unique, very, very, very unique matchup with a
5 that is as good as Mike Daum is.  
  
Q. Coach Few brought up how you reached out to him when you were
considering taking the Ohio State job, and asking for advice. Can you say what
some of the advice he gave you was?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I won't get into great detail on what Mark said. But,
listen, I've got tremendous respect for Mark and this Gonzaga program. That's
what they are, they are an elite program. And when you can go to a
championship game and come back the next year and have the kind of year that
they've had, the consistency that they've had, it says you have reached elite
level status. And I think that's where they're at right now. That was one
reason for reaching out to Mark.  
  
Another reason was just he's obviously been a guy that a lot of people have
reached out to, other programs. And I wanted his feedback. And he probably
gave me, as you'd expect, as level-headed of advice. He didn't say to go or he
didn't say to stay. He just kind of gave me what his thought process was when
situations came up. And that was helpful.  
  
Q. Could you talk about bringing in Andrew Dakich and what it was like
to bring in a guy from Michigan and how glad you are now that you did take
that chance?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, certainly really happy. The fact that he came from the
team up north didn't really factor in a whole lot because we were really
desperate for guards. And we were in a situation really in July when there was
really slim pickings. It was a no-brainer in our mind. I think when we took
him I think our coaching staff felt like, Okay, we got better as a program.  
  
Now, I don't think we anticipated him having quite the impact that he's had
kind of with the -- we thought the intangible stuff he would really help with.
But he's been a little bit better in some areas than maybe I anticipated,
which has been a real credit to Andrew, particularly on the defensive end.  
  
But, yeah, it was a no-brainer for us because we were sitting with -- in terms
of our back court we had, at one time, two guys on our back court; really,
C.J. and Kam. And I was thinking, Okay, we're going to have to probably play
Jae'Sean some at the point, but how will that -- so we were just in scramble
mode. And he was a gift for sure.  
  
Q. Players win games. Best players have to be the best players this time
of year. As it comes to Keita, how much do you have to remind him either in
games or before games that, You are the guy, be the guy, and how does that
work itself out?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I probably had to remind him of that less and less as the
season has progressed, because I think his confidence has grown to the point
he's embraced that role. It's been, Okay, you're saying it to me, you were
pushing us early. I think he saw that we were going to utilize him as a focal
point of what we do. I've had to say it to him less now. Now he's embraced
that role.  
  
And his assertiveness on the offensive end is not something I've really had to
address, as you can tell. He's pretty aggressive most times when he's out
there, which is great to see.  
  
Q. Back to Andrew and him being a coach's son. How does that affect a
player when they have a father like he has?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, in coaching coach's kids, sometimes it's a blessing and
sometimes it's a curse.  
  
With Andrew it's been much more a blessing. It's been much more a blessing.
Sometimes coach's kids, they kind of think they've got it all figured out and
they've kind of got the answers because of where they grew up. I think Andrew
has been one of our most coachable, teachable guys. He'll share his
suggestions, for sure, unsolicited. But it's what we love about him, too.  
  
But he's been a dream to coach. He has been an absolute dream to coach. And
his family has been perfect. They've been incredible player parents, probably
because they get it, because Dan was a coach. Dan understands there has to be
a separation in that relationship. Dan really understands that. It's been a
dream scenario for us.  
  
Q. How have you seen Gonzaga grow since you faced them in November?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think they just have gotten better and better. They are
really balanced, as we would expect.  
  
Listen, game one was not much of a game. They absolutely took us to the
woodshed. It was a mismatch in every way. And I'm hopeful that we can do a
better job of getting our guys ready for that.  
  
But I don't know that they've made dramatic changes, they've just gotten
better and better, as you would expect one of Mark's team to be. I think
they're an elite team right now.  
  
Q. I thought I read somewhere you talked with Mark earlier this week.
Was that about South Dakota State or the tournament?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I called him late, late one night we were in the office
just doing some work. And I was going to ask him about South Dakota State
because, you know, they obviously played them last year. And he was enjoying a
beverage and a view of the mountains. So I said, Man, what a life that is
right there. (Laughter.) I was quite envious at the time. And it was about
9:30 or 10:00 our time. And I just tried to figure out honestly how to guard
South Dakota State and if he had any suggestions.  
  
South Dakota State is very different than when Gonzaga played them last year,
but I just wanted his thoughts, because I really respected his opinion. We had
a good conversation. And you could tell, he was pretty chatty. And I was like,
I've got to go, I've got to get back to work, all right? You can finish
whatever you're doing, but...  
  
Q. With Kentucky playing in the same pod you probably have a few
additional supporters. Do you have any shout-outs to the people of
Nicholasville or Jessamine County?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: That's my hometown, Lexington and Nicholasville. I have a
great affinity for that town, that city, that area, Down there in Big Blue
Nation. We would love to steal a few fans, because we know it's going to be a
road environment. So absolutely I would love to solicit some extra help from
Big Blue Nation because it's going to be a pretty raucous crowd, for sure,
with the Zags.  
  
We played them in Portland and we felt like it was a road environment.
Yesterday was kind of a road environment for us, I think for a variety of
reasons. And we expect it to be another tremendous road environment. And our
guys have been good on the road, for the most part.  
  
But the last couple of years, I think last two years we've been in the same
area as Kentucky. Wish them great success.  
  
Q. Growth in your team from November to now, what have you seen is the
most difference?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I don't know that I did a great job early on. I was trying to
just -- you get a new team, you're trying to figure out some things with your
group. And I don't know that I always did a great job figuring out our
personnel and how they fit. It was just such a new group.  
  
I think once we got into a little bit of a rhythm and maybe we as a coaching
staff understood some more of our guys' strengths, that really helped us. And
I think it also took time for them to understand kind of what our expectations
were. We thought it would take some time, it always does with a new coach. And
fortunately we hit our stride at the right time with this group. And as I
said, they've been extremely coachable.  
  
Q. What were the challenges of trying to build trust with a new team
taking over so late?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, as in any relationship, I think I just tried, we as
a coaching staff, just tried to be honest and up-front and as real as possible
with them. They play for a very good coach in Thad Matta, and we were going to
do things different than they did. But I just wanted to be really real with
them and honest with them from the get-go.  
  
And we knew that there was going to be some time that was going to need to
take place where they could fully trust us, both to put them in the right
positions and just trust what we were saying. Fortunately that happened and
probably happened even a little quicker than we all anticipated. It helps when
you have great kids.

### [Zach Norvell Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35061)

### [Josh Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30801)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Gonzaga.  
  
Q. Both of you used red-shirt years, yours was due to an injury, Josh.
Can you talk about what you learned during your red-shirt years that you might
not have learned if you spent the full season with the team?  
JOSH PERKINS: I knew not to take any day for granted. Any day can be taken
away from me. Just approaching every day with that mindset.  
  
And basketball-wise, I had a great mentor, Kevin Pangos, learned some of the
little things he did; talking, hand shakes on the low. Just noticed stuff like
that to be a better leader for the team.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: For me, just having guys like Josh, to see how the guys
approached every day, every practice, stuff like that, all the stuff you can
learn. They're all winners so the attitude and mentality that they had going
into every practice was big for me.  
  
Q. Now that you've had some time to digest the game, what are your
thoughts about being able to hold off a comeback attempt from UNCG? And what
are your thoughts and notions about that?  
COREY KISPERT: It's March, and teams are going to give us their best shot.
They made a lot of tough shots. And that's something you can't control all the
time as a defense. But a team will make a shot or not. It's our job to execute
on offense and play as hard as we can.  
  
We did that down the stretch and it showed.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Obviously our leaders, Perk, J3, and Silas, kept us
composed. So looking for our leaders to carry us and stuff like that.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: We're very fortunate and grateful to be here. But like he said,
any team could have wavered, but we didn't, we knew we had to dig deep. We
came out with the win. So we're glad to be here.  
  
Q. You guys played Ohio State and dominated pretty well. But this looks
like they've made some changes. What do you see different with this team that
you're going to face tomorrow?  
JOSH PERKINS: Like you said, they've got a lot more shoes out there, a lot
more confidence. They're still monsters on the boards. But we're a different
team, as well.  
  
It's going to be a fight tomorrow, for sure. Just try to execute our coach's
game plan and we should be in good hands.  
  
Q. Did you know Donte Ingram very well? Did you talk, text or anything
yesterday?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: He texted me yesterday. We played together in high school;
when I was a sophomore, he was a senior. We played in a city championship. I
was really excited for him after he made the shot. He texted me, being from
Chicago and being from this school, he was really proud of us.  
  
Q. Gonzaga sometimes is known for having a lot of the former players
come back and have a presence around the campus. What kind of impact does that
have for you guys? What does that do for your team?  
COREY KISPERT: I love it. I remember one of the very first games in pickup I
played on campus, Rob Sacre was screaming at me. After the game he'll tell you
a joke and give you a pat on the back. And being a scared freshman, my first
few days in the summer really helped me feel at home and have all those guys
come back gives me a good feeling to know that this is where I need to be.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: They've been through the program. They've been through the
ups and downs, and also talking to them about the transition from your
freshman to graduating was really big to me. We came here to develop as a
player.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: It's just an awesome feeling. Guys come back and build
relationships. And as I said before, they really helped us. Gave us the ropes.
And obviously it's competitive, as basketball players. But they show us the
things they learned in the program and they do what they can to help us better
ourselves as individuals and basketball players every day.  
  
Q. Being on the team last year but not playing, just what was that like
going through the tournament?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: I mean before, you know, going through the red shirt, being
a victim, Why me, why do I have to red shirt? Seeing how special the team was
last year, and the fight and the determination they had from day 1 was big for
me. Taking every moment, I don't want to take anything for granted. And just
take it all in.  
  
Q. Last year you made it to the championship game. Does that have any
affect on your mindset this year? Do you feel like you have more pressure on
you to go out and prove something or is that last year and doesn't affect this
year?  
JOSH PERKINS: I mean that definitely is going to stick with us forever, coming
so close, coming so far. But it wasn't a burden or anything, like it was last
year. But that chip has gotten bigger for us. People expect us to be here this
year, that chip is going to keep be getting bigger and bigger.  
  
COREY KISPERT: I was in high school last year, and I picked the Zags to make
it to the championship last year. And people kind of looked at me, They never
made it to the Final Four, what are you doing? Don't pick them. I had
confidence and faith. And now that they actually made it and broke that
barrier, and got the monkey off their back, I don't expect anything different.  
  
This is my first year. I expect us to do big things. And that's kind of all I
know.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Like he said, just the big monkey off the back. It's an
expectation for us. Having the feeling last year, you want to get back to
that. That's just the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Ohio State has changed from your first meeting but you guys have,
too. What would you say the biggest difference is from November to where you
are at now?  
JOSH PERKINS: I mean obviously ball movement, more experience. The young guys
are getting better and better every day. Corey has improved, roles have
changed. Guys are more comfortable in the spots they've been in before. We
know how to win now. And hopefully we can do the same thing tomorrow.  
  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Just being more comfortable with our roles and stuff like
that. We drill every day in practice being proactive, we're kind of reactive
and kind of surprised with some of the things that were happening. But now
we're like a well-run machine. We look to Josh to make big plays for us, J-3
and stuff like that.  
  
COREY KISPERT: The biggest thing I noticed from watching is the defense. The
defense has definitely tightened up. There were definitely holes we left open
in November that we definitely tightened up now. We've been preparing for
them, piece by piece.  
  
Q. Start with the obvious. You played this team before, Ohio State. They
won a lot of games since then. How different are they from that first
meeting?  
MARK FEW: It's a lot of the same faces, but, again, that's why Chris is up for
National Coach of the Year. Just an unbelievable job. We watched them as they
ran through that Big Ten almost to the last week of the season. And they did a
great job getting them to believe and really come together. And they seem like
they're really connected.  
  
When we faced them in the PK-80 I think both teams had a lot of -- he was
trying to get his system and philosophy put in. We were trying to integrate a
bunch of new faces and players in different roles. And I think the game was
closer than the final result. We kind of blew it open there in the second
half.  
  
But, no, we know it's going to be really tough, physical. They've got great
size and great physicality. And tough guys. And they've really shot -- some of
them shot the ball well last night.  
  
Q. You've done this a long time. Is it harder to keep a team on top or
to sort of try to rebuild it maybe after a couple of tough years?  
MARK FEW: I mean, just speaking from experience, say it's a lot harder to
maintain a high level of success. That's why I have so much respect for Coach
Cal and Duke and North Carolina, just to be able to stay at a level. Because
it's a constant pecking away at you, in every way, shape and form. And trying
to tear you down. And it's everybody's biggest game all the time.  
  
We've done both. We've built our program up. And were the Cinderella for a
while. And the maintenance part is a lot harder than I think people realize.  
  
Q. Eight players on your roster have had a red-shirt experience during
their career. It's pretty high for a one-and-done era. I know a lot of times
that's injuries and transfers. But for guys like Zach, can you talk about the
process of deciding to red shirt them, and what you think they get out of
their red-shirt years?  
MARK FEW: Yeah, it's strictly up to the individual. And it's not something
that we go in and tell them, other than on a transfer situation, obviously
those guys have to.  
  
We have a culture up there that we're very proud of. It's a culture of
winning. It's a culture of handling things the right way, whether it's
academically or out in the community or the cohesiveness of our team. We're
very protective of our team-first culture. And I think it gives those guys
just a great opportunity to assimilate all that stuff as well as grow the
basketball side of them.  
  
We've been lucky enough and fortunate enough to do that with a portion of our
guys that feels like to me we've done less of it as we've evolved. But in
Zach's case, his knee was really bothering him last summer or two summers ago.
Then looking at our roster with Perk coming back, Nigel Williams-Goss, we all
knew how good he was going to be, Jordan Mathews, Silas Melson. It was the
right thing to do.  
  
Q. Last night was a fairly pro-Gonzaga crowd. I would assume that it's
going to be the same way tomorrow night. Did you feel like your team fed off
the energy of the crowd last night or how do you feel they did?  
MARK FEW: No, not necessarily. I thought UNCG had certainly some momentum
going down the stretch. You watch how all these games are playing out, even
ones that are currently going. Those first-round games when you're the
favored, higher seed, momentum is a crazy thing. And it affects people in pro
sports at the highest level.  
  
So I think that's probably what I'm most proud about is we were able to stem
the momentum of Greensboro and just find a way to win. Obviously the Zag fans
travel, showed that throughout the run last year to the Final Four. And we
consider Boise a Zag town. And we'll take as much support and as much energy
and as much of a home crowd we can get tomorrow. We're going to need it.  
  
Q. Your best players have to be your best players especially during
tournament time. Have you had to, through the years, remind guys, your best
guys, that they need to be the ones, they have to even take it up another
notch?  
MARK FEW: We talk about it. Not just so much the tournament, but anytime
there's a big game, that that's when they've really got to shine. And this
year's team's unique. We're pretty even across the board with picking who our
best guy is. A lot of times it's matchups and a lot of times it's who's
playing well at that particular time. It might be Josh Perkins, it might be
Killian Tillie, if you look at the conference tournament. Certainly down the
stretch for a lot of games Rui has been spectacular.  
  
But through it all Johnathan Williams has been an absolute, rock solid guy you
can count on as far as his physicality, his rebounding, his protecting the
rim. And then delivering when we get him the ball down low.  
  
Q. Obviously the sport's had some rough headlines the last few months.
And we roll around into this time of year. What is it about this that kind of
makes you forgive and forget?  
MARK FEW: It should make you forgive and forget. It's a magical, magical
sport, this college basketball. You've got kids that no matter what we say and
no matter how we try to -- many of you out here and everything try to push
them into the next level, this is the greatest years of their life. You play
in this NCAA Tournament, they'll remember it for the rest of their life. It's
the ultimate experience if you're a college basketball player. Not only are
they playing on a national stage or even an international stage, but they're
doing it with their best buddies, you know. And the connectivity that you see
from 18, 19, 20 years old is real. And they care about each other and they're
having a blast.  
  
And then just the opportunity that you see coming out there, for these 14
seeds and 13 seeds and 12 seeds and all that. They make their one statement in
front of the world. It adds even a higher level of drama to it.  
  
I think it's the greatest thing going. I'm obviously biased. But you watch
these games yesterday and the ones starting today and it's definitely
captivating and makes you want to believe in the good part of the sport, which
is probably like 98 percent of it.  
  
Q. Chris Holtmann mentioned yesterday that you had helped him a little
bit with South Dakota State or you guys had talked a little bit. Now he is
your adversary, and somebody asked him about that and he said, Hell, he's glad
he's got us now.  
MARK FEW: I don't remember saying that. I don't remember implying that.  
  
Q. Chris said that.  
MARK FEW: Okay.  
  
Q. But you talked a little bit about what he's done this year. You
regard him as one of the guys in that young rising star class?  
MARK FEW: Absolutely. And I have the highest level of respect for him that you
can have. He's an excellent basketball coach. But he's an even better person,
that has the right values and the highest level of character to run a program
like that. And just like he ran it at Butler.  
  
So he's definitely at the highest level of respect I can give a man and a
father and a husband and a coach. He's the real deal.  
  
We've talked a lot, we even talked when he was mulling over the Butler-Ohio
State move. And he reached out to me out of nowhere and we had a talk about
that. He's a good man and a great coach.  
  
Q. You have quite a bit of tournament experience now. And in your
experience would you say the first game has any impact on the rest of the
tournament? Or is each game kind of its own individual animal?  
MARK FEW: I just think each game is its own -- takes on its own life, much
like it does during the regular season. And the styles of play vary so much. I
think there's something a little bit different from that first-round game to
now you've played, you've experienced it, you've got it out of the way. And
the second-round game kind of becomes a little bit more just playing.  
  
I'm hoping that's the case, because we did not play very well last night. So
I'm hoping we'll come out and play like we played down in Vegas or play like
we played against Ohio State in the PK-80, that would be good.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, it's obviously been a long time since you saw Ohio
State, and you both are very different teams than in November. How have you
seen Ohio State when you scouted for them now versus scouting for them in
November? How do they look different?  
MARK FEW: They're a team that looked like they came together more and they
certainly have their belief in Chris and the staff and the system and all of
that. Certainly has grown exponentially.  
  
And as far as adjustments, it's a short turnaround here. We're pretty much
going to do what we do and I'm sure they're going to do what they do. But we
can tweak some things here and there.  
  
But like I said, we look at a game, and someone said it was 20-something
points, you go back and watch the game and it was a little tighter than that
for longer periods than maybe the results indicate.  
  
So expecting a really, really physical game. And Bates-Diop, we prepared for
him heavily last time, as well we should have. He's a fabulous player. Tate is
a unique player to prepare for. He's just a load and tough and physical and
aggressive. And I really think those guards have stepped up their game. I
think they've came into their own and are playing with a lot of confidence,
which I think that's probably the biggest difference from November to now.  
  
Q. Over the last two decades you've done a really good job of getting
players to return to campus and come and be part of the larger Gonzaga family.
What is it about Gonzaga and how do you get different players to buy into the
larger Gonzaga family?  
MARK FEW: It's just the culture. We've been able, because of the players that
came before them, to create a unique team-first, winning culture that involves
cohesiveness of players that really care about each other, and a fan base that
is unbelievable, the experience, when you're up there.  
  
So I think there's a lot of love that the players feel and the support and the
notoriety. And you combine that with getting to hang out and kind of hoop with
your brothers. And certainly winning makes everything more attractive and more
fun. And we've been fortunate enough to win at a high level for a long time.  
  
I think the one thing that our guys do a good job of passing all those
qualities down. And then one way or another we find a way in recruiting to
find the right guys that kind of fit the Gonzaga culture.  
  
And I'll tell you the last thing, I think we're very unique. A lot of our
former players move back to Spokane after they're done playing. I can't think
of a place that probably has more former players living around them than what
we have in Spokane.  
  
Q. With everything that's going on in college basketball right now, it
would seem to me to be a difficult time to be a college head basketball coach.
Do you sense a trend in more and more people coming out in support of each
other in the coaching fraternity? How would you assess the collegiality
between college basketball coaches now?  
MARK FEW: That's a great question. I do think we're in an age, in an era where
we're just -- again, I think it mimics what's going on in our country and
everything. But we flipped way, way over to here, and we've just got to move
the needle back and just get everything calmed down a little bit.  
  
But I've been fortunate enough to have a bunch of really good friends in this
business. I mean really, really close friends. And the one thing -- it's a
fellow head coach, you can really share some experiences and share some
feelings. And have some great talks, whether it's Coach Cal out there on the
floor to just so many of my buddies that I have in the profession, and I do
think there's a collegiality that happens, and there's, I don't want to say
like a care group or anything, but we have a tendency to call each other up
and have these little bitch and moan complain sessions. Like, wow, we're going
through the same thing. It's like, you'll be fine. You'll be fine, and go from
there.  
  
There's some really, really, really great people in this profession. Like I
said, Chris Holtmann is obviously -- it's great to see the profession being
passed on to guys like him, because it's going to be in great hands with guys
like him.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Kentucky.  
  
Q. Yesterday in the locker room everybody was asking about Arizona and
you were the only guy to say, Hold up, let's see who we play. Have you seen
Buffalo play at all? Were you surprised they were able to advance?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: I've seen Buffalo play a little bit. I know they're a really
good team. We watched some film on them, and know they're a great team. We'll
have to come out really prepared to beat this team.  
  
Q. UB's coach said you guys are young and they're veterans, and they
don't have the problem of having all freshmen. Do you think he's
overestimating the veteran experience?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: I feel like we've been getting that statement all year. That
statement is kind of old.  
  
At the end of the day, we're all basketball players, we're going to try to
come out and compete and show the world what kind of basketball team we are.
That's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Now that you've had some time to digest yesterday's game, what are
your thoughts and emotions about being able to slow down or stop the comeback
from the other team?  
QUADE GREEN: Just play hard, play our speed, play our pace, and play our game.
Everything else will sort itself out.  
  
Q. They're 6th in the nation in scoring. Obviously your guys' defense
has been pretty good all year. What do you think has been the strength of your
defense and what makes you confident about your defense?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: I think our length is what bothers teams, and our athleticism.
And we've been able to defend the rim. So we're going to continue with that.
And I think as the season, our communication has picked up as a team. As young
players we've been coming together and that's helped us defensively.  
  
Q. Curious to know how much you guys have seen from last night's
Buffalo-Arizona game and what have you learned about them and what do you
expect tomorrow night?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: The game tape we went over didn't have any of last night's
game. Some of us watched highlights and some of us a little bit of the game.  
  
They're a great team. They defend well. They've got great guards and great big
men. We just have to come out and play Kentucky basketball to get a win.  
  
Q. You're due for a breakout game. What's your mindset when you see
people like Wenyen hitting all those 3s and all your other teammates doing so
well? How do you stay so patient?  
QUADE GREEN: I'm in the gym, really. I know my time will come. But I'm not
really focused on that; I'm focusing on the team. So whoever is hot gets the
ball; if you miss them, you miss them, if you make them, you make them.
Simple.  
  
Q. Your decision-making seems to have improved a thousand percent. Can
you give us a couple of examples of play decisions that you're making now that
maybe you wouldn't have made at the very beginning of the year?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: I think my decision-making was always well, I was just trying
to rush things, that's the biggest thing. My decision-making was always, Well,
I just needed to slow the game down, be able to see the floor, and accept my
role I have to play on this team. And that's what I've been doing. Anything
the team needs me to do, that's what I've been trying to pick up on.  
  
I feel like my decision-making has always been there, but I just had some
lapses and adversity, and things like that. I just stay level-headed, and know
if I keep working everything will work out.  
  
Q. I was hoping PJ would be there so I could ask him, but I'm interested
to see what you think about this. All his facial gestures have really been
getting a lot of attention out there on the court. Does he practice those,
like in front of the mirror? Can you give us some examples of some of your
favorites?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: No, I just like that mean face he makes after a dunk. I think
that's become one of the fan favorites. He doesn't practice them. We only see
those in the game. He doesn't even do them during practice. I think it's a lot
of fun.  
  
Q. If a player is having a good time, do you enjoy watching them or do
you also use it as a little bit of motivation if the other team is talking
that way?  
HAMIDOU DIALLO: At the end of the day I feel like everybody can talk on the
court together. We're just going to keep working and keep staying humble no
matter what. We just tend to stay level-headed and just keep working and know
that for us to keep moving on, to go further and further, we just have to be
together as a team.  
  
Q. You say that you haven't really looked at the film of Buffalo. Last
night's game, they came out and they showed more energy and intensity than any
teams that we've seen all year. How do you plan to match their intensity
level?  
QUADE GREEN: Playing our game. Doing what we do best: Match their intensity,
match our intensity, even boost even higher that we're going to win the game.  
  
Q. Have you watched any of the Texas A &M-Buffalo tape, because SEC --  
QUADE GREEN: No.  
  
Q. Secondly, you guys come in, all of you could come in with the
attitude, I'm going to take 16 shots a game. How would you describe Coach
Cal's approach early in the season to get you guys thinking collectively not
individually?  
QUADE GREEN: Everybody can score on our team. 1 through 6 scoring on the
court, everybody can score. It depends who's open, who gets the ball, if
you're open, shoot it. That's how everybody is on this team. Just making the
right play at the right time, that's all.  
  
Q. Young team, first NCAA Tournament last night. How encouraging was it
that it was Hami that got things rolling really early? Have you ever had a
player to be in the hole as deep as he was and trying to climb out?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Not that was a starter. I've had guys in that hole, but they
weren't starting. And we've stuck with him, he's stuck with us. The way he
drove the ball and the things he did. And the other thing you may have missed,
he really did a good job defensively guarding Grady.  
  
Q. Just curious what you think of the way Buffalo played last night
against Arizona, how much you watched of that game tape, and what do you think
of Buffalo? They seemed pretty confident.  
JOHN CALIPARI: If I were on their team I'd feel very confident, too. The way
they played, I watched about six tapes of them, and they remind me of my UMass
teams. Hard-nosed, tough, swagger, chip on their shoulder. I'm a high Major
player, and they are. And my UMass teams went to, I don't know, four or five
Sweet 16s, a couple of Elite 8s, a Final Four, I believe. Some of my people
will check those numbers, but I believe it is.  
  
And that's what I see in them. The ability to score the ball, they score 85
points a game. They play fast. But they're tough defensively. They're not
afraid to mix it up and be physical. And they've got players that come off the
bench and give them a jolt defensively. They've got those kind of players that
are positionless. You play them, and you say he's their 4. He's not their 4.
He's like a 2, 3 playing as a 4.  
  
So their record indicates that what they are, which is they are an outstanding
team. They're well-coached. And we understand it's going to be a hard game.
We're walking in with all freshmen. We know it's going to be a tough game. It
will be a hard one for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the biggest challenge when you have that many
young guys, what's the hardest part?  
JOHN CALIPARI: The first thing you have to understand that young people will
do, and they do this at every level, I would imagine every sport, until you
establish who you are, it's hard to be about the team. They go through the
process of trying to establish themselves. It takes time.  
  
The biggest thing for me is to try to get them to think different. They've
never had to prepare the way they do now. If they played bad it was always
someone else. It was the coach. They never had to take responsibility for
their play. They never had to self-evaluate. They just went on to the next
game, because they had three games in one day. A lot of times they were
enabled by people around them, never held them accountable. They believed they
worked, but they never -- they have to learn all that.  
  
Most of it is a mindset. They can do probably 40 percent -- when they think
they're done, they've got about 40 or 50 percent more in their bodies. But
they've always stopped. I'm done here.  
  
That being said, I've always had veteran players that could talk the young
players through. That's not the case with this team.  
  
I said I've never gotten frustrated, because this has been maybe my most
rewarding season as a coach, to see a group on the edge of the abyss, the look
of terror, the text to me, Coach, we need you more than ever now, to smiling
faces, being about each other, picking each other in the locker room. They
were so happy for Wenyen in the SEC tournament. Seeing that an individual is
playing better, individuals helping their team as they helped themselves.  
  
The last piece of it is they've got to come together and be about each other.
And normally that takes us, the people that have watched my teams until
February. We play okay, but it takes until February before they establish who
they are, start thinking the right way, start preparing the right way. If I
want to change I've got to work and do things different. If I want to be
disciplined on the court I've got to be disciplined off the court. I've got to
do things I don't like to do and then try to do them well. I mean, it's like a
process that every one of these kids go through.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about Georgia hiring Tom Crean?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He and I talked yesterday. I couldn't be more happy for him.
Terrific coach. One of the best. He's into basketball. He loves it. He's about
getting kids better. He's always done it. We've had some good games.  
  
I did tell him I'm taking Georgia off the schedule. He laughed. Said, We're
playing you twice. I said, Not in Athens. No, I'm just kidding. We're playing
in Athens. But I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. During the losing streak a lot of people, myself included, doubted
that you could get this team playing at this level. Given the fact that --  
JOHN CALIPARI: You doubted me?  
  
Q. I doubted you, yes, sir.  
JOHN CALIPARI: And told me that? Why did you tell me? I didn't know. Now I
look at you different (laughter).  
  
Q. Given this team is the youngest in the history of college basketball,
and given the fact that they could revert at any time --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Everybody have followed us closely.  
  
Q. Everybody talks about peaking at the right time. Is it fair to say
that this team is peaking at the right time?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We don't know yet. I'll tell you after tomorrow's game.
Tomorrow's game is: Are you ready to dig your heels in and ready to be strong
with the ball and not make excuses and play harder than the other team? That
means I'm looking at a guy in the eyes and I'm going to play harder than him.
And Buffalo is looking at us and say, No, we're playing harder than you.  
  
Do you know what that ends up being? That is a scrum. Are you willing to play
in the scrum? I love it. I think it's the best. And here's a big part of the
reason: These kids, every experience they go through they're learning, it's
going to help them in the future. And playing in this type of game, it's
wonderful, because there are some guys on the team that have to conquer that.
You can bail out, take a fade away or you can go right at that rim and try to
get fouled. You can play defensively and stay in a stance and here he drives
it, or you can foul him. You can have this look or you can have this look,
which one do you want?  
  
And so this is all good for these kids. I have no idea. What I'd like, and
what's been rewarding, I saw the eyes that you saw in February. But I also
knew they were looking right at my eyes, like how is he taking this? And, you
know, I've been doing this 35 years. 35 years. I've seen everything. We've had
losing streaks. We lost to four NCAA Tournament teams. They were four. They
weren't bad teams. And so I knew we were getting better, and everybody is, Why
are you so calm? Because we are getting better, that's all I can ask of these
guys.  
  
And now that I see what they look like and how they're responding and how
their games are changing, that is rewarding to me. And I'll say it again, of
all the years I've had, this may be the most rewarding for me personally, to
see this team do the things that they're doing.  
  
Q. How about this quote from Nate Oats: Calipari has been whining about
no experience, young, young, young --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Who said that?  
  
Q. Nate Oats. His direct quote. He was excited after the game. We don't
have that problem, we've got some veteran guys. What do you think, just trying
to talk his guys up?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I don't know if it's whining or telling the truth. I'm not
whining about it. I've got a pretty good team. He should not tell the truth.
He should not even say it. Introduce them and don't give their year. That's
fine.  
  
At the end of the day we've got to play a basketball game. Everybody has got
to get in the ring and play.  
  
Q. You've probably been in every single tournament situation but going
into tomorrow, playing a team that's coming off their biggest win in school
history, what kind of challenges does that face for a team that's playing
loose and playing like they have nothing to lose?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We're playing like we have nothing to lose. If we play and they
play, it's probably going to come down to who has the ball last. That happens
in the NCAA Tournament when two teams are fighting.  
  
If they come after us and we back up, they win the game. It's just how it is.  
  
I'll see how the game is being played. I don't know until the game starts. And
then what I have to do to try to keep my team in the game I'll try to do. My
freshmen -- I start five freshmen, by the way. I'm not whining, I'm just
explaining.  
  
Q. How good a leader has Shai been for you this year, and does he remind
you of anybody else you've had?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He's come on for that. And you have to earn that. I hate to
tell you, we won the SEC Championship and the Commissioner said, Who are your
captains? He wanted to give my captains the trophy. I never named captains. I
didn't know who the captains were. I just, You two, come up here.  
  
But he is now becoming that guy because of how he works, how he performs, how
he finishes games. Players are now looking to him. It's the best way is to
have captains kind of evolve versus I'm naming you a captain. I'd rather it be
that way.  
  
Q. Last night Arizona had Deandre, and Perkins is probably four inches
shorter than Deandre, and he was blowing by him. What kind of matchup issues
does Buffalo pose in that lineup that has four guards, and a 6-8 center? And
you and Arizona both have a lot of height. Is that difficult when you're going
against --  
JOHN CALIPARI: They also front the post. They also put unbelievable pressure
on the ball. As much as it's that, you've got to withstand it. They're going
to play. You're not just passing it where you want to pass it. You better get
open and be strong with the ball. If you're in the post you better fight for
the position, because they're not going to give it to you. It's not just
height. It's more battle.  
  
And they've been through it. They won their league. They won their league
tournament a couple of years running now. They're good. This is no -- I'm just
telling you. I've lived it. I had that kind of team. I had guys with chips on
their shoulders. It's fun to coach those guys. I always say when I had a whip
I would talk. I would say stuff, because I had a whip, I knew, they'd back me
up, they'd go play.  
  
It should be fun. It's going to be a hard game.  
  
Q. I don't know if you agree with this, but a lot of higher-seeded teams
might try to shorten the game. Buffalo is 17th in the country in tempo. Do you
agree that they're a little unusual and they use the tempo against everybody
and what do you think of the tempo?  
JOHN CALIPARI: My thing was I thought they were the top 5 in how fast they
were playing, not 17th. And they're creating shots for each other. They're an
unselfish team, too, now. They don't just come down -- they're creating good
shots for each other. They use the lane to create opportunities on the
perimeter. And they've got a lot of mismatch problems.  
  
Q. Do you recall who the player was that sent you the text that said
--  
JOHN CALIPARI: I do.  
  
Q. Can you tell us who it is?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, but I do.  
  
Q. Has it ever happened before? And how much did that drive into you
that you've got to get this right or these kids will never get to where they
should be?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, it's more of how can I feel bad when I've done this for 30
years and been through everything? My focus is going to be on how do they
feel? And that just because they're 6-9 and 6-10 doesn't mean they're grown
men. They have not been through these experiences that I have. And I've got to
keep relating to them that it's okay. And it's okay not to play poorly, if you
self-evaluate and figure out how you're going to change it. If you make
excuses, if you're enabled by the people around you it's not good.  
  
But these kids didn't do that. The people around them didn't do that. They
just kept fighting.  
  
I text with a lot of the guys. I texted today a couple of times with the
entire team. And I'll text each guy and give them something, some thoughts and
stuff. And sometimes I get stuff back. Sometimes not. But hopefully they read
some of it.  
  
Q. I know that the coaches and the players often run into each other in
different settings. With the Buffalo kids, seen any of them outside of
whatever you've been watching the last few days?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No. I don't know if you remember, but when I was at UMass my
team was No. 1 in the country, and we went to Buffalo. Dan Bazzani coached the
team. He said, Come and play at Buffalo. We played at Buffalo in their new
arena. One of the reasons I got to -- I like to talk food, I went to Bacci
Pizza, unbelievable, big square. They had anchor wings, have you ever heard of
them? I said, We'll play in Buffalo, I'm going to have two nights of eating
good food. I'm good.  
  
We played. And I've always had great thoughts. I've had friends of mine who
lived in Buffalo, Art Serotte was a high school coach for years and years and
years, and stays in touch with me now. So I've always liked Buffalo. In August
it's 76 degrees. The rest of us it's 110. In Buffalo it's 76 degrees.  
  
Q. I wonder, you're very animated during games and very into the action.
I wonder if there were coaches you watched coming up that you sort of got that
from how do you try to handle that, not getting too excited?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You are who you are when you're coaching. And I never tried to
be anybody else. But whether it's the guys I played for, Bill Sacco, and Joe
DeGregorio, I thought everyone that went into coaching was Italian for a
while. I didn't learn until I left high school that there were other people
that coached basketball. And then I worked for Larry Brown. I've worked for
great people. Paul Evans.  
  
They were all different. I learned from each of them. But I don't think any of
us in this profession can try to be anybody else.  
  
I wish I was less animated. I wish I was less emotional. But I was born this
way.  
  
Q. I've been sitting here listening to all these other coaches talk
about how much they enjoy the process of seeing their teams develop without
having to worry about the results. At Kentucky you don't have that luxury,
you've got to win every game by 20 points. Do you ever feel cheated that
you're not able to really enjoy --  
JOHN CALIPARI: I enjoy it. No one will steal my joy. I don't read anything.
Has anybody followed me on Twitter. If you do, I don't read what you send
back. 600,000 Facebook, 700,000, a million, I don't read any of it. I send
stuff out. I send pictures out and most of it is trying to help other people.  
  
But my joy is my joy. No one creates it for me and no one will take it away.
I've had many people try to steal my joy. They failed. They failed. If I worry
about people in the seats, what they're saying -- in Kentucky we have four
million coaches, that's how many people live in the state, four million. If I
worry about them I'll be up there sitting with them.  
  
I try to coach my team. And I get great joy. When I don't get that great joy
then I won't do this anymore. I don't feel like I have to do this the rest of
my life and then that's it. I'm really enjoying the players. Very hard turning
over teams like this. Very difficult. And there were times I'd shake my head,
why do I even try this?  
  
And I think back to my teams where I had four years with guys when I was at
UMass. And I wish I had guys for four years. But it's not my rule. And all I'm
trying to do is help the kids and whatever is right for the kids I'll deal
with. They are 19. I am 49. I can deal with it.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you knew Nate Oats at all? Have you recruited any
of his guys at Romulus?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I've been up there and I've recruited some guys up there, yeah.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

### [T.J. Otzelberger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33061)

### [Mike Daum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30736)

### [David Jenkins Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35078)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Ohio State - 81, South Dakota State - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome South Dakota State.  
  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: That was a very high-level basketball game. A lot of credit
to Ohio State. They played differently than they play each game. They decided
to go small, switch a lot of screens. And credit to Coach Holtmann, he does a
phenomenal job.  
  
Really proud of the young men in our program. We didn't come here for a moral
victory. We certainly didn't come here to lose. At the same time we got
ourselves in tough spots, down 13 in the first half, down 10 in the second
half, and brought it back, which speaks volumes to the character of the guys
I'm fortunate to coach each day. They made more plays down the stretch and
they came out with a win and credit to them.  
  
Q. You were matched up against Bates-Diop a lot of the game, did
anything surprise you?  
MIKE DAUM: Bates-Diop is a great player. For him to be able to shoot the way
he does at the height makes him a tough guard and his ability to take you off
the dribble. When I was on him I tried to keep my chest in front of him and
contest the 3-pointers he was taking.  
  
Q. They go on that 16-0 run, the game looks like out of hand and then
you storm back. What did you do to get back in the game? What does it say
about the team to not give up?  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: Yeah, I mean it just shows the togetherness of our group
of guys. We've been together, we fought through a lot of adversity throughout
the year. And they made their push and then we kind of popped back.  
  
But in the end they hit big shots. You've got to give credit to them.  
  
DAVID JENKINS JR.: We just made sure we kept a fast pace throughout the whole
game. We knew they were bigger, a strong team, we knew we had to go and push
it at them up and down the court. We kept doing that throughout the whole
game. And I feel like that helped us.  
  
MIKE DAUM: It just shows how together our team was, no matter what was going
on in the game, we just always huddled together, kept our game plan, stuck for
each other. And we were able to get ourselves back into it.  
  
Q. I know you had a big first half, 17 points, second half only 10. Were
they doing something to limit you in the second half? Were they making
adjustments guarding you or what were your thoughts on that?  
MIKE DAUM: I think they pressed up more when I was out on the perimeter,
forced me to take more contested 3s than anything else. Then I tried to go in
the paint in the second half. I thought they did a good job of adjusting from
the first half.  
  
Q. When you look back on your season, on your career, how much will it
mean you haven't got a NCAA Tournament win yet?  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: It's awesome that we've made it to three. It's always
going to hurt that we could never get a W in this environment. But I just look
back, the guys I've got to play with and the coaches I've been coached by. I
would not be in any other place than South Dakota State.  
  
Q. Their guard play was really good tonight, the 42 points. How big was
their guard play today and what did you see from the guards?  
DAVID JENKINS JR.: The guard play was really good tonight, and felt like they
really kept a good pace, as well. We tried to keep our chest in front of them.
But the guards stepped in front of the bigs.  
  
Q. A big decision on your future, NBA or otherwise, just take me through
the time line.  
MIKE DAUM: Honestly, I haven't really thought much about it. I've got to kind
of let this settle in for me. I've got to finish my school this year. So make
sure I get my credits all done, and I'll worry about it when it comes down the
line a little bit later.  
  
Q. They run that big 16-0 run but you guys fought back. What were you
able to do to get yourself back in the game and give yourself a chance to win
it there late?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: We've played all year faster style of play. And when you do
that there's runs both ways. We talk about moving on to the next play. We have
a lot of spurtability offensively. Our guys keep their composure, share the
basketball, we know it's going to come back around. Had it happen to us twice
in this game.  
  
Q. Not the time to reflect back on the season as a whole or some of
these individual players' careers, but when you say good-bye to players like
Reed and Lane and Ian, how much have they meant to the program and you as an
individual, and what will be your lasting memory of those three?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I'm thankful for those three. From the first day, they've
been unbelievable teammates and workers, great students and citizens. I've got
a tremendous amount of respect for those three guys, and they'll be missed.  
  
They did something that many of us aren't fortunate enough to do, they came
into a place that experienced success and took it to another level. They'll
always be remembered as a group that left the Jackrabbit jersey in a better
place.  
  
We hope that this is just -- even though they're leaving us in terms of
eligibility, but they're part of our extended family moving forward and we'll
see a whole lot of those three guys.  
  
Q. How much is it going to start to get to this program that you still
haven't won a game in the tournament?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I think our focus will continue to just remain on improving
every day and being at our best. And we're not a program looking at results
driven. We certainly have a high expectation for what we can do and what we
can accomplish. But it's not going to be something that overshadows all these
things these guys have accomplished on the court, in the classroom, in the
community.  
  
Any time you lose it's not what we're in this for. We play to win. But I don't
think that will overshadow what these guys continue to accomplish on a daily
basis.  
  
Q. Did it feel like a home game in there tonight? How much did the fan
support help you guys?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: It was a great feel. It's an awesome college venue. We're
fortunate that we had tremendous fan support. They came out. We've been lucky
with that all year long, loyal fans, and I think a few others maybe jumped in
with us as well, for one reason or another.  
  
I'd like to think our guys showed fight and they're a fun group to pull for.
But it was exciting and our guys certainly fed off that energy.  
  
Q. I know you kind of talked briefly about it, switching to small ball.
C.J. and Kam combined for 42 points, how big were those two in the second
half, how much difficulties did they give your defense there?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: Yeah, they did a tremendous job. Those guys are really good
players. And then certainly Kam at the end stepping up hitting the big 3 and
getting the 4-point play and the foul shots.  
  
They're coached, as you can tell, they're very well schooled and disciplined
and those guys stepped up and made big plays throughout the second half. But
none stand out more in my mind than the ones Kam made that separated them to
get the victory.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Buffalo - 89, Arizona - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Buffalo.  
  
NATE OATS: Can't say enough about our guys, just fought and battled. I felt
like we had a shot; I didn't think we were going to win it like that. I really
felt like we were going to win this game. I liked our guard play, I said it
from day 1.  
  
We felt like maybe we had a bad seed. We thought we were better than that.
Then I told the guys after the initial -- we'll try to get to the second
weekend, whether you beat a 5 as a 12. And then a 4 or 4 first and a 5, let's
go get what they gave us and get it done.  
  
Then the more you looked at them, the more beatable they looked because they
weren't that deep. We play fast. We had great guard play. I thought we could
guard their guards. They had one ball handler. I thought we could do a pretty
good job.  
  
And they've been through a lot of controversy. I thought they've done an
unbelievable job. They won 8 out of their last 9. The only one they lost is
when Trier didn't play and Coach Miller wasn't coaching. I didn't think the
more -- I watch enough Pac-12 games to last myself about five years. Nobody
puts any kind of ball pressure on them. We've got two of the best defensive
guards in the country in Caruthers and Jordan.  
  
I thought they'd come out and pressure and see if they can get the ball to the
two 7-footers with the guards having to handle pressure all night. And they
got it to them enough, but not enough to beat us. So if you look, Ayton had 14
and Ristic had 16. They were 312th in the country in percentage of points from
3. We wanted to make them shoot a lot of 3s. We're fortunate that they shot
2-for-18. And some of that was due to us and some they just missed.  
  
That's a great program that Sean has built, unbelievable program. To get a win
over a program like Arizona, that speaks volumes to our guys. Wes and Jeremy
kind of carried us through the MAC tournament. This is the Third Team All MAC
selection. Supposedly there was five better point guards in the MAC than them.
The other coaches, I guess, didn't want to give them a First Team. Jeremy is a
Second Team All MAC guy. Apparently there are five players better than him in
the MAC. And CJ was First Team. He struggled a little bit in the MAC
tournament. I told him this afternoon, CJ, statistically it's impossible for
you to have another bad game because you're too good of a play. So you're
going to get this thing going tonight. He came out, hit a big 3 right out of
the gate.  
  
Jeremy and Wes got going right away, and felt good. We had to shore some
defensive stuff up and get the turnovers down. After that I felt good about
it. I felt great at halftime. We had 9 turnovers at the half. If we'd quit
turning the ball over we'd be up 10. We only had one in the second half and we
got a pretty good win.  
  
Q. Did you feel a little bit like people didn't understand how good this
team really was?  
WES CLARK: Definitely. With us being the MAC team it's easy to look as a team
that can't compete with a high Major or a team that got four NBA prospects, we
wouldn't be able to compete. But we know deep down, watching enough film,
looked at things, that our confidence was there. We can play with these guys
and play hard.  
  
Q. It was very back and forth in that first half. You guys took over the
second half. What were you guys doing to get separation from them?  
JEREMY HARRIS: I have to give the credit to our coaches, because it was a
great scouting report. And we just followed it for the most part. And did what
we've been doing all year. That's it.  
  
Q. You guys came out shooting incredibly in the second half, shot 64.3
percent from the 3-point. How do you explain how you shoot that well from
3-point?  
WES CLARK: I think it was simple, you just make the shots no matter who was
out there. It's the same kind of shot, still the same basketball, 18 feet --
is it 18 feet?  
  
NATE OATS: 19-9, I believe --  
  
WES CLARK: 20 foot 3-pointer, we had the same confidence and didn't worry
about who was on the defensive end.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: We've been putting in work all year. We always staying after
practice, before practice, late at night, just shooting and getting the shots.
Since we've been here we've been in the gym late at night. We had a shoot-
around this morning. Same shots we've been shooting all year like Wes said.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: It just shows what type of program we have and what type of
guys and coaching staff we have in our program. We are very hard-working guys.
Ever since we've been here we got here early just to get in the gym, get used
to the altitude, and stuff like that. As soon as we got off the plane, went to
the hotel, Let's go hit shots. We just kept pounding it.  
  
Q. When you started you had a small section of Buffalo fans, a small
section of Arizona fans, and as it started picking up in the second half, you
had about 10,000 fans for Buffalo. Talk about that and the motivation it gave
you.  
CJ MASSINBURG: It was amazing. I noticed it at first, when we first got there,
we heard our Buffalo fans, then we went on a run. The whole arena started
erupting. It felt amazing so I guess with Wes Clark there, they thought we
were handsome and they got behind us.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: The same thing as CJ said. We had a little section and then by
the end of the game it seemed like we were in the arena in Buffalo.  
  
WES CLARK: Man, you know, it's the same. It's just the same feeling. We just
took it one play at a time. Everybody likes a nice, hard-working team. So we
just embraced that and tried to play as hard as we can.  
  
Q. One of the things I noticed about your style of play is that you know
exactly what you wanted to do and you stay with it. Where do you get that?
Arizona made a nice little comeback, down 2 going into halftime. They went in
a little bit, and then you took over from there. Where do you get the
relentlessness from?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Man, it comes from the man at the end of the table. He has the
utmost confidence in all his players. We just came in feeling like we belong
there. We belong at this stage. He's not scared of anything, and he puts that
into us. And we follow his lead. He's a relentless person.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: I have to say the same thing. Coach is probably the most
competitive coach I've ever played for. He wants his players to go out and
play the game. If you're a 3-point shooter, he wants you to shoot 3s every
time. If you're a driver, same. Credit to Coach Oats.  
  
Q. You guys busted a lot of brackets tonight. How does that make you all
feel?  
JEREMY HARRIS: That's pretty amazing, I can't even sit up here and lie
(laughter).  
  
Yeah, we did bust a lot of brackets. We kind of knew that we could play with
them. So we went out there with a game plan. We're really happy.  
  
Q. You were here two years ago when this team lost. So what's it like to
be a part of winning the first tournament game, with this being your first
ever NCAA Tournament?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Oh, man, it feels good. Yeah, like you say, we came here two
years ago, we felt like we could have got that one. That one came down to the
last four or five minutes. We just carried over that experience. We did get up
on Arizona like maybe 6 or 4 or something like that, we've got to put our foot
on the gas. We just carried that experience over to here.  
  
JEREMY HARRIS: Wes and I were talking late last night -- I won't tell you the
time, because Coach might get mad -- we couldn't sleep because we were so
excited to play. And it's amazing. March Madness is amazing.  
  
WES CLARK: This is a great opportunity for us. We watch it on TV every year.
But for us to be in this type of tournament it was a great opportunity. We
wanted to embrace it. We couldn't sleep, like he said. We were up all night,
thinking about the game, watching film, and thinking about what we had to do
to get a W.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: President Barack Obama, he picked Arizona to beat us. And I
just want to say, President Obama, I'm sorry, but I had to (laughter).  
  
WES CLARK: Should have chose the handsome guys. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. You mentioned it yesterday, did anybody go through a table
celebrating?  
NATE OATS: Search it on Twitter, I'm sure somebody has by now. You Be Naked
Guy maybe, our big fan in Buffalo, probably went through a table.  
  
Q. I confess, I haven't really watched your team play a whole lot this
year. Do they usually play with that amount of effort and intensity? And if
so, how in the world did you lose 8 games during the regular season?  
NATE OATS: Great question, really. Wes Clark transferred from Missouri. We
didn't get Wes eligible until second semester. So we lost five of the non-
conference, three of them without him. And we were down to seven scholarship
players, one of them we had to pull off the football team, Dominic Johnson. We
didn't have enough players. We lost to Cincinnati and South Dakota State, who
everybody saw play here.  
  
We got Wes back, we were up one at Syracuse, and ended up losing it. That was
his first game in 22 months. We had to travel to Texas A&M, it was the travel
day from hell. And we were still in that game with three minutes to go, and
lost that. We lost to St. Bonaventure, who is playing -- they're playing
tonight. I don't know if they won it. Did they win or not? Oh, they lost? But
they're a pretty good team, too.  
  
And then we got in conference. Conference play sometimes -- we had some
injuries. Caruthers missed a month and a half with a stress fracture, and he's
basically been playing the game. We shot 11 of 26 at the free throw line in
one game.  
  
We do play that hard all the time. We've given ourselves a blue collar
mentality, we give out a hardhat after every game. We have charges, floor
dives, loose balls, deflections, we tally up the whole thing, and give the
hardhat out to whoever wins the blue collar points we call them.  
  
We were 7th in the country in scoring. But we score off our defense. So we
keep preaching defense, defense, defense. It was pretty good tonight.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about some of your ideas of how to slow down
Deandre. Talking about it and doing it are two completely different things.
Are you at all shocked at how well you guys were able to slow him down and
almost made him look like a normal human being at points?  
NATE OATS: No, because our bigs do a great job. Our guards do a great job.
He's really good, but you can take a big out of the game in college. It's not
that hard. There's no three seconds in the lane. You can pack a guy, sit right
behind him the whole time. You can't take a guard out. You can't take Wes
Clark out of the game. The thing was if Trier got hot, Jackson caught fire, we
knew they were going to have to miss some 3s. It's not that we don't have guys
with size. We have 6-10, 6-8. Jeremy is long, he's got length.  
  
So I might be a tad surprised with how well it went but no, we've been able to
take bigs out all year with how well we play.

### [Francis Alonso](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34995)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome UNCG.  
  
WES MILLER: Well, I don't think I could be prouder of my group. We're 0-13 in
the first half, 3-8 from the free throw line and we're in a three-possession
game at halftime. And I think that says a lot about the toughness we've had
all year, the grit that we've had all year. So I felt really fortunate because
I felt we got pretty good looks in the first half, maybe we had to kick some
jitters off.  
  
In the second half I thought things opened up for us offensively. The ball
started going through the basket. And certainly in the first half James Dickey
kind of kept us in it. I thought he was in a good rhythm offensively. Probably
could have done a better job getting him the ball in the second half.  
  
In the second half Demetrius and Francis got us going with the plays, not just
for themselves but for other guys. And then our defense wasn't what it wanted
to be, especially to start the second half. But I thought we had some tough
possessions, just to go get 50/50 balls. There were a couple of scrums around
the basket and you always kick yourself and go "what if"; what if we came up
with that one or this one.  
  
But I thought our fight to the ball was pretty good. We'll always think about
that last minute or so and think kind of "what if." I could have made some
better play calls. I changed the play call coming out of the timeout. And I
put Francis in a really tough position. I think if I kept the first one it
wouldn't have been scouted and we might have got a better look and not turned
it over.  
  
And then I think for these young guys, the guys that will be returning, we can
build on the fact that we had all off season we've been a good defensive team,
but we can get better. We had a lead, two possessions to get stops to win a
game. And we gave up five points in those two possessions.  
  
There are some things we can learn from and build on, but I couldn't be
prouder.  
  
Q. The play late in the second half where the ball skimmed off the rim
and they didn't reset the clock, how did that happen?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: To be honest, I didn't really even notice it. All I hear is
guys from the benches yelling at me, You've got to shoot, you've got to shoot
the ball. We kept playing. And I think that play didn't really affect us as a
team in the last stretch of the game.  
  
For me personally, I could have guarded the ball better in the last two
possessions, and we could have had a better chance to win the game. But
absolutely that play didn't affect us for the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Mark Few said he was surprised how well you were able to penetrate
and score. Your thoughts on why that was working so well and how much of a
difference that made today?  
DEMETRIUS TROY: Well, I think it worked really well. Coach Miller gives us a
lot of freedom to just play very freely and open and confidently. And Coach
was just giving us a lot of great play calls for us to be able to get into the
lane. And we were able to continually get down there and make things happen.
So we just kept going along with what was working.  
  
Q. The play with 20 seconds left where they called the foul on you, what
was that play supposed to be? Take me through that sequence, what happened
there.  
FRANCIS ALONSO: You're talking about coming off the screen and they called an
offensive foul? Well, I was hearing from the Gonzaga bench that they knew the
play. So I was trying to set up a ball screen for me. The guy stepped on my
feet. I was leaning into him. The ref called charge for some situations that
had happened during the game. And you can't control that.  
  
And I'm still frustrated by the defensive stops that I didn't get, guarding
the ball. And the last possession, and those situations, there are things that
I can control as a player. But absolutely that call, it was -- that was a
ref's decision so I couldn't blame them.  
  
Q. Not making the 3-pointer in the first half, he said you had some
looks. How would you assess what wasn't working in getting those shots falling
in the first half?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: Of course playing against a great team as Gonzaga and making
wide open 3s or good looks is going to hurt you by the end of the game. Some
3s went in and out, but it happens. We stayed true to our values on the
defensive aspect of the team. We knew that some shots aren't going to go in.
And it happened today, unfortunately.  
  
But we fought, as Coach said, in a defensive aspect on the other side of the
court. And we kept competing. We kept competing as a team and we didn't give
up. So we've got to be proud of that. Of course, really sad because we didn't
have our day offensively.  
  
Q. You have only one senior in your starting lineup -- two seniors in
your starting lineup. What can this team build for next season, and how
encouraging is it that you'll have players coming back?  
WES MILLER: We hit on that in the locker room. We've really worked hard to try
to build culture on a day-to-day basis in our program. And I told our guys in
the locker room that our seniors from last year, Diante Baldwin and R.J.
White, were probably really proud watching them play in the NCAA tournament.
And for the returning guys, Jordy Kuiper and Marvin Smith and Garrett Collins
and Justin Jordan, our seniors this year, be really proud if we can take a
step forward and keep growing our program.  
  
So we do have the opportunity to keep growing and moving forward. And I'm
excited about the young guys in our program and the returning guys. These two
guards sitting up here today, they're pretty darned good players, they'll be
seniors next year. Hopefully we can continue to try to grow one at a time.  
  
Q. You said you put Francis in a tough position. I know there were two
possessions, the offensive foul and one where he was really behind the eight
ball trying to get a shot off. But I just wanted to get your breakdown of what
happened on those.  
WES MILLER: We had the ball there and I looked up and there's 50 seconds or so
on the clock. And we were struggling to guard him in the second half. I felt
like we were searching at times. And I felt like we tried the zone a little
bit. We were trying to mix up how we were playing the post.  
  
But I felt like sometimes we were lucky, they missed some quality 3s. I
thought we really guarded in the first half. I didn't think we were as good
defensively. So I looked up and it's a feel thing, sometimes I've gone two for
one with this team, sometimes I haven't. I looked up and said, man, we can go
two for one.  
  
I want the ball in Francis's hand, we needed a basket, we give him the ball
and give him space. We set a high ball screen, and I wanted to get the two-
for-one opportunity, which we did, but I don't think he got a great look and I
probably sped him up a little bit. And then coming out of the timeout there
after Norvell hit the big three. Again, I had the call, the same set, and I
changed it to another call in the set. The one that I changed it to they had
scouted and I put him in a tough position.  
  
I don't think any of our calls are were bad calls, but you think "what if," I
think that's what you do in this situation as a player and coach. People say,
man, you were pretty gutsy when you threw the lob, we were up two, but they
were starting to really extend on pin-downs.  
  
I love Demetrius and James, they've connected on a lot of lobs this year. And
we weren't going to be afraid tonight, we were going to come out swinging.
People might think that's a gutsy call, I thought James would call it, and
come down with it, there might have been a little contact there, we have to
look at the film. We didn't execute in the last minute and a half, and we'll
have to go through the film and look at that.  
  
Q. Two things about James, you pulled him about 90 seconds into the
game. What did you talk about? Were you surprised how well he got off the
block offensively against a team that's long and tall?  
WES MILLER: You mean 90 seconds in the first half? He gave the tired signal
which is why he came out there early. I thought he was in a great rhythm
offensively. Our team was in a good rhythm offensively. We got quality shots,
we just couldn't seem to make them. But he was the one guy that had it going a
little bit.  
  
The last two or three weeks he's been sped up a little bit on offense, he's so
excited, plays with such good energy. I thought he had slowed down around the
basket tonight and that's who he's been most of the year. But maybe he was
just a little too excited.  
  
Tonight he was really under control with the ball there. We're not even in the
game in the first half offensively if it's not for him. He was tremendous
tonight. He's been defensive player of the year in the Southern Conference.
You look now and he's got 11 rebounds tonight and I thought he was a factor
defensively. He's a tremendous young player, and we're fortunate he'll be back
for the next two years.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about the problems they present for you in the
post. You out-rebounded this team tonight. How pleased were you with that
effort and particularly the effort inside from your guys?  
WES MILLER: I thought we had to do that to give ourselves a chance. I thought
we made a great effort to get the ball in the second half. I don't think we
guarded as well, I don't think it was from lack of effort, they're just a
really good team. Give them the credit. They can execute offense, so we were
struggling.  
  
But the one thing I think we did was we pursued the ball well. My favorite
play of the night was Marvin going for a loose ball, gets knocked to the
ground. Sometimes that's frustrating, you thought you had it, you get knocked
off your position, he just sprints up and goes and gets a big-time rebound in
traffic.  
  
I thought we had an edge in the second half to go get the ball, even though I
thought they were in good rhythm offensively.  
  
Q. Mark talked about how essential he thought it was that they guarded
the three. He also said he thought you guys were exceptionally efficient at
driving for 2s in the second half. Did you emphasize in any particular way
dribble penetration as a reaction to what they were trying to do to you?  
WES MILLER: We're a spread team. We try to open the floor up and let the guys
go. We like to shoot the 3. We got 22 looks, and I venture to think that 18 of
them were pretty good looks for us. But the one thing we did really emphasize
was being strong with the ball and we did drive. We thought we could drive it.
But they're good at coming in and getting deflections. We saw that on tape. We
drilled it this week. We talked a lot about it.

Cartwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33080)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Buffalo - 89, Arizona - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Arizona.  
  
SEAN MILLER: Well, we knew we had a very tough draw. We knew we were playing
an excellent basketball team. And the team, quite frankly, that we didn't
necessarily match up well with. We prepared hard but we ran into a team that
played well on a night where we didn't. They certainly had a lot to do with
that.  
  
But it's difficult to exit the tournament the way we have because it doesn't
shed light on a lot of the great moments, a lot of the things especially these
two guys have fought hard to establish on a season that represented 27 wins
and the Pac-12 tournament, regular season championship. All that goes away
when you lose in the tournament, but in particular lose in the first round the
way we did.  
  
It wasn't a lack of effort, certainly wasn't a lack of wanting to advance. We
got beat. And we got beat by a good team. A well-coached team. A team that was
tough.  
  
And the second half -- we didn't play well in the first half to be down 2. I
think we felt like we had been in that situation many times, but they
overwhelmed us in the second half. We struggled on offense and on defense. And
clearly all credit to Buffalo. They did a great job.  
  
Q. You guys represent two of the winningest players that this program
has ever had. Could you take me through your emotions right now in what's got
to be a particularly disappointing time?  
DUSAN RISTIC: Like you said, it's a disappointing time for us. We didn't
expect to lose this tournament. And the last four years, like, doesn't feel
good right now. It's frustrating. It's something we didn't expect.  
  
PARKER JACKSON-CARTWRIGHT: It really doesn't seem real right now. And for our
team, just disappointed.  
  
Give them credit. They played really well. Did a good job.  
  
Q. The Buffalo coach talked about how part of his plan was to pressure
the guards and he felt that was an effective strategy. Did you notice more
pressure, like defensive pressure than most teams had played on you this
year?  
PARKER JACKSON-CARTWRIGHT: Yeah. They were physical from the start of the
game, which kind of got us out of rhythm, particularly on offense. The
pressure on not just myself but all our guards made it tough on us.  
  
Q. Can you just take me through your emotions in terms of the course and
way you took this season, the ups and downs, and for it all to come to an end
tonight?  
PARKER JACKSON-CARTWRIGHT: We endured a lot from the beginning. People kind of
wrote us off. And I thought we responded every time that happened. We kind of
fought through everything. People were writing about us or tearing us down. We
felt like coming into tonight we were playing good basketball, and for it to
end like this is just really disappointing.  
  
Q. Deandre just now said that the biggest thing he got out of the season
was a real appreciation for you, for how hard he had to play game in and game
out. He said that he really didn't think he understood what that represented
until he came here. Could you talk a little about where he was versus where he
is now?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes, you know, Deandre superceded any expectation that I could
have ever had for him. He was an incredible teammate. Worked hard every day.
Played for the win. The way our team is made up and we've fought all year with
this, when you play two 7-footers, one of the two 7-footers has to do some
extraordinary things on defense. And that's part of what I saw Buffalo play.  
  
I knew it was going to be a tough draw for us because Harris is so good. And
it's what they do every game. They exploit that matchup.  
  
But with Deandre as fine of a kid as we've had and an extraordinary player, I
hate to see him go out in the first round. It's not his fault, really. He had
13 and 14. I thought Buffalo pressured us and took us out of some things and
negated some of the things that he's done all season long. But for anybody to
not remember Deandre as the greatest freshman that ever walked through
Arizona, they weren't paying attention, statistically and just the type of kid
he is. He's destined to go do some great things.  
  
When you get someone like him, you want to go all the way, right? And when you
lose in the first round that's a tough pill to swallow. But he was fantastic.
He's one of a kind.  
  
Q. Deandre has looked superhuman at points this year. You mentioned that
you knew it was going to be a tough draw, because of how Buffalo plays. Were
you surprised at how well they were able to slow him down?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes. Even him. He might not have had his A game. But I thought
their pressure decimated us. It was 40-38 at the half. And kind of the way our
team played this entire season, we've been more of a second half group than a
first half. And a lot of times, in the first four minutes of the second half
we really get going.  
  
The opposite happened tonight. And that's to Buffalo's credit. The stat sheet
is one that you don't oftentimes see in that they had two players had 20 made
field goals. They were 15 of 30 from the 3-point line. We were 2 for 18. Their
guard play, their pressure defense, you know, they really took it to us.  
  
The other thing is, Perkins can make a couple of 3s in addition to what they
already have, especially against us. That means their 5 and their 4 are making
3s. UCLA gave us problems with that. That was one of our losses. And the way
they utilize their bigs, I mean they're very difficult to defend and yet at
the same time they play tremendous defense. They did a great job. They beat us
hands down from start to finish.  
  
Q. Two years ago Wichita State kind of came out similarly to Buffalo.
Besides losing the first round, can you explain your emotions going through
the course of the season and what you're feeling right now?  
SEAN MILLER: This game feels a lot like Wichita. Wichita, they had those
guards and they pressured us, and they were physical and an excellent team.
Buffalo, excellent team, physical, pressured us and both of our first-round
exits had that in common.  
  
You know, in terms of my emotions, I'm not going to change. I'm taking things
a day at a time. Obviously this is a tough day. And we have to move forward.
My thoughts are more with our players right now. It's not easy to win the
Pac-12 Tournament in the regular season, overcome a lot, get here to the
tournament finally and not play well and get beat like we got beat. But that's
part of sports.  
  
Q. Along those lines, how do you think this season will be remembered
two or three years from now?  
SEAN MILLER: I don't know. I can only go on what we've done. We're 27 and 8.
We made the tournament. We got beat by I think a really good team. Didn't play
well. They had a lot to do with it.  
  
Let me just say this: We worked hard to be ready for the game. The guys
practiced hard. When you go three games in three days in a conference
tournament you're a little bit banged up. So we tried to be smart in our
approach. But our intention was good. We just didn't have it tonight. And
Buffalo deserves a lot of credit.  
  
Q. There were a lot of stretches where Deandre did not touch the ball.
And it resembled when they lost in Oregon. How do you guys not give him the
ball?  
SEAN MILLER: Buffalo did a great job. They did. They pressured our guards.
They took us out of a lot of things. Deandre in the first half had zero
offensive rebounds, so that was part of the story. Obviously he came alive in
the second half. He had five offensive rebounds. We as a group didn't get him
the ball. But it wasn't like we didn't know that.  
  
I think sometimes you have to give the defense and the other team the credit.
They were able to pressure us at a level that hasn't happened very often. And
Deandre's averaged 20 and 10, 20 and 11. I think in the last two or three
weeks he's probably closer to 26, 28 points, 15 rebounds. So we've established
that we can get him the ball.  
  
Tonight it wasn't as if we got away from him; it was just that the other team
did a great job. I'll use the analogy of a great wide receiver. If the pass
rush and the blitzes just continues to get to the quarterback, then that
receiver is not going to get as many catches or opportunities. And tonight in
the basketball terms their ball pressure, taking us out of our ability to get
him the ball, and it certainly played to their advantage and they deserve a
lot of credit.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE.)  
SEAN MILLER: He's frustrated because his career is ending. He wanted to keep
playing.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Will Magarity](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35087)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 78, Davidson - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Davidson College.  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Congratulations to the University of Kentucky. They made life on
both the defensive end and the offensive end difficult.  
  
I have such incredible gratitude to the Davidson players for the way they made
this one of the most joyful seasons of my life. To see them cap off the season
with a NCAA berth and then go toe-to-toe with a storied school like Kentucky
gives me great pride as well as the great joy. And it's a memory I'll treasure
forever.  
  
Q. John just said that he was obviously extremely concerned, as you
expect, with the 3-point shooting. And he felt it was essential to use their
length to get up on you guys, more than they might against a typical team.
Could you talk a little about that and to what extent you thought that
affected you tonight?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Yeah, they're a very long team. And tonight I thought I got
some open looks early on, even later on they didn't fall. They did a good job
of knowing where I was at and trying to close out every time I saw the ball.  
  
Q. Looking back at the season and your careers at Davidson, how are you
going to look back at this four years ten years from now?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: This has been one of the best four years of my life. I
couldn't be any more proud of the Davidson community, Davidson College. It
means everything to me. They're my family. I love each and every one of the
guys, each and every one of the coaches. You'll never be able to take Davidson
College away from me.  
  
WILL MAGARITY: I decided to come here from -- when I transferred in. The first
day I was here I knew right away this was family. This is a different program.
The way that Coach really instills trust, commitment, and care every single
day. It's hard work, but we love what we do. And I think this season is an
accumulation of everything and is really the peak of it. I'll treasure this
for the rest of my life.  
  
Q. What sort of difficulties did Kentucky present defensively that you
might not have otherwise seen this season, if any?  
BOB McKILLOP: I think the ability to defend the rim, to take away maybe four
or six layups that we normally would have had. And with taking away the rim
they were still able to close out on our shooters at the arc. So I would say
in the first half there were four or five layups that came up empty. And in
fact, led to baskets by them.  
  
I felt their break on the ball, which was very deceptive. They're not a denial
team, but they have the ability to close space very quickly. And there were, I
think, three occasions they closed space very quickly, got steals and baskets.
When you add it all up, that's the game right there. This was a two-possession
game, and we ran out of time.  
  
Q. Early in the game it seemed like your team was focusing getting back
on defense. But partway through the game you were crashing the board. Was that
a change in the game plan or what was the decision?  
BOB McKILLOP: It wasn't a change. A few more of the balls were going through
the net. We did a much better job of tipping out long rebounds, and I think
that was where the offensive rebounds occurred on the tip-outs, much more so
than securing them and going back up with them. But I thought that the ball
went through the net a little bit more the second half.  
  
Q. I'm more fascinated with this than anyone, but Kentucky did not make
a three tonight. Did you know that?  
BOB McKILLOP: We sure did. And that was a point of emphasis. And may have
caused us the problem of sending them to the line as much as we did. And
having them score points in the paint as much as they did. The point of
emphasis was on a couple of their shooters, but not to the point of not being
connected. And I thought we had such a sense of urgency about covering their
shooters that we didn't stay connected on penetration. And there were several
penetrations that we should have had much more help, which we didn't, because
we were concerned about the shooters.  
  
Q. Along the same lines, it's so rare, would you have almost always bet
the house that if you held any team without a three that you would win?  
BOB McKILLOP: Well, when they send them to the line for 32 shots and they make
80 percent of them, you're putting yourself in jeopardy right away. And you
give them a couple of undefended baskets with turnovers, you're talking about
35 points right there. And that 35 points in a 5-point game is very pivotal.  
  
I'd also like to make one comment. The fans in Boise, the hospitality here in
Boise, the people that worked, the police department, the people in our hotel
absolutely sensational. I could not be more impressed, felt more a sense of
belonging here, welcomed here. And, boy, it's going to leave a lasting memory
with our players, with our program and with our coaches because the people of
Boise are just absolutely sensational. So thanks to them.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Kam Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35077)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Ohio State - 81, South Dakota State - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ohio State.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Listen, we have a lot of respect for South Dakota State. And I
think our preparation certainly defensively, certainly defensively was on
point. We did not always have as good of attention to detail as we needed to
against them. They're a matchup nightmare in a lot of ways. And I give them a
lot of credit for how they played. I just thought they kept battling. They had
the benefit of the crowd behind them. It got loud for them.  
  
But our guys responded and came down the stretch. Players win games, and they
did that.  
  
Q. You shot 40 3-pointers, today, was that in the game plan?  
KAM WILLIAMS: I'm going to say yeah, but not really. We knew if we got the
ball we'd get rotations to drive to the basket. We were taking what the
defense was giving us. We forced a couple of them. Once we got settled down we
were able to execute like we were supposed to.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: It wasn't really in the game plan, but the game kind of
called for it. We had good shooters and for the most part had good shots.  
  
Q. It had been a couple of seasons since this team had been to the NCAA
Tournament. What did it feel like getting back here?  
KAM WILLIAMS: Amazing. Ohio State's been in a drought. And myself, JT,
everybody on the team, Kaleb, we've been hungry for this moment. The coaching
staff has been preaching to us: Embrace the moment. You never know when you're
going to make it back here.  
  
So just embracing the moment and just hopefully we can go as far as we can.  
  
Q. You talked about it yesterday, you finally were matched up against
Mike Daum. What was that like and was it what you thought it was or did he do
anything to surprise you?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: It was about what I thought it was. It was a tough matchup
because of his size. He's a tough matchup, but everything we expected. We did
a great job scouting.  
  
Q. The corner 3 they made when you had a guy in your face, you made it
and get the shot to go down, and then scored the next seven points.  
KAM WILLIAMS: I give the coaching staff the credit. They called the play for
me. They had enough confidence to do that down the stretch. And as hard as I
worked, my confidence is never going to be shot. So as soon as I let it go I
felt like it was going to go in and it just went in. It just felt great. And
everything just kind of got rolling from there.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a game there's a lot of talk about whether the
long break would be helpful or hurtful. Do you have any opinion on the impact
of the longer break?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I feel like it was good, just because we fine-tuned some
things, especially on defense. We had a lot of time to get back to basics and
defensive principles specifically. But I did think it helped and we won the
game.  
  
KAM WILLIAMS: I think it definitely benefited us. Because the way we went out
in the Big Ten tournament, that made us more hungry. So we had to fix little
tweaks that we had in the games previous. Once we did that and we got our game
plan together we felt like we'd be here for a while.  
  
Q. In that second half it seemed like they were maybe about to go on a
run, what did you do during that one run to put separation between you guys?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Tried to stay poised. It's a game of ups and downs and runs.
We went on a run obviously and just kind of played our game.  
  
Q. What do you remember about your game with Gonzaga?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Like you said, it was a long time ago. We're two completely
different teams, especially us. I remember they were obviously big and long.
But they killed us on the big point shooting, I'm pretty sure. That was months
ago. And not even close to the same team.  
  
KAM WILLIAMS: We're nowhere near the team we were back then. We've progressed
in so many different areas. And the whole team is excited for this one. We've
been wanting this matchup ever since the bracket came out. Hopefully when they
take the court they'll feel us, because they didn't feel us in the first game.  
  
Q. Everyone knows about you're the Big Ten player of the year. But what
was it like seeing Kam and CJ have a monster game. In the second half they
seemed to take over the second half. What was it like to see those two players
and what do they mean to the team?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I wasn't surprised at all. This isn't like a one-man team in
any sort of way. I trust Kam to shoot the shots he took, and CJ to do what he
did. I get a lot of credit sometimes, but this is a team, this is a great
team.  
  
Q. Were you surprised when you looked at the stat sheet and saw 40
3-point attempts?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It's not really who we are. It wasn't the game plan. It's
really difficult because they're literally giving you tee-up 3s. I think they
knew we liked to play inside out. And they were taking away all the interior
stuff that we wanted to do. We have got -- probably could have shot about 8 or
9 of those 3s, honestly.  
  
If we were at 30 or 32 -- it's a tough thing as a coach where you're trying to
figure out, Are we going to get a better shot than a wide open 1, 2, step 3?
And talking to coaches in the past we knew they were going to play us like
that here. We didn't always make the ones that we had open. But certainly 40
is too much for us.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Kam's role, 7 points and kind of iced the
game and talk about his play down the stretch.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It was great. One of the assistant coaches, Ron, we had a call
on an action we run for him. We were struggling there late, we were saying,
Somebody has to make a play, and someone has to take an open look and make an
open shot. And he's that kind of a kid. He wants the ball in his hands in
those moments. And he's got that look in his eye.  
  
And I thought Keita did a nice job screening for him, and Dakich did a nice
job tipping out. When he gets the offensive rebound the bench is screaming,
Pull it out, pull it out. When you have a guy that can shoot it like him, I
don't know if you're going to turn the off switch there in that moment. I was
happy he took that shot and got fouled.  
  
Q. Dakich never left the floor in the second half. What did you think of
his performance?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Good. Andrew has given us a lot of quality minutes, he's glued
our team and connected our team in a lot of ways. Missed some open looks, had
some defensive errors. But Andrew has been terrific for us. And he was
terrific again tonight, he really was.  
  
It's hard for me to -- I don't know if I'd have thought this going in the
season, but when we put him out there a lot of times he's hard to pull off the
floor.  
  
Q. In the second half it was pretty tight. But you ran that 16-0 run.
How big was that run for you to set the tone of the game in the second half?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You can't get a whole lot of separation from these guys. I'd
watched them against Wichita State and Colorado and Ole Miss and Iowa. It's
hard to get separation from them. They're so proficient.  
  
So to get a little bit of separation and then kind of keep them at bay, and we
knew it could get tight late, again, I think we anticipated a road-type
environment. I don't know that we anticipated that it would be quite as loud
as it got. Maybe I should have prepared them more for that. It was great to
see our guys respond.  
  
Q. How does the fact that you played Gonzaga earlier this season affect
your preparation for Saturday?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Two different teams a lot of ways right now. I've got so much
respect for them after playing them. I'd never coached against a Gonzaga team
before. Mark does such a fantastic job. They're physical. They're tough.
They're very talented. I thought that they're one of the top one or two teams
we played all year. They are one of the very best teams we played all year.
And they handed it to us. So we'll go back and we'll watch that.  
  
How much they've changed and we've changed, I don't know, because I didn't
follow them as much. But they smacked us around pretty good.  
  
Q. Daum, in the second half you did a better job containing him. Did you
feel you did a better job limiting what he could do?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, obviously you did. But I didn't think we did a terrible
job in the first half. We probably weren't as good -- we left him open a
couple of times off of offensive rebounds and then had a couple of slip-ups.
He's just a really, really good player. Man, he's a really good player. And
when he gets driving it downhill he's a low 2 because of his size.  
  
But I thought our attention to detail was a little better in the second half
and we had probably about four errors with him in the first half and then the
second half we had maybe one or two.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Johnathan Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33110)

### [Josh Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30801)

### [Zach Norvell Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35061)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Gonzaga.  
  
MARK FEW: It was a heck of a ballgame. We sit up here and feel very fortunate
to advance and to win. But at the same time I'm proud of how my guys just hung
with it and hung with it and hung with it. We knew it was going to be kind of
that pace of a game, that's all UNCG plays. And I think we just made enough
plays down the stretch to hold them off.  
  
But, man, I thought they were really, really good. And I thought they were
really good down the stretch. The guards hurt us with the penetration. And yet
we were guarding them very, very well. And they were able to make some very
difficult shots against some of our switches on the ball screens. Our guys
kept their poise and continued to get good shots through all that. Made one
more play than they did. We're fortunate to advance.  
  
Q. This isn't your first tournament. Just talk about the battle you just
went through.  
JOSH PERKINS: I'm still shaking, still sweating, but I'm just glad I'm here
with these guys and coaching staff. This is my first tournament, but I'm just
glad I'm here with this group of guys, my brothers.  
  
Q. The shot at the end of the game, can you talk about that?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: For sure. I'm a really confident guy. And the coaching staff
and all the guys around me put the confidence in me. I don't know how many
shots I missed tonight but every time I missed all the guys came to me, The
next one is going in, the next one is going in. So I had no choice but to make
a bucket.  
  
Q. On that shot it seemed like you were feeling it. You saw the open
window and you took it. Walk us through the play and why you felt so
confident.  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: Throughout the whole game they were trying to get over the
ball screens really good and they were showing really high, as well. So I knew
if I tried to get over really hard and I was able to knock the shot down.  
  
Q. You had the shot to tie the game. What was going through your mind?
What were you trying to say and the emotions you're behind and 30 seconds it
all turned back around?  
JOSH PERKINS: They were all over the place. I looked at the coach and said,
We've got this. I trust you and we're trusting each other.  
  
I'm glad I'm here with this guy and we're not done yet.  
  
Q. What was the crowd like and what was it like having them behind you
tonight?  
ZACH NORVELL JR.: It was great. Anytime you have Zag fans that can travel like
that and have our back, and when we got down, they didn't sit down at all.
They kept us going.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: It's nice when it felt like a home game out there for us. A lot
of credit to them and hope we can keep doing it Saturday.  
  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: We have the best fans in the country, probably in the
world. We appreciate them coming out and supporting us. They did an awesome
job.  
  
Q. From the first three minutes you had three turnovers. Was it jitters
or their defense? And if it was the defense, how did you push through that
down the stretch?  
JOSH PERKINS: I don't know. I can't answer that question. I'm just glad we
didn't keep that train going. If it was jitters, we got rid of it. I'm glad we
got rid of them.  
  
Q. What's going to have to improve for Saturday?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's direct the questions to the student-athletes and then
we'll go to the coach.  
  
Q. The matchup between you and James Dickey was entertaining in the
first half. What does he present from a length perspective, and why was it
rubbing off on the other guys?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: It wasn't just him. It was also other guys, as well. And
32, he had a big body. As far as Dickey, he's long and athletic and he can
jump. He made it tough for us.  
  
But we was able to make the shots down the stretch. He played awesome game. I
give him a ton of credit.  
  
Q. What made you calm enough to play Perkins after four fouls?  
MARK FEW: Basically out of necessity. He's essentially the only point guard we
have, and they were pressing us. But also there's some trust built up after
being with him, around him for four years. So it's a combination of probably
both of those.  
  
Q. You've done this a few times now, ten in a row. Does it get any
easier? What were you telling the team when Greensboro was making the run?  
MARK FEW: No, it doesn't get any easier. These first-round games are hard.
They're really hard. And I think people get a little misled when they see the
seed numbers up there.  
  
That's a really, really good team that we were fortunate enough to beat. They
were a very good defensive plan that kind of never quite let you get the flow.
I think we were able to get flow a couple of times there, especially in the
start of the second half and around that eight- to ten-minute mark.  
  
But I kept telling our guys to stay with it, stay with it, stay with it. We
were taking great care of the ball down the stretch. And we were actually
getting good shots on goal. I just felt like we weren't quite finishing them,
even the ones that led up to the three. It was a very good play. I think
somebody else had a jump shot that was a great shot for our team offense.  
  
I think the thing that probably most surprised us is their guards finished 2s
in the paint better than we saw on film or better than we had seen them do all
year. We went into the game trying to held them from the 3-point line, went 3
for 22, we out free-throwed them 13-5. But they made two.  
  
So that's when you tip your hat to them. They did a heck of a job making some
really tough shots.  
  
Q. What's impressed you about the confidence? Josh had it and Jack had
it, too. Making shots like that, and they felt they had a chance.  
MARK FEW: Those two are really confident players. It's probably more so than
anybody in our program have a high belief in themselves and at times that can
hurt us. But at times, especially down the stretch of the game when obviously
pressure is up a little bit and somebody has to step up and make a play,
that's when you want those two guys.  
  
Perkins has hit shots like that for us. Last year he hit them and this year he
hit him. And Norvell has a knack for that. When you size the guy up, A, he was
going to shoot it, and B, it was probably going to go in. So I was fine with
it.  
  
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about Zach? He was a red shirt last
year. And he had to sit there and watch a lot of your great stuff happening.
How did he deal with it?  
MARK FEW: I think he had some knee problems all through the summer and into
the fall. And then I think reality hit him. And he was a little bit behind
with everything. But he was looking at a back court that had Perkins, who had
been a two-year starter, Nigel Williams-Goss, he was a preseason All-American,
Jordan Mathews, who was a grad transfer who had unbelievable success,
especially shooting the ball like Zach does at Cal. And then Silas was
obviously going to play a lot of minutes because he's such a good defensive
player.  
  
So I think he understood that. And he's got a winning spirit about him. He has
an effervescence and charisma that is much needed with this team, because it's
a really quiet, introverted team, and he's certainly not any of that. He
provides not only that stuff on the floor, but off the floor is very
important.  
  
Q. Obviously first tournament game for Zach. Just talk about the
confidence you had in him making that shot.  
MARK FEW: Well, he's done it a lot. He's really done that time and time again
this year. And it might have happened in the first half when someone is on a
10-0 run against us and we're really struggling, or five minutes to go in a
game and they've shrunk our lead from 15 down to 7. And he's just wired to --
he's going to make a play. Now, sometimes it's a bad play and sometimes it's a
bad shot. But usually down the stretch of games he's confident enough and it
usually goes in.  
  
But prior to that shot, guys, he was 2 for 11. So it wasn't exactly one of his
greatest games in the Zag uni. I felt totally confident. When he sized it up I
knew it was going in. And that's kind of what he does.

BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Kevin Knox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34916)

### [Shai Gilgeous-
Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34914)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Kentucky - 78, Davidson - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome University of Kentucky.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: It was a good one for this young team. First time they've been
in the NCAA Tournament, not knowing what to expect. If you come out to play
the way we did in the second half, our season will be over. The way they
played in the second half, I thought defensively, to play a team that's as
efficient and an execution team like Davidson, this young team did pretty
good.  
  
And we had some breakdowns late and I got upset with a couple of the guys,
based on the fact that you cannot do what you're choosing to do. We're a team
and you cannot just break off. They're freshmen, and they're learning. We're
learning game to game now. Every one of these experiences is new.  
  
Kevin made some shots, Sacha is playing better and better, and he made shots,
and Shai controlled the game at the end to take us over the finish line,
barely.  
  
Q. You brought up yesterday that the main thing that you saw on tape was
the 3-point shooting. Was there anything in the game that surprised you from
Davidson?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Nothing really surprised us. We scouted really good
and Coach got us prepared for the game. But in terms of physically, it took a
lot from me personally guarding them, their actions, they don't stop moving.  
  
SACHA KILLEYA-JONES: Everything Shai said sums it up. They're a shooting team.
We expected that. They got off a lot of 3s, and they played strong through
their actions, their offense was tiring. But we did what we could.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: They did a real good job of knocking down the shots they got open.  
  
Q. For the past three weeks we can't get through a press conference
without Coach Cal saying something about your game. How does it feel when the
lights are brightest, the stage biggest, and your game finally coming
around?  
SACHA KILLEYA-JONES: It feels good that I'm playing well. Mostly I'm just
happy that the team is winning games, and anything I can do to contribute to
that is going to obviously feel great. And I'm glad I'm doing my part.  
  
And like I said, we're winning games and we are exactly where we want to be,
and looking forward to keep going.  
  
Q. What's been the difference these last couple of weeks? Seems like you
continually have been playing well. What was the difference today for you?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Personally, I don't think I played too well today.
Yeah, I've just been trying to do what I worked on and do what Coach is asking
me, what this team needs me to do. Today I didn't do too well. My shots
weren't falling. I got a little selfishness. I'm going to learn from it and
get better for the next game and try to do better next time.  
  
Q. You guys did not make a three tonight, which is strange. Do you think
about that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I just looked at the stat sheet myself.  
  
Q. I'm going to get to you.  
JOHN CALIPARI: They don't know, because I didn't know.  
  
Q. Do you try to make one, do you try to get hot?  
KEVIN KNOX: I didn't know that at all. We just shoot the shots that were open.
They didn't fall tonight. It's rare for us not to get a 3-point shot. But
yeah, I didn't know the whole game.  
  
Q. You all are young men, you're about as far away from Lexington that
you can get in the United States. There's a lot of pressure in the season, are
you enjoying yourselves here?  
KEVIN KNOX: Yes, I'm really enjoying myself here. Idaho, there's not much to
do here, but I'm enjoying it. First time to be in this state.  
  
I'm here to play basketball, get these two wins and get back to Lexington with
two Ws.  
  
Q. I'm curious, when the crowd is upset, they're looking for an upset,
cheering for Davidson, and you were able to pull it through, what's going
through your mind when you hear the crowd roar for the other team?  
KEVIN KNOX: We were making plays down the stretch, executing offense to get
stops on defense, and that's what it comes to down the stretch of the game.
They were making runs, but we responded pretty well for freshmen.  
  
Like Coach said, we have to mature some day. This is the time of year it's win
or go home. We have to make plays down the stretch. And Davidson did a really
good job. Down the stretch we executed our offense and got some stops down the
stretch.  
  
Q. You were young the last time this happened. It's been 30 years since
Kentucky didn't make a three.  
JOHN CALIPARI: 30? I was nine years old then (laughter).  
  
Q. It's a fluke? I know you've been struggling with this all season.  
JOHN CALIPARI: We really haven't. In the last five games we shot over 40
percent. But we're not a team that relies on 3s. I wouldn't like to go 0-6,
but we'd like to make five, six, seven, maybe eight 3s. There's other teams
that need to make 12, 13, 14 to win; we're just not one of them.  
  
Second half we didn't guard. We just kind of let it go. We exchanged baskets.
But I thought the first half proved that this young team could guard an
execution team that really runs their stuff hard and really does a good job.
But, again, we were trying to go inside. We were trying to go inside, we were
trying to drive the ball. I told Hami, Put your head down and get to the rim.
He did a good job of it. We wanted to get to the free throw line, we wanted to
post it some. We thought that was our advantage.  
  
Their advantage is they were going to take 30 3s; they took 33. We held them
to 33 percent on the year; they're probably 40 percent.  
  
Q. You talked about some of your struggles. Just talk about some things
you'd like to see your guys improve on moving forward?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We became undisciplined. There was a stretch where guys did
what they wanted to do. Just tried to steal a guy and foul and it was like,
Wait a minute, we don't stand behind the post; we were standing dead behind
the post. I don't know if they were tired or so anxious the first 20 minutes,
like tired them out. They have never been in this tournament. We start five
freshmen.  
  
And I think they were -- I even thought we were tired to start the game. It
looked that way. Then we got our legs and I took a couple of guys out, we
played with more energy and we got going. But this is all new to these kids.
And it's an exciting thing.  
  
I'm holding them accountable, I'm not just clapping right now. Because each
time you play the next game you're going to have to play more of a well-
rounded game. You cannot have three bad minutes because you'll be down 12. Now
you're down 12, you can't come back in this kind of tournament, because those
teams make free throws, they're good defensive teams or they wouldn't still be
playing. They're tough rebounding teams. You can't have three minutes of a
breakdown. And that's what I was on them today about a little bit.  
  
Q. How would Aldridge or Grady fair in the SEC?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They'd do fine, on all the tapes. I had friends of mine from
within the league and told me, You know, they have guys that could play for
you guys. And they do.  
  
I also looked at their stats prior to the game within their league. They're in
the top 1, 2 or 3 in almost every category in their league. Bob has done a
great job. They play a style that's hard. One advantage we had, Rick Barnes
and Bobby are really good friends, so a lot of stuff that Tennessee runs is
similar to what we faced today. So we had an advantage.  
  
We had a short-term, we had a day off, one day of practice, and then open gym
here to get ready. If we had never seen this stuff before, we would have had
no chance, none. We just had played Tennessee three times so a lot of the
stuff is similar.  
  
Q. What are the things that you did well in this game you'll need to
continue to do well moving forward?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You have to defend and rebound in this thing. Again, we can't
go 0-for from the 3-point line. You have to make some shots. And I always say
this: You don't have to make them all. You just can't miss them all. You can't
miss every one. And then you can't miss them bad because they're demoralizing.
This is a good shooting team. But we only took six. If we took 6 more we'd
have been 6-12.  
  
Q. How would you rate your overall defensive effort in this game?  
JOHN CALIPARI: First half really good. Second half shaky.  
  
Q. You brought up how you held Davidson to 11 of 30 3s. How did you go
about defensively scheming against that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They drive baseline better than anything we play. We worked on
a day and a half on just when they caught it on the wing, make them go middle.
They go baseline, that's how they create 3-point shots for themselves. They
find areas to shoot.  
  
The second thing was we wanted to be up, because our length we felt would
bother them. But when Gudmundsson made four in a row, we were like, Guys, is
anybody watching the game? And then -- well, he was lucky. Lucky? He just made
four in a row. He's not lucky; get up and make him put it on the floor.  
  
I told them in this tournament you enjoy wins, but you still need to learn
that if we played the way we played in the second half, it's been a heck of a
year, but you're not advancing, doesn't matter who you play. You've got to
play 40 minutes and fight like heck and then go back to the hotel room and
pass out. And then get a day in between. This is not a conference tournament
where it's game, game, game. You have a day in between to recover.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Q. Mike, on Sunday you said you didn't know anything about Ohio State.
I'm assuming in the next couple of days you've had a chance to study them a
little bit. What do you know about them now?  
MIKE DAUM: We really respect the basketball club they have at Ohio State. They
are a group of guys that play well together. They do a good job of getting the
ball in the paint and have a lot of matchup problems. They're a team that's
really well oiled and can play well together.  
  
Q. You guys have done a good job of taking care of the basketball this
season. You played different roles. Why have you done such a good job of not
turning the ball over this season? How do your strengths play to something
like that?  
TEVIN KING: For myself, I understand that offensively we need to be as great
as possible. You can't turn the ball over. We've got great scorers, that just
getting the ball in their hands and getting at least a shot attempt is the
best thing for this team.  
  
MIKE DAUM: Kind of go off him, like he says, for us it's just taking care of
the ball. For me last year I feel like turnovers were something that every
game I would have two or three of, and I tried to cut those out. To try to get
those guys open shots is a big deal for us.  
  
Q. How much did the experience last season help out coming into this
year? This is the third straight trip you've made to the NCAA tournament. I'd
imagine the experience has helped.  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: Yeah, definitely. Three guys sitting up here have been to
three NCAA tournaments. We've got a group of experienced guys. And some
younger guys that are mixed in. And I think our group overall has great
experience. And I think that definitely helps us out as a group.  
  
TEVIN KING: Going off of that, being here a couple of times before, you get a
feel for things. You see it from a different perspective and you're just
comfortable.  
  
MIKE DAUM: I agree with what they said (laughter).  
  
Q. Ohio State is a good defensive rebounding team, they're top 40 in the
country. You guys are No. 1 in the country. How important is that matchup
specifically controlling the glass, and it leads to offensive transition.  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: That's been big for us all year. Coach stressed getting
defensive rebounds. And that definitely helps us in the transition offense,
that's a big part of our offense. Getting the defense rebounds makes our team
at its best.  
  
TEVIN KING: Just getting the ball out and pushing it, it's one of our greatest
threats on the offensive end. We really emphasize that.  
  
MIKE DAUM: I'm good again.  
  
Q. It's no secret to pull an upset most Mid-Majors have to shoot about
45 percent or better. That's something South Dakota State struggled with
historically when they get to these tournaments. How do you get comfortable
and get in a rhythm? And is the big setting, avoiding the nerves, hopefully
you will kind of shoot the way you normally do during the season?  
MIKE DAUM: I think this kind of goes back to our experience in previous
tournaments. For us we're a veteran group of guys who have seen the spotlight
now for a couple of years. And I think that we're going to be able to help
keep our nerves down on the team when we just go out and play our basketball,
move the ball, and just be able to take the shots we've been taking all year.  
  
TEVIN KING: Just staying disciplined to what we need to do. Just being calm.
It's going to be an up-and-down game, just being able to stay calm and
collected and take our part and the rest will work out.  
  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: I think this is the best shooting team we've had in the
past three years. Just doing what we do offensively, moving the basketball,
and taking open shots, I think that's one of our strengths.  
  
Q. Mike, from what you've seen the last couple of days, what are your
thoughts about Bates-Diop?  
MIKE DAUM: He's a tremendous scorer, he's got tremendous size for his
position, he can shoot the ball well from the outside, and using his body in
the lower post. He's going to be a tough matchup for us.  
  
We just go over that Ohio State is a great basketball program and we're going
to have to play very well.  
  
Q. How did you view last year's game? You were extremely, extremely
competitive. And did your view of it change as time went on? I know you must
have been bummed walking off the court.  
MIKE DAUM: For us last year it was kind of a hectic season. No one kind of
expected us to make the NCAA tournament. So for us to make it we tried to go
in with as much open mindset as we could, knowing it was going to be a tough
matchup game for us.  
  
Obviously this year expectations are really different for us. We have a group
of guys that really play well together, work hard and do whatever it takes to
win.  
  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: I'm going off Mike, it was just totally two different
seasons, this year we have higher expectations, and I think our guys are
playing with tremendous amount of confidence right now and that just kind of
helps going into an environment like this.  
  
Q. You've played with Mike for a couple of years now. You've seen all
the accolades he got. Accolades notwithstanding, what's the biggest thing he
brings to the team?  
REED TELLINGHUISEN: It's just his leadership. Obviously he's a great
basketball player. But he's there messing around with everyone, he's just a
great person. And that's what leads to everyone liking him. And we're just so
happy for him, how many accolades, how awesome his college career is going so
far.  
  
TEVIN KING: Mike is a versatile player. His attitude day on and day off, he's
just a great person to be around. It's great.  
  
Q. Mike, near 12,000 mostly neutral fans. Why should they pick South
Dakota State to root for? What's your pitch?  
MIKE DAUM: South Dakota State, first off, we have one of the best mascots in
the game. I want some Jackrabbits to win.  
  
They're going to see a well-oiled ball club. We play for each other. You'll
see us smiling and laughing with each other on the court, and how coachable
and how close we are with each other on and off the court. You're going to see
a group of guys enjoying playing with each other, and I think that will help
tie in some fans for us.  
  
Q. We talked about this is your third straight year. Why is it important
that it's no longer good enough to get to the NCAA tournament and bring that
first victory back to Brookings, but why is it so important to get out of the
first round and put this program on the map?  
TEVIN KING: I think we owe it to ourselves. We worked really hard for the past
couple of years. We grew as a team. And we grew ourselves. And getting this
type of win would be phenomenal for us and this program.  
  
Q. Everything you've done throughout your career, how much would this
mean for you to get a win?  
MIKE DAUM: It would mean a tremendous amount. Not just for me, for my
teammates, for the coaching staff and for the school. For us it seems like
years in the past if you win your conference tournament you get that automatic
bid and that's considered a good season. But going off what Tevin said, we're
holding ourselves more accountable, because we want to be able to come to NCAA
March Madness and make some noise and get a win.  
  
Q. Mike, what is it like playing, developing as a player with your mom
being such a great player in her day? And tell us about the first time you
beat her one-on-one.  
MIKE DAUM: My mom is the baller of my family. And she'll always hold that
against me. She taught me everything I knew about basketball up until I beat
her one-on-one. That was a good day. I was probably 7th grade, I was still
young, and I knew she was pretty upset about it.  
  
But she's been a great influence in my life with basketball, and she's been
super supportive, my entire family has, and helping me get to the point where
I am today.  
  
Q. Talk about Ohio State, and what it is you see and what concerns you
most about them?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I think first of all any time a team can do what they did,
play 15-3 in the Big Ten, is impressive. The coach is a tremendous coach.
They're a physical team defensively. They have a really good defensive system
and they're strong and tough and physically imposing. They've got great
mismatch players, Diop obviously being the Big Ten Conference player of the
year, scores it inside and outside, and so talented. And with Jae'Sean Tate,
6-4, 230 pounds, really physical.  
  
Those are players that we don't see every day in our league. And just a very
fundamentally sound team. A team you don't see a lot of weakness there. Very
well coached and a group that displays a lot of physicality and toughness.  
  
Q. The guys up here were talking about this is for real, and you're not
coming in as a Cinderella. As the guy who's trying to set the tone, how do you
deal with expectations versus that whole Cinderella thing?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: Yeah, for our guys being here three years in a row, we have
quite a few players on our roster that have logged a lot of minutes and
experience in this situation. And the more of that you can get on any big
stage is beneficial.  
  
So I feel our mindset coming into this, is we know we have a tremendous
challenge with the Buckeyes team that is very physical, very well coached. At
the same time our guys are playing really confident right now. They're sharing
the basketball, they're playing for each other. And I think our mindset is
such where we're focused and trying to do everything we can to be on our best
tomorrow afternoon to come out with a victory.  
  
Q. Depending on how much they guard each other, how do you see the
matchup going against Bates-Diop and Mike?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: Yeah, not sure on their end totally how they'll do things.
Mike, when you haven't played against him, his ability to shoot it in the
range that he shoots it from poses some challenges. I guess they'll put
different guys on him at different points in time.  
  
Where Mike has been successful we try to determine is where he has the best
advantage, whether it's in the block, on an isolation, on the perimeter and
trying to do what we can to take advantage of that.  
  
So I think you're dealing with two guys, both conference players of the year,
both can score inside and outside, both who have a long career playing
professional basketball. So it's just a really neat matchup.  
  
Q. This is a chance to expose your program, your school to a lot of
people that don't know a lot about South Dakota State. What would you like
people to know about your program and your guys as they get in this
position?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I think first of all would like them to know about the
character of the young men in our program. We're very selective in who we
recruit and bring in. We want it to be people that are great citizens in the
community, great on campus, and also have really high desires on the
basketball court. And we want to recruit guys and bring in people that want to
win, want to be in a winning program and understand that sometimes that takes
sacrifice and may not be instant gratification.  
  
As far as our school overall, just take a great sense of pride and the
tremendous people we have, leaders on our campus and community, the
camaraderie we have in Brookings, and the support we have from the great fans
we have. So I think it's a unique situation, because it has a small town feel
with big-time dreams and goals and visions.  
  
Q. When you recruited Mike what did you see in him? Did you see him
being as successful as he is today?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I wasn't here when they recruited Mike. But what Coach Nagy,
the former head coach, had told me is that they saw a skill set with him and
his ability to shoot it with the size he had.  
  
At the same time when he got here it wasn't like things just took off from the
start. He needed to get in great shape. He needed to get a lot stronger. He
needed to improve on playing with a really high base, so he could get moved
all around. That first year they red-shirted him not knowing what might come
from it.  
  
And I think to Mike's credit, his work ethic, his character and his natural
ability, he's put those things altogether to develop at such a rapid rate
since he stepped foot on campus.  
  
Q. I know all year you guys have emphasized rebounding and controlling
the glass. No. 1 in the country for your program. Do you emphasize more this
week how important the matchup on the glass will be, or if not, what do you
think will be the biggest or one of the biggest pieces of the matchup?  
T.J. OTZELBERGER: I do think the rebounding battle will be something that will
be very telling. Oftentimes it sheds light on who the more aggressive team is
that night.  
  
For us on the defensive glass it's really important, because we like to get
out in transition and go. And you need to make sure you're finishing plays on
the board. I think for them they have such great physical toughness and bodies
and they're so well coached, those guys play with great energy and effort on
the offensive boards, and great effort on the defensive side. We're going to
have to be not only very intentional, really competitive in those situations,
because they're a very good rebounding team.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [Nate Oats](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30683)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Nate Oats.  
  
Q. The million dollar question, how do you begin to slow down Deandre?  
NATE OATS: That is a million dollar question. Everybody in the PAC 12 hasn't
figured it out. So I've got a few friends that coach there, I've talked to
them. He's definitely the No. 1 pick in the draft from what everybody is
saying. You can see it when you watch film. He's 7-1, 260 and moves like a
guard.  
  
It's not going to be that easy. I think you have to limit his touches as much
as possible. When he does get it you can't play one-on-one. There's some
pretty good bigs in our league, but we've just told our guys, If he gets it,
you're going to just have to guard him. That's not going to work with him.
You're going to have to double, and pick your poison on who and where you
double on. You've got to play hard.  
  
I told our guys, it gets to this time of year, you ain't getting an easy team.
You're going to play a team with some players.  
  
We're going to have to figure it out. We're going to play a little bit harder
than them and figure it out. We've got option A, B, C, and D, and we'll see
what's working the best.  
  
Q. Earlier Coach Cal was asked if he watched any video of Arizona. His
answer and his response was, I haven't watched it yet because UB is a great
team. And if you've seen film on them you'd know that. A, what does that say
about what you think your chances are against Arizona; and B, how nice is it
to hear what Coach Calipari said about your program?  
NATE OATS: When we played at Kentucky, my last year as the assistant, and
Bobby was the head coach, and we were up on them in the half, and then played
them pretty tough. After the game I actually talked to Cal a little bit, he
was super complimentary of how hard we played. I know he said let's bring you
down every year. That hasn't happened.  
  
But I do respect the fact that he will be humble enough to talk about our
program that way. We played them tough the only time we played them.  
  
I don't know if he's actually watched us, but he gave the right answer on
that, not assume anybody is going to win. My guess is they're putting a little
bit more time in Arizona than us. It was nice he said that.  
  
We have a shot. We're going to have to do some stuff right. We're going to
have to make some shots. Their depth is not quite as good as ours. And we're
5th in the country in possession length on offense. So it's not like we've got
to do something we don't do. We're going to speed them up. We've been speeding
people up all year.  
  
We're going to play our game and tweak a few things. There's no Deandre Ayton
on our schedule. So we have to change a few things to deal with him. But other
than that, we don't have to change who we are. Who we are is more than capable
of beating them. I think people know that. I think that's why a guy like Jay
Bilas talked about this might be the best four seed in the history of four
seeds. And putting them at a 4 doesn't necessarily screw them; it screws their
opponent. Because know we've got a chance to win some games.  
  
I still think we've got a chance, too. Earlier in the season we went to the
NCAA tournament two years in a row, we didn't make it last year. We talk about
getting to the tournament and then winning some games. If you're a 12, if you
want to get to the second weekend you have to beat a 5 and a 4. If you're a
13, you got to beat a 4 then a 5. It is what it is. You're are going to have
to play some good teams.  
  
I think we'll be ready to go tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You said before when the matches came out that you were going to
exchange some scouting reports with Bobby Hurley. How much have you talked to
him?  
NATE OATS: A few times. They played them pretty tough. They didn't get either
win. I think they showed enough stretches in there what they wanted to do. You
always know what you want to do against a team. Sometimes it's a little easier
said than done.  
  
But I definitely -- I saw both their games live. They're on the West Coast,
and you're up late, 11 o'clock, all of a sudden their game is on and you get
to watch them. I watched both their Arizona games live. I watched their second
one.  
  
There's no secrets here. Deandre Ayton is a force to deal with, but they've
got Trier. He's a pro, too. Rawle Alkins is a pro. Ristic might be a pro.
They've got two 7-footers, you're not dealing with just one.  
  
I do think that Bobby was on to some things when they played the. They play
similar to us. I read somewhere Sean Miller talked about us kind of playing
like them. So they kind of know we're going to spread it like Arizona State
did, but it was successful for Arizona State at stretches in the game. We have
to do a better job than they did at some of the things they didn't do so well
on.  
  
Q. I've been asking some of the teams why should the people of Boise get
behind your team. Your guys said it's because they fight really hard, they
play really hard, but they also look really good doing it, because they've got
a lot of good looking guys on the team.  
NATE OATS: Perkins takes a million selfies a day. I'm sure that's what he said
when you asked him about that.  
  
The reason they should get behind us is we play together. We don't play
isolation basketball, and it's fun. And I think teams want to cheer for the
underdog.  
  
So you're seeing Deandre, you don't see too many of those guys in college
basketball now. Our group is a fun group. They love playing with each other.
They're a fun group. They legitimately want their teammates to do well. CJ
struggled in the MAC tournament, he said I'm going to do something to make
sure we win this game. And he came up with some big rebounds. When somebody
gets going, they start cheering for them.  
  
And guys on the bench that don't play a lot that really could play on a lot of
teams really pull for the guys that are in there. Nick had to get himself
calmed down in the MAC championship. We had Brock Bertram, who hasn't played a
whole lot, but a really good big that could be playing a lot in a lot of
places, getting in Nick's ear, getting him right. Guys that genuinely want
each other to do well. And it's fun to pull for a group like that.  
  
Q. Your guys have talked a lot this week about not having a lot of
pressure on them, which is different from how it was during regular season in
the tournament when you were favorites for much of the year to win the
conference tournament. How do you change that mindset, expecting to win the
MAC championship to saying we don't have any pressure on us and hopefully come
out with a win?  
NATE OATS: We started the conference, knowing our people were writing about
guys running the table. And I tried to slow them down. Let them know we've
been in the conference a long time, it's hard to win road games here. It was a
bit of a wake-up call. We dropped 3 out of 7. Ever since we started, there's
been pressure on them, but it's a disappointment if we weren't winning by
double digits.  
  
It might be a relief, finally someone else is picked. It might be the first
game in 20-plus games where we weren't supposed to be the winner. It might be
nice coming in as the underdog and play with a little bit more freedom, so to
speak.  
  
But there is still pressure on us. Because we talked early in the year, we've
been to this tournament twice in the last three years. This is the third time
in four now. It's time to start getting some wins. We've been here, done that,
got the participation trophy deal.  
  
There's still some pressure to come in here and not just play well, because we
played well the last two times. It was one or two possessions in the last
minute both times we were here. At least I feel a little bit of pressure that
we need to get a win. I don't think it's bad to have a little bit of pressure.  
  
Now, it's a different kind of pressure than it's been for the last 20-some-odd
games, though, you're right.  
  
Q. Could you describe your relationship a little bit in detail. We know
about Wes Clark and your history with him, but also that trust you have in him
and what it's brought your team.  
NATE OATS: Everybody knows I coached the kid in high school. I love the kid to
death. He's competitive and a warrior. He's got plenty of stories from high
school we could talk for an hour about. We brought him in here and I told
everybody bringing him in, my assistants, administration, when we talked about
bringing him in, why should you bring him in, you talk about the positives. He
obviously had some stuff going at Missouri. I knew him well enough and trusted
him well enough. And he's been unbelievably great since walking on the campus.  
  
He's been in the program going on a year and a half, he came at the semester
and he had to sit a whole year. So he played with our guys all last year, from
January on all this year until he got eligible in December. So it's not like
we just threw a kid they didn't know. They knew him well. He had been kind of
dominating them on the scout team for a year now. And finally when he got
moved over off the scout team with them they were like, yeah, come on, come
play with us so we don't have to guard you every day in practice.  
  
He's a great kid. He's not one of those -- he knows he's really good. He's got
a lot of confidence, he's got swagger to him. But he's not arrogant. He's not
all about me. He's all about winning is what he's all about. It's easy to
throw a kid that's all about winning in a team that's all about winning.
Davonta Jordan has done an unbelievable job but he's a winner more than
anything.  
  
So you throw him in with a group like that, and it works pretty well. So it
kind of seems like it was real seamless, throw him in, and we played well and
kept this thing rolling. But there's a lot of work, a lot of friendships
built, a lot of camaraderie built over the last year before he actually got to
play in a game.  
  
Q. What effect did bringing in Coach Hodgson have, as far as recruiting
and things like that, and having a guy like that to bring in the talented
players that you've been able to do?  
NATE OATS: Caruthers played for him at Midland, Jeremy Harris, who's been
pretty dang good, Montell McRae has been great for us, Blake Hamilton was
pretty good, got us to the tournament our first year, Willie Conner, Davonta
Jordan, all that stuff that we went national with recruiting and a lot of
that's him.  
  
As far as what the roster looks like, he's been like super big, just integral.
He's a great guy, if you get to know him well, he's personable, and doesn't
have a big ego. He works hard at building relationships. He had been working
hard at building them. He's a western New York guy. So to have a western New
York guy on staff, he's all Bills everything. And all the annoying Bills fans.  
  
But it's easy to sell western New York and Buffalo when you're from there, and
he's been doing an unbelievable job for three years. I'm becoming a Bills fan.
I grew up in Wisconsin, so you have to be a Packer fan. You can never leave
that. But the whole Bills mafia thing is growing on me. They made the playoffs
this year.  
  
Most of that is Bryan. If he can sell me on the Bills, he can probably sell
recruits on Buffalo Bulls basketball, too.  
  
Q. You brought up Bills fans. Any chance we see any Bulls fans going
through tables in the parking lot tomorrow?  
NATE OATS: They didn't ban selling folding tables out here in Boise for the
deal? If we get the win I'm sure somebody is going to dive through a folding
table after the game.  
  
Q. Bills just signed quarterback A.J. McCarron, it was just announced.
Is that the good move? Is that the veteran or do they need to draft a guy
still?  
NATE OATS: They have to draft somebody. They need options. A.J. can be one.
They need to have a quarterback battle through the entire preseason unless
somebody earns it, that's my opinion. Not that I know anything about football.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
Q. For any of you, how would you describe Wes's approach to coaching,
anything distinctive about the way he interacts with the guys?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: Well, I can tell you he's a really great coach. Our coaching
staff has done an unbelievable job, knowing the practicing in determined ways,
but actually making us a better person in terms of how to approach every
practice and what type of mentality we have to have since we are on the court.  
  
But it's really helpful to have a coach, really young coach, in this case,
that has been on both sides, as a coach and as a player. And also he played
with a great program at UNC with the Tar Heels, and that makes things easier.  
  
JORDY KULPER: Coach, I've had the pleasure of being with him five years. When
he came to Spain to visit me, he had an image for Greensboro, and we're
working every year, every day, actually, for five years to get that. And I've
never been around a coach that is so intense, so consumed with the process of
getting better.  
  
But the thing I like most about his coaching style is that he's never worried
about or never thinking about other teams or even actual, like, specific goals
or results. We're only focused on the process. So every day we come in and the
only thing we're worried about is getting better, one drill, one possession,
one practice at a time. And if you keep coming to work every single day, all
the results and accolades will come.  
  
We've always thought of the Big Dance as a huge goal for us, but we're always
thinking about thinking big but working small. And that was something new to
me as a player, and something I really cherish that he brought to the program
personally.  
  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: He's definitely a player's coach. He wants nothing but the
best for us. And he'll do whatever for us, he'll push us to reach out to our
fullest potential. That's what he wants. I can't appreciate him enough. He
drives us extremely hard.  
  
Like these guys said, he says to just come in and work every day. The results
will take care of itself, but let's come in and do our part and control the
things we can control. And giving our best every time we get out there on the
court.  
  
In all aspects of life he pushes us to be great men, as well. He made a
promise to my mom that I would not only grow as a player but also as a man. I
can honestly say that at my time here him and the rest of the coaches have
helped me grow as a better player but also a better man, as well.  
  
Q. Three-point numbers are off the charts with what you guys do. How
much of a green light do you all have from him?  
JORDY KULPER: : Well, when I came in as a freshman, in Spain, if I shot a
jumper it was suicide in Spain. I'm happy for the problem. The big thing for
ourselves is that we have incredible shooters. Right next to me is the best
shooter in the country, best shooter I've seen. But the only thing we worry
about is everybody on the team doing their job and working to get the highest
quality shot every possession. We call it a quality shot. And that can be a
post-up, it can be a 3-point shot. But our inside-out game is very strong.  
  
If people like Francis, myself or Marvin get a good look at a 3, if we don't
shoot it, that's when we hurt our team. If it's a high-quality shot we have to
take it, we will. And luckily through the great confidence and positive energy
that our teammates give me we're able to knock those down. But it's all about
getting the highest possible quality shot.  
  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: We just commit to working together, get the best shot
possible for the team. We work on our jump shots. And coach and our teammates
trust us. We get over shots we just knock them in, not necessarily no green
light, so to say. But like I said, we work extremely hard to get the best shot
for the team.  
  
Q. Francis, you played impressive defense especially during the
conference tournament. Are you changing your play style at all to match
Gonzaga?  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: My teammates are going to say the same thing, we are really
focused on ourselves. We're going to play against a great team that has a
great history at Gonzaga. And they have been good, but we're just going to do
our part, as Marvin said. It's nothing special for us, being here is a great
goal that we always dreamed of. But now it's just time to put the work in that
we've been practicing on back in Greensboro and just do our part.  
  
Q. Ten thousand neutral fans in there tomorrow. Your pitch to those
neutral fans, why should they root for you, NC-Greensboro, and should people
appreciate it?  
JORDY KULPER: I feel we play basketball the way it's supposed to be played.
Really hard. Defense first. We have guys really deep that give the absolute
all to the program, to our school, to our city. Every time we step on the
court we feel like it's the last time we'll pick up a basketball. And I feel
that the passion we have for our game, for our program, for our city is
contagious.  
  
And hopefully we're able to show here in Boise, and hopefully longer in the
Big Dance, what Greensboro is all about, what UNCG is all about. And I think
the way we play basketball hopefully will spark some excitement for the fans
that come. And I'm excited to see them come out here, it's a beautiful venue,
and show what we're all about tomorrow.  
  
Q. I'm wondering what you knew about Boise before you learned that you
were going to be coming here for the tournament?  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: Only thing I knew about is the football team and the blue
field. I haven't known much about it. But since I've been coming, it's a
beautiful city, I've been enjoying it, the weather is pretty nice. It's better
than Greensboro. It was snowing in Greensboro when he left. It's been a
beautiful view here. I'm enjoying my time here.  
  
JORDY KULPER: I've never been before. I'm from the Netherlands and my hometown
team, when I grew up, I was really closely involved with the pro team we had
there. And a person that I used to actually teach me some moves back in the
day was Matt Bauscher who played there. I've seen a play or two. And that's
probably the first time we heard of Boise State.  
  
Looking to their program a little further, obviously, but that was the first
connection I had. He's a great player, and helped me a lot, too, when I was a
young kid growing up. That's only the connection I have to Boise.  
  
FRANCIS ALONSO: Same. I'm from Spain, so it was really difficult for me to
know about Boise State. But as soon as I got here this place is really
beautiful. And all the people from here are really passionate about it,
basketball, and I can't wait to come out there and play with a beautiful
environment, absolutely.  
  
Q. You have obviously played some games against Power Five teams.
Playing a team like Virginia, playing a team like Wake, I just wonder, I know
it's kind of an extrapolation, but what kind of value do you think that might
provide going into a situation like this, that you have been up against those
kind of teams?  
FRANCIS ALONSO: To be honest with you, I think that the Virginia game really
helped us a lot in terms of how to view, how badly was the defense and how
much it does to the game. And I think my teammates are going to agree with
this, since that game we changed our mentality and how to approach our defense
and how to approach every possession.  
  
And absolutely that happens a lot at this time of the year, because all the
teams we're going to play here are going to be top teams and good defensive
teams. So we're going to match their level of defense.  
  
JORDY KULPER: Yeah, I mean when you're playing them there are certain
weaknesses we can exploit as a team, but when you get to this everybody is so
really good. And also they always say that what travels is defense and
rebounding, it's been our identity all year. And to be honest, we're all
committed, we're all talking, getting one stop at a time. I'll take our
defense against any team in the nation.  
  
And I'm seriously excited for the opportunity to go up against a great team
like Gonzaga tomorrow and show them what our defense is all about.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. What is your first memory about seeing
Gonzaga playing basketball? And with them in the Mid-Major and you in the Mid-
Major, is this something you strive to be going against a program like this?  
MARVIN SMITH, JR.: I just remember Gonzaga basketball, I mean they've always
been a good team. I followed college basketball since I was young. I've always
known them to be a good team; pretty good guard play and can shoot the ball
pretty well.  
  
Going against them, I mean, yeah, it's a good opportunity to stop shots. They
are a major program who had success over the years and established themselves
as a powerhouse Mid-Major team. And that's something that we're working to
build at UNCG, that would be a time to establish ourselves as a major program.  
  
JORDY KULPER: Yeah, what he said. Gonzaga is basically like almost an ideal
blueprint for what a Mid-Major program aspires to be. And I really like that
matchup, too.  
  
Obviously we're maybe a little younger in that regard, but we're shooting
towards it. So I think it's a great opportunity for us. We are both really
tough teams, great rebounding teams, all-around strong defensive teams. I feel
it's going to be a war out there. I feel like we're ready, and I'm sure
they're ready, too, so I'm excited.  
  
FRANCIS ALONSO: I know a lot about Gonzaga. One of the reasons why is one of
my good friends back at home played here. And we still have a good
relationship and are still in contact. And absolutely we talked about this
program having adversities and opportunities. And I think we have a great
opportunity in front of us to show what we are about.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. When I asked the kids if there was
anything that they feel is particularly distinctive about your coaching style,
Jordy went out of his way to talk about how you value process over results.
I've heard people talk about that for years. And that luxury of looking at
things that way might be more difficult. I was curious where that point of
view came from. The other thing I was curious about is obviously UNCG stuck by
you in some losing seasons. In these days of college basketball I wondered how
rare you felt that experience is?  
WES MILLER: I think it's a great question. Early on we really struggled, my
first handful of years. I think as a staff we were trying to figure out who we
were as coaches, what our values were as a program. And that process kind of
led us to the idea that we wanted to base everything around the idea of
growth. And you come in our practice facility, it says it on the wall, a big
banner, just growth, one at a time.  
  
And we just talk about that term a lot, let's just be a one-at-a-time program,
one drill at a time, one practice at a time, one lift at a time, et cetera.
And I think we're fortunate that we've had a group of guys now that have
bought into the process, as you mentioned. And the idea of just trying to get
better one day at a time.  
  
I think we kind of got to that through some of the trials and tribulations
early, so that's kind of how we developed that type of a mindset. But I don't
think we have any chance to see if we could execute it or not without
leadership that would allow us to work through it. And I think that's really
unique now in 2018 in college athletics to have people stick behind you.  
  
Three or four years ago there were a lot of questions, as we go out recruiting
and things of that nature, we have a job the next year, try to defend and
still be there. And our athletic director always stuck by us. We've had two
chancellors since I've been the coach here, Linda Brady being the first and
Frank Gilliam the second one, always stuck by us. That's the ace in the hole
why we're here today because people have always given us a chance.  
  
Q. Following up on the process notion, I just wondered if there's
anybody in your upbringing as a player or coach, who stressed that point of
view of going after process, rather than just goals?  
WES MILLER: You know, I was fortunate to play for a lot of great coaches and
be around a lot of great ones, Jaime Arsenal [ph], my high school coach
believed in that approach. Roy Williams believed in that type of approach. I
was always really impacted as a player how Coach Williams graded every player
on every defensive possession, and how sometimes you could get a good grade
even without getting a good result. Like you could play great defense and they
just made a tough shot and you'd still get a good grade.  
  
I remember that impacting me a lot as a player, and we bought into those type
of things in the program here.  
  
Q. I don't know if any of your guys have NCAA tournament experience as
players, but I know you and your staff do. Is there anything you worry about
or try to talk about in trying to handle this type of stage?  
WES MILLER: No, none of our players have been in the NCAA tournament, and none
of our staff have coached in the NCAA tournament, with the exception of Kyle
Bankhead, who's the director of operations, who had that experience in San
Diego. So this is really new for all of us, even those of us who played it in
as coaches.  
  
The first thing we try to do is just balance the idea of really enjoying this
moment. I have great lifetime memories of playing in the NCAA tournament. I
want our players to have those same type of experiences. But also to kind of
stay true to who we are and what our values are, and that's a team that's
prepared every single day, that comes in the gym and tries to get better one
day at a time and hasn't been afraid of any type of moment.  
  
Some of the experiences that we've drawn on to -- obviously it's not the NCAA
tournament, but we played some really tough non-conference games. We played at
Virginia early in the year, I think we learned a lot from that. We played at
the NIT last year at Syracuse in a game that was nationally televised that was
a big moment for our program. Even though they're not NCAA tournament
experiences, but our players and staff can draw from them.  
  
Q. You brought up Kyle Bankhead from your coaching staff. And I know he
used to play for Gonzaga several years back. How big of an asset has he been
for preparing for Gonzaga?  
WES MILLER: Yeah, you know, kind of funny, we had a selection party, which was
awesome. We had a lot of support there. And the community really has gotten
behind this thing. Our selection show, when our name was called, and the kids
and coaches, we all had our same reaction, we'd been waiting six days, since
we won our conference tournament, to figure out who, when and where. And after
about 25 seconds I think everybody in our program kind of turned and looked at
Kyle, because obviously we all know he has the Gonzaga connection as a player
and as a staff member there, and our players were kind of funny. They were
asking who were they pulling for. And he's pretty far removed from being a
part of their program.  
  
So I do think he's been a part of our preparation process, for sure. But it's
not like he's been a part of this team and been a part of their program the
last couple of years. I do think he's been able to give his two cents, but
it's not like we have some extra special knowledge, because he's not as
familiar with this team the last couple of years as he was back when he was
coaching against them at San Diego, playing, helping out in the program.  
  
Q. Two-part question for you: Gonzaga has kind of been a staple now for
a while. What was your first memory with that program? And with them being a
Mid-Major like yourself, do you model your program for the type of success
they've had over the years?  
WES MILLER: I'm a basketball junkie, grew up idolizing the NCAA tournament,
and watching games. It was funny, I did a radio interview with Dan Dickau, I
walked in and laughed at myself, he's one of my first memories of Gonzaga, to
say I'm a short little white guy.  
  
I saw Dan Dickau out there running around winning games in the NCAA
tournament, that's my first memories, as a young guy you look up to people
like that that you can relate to.  
  
As far as Gonzaga, I don't think any of us in college basketball think of
Gonzaga as a Mid-Major, I don't think the term applies to them in any way. But
I do think they're the standard for how you take your program from one level
to the next for all Mid-Major programs in college basketball, is you look at
what they've done over the last 30 years. And so certainly that's a name to
start around there, but I wouldn't call them a Mid-Major at all.  
  
Q. You guys scheduled Virginia, you scheduled Wake this year. Jordy
talked a lot about how valuable a learning experience of having to play
Virginia early in the season was. He thought it had a tumbledown effect. I
know Bob McKillop has aggressively scheduled in the past. How conscious a
decision was that on your part in playing Virginia and playing Wake to get
these guys ready for what might be down the road?  
WES MILLER: A couple of things. Really interesting that you brought up
Davidson, because they were in our league when I first got the head coaching
job at UNCG. We took some lumps, like everybody in the Southern Conference.
But we really did look early on in how they scheduled. Because I think they
have a really unique scheduling philosophy if you look at it. We have talked a
lot about them as we scheduled.  
  
As far as the experience, we've opened up the last two years with Virginia.
Our first game the last two years or two years ago was Virginia at our place.
And then we opened up up in Charlottesville this past year. I don't think
there's any game we benefited from more than that game the last two seasons.
We used that game to go to our players and say, Did you think it was hard to
get a shot. And without question they say yes, because it's so difficult
against them. And then we've gone through the film and showed them why.
They're always in the right place in every possession. Their communication is
elite. They do the little things.  
  
So we've learned a lot from that Virginia game. And we've used it as a
teaching tool, even though it hasn't been a whole lot of fun getting our tails
kicked. But I do think as a Mid-Major school those tough road games early in
the year against elite programs, I think you can gain confidence from them if
you have success. Our win with NC State really gave us confidence moving into
conference play that we could play with everybody. Or you can really learn
from them if you struggle.  
  
And I think of Virginia in that way. That we really learned a lot from that
game the last two years, even though we didn't have a whole lot of success.  
  
Q. To put your program in the spotlight a little bit, to introduce it to
a lot of people that don't know about you, what do you hope people take from
this? What do you want people to know about your program as they see it?  
WES MILLER: Thank you. We're basketball junkies. And we've been fortunate now
that we have a locker room full of guys and a staff full of guys that are just
nuts about basketball. That's not always the greatest quality but it's true. I
don't think our wives and families always appreciate how locked we are into
hoops. We're gym rats and basketball junkies first.  
  
I think we value competitive, junkyard dog-type guys. And I think this year
you can see that when you watch our team play. We're not perfect, by any
stretch. We're not consistent defensively, even though we've done some good
things. We've been up and down on offense, but we value competing and really
value sticking together and fighting through adversity.  
  
So I hope people see our grit and our toughness and our togetherness when they
take the floor. I hope people realize that we're just a bunch of guys that
love hoops.  
  
Q. Gonzaga is the reigning national runner up. What's it going to take
to win against a team like this? And a win over a program like that would put
your program on the map and take a step in the right direction, not being in
the major program, kind of establishing your own brand a little bit.  
WES MILLER: Well, Gonzaga presents a whole lot of challenges. We knew we
wouldn't be a really high seed. So we knew whoever we played would be a great
program. When Gonzaga came up on the screen you go, okay, they're not just
good, they're great, like you mentioned. They played on the last day of the
season last year.  
  
As we dove into the scouting report to break them down you start to see why.
They are as consistent on both ends of the ball as any team in college
basketball. I want to say in offensive and defensive efficiency, they're the
only team in the nation ranked in the top 20 in both. They have very few
weaknesses. Their size in every position, their skill level in every position,
that will be something we haven't seen in a long time, maybe since we played
Virginia, and that was a long time ago.  
  
So it's going to present challenges that we're not accustomed to. We know it
will take a tremendous Goliath-like effort. But we're not afraid of the
moment. We have tremendous respect for Gonzaga, we know how difficult it will
be. But we have a bunch of guys that are excited for this moment, excited for
the opportunity.  
  
Q. Playing at the level you played at with the stakes you did, and I
just wonder if you have any thoughts how that applies to what you're going to
be doing the next 48 hours?  
WES MILLER: I think there's some comfort with what the NCAA tournament is,
that I've been through it. Been through an open practice. I know the idea of
the media sessions and the whole nine. Outside of that I'm not so sure that my
player experience has a whole lot to do with coaching. I think they're two
totally different extremes.  
  
That said, I think this is what you're asking, I always felt that coach
prepared us. I always felt that he let us have fun and enjoy the moment. But I
felt it was hard, he was doing every single thing he could to prepare us for
everything in the NCAA tournament. I have drawn on that as I thought about
preparing my team. I want to make sure they're having fun, I enjoyed it. But I
want to make sure I take it as seriously as he did to prepare them for every
single moment of this and I don't shortchange them. I think as a staff we've
taken that approach over the last week.

BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Allonzo Trier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30553)

### [Rawle Alkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33150)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Arizona student-athletes to the dais.  
  
Q. Questions for both you guys. It's obviously been a chaotic month for
you guys in this program. Can you talk about what's that been like to deal
with that distraction, but still playing good basketball, if you could talk
about that.  
RAWLE ALKINS: I think off-the-court stuff, we don't really worry about that.
We focus on the court, on the task at hand, this week, and we just take
everything game by game.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: We're taking it day-by-day, worrying about playing our best
basketball every time we step on the court. There's nothing else to take away
from our focus of that.  
  
Q. This is an off-the-wall one. Today a lot of high school students
walked out in their classes in protest of gun violence and gun control. Have
you ever talked about that as a team, if the two of you have thoughts on gun
control?  
RAWLE ALKINS: We haven't really talked about it as a team. To be honest with
you, I wasn't aware of that. I didn't know about that stuff. But I don't think
it's right.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: Something we've never talked about as a team. I wasn't aware of
the protest happening today. But there's something that needs to be done about
that. I don't know if we have the biggest voice to have that opinion if it's
going to change anything. But I'm sure something needs to be done about that.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk to me about your opponent, Buffalo, what do they
bring? Is there anything that you're concerned with? Anything that you've seen
on film that you really need to lock in on?  
RAWLE ALKINS: We know that they play a fast tempo. And they have four guards
on the court at all times. They're kind of a small team but they still play
tough. That East Coast toughness. And we know it's going to be a battle
tomorrow.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: We respect them a great deal. They have a great pace. We also
understand that they're in the top five point scoring teams in the country.
They're really good on offense in what they do. It's going to be a challenge
for us defensively and we respect them a great deal.  
  
Q. You guys were seeded lower than a lot of people had predicted. Do you
think there's any particular reason for that, either being part of the West
Coast or the FBI investigation?  
RAWLE ALKINS: I don't think so. I don't think the FBI investigation has
anything to do with seeding. But that's just my opinion. I don't know.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: We can't be worried about where we're seeded or anything like
that. We have to beat them, no matter who it is. All we can do is focus on
every time we step on the court playing our best basketball, that gives us the
best chance to win.  
  
Q. What do you guys plan to do to slow down CJ Massinburg? What are your
guys' plans for stopping that core four? They're all averaging double digits a
game.  
RAWLE ALKINS: We're going to still do what we do. We don't have a game plan
for the one person. It's the whole team. We play whole team defense. And we're
just going to try to play our best.  
  
Q. It really seems like the program and the school have stood by your
coach. Just talk about the support that you have lended to Sean Miller during
this trying time.  
ALLONZO TRIER: Our basketball coach has led us on the right path. All we're
focused on is basketball right now, and nothing else.  
  
RAWLE ALKINS: The same thing that he said.  
  
Q. Last one for you, despite all the outside noises, the team has still
done well. Winning five in a row on the road. What's it like for this team to
still play the best basketball, despite the outside things?  
RAWLE ALKINS: Just the same thing, just focus on the task at hand, us winning.
We understand with team success comes individual accolades. And we just want
to win the championship.  
  
ALLONZO TRIER: Not worried about what anybody is saying or what's going on the
basketball court. Trying to put together our best basketball and see where it
takes us. That's what we care about. That's what we're worried about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Coach Sean Miller.  
  
Q. It is a very, very difficult time to be a college basketball coach in
this day and age. A lot of coaches talk about managing distractions. What have
you done to manage all the distractions around your team and get them to focus
and play at such a high level?  
SEAN MILLER: I think it starts with you have to really attempt to control the
things that you can and to block out the other things that you can't. For us,
whether it's anything off the court, an injury, a tough loss, you want those
types of things that are adversity-filled to build your team, to build
character and the players on your team.  
  
For us, I think we're playing our best basketball as we enter this tournament.
That doesn't mean we get a chance to stick around or we're automatically going
to win because of that. But I think our team has shown a lot of resolve. And
it's been through some of those obstacles that we've had to overcome.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just what it means for you to be the head coach of
the Arizona Wildcats? What's it mean to you to be the head coach of this
program?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, the University of Arizona is one of the great programs in
college basketball. It's not anything that I have done. When I showed up in
Tucson nine years ago Lute Olson built the University of Arizona's basketball
program, and he did it with decades of excellence. Players like Steve Kerr,
Sean Elliott, Damon Stoudamire, Jason Terry, Luke Walton. And I'm almost
embarrassed because I've named them all that didn't play for me.  
  
If you start to name the players that have played in our stretch over nine
years there's quite a few: Solomon Hill, Derrick Williams, T.J. McConnell,
Nick Johnson, Deandre, who is playing with us. And I've left out a hundred.  
  
So it's been a foundation of great players and great teams. And it's an honor
to coach. If you've ever been in McKale Center on basketball weekend, there's
no more pageantry than anywhere else.  
  
To answer your question, it's an honor to coach at Arizona.  
  
Q. Today across the country a lot of high school students walked out of
their schools in protest of gun violence and gun control. I wonder, do you
talk with your kids about social justice issues? Do you encourage them to be
involved, be aware, vote, that type of thing?  
SEAN MILLER: Certainly we talk about a lot of different things, not just
basketball but sports related. Off the court you try to teach your players.
You try to allow them to be independent.  
  
If you just think about being on a university's campus, you're there to grow,
and form your own opinions. And that's really what being a student-athlete is
all about, that you get that opportunity. Oftentimes the court is your best
classroom. And then you learn other things.  
  
But clearly those types of topics are always discussed. And at the same time
all of our players come from different families, different walks of life,
backgrounds, that allow them to have their own informed, educated opinion.  
  
Q. While you were preparing for Buffalo and studying the tape, was there
anything that surprised you or jumped out at you with how they played?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Buffalo is a really good team. Any team that you play in this
tournament is capable of beating the other team because of the great parity in
college basketball. If you're from the MAC and you win the regular season
championship and you follow that up with the tournament championship, you're a
really, really good team.  
  
And they have a real confidence about them. They're a tough matchup. They
score the ball as easily as any team that we've played. Oftentimes in that
conference they're guard and forward heavy but they may not have a big guy.
But Buffalo does. Perkins in particular is a center that I think could play at
any program in the country.  
  
We know that it's going to be a difficult challenge, that's what we expect.
And our focus is on that, just trying to play our best.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts in general about the changes
that could be made in a sport where the culture is so much incentive to bend
the rules that the FBI could get involved?  
SEAN MILLER: I've made my statement.  
  
Q. The other day John Calipari said that your grandmother basically
raised him and that your guys's relationship goes way back. Can you talk about
that a little bit.  
SEAN MILLER: He's right. It's really amazing, but his family and my family
have been connected since we were born. And he was an assistant coach at the
University of Pittsburg. When I was recruited there, in large part I went
there because of him. And certainly have a lot of admiration for him, not just
as a coach, but also as a person.  
  
Q. Ben Tucker is a local kid that was born and raised here in Boise. I'm
curious, what do you think of his coaching prospects and his future?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Tuck, he's one of my favorites. He did a great job as a manager
at the University of Arizona, and he's become a coach with us, has left us,
and now he's at Santa Barbara doing an excellent job. But he's a great person,
No. 1. And I think he has a future to be a head coach one day. He'll make
Boise proud, if he hasn't already.  
  
Q. According to a lot of the experts, they projected you being seeded
higher than you actually were. Do you think there was any contributing factor
to that you're being on the West Coast or the FBI investigation?  
SEAN MILLER: No, I think the tournament selection committee has a difficult
job. We're a 4 seed. We're in Boise. Excited to be in Boise.  
  
On a personal note the last time we were in Boise we got to the Sweet 16 when
I was the head coach at Xavier. When you return to a city that you won in,
you're excited even more.  
  
We'll have a lot of fans, and most importantly, it doesn't matter where you're
at or what your seed is, you're going to face a very good team. And if you
don't play well your tournament will end quicker than you want it to. Our
focus isn't on things we can't control, but to be as ready for Buffalo as we
can be.  
  
Q. Considering the distractions the last month or two, as a coach, how
good has it been to see your team respond and play good basketball despite the
distractions surrounding the program?  
SEAN MILLER: I'm incredibly proud of our team, the players on our team, and
the families of the players on our team. Sometimes when adversity strikes it
can really rally a group of people. Can bring out a closeness that maybe you
otherwise would not have felt. And I believe that about our team.  
  
That doesn't mean that because of that we're going to win. There's a lot of
teams in this tournament that feel the same way. But I do think that we've
played our best over the last month. Our defense has improved. And sometimes
the starting point of defense is a closeness and unselfishness. And I believe
our team has grown in both of those areas, and that's a big reason why our
defense has gotten better.  
  
Q. Calipari was in here saying he hasn't watched you guys all season, he
doesn't see anyone except his team and who he's scouting. Do you watch
basketball in your free time? If you have a late tip do you watch games during
the day? Do you watch your brother?  
SEAN MILLER: I watch basketball. But to his point, you're so consumed with
your own team practice that day, the team that you're getting ready to prepare
for. It's like this tournament, you'd be surprised how unaware you are of even
the other 7 teams that are here and who plays who tomorrow because it's for us
about getting ready for Buffalo. And you get that single-mindedness that maybe
takes the ability to really follow people that you care about and other teams.  
  
But that's what I would say. I have a son who is in high school. I have a hard
enough time getting to watch him play, let alone another team in the country.
But you're right, if I would watch one other team or two other teams I would
watch Indiana and Xavier because of my connection to both.  
  
Q. You mentioned how much it means to you to be the head coach of
Arizona. If you could talk about what the last month has been like for you and
just what does it mean to see the support you've gotten from the university
and your players during this time?  
SEAN MILLER: You know, I'm very fortunate. Dave Heeke and Dr. Robbins, our
president and athletic director, that they have been as diligent in listening
and learning and staying with me as they have been. I'm grateful. Our fans are
amazing.  
  
But the two groups of people that I really hone in on right now is my own
family and our team and our program. The parents of our players and our
players. And those are the people that you know love you. Those are the people
that you're the closest to. And whether it's a season that you don't want to
end or having three sons that you don't ever want to see hurt, that's really
what you try to focus and stay in the moment with.  
  
A lot of the other things, they're on the periphery. Everybody learns that
when you go through different things.  
  
Q. Do you have strong opinions on the one-and-done rule?  
SEAN MILLER: I really don't have an opinion one way or the other.  
  
Q. Has all that's gone on over the last several weeks made you like this
profession more or have there been times where you wish you could go to Hawaii
and call it a day?  
SEAN MILLER: You probably know the answer to the question that you asked. Like
I said, I think it's coach-speak to some degree, but there's nobody that will
put what I'm saying in that category, for you to be successful in a high-
pressured environment with a lot at stake, a lot of different things going on,
your emotions have to be aside. It's about what can you control. Who really
matters.  
  
And I think if you focus on the things that you can really control and you
surround yourself with people that really matter, meaning that they love you
unconditionally and that you're in charge of them, whether you be a coach, a
parent, a teacher, then that's going to be your best way. And that's really
what I've attempted to do. And I've probably improved at doing that, as well.  
  
Q. Have you ever been to Boise or Idaho before? Do you feel like a lot
of fans should maybe root for you guys here at the NCAA tournament here in
Boise?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes, I was here a decade ago in the NCAA tournament. We played
Portland State in the first round, Wisconsin in the second. We advanced to the
Sweet 16 when I was the head coach at Xavier.  
  
We were in Providence, Rhode Island a few years ago in the first round of the
NCAA tournament and you could hear the U of A chant. It doesn't matter where
we go our fans will be prevalent. But I would expect we would have fans here.  
  
Q. You're a defensive guy. This team has been different, they haven't
been as good defensively all year. With that plus all that off-court stuff,
how is this manifesting itself with your stress level? Do you feel like you
have more gray hair this season from getting these guys to play defense?  
SEAN MILLER: No. Our defense has improved over the last two or three weeks,
almost astronomical. I think that's a function of the closeness of our group,
the unselfishness of our team. You could sense sometimes in our earlier
practice today if your group wants to continue to play, and we have that.  
  
That doesn't mean that it's going to win out and we're going to beat Buffalo.
But I do think we have a closeness, togetherness, we played our best here at
the end.  
  
And offensively you can look at that question two ways. The other way is, they
also are a really good offensive team. We have some answers on that side of
the basketball. We've played very well as far back as November on offense. And
recently we've really cut our turnovers down, which I hope we can do tomorrow
night, as well.  
  
It's the combination for us of improved defense and continued offensive
excellence that I think is our best recipe to stay in that tournament.  
  
Q. This is kind of a two-part question: Deandre makes up such a large
part of the offense. Do you see that being a potential issue in the tournament
as you progress? And also is there any plans to try to get Allonzo more
involved in the tournament than he was in the PAC 12 tournament?  
SEAN MILLER: That's a good question. We have balance on our team. Allonzo
Trier has had a great season, his defense has been the best it's been all
year. He shoots over 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from the three, 80
percent from the foul line. He averages right below 20 points per game. You
have Rawle that brings a toughness to our team that separates maybe us from
some others. Parker Jackson, Dusan at the center position, they're seniors.
Dusan is the all-time winningest player in Arizona history. When you think of
some of the great players that have played in our program, that's quite a
testament. Parker is now second. They've been involved in a lot of games. We
have some experience, as well.  
  
But Deandre, he stands out because I haven't seen a player like him. And I
think he's the best. He does it on defense. He does it on offensive. As his
coach he does it every day in practice. He has an energy and smile about him
that makes him fun to be around. He's exceptional. And I hope this tournament
gets a chance to see him at his best. If you watched the PAC 12 tournament you
watched a player that played a level that you won't see very often.  
  
Q. Could you talk to me about Allonzo and Deandre as a one-two punch.
How would you defend against that? What do you do with those two?  
SEAN MILLER: The key is for us to get both guys playing well in the same game.
I think that's when we're really tough to deal with. Allonzo can do a lot of
different things offensively. He's not one dimensional. He's a high free throw
attempt player. Gets fouled a lot. Shoots a high percentage at the three. He
has over a hundred assists, which I think is the biggest improvement that he's
made from the time he's walked in the door until now.  
  
With Deandre, he can score a number of ways, as well. He doesn't score just in
the low post. He's averaging I think five or six offensive rebounds a game
over the last five or six games. Makes free throws, gets fouled.  
  
For us it's a matter of playing team basketball, being unselfish. Those two
guys have a way of scoring. You don't have to call their number for them to
score. They're going to score as long as we're an unselfish team. Both of
those players are very unselfish.

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Davidson student-athletes.  
  
Q. Someone asked Coach Calipari to size up what a threat Davidson is.
And his quote was to the effect of: They're going to take 35 threes, and they
make 20 of them I'll tell my kids, Well, it's been a terrific season. To what
extent is the three an equalizer in this situation?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Well, they definitely spread the floor at all five positions,
with everybody being able to knock down the three. And we definitely try to
get inside out to get some easy ones to fall early. If we can knock down some
3s, we're tough to beat.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like of the team and what's it like now going
into a conference tournament knowing that you had to win in order to get into
the tournament, and going into the tournament and winning it?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Yeah, going into the tournament we wanted to take it a game
at a time and have as much fun as we could out there. We didn't want to put
any pressure on us, we wanted to take it day-by-day and enjoy the time that we
had left with each other and continue to fight for each other.  
  
Q. You guys have to have been dreaming of this moment, big stage, bright
lights. How do you balance just the joy of knowing that you've made it and
just glad to be here with the focus that's required to survive and advance?  
RUSTY REIGEL: I would say throughout the season Coach has prepared us so well
for this moment. We played in a tournament in Hawaii. And then we had the
experience of playing in this recent tournament that we won in DC. And it's
about taking it day-by-day, game by game, and preparing the same way we have
for all the other games we have this season.  
  
Coach preaches joy in the moment and being happy with playing and loving what
we do. And I think every one of us is happy that we're with this team, with
each other, with the coaches, and it's a family we want to win with.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: This is definitely a dream come true for all of us. There was a
lot of excitement especially after winning the conference tournament, which I
think was expected. But you have to know that we still have more basketball to
play.  
  
And despite all the excitement and the thrill of making the NCAA tournament,
we still have a very good chance of winning tomorrow and we have a game to
play. We're going to play with joy and confidence, but also with focus.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Rusty and I have fortunately had the opportunity to make the
tournament as freshmen. We've been here before. And we believe that's a
learning experience for us, and we have an organization and team that has the
experience of being here.  
  
Like they said, it's a great opportunity and we're happy to be here, but we're
not content with just being here; we want to go and win some games.  
  
Q. This year marks 10 years since Davidson's run to the Elite 8. How
much does that loom over the program and how much does that team inspire you
guys?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: That run ten years ago was incredible. That was a great team.
Obviously Steph Curry, a great player. And a lot of us look up to that and we
see that in the back of our mind.  
  
But we don't really think of it as being ten years ago to this year, and now
we're back in the NCAA tournament. But it definitely is a team that showed
great care for each other. And they didn't want to let each other down, and
that's something we try to back on with this team.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: It's crazy that was ten years ago, but it's definitely
motivation for all of us and we believe we're capable of making a run, as
well. And it's cool to see that Davidson has been successful in the tournament
before. And we believe that under Coach McKillop we'll be able to do the same
this year.  
  
RUSTY REIGEL: That team absolutely left its mark on Davidson and the program
as a whole. And guys like Kellan that chose to be here because of that run.  
  
Growing up I was a Davidson fan, I was at three of those four games. And
looking back it was awesome that we have an opportunity to do something
similar. And I'd love to be a part of something like that.  
  
Q. Today across the country there were a lot of high school kids that
walked out of class in protest to gun violence. As college students have you
thought about the issue of gun violence, and if so, what are your thoughts?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I've never really thought about it too much this year. But
seeing everybody step across the country, it's great to see the unity of
everybody joining together peacefully. Different schools doing different
things. And it's great to see the younger community being together as a whole.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah, we definitely think about it a lot, especially with all
the tragedies that have happened over the last six months or a year. A lot of
people are not happy with the gun laws and how easy it is for some people to
get a gun. To see people be proactive and voice their opinion and step forward
in something they believe in is something cool to see.  
  
RUSTY REIGEL: I agree with everything they said.  
  
Q. Since you've had the long history with Davidson, I'm asking the
underdog teams: Do you count on the neutral fans to join you in an event like
this? What would be your pitch to the people of Boise?  
RUSTY REIGEL: My pitch would be that we're a team that's entertaining, it's
fun to watch. You see the guys play, the smiles on their faces. It's awesome
watching us go out there. To pull off an upset like that would be a cool thing
to happen. Let's hope Peyton can hit six of six 3s. Cheer us on and we'll show
you a good time.  
  
Q. Rusty made a comment that '08 team played a part in you coming to
Davidson. Was that your first exposure to the team?  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah, I was 11, my dad had just given me a magazine article. It
was a picture of Steph Curry shooting, and that's when I got exposed to Steph
and the 2008 team. And he and I and the rest of my family would watch every
game. And in the halftime I'd mimic his shots in the backyard. And ever since
I've followed Davidson and especially Steph. Back in 2008 was when I was first
exposed.  
  
Q. In Kentucky you had this big name school with a bunch of players on
their way to the NBA. How important is it for you guys to show that you can
play with them?  
RUSTY REIGEL: I think it's extremely important. I think we all feel that we
absolutely can play with a team like that. We feel like we've been playing
against teams similar to that caliber throughout the year in UVA and with
Carolina. Players that are very talented.  
  
We're going to come out tomorrow and prove ourselves, not that we haven't done
that throughout this year.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: I agree with Rusty.  
  
Q. So for all of you, is Steph your favorite Davidson player? Isn't
there someone that you love more that is underappreciated?  
KELLAN GRADY: My favorite is Steph Curry. There's been a tremendous amount of
players through Davidson. Steph has always been my favorite.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I have to say Steph as well. But one of my other players is
Tyler Kalinoski. I was fortunate enough to play with him my freshman year. The
way he played the game, everything he did was right, the way he did things.  
  
Q. As you guys were studying film for Kentucky, was there anything that
surprised you about Kentucky when you were studying them?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Well, we knew they were a very athletic, very long team and
that they really crashed the offensive glass and got out in transition and
ran. They are able to spread you out, as well, with different lineups they can
spread the floor and knock down open 3s. It will be a challenge to guard
inside and out if they're knocking down 3s from the outside.  
  
KELLAN GRADY: I was a little bit surprised. They do a lot of baseline down-
screen action. Thinking of Calipari and Kentucky, I thought dribble handoffs
and ball screens and downhill motion. They run a lot of stuff for Kevin Knox
and some of the perimeter guys coming off the baseline. So I was a little bit
surprised by that, watching film on them.  
  
RUSTY REIGEL: I agree.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll wait for Coach McKillop in just a couple of minutes.  
  
Q. Going into the conference tournament you guys probably had a feeling
that you needed to win if you wanted to get into March Madness. What's the
feeling of the team after going out and winning the conference tournament?  
BOB McKILLOP: Mission accomplished. We've had that experience at Davidson for
many years. As members of the Southern Conference it was one big league. We
would go into that weekend in March, no matter what our record was during the
course of the year, knowing that we had to win three games or you were going
home.  
  
Q. When most people think Davidson basketball, obviously they think the
2008 run. Has it hit you that it's been ten years and how much influence did
that team play on the program today?  
BOB McKILLOP: It's hard to believe it is ten years, because it's such a vivid,
treasured memory. It resonates with us every day, that spirit of that team, of
that experience hovers around our campus.  
  
So for me and for many people that have been part of the program for so long
it will never, ever disappear or be such a distant memory.  
  
Q. John Calipari described your team as almost like (inaudible). Do you
believe anything he says about your team?  
BOB McKILLOP: John's first recruit at the University of Massachusetts was a
young man who played for me, and I was a high school coach at the time. So
it's interesting. The boy's name was Kennard Robinson. And John went on to
ensure that that young man graduated with a master's degree from the
University of Massachusetts and played professional basketball in the
Philippines. I trusted one of my quote, unquote, sons with John 30 years ago,
35 years ago, and he honored that trust. So I trust everything John says.  
  
Q. This tournament gives you a chance to expose new people to your
program and your school. And obviously you guys have done this for a while
now. What do you hope people learn about Davidson, see about your program as
you come to new places like this?  
BOB McKILLOP: In 1994 we played in the Albertson's Classic here in Boise. So I
have fond memories of that. Who could not have the greatest admiration for
what Chris Peterson did here with the football program, and Leon Rice, happens
to be a good friend, and Justinian Jessup was a kid we recruited aggressively.  
  
Familiarity with Boise is very, very strong. We're thrilled to be in this
marvelous city. We understand why people want to flock to come and live here.
And of course being on a national stage like we are, and having it in this
venue, which is going to attract a great crowd, is indicative of the athletic
spirit that lives here in Boise.  
  
Q. As you were preparing for Kentucky and watching film and probably the
first thing that pops out is their length and athleticism. How do you slow
down a team like that?  
BOB McKILLOP: What impressed me most is how much they've improved throughout
the season. We've watched tape early and we've watched tape midseason. We
watched tape late. We watched tape conference tournament. And they just seem
to be getting better and better. And that's a statement of the outstanding job
that John has done. John has brought a group of young men in there and molded
them into a team.  
  
That's not easy. Everyone thinks it's, if I had those kind of players I'd have
a great team. It's not easy. And that's why he has done such a marvelous job
as a coach and that's why he's a hall of famer, because he's taken young men
and put them together as a team, even though they were the stars. And I think
he has a host of high school all-Americans, and yet now he has to mold that
talent into a team.  
  
So hats off to John for accomplishing that, not just this year, but that's
been a tradition that John has had wherever he has been.  
  
Q. How much do you guys get Steph Curry around the program? If I'm not
mistaken, I believe Golden State has a night off tomorrow night, do you expect
him to make the trip up here?  
BOB McKILLOP: Steph Curry is around our program 24 hours a day. The imprint
that he put on our program is probably the greatest imprint that any alum
could put on a program or a school.  
  
Davidson College, no matter where you go in the United States or across the
world, the recognizable name is Steph Curry. And what's wonderful about that
is that Steph Curry has taken ownership of that. Steph Curry has never, ever
separated himself from the spirit of Davidson College that was part of his
upbringing. And you could look at article after article about his reference to
that.  
  
And in fact, on the court Sunday, as we had just won the tournament, we're
sitting there on the benches waiting for the awards tables to be set up, Steph
Curry called, FaceTimed, FaceTimed with our bench, and it was game day for the
Golden State warriors. A shout-out to Steph, because it's Steph's 30th
birthday, so happy birthday, Steph.  
  
Q. You've watched how you've built your program from moving conferences
and with the Steph Curry and to situations like this where you could play
against a team like Kentucky, and you're not an unknown. People know about the
program. You've watched all that happen. What sort of pride does that give you
in seeing that during your career?  
BOB McKILLOP: When you're at a program as long as I've been at a program, 28,
29 years, and you become part of that. You become part of that culture. And
not only do you become part of it, because the connection for many of our
players is through the program that I was the head coach in, they become part
of it. So your family grows and grows and grows, and that family has become
like an army.  
  
And to me that is the greatest source of pride that people that were there in
1990, 1992, 1996, they're feeling as much a part of this. And that's the sense
of Davidson College, there's an intimacy there whether you're a basketball
player or not, an intimacy that connects everybody.  
  
You drive down the interstate, you go into a shopping mall, you walk across a
piazza in Europe, and you see the Davidson shirt or sticker on their car, and
you try to pull up fast in that car or try to talk to that person to speak,
because there's somehow a connection. That's the extraordinary aspect of
Davidson College.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE.)  
BOB McKILLOP: I don't know. No, I don't think. He'd have to ask me for
tickets. (Laughter.)

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [CJ Massinburg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35020)

### [Nick Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30768)

### [Wes Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27920)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the student-athletes from University of
Buffalo.  
  
Q. Million dollar question, how do you begin to slow down an athlete
like Deandre?  
WES CLARK: Focus on making the catches hard, making him work for everything.
We know he's a force, one of the best players in the country. But we're not
going to let that deter us from what we're trying to do, where we're trying to
get.  
  
Q. You guys played in this tournament two years ago when you guys went
to Providence. Last year you didn't make the tournament. How gratifying is it
to be back here and how much did you learn from the first time around?  
CJ MASSINBURG: It was definitely an honor getting back to this tournament.
When you begin the season you've got one goal in mind, two goals, actually,
winning the conference tournament, and the second goal, which is more
tournament, is getting to this tournament and trying to get some wins.  
  
We came up short last year, but that made us more hungry to get here this
year.  
  
NICK PERKINS: Pretty much what C.J. said. We came up short last year, and we
worked our butt off all summer and all spring to get back here, and now we're
here.  
  
Q. How are you embracing that underdog role, given the task at hand?  
WES CLARK: I think the No. 1 thing we're doing is just trying to focus on
playing one play at a time. We're used to being the guys with the targets on
our back. So for us to go out and hunt one time is fun.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: Definitely. One thing that is circulating in the locker room is
we don't have any pressure on us, we're not expected to win the game. So we
don't have anything to lose. So we're not going out there with a bunch of
pressure like we have to beat this team. We're going to go out there and give
our all. It's March so upsets happen.  
  
NICK PERKINS: To be honest, I wouldn't even call it an upset. We're supposed
to be here. We were winning all year, winning at a high level. We're supposed
to be here. It didn't surprise us. We're supposed to be in this game. I think
it would be great for us if we win. It is what it is.  
  
But we're planning to win. We're ain't here to just say we got here; we are
trying to win the game.  
  
Q. You've known Nate for a long time, you played for him in high school.
Describe the man he is and the type of leader he is for this program.  
WES CLARK: Very confident, man, and a team coach. I've had some coaches where
you felt a disconnect from the coach and the players. Our coach does a great
job connecting all the players. I don't know one guy on the team that he
doesn't have a great bond with.  
  
Just to have that family figure around and that type of effect is a different
type of game. A different type of coach and a different type of team.  
  
Q. Buffalo sports fans are sometimes known to be a little crazy,
especially Bills fans. Is there any crossover with your fans? And if so, will
we see some fun fans here in Boise?  
WES CLARK: Our fans are great. I think they're the same, the Buffalo Bills
fans and the Bulls fans. I can't say they will be any different. They'll be
out and go hard just for us like they are in Buffalo.  
  
CJ MASSINBURG: We definitely have the greatest fans in the NCAA. We have one
guy, we have a student section called True Blue. We have one guys that comes
in Speedos and is naked all the whole game. He's called you be naked. He wears
a cape. He shows personality to our fans and stuff and we appreciate him.  
  
Q. Whichever one is the best politician, there will be a ton of neutral
fans in the arena tomorrow. What would be the pitch to Boise to get behind
Buffalo? What stands out in your program and your team that people may like?  
CJ MASSINBURG: Just to the neutral fans, you know, everybody likes, I won't
say a Cinderella story, but people like to root for the underdogs.  
  
Neutral fans, we are hard-nosed, fierce competitors, don't back down to
anybody type of guys, hey, root for us. You'll see what we bring to the table.
We're very easy to cheer for.  
  
WES CLARK: We have a great group of guys. A lot of guys that's handsome,
you'll enjoy coming to watch us. We play hard, we're going to fight, we're
also nice at the same time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I want to hear more about how these guys look when they play.  
  
We'll wait for Coach Oats in just a moment.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BOISE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BOISE)

  

## March 14, 2018

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ohio State.  
  
Q. What's the excitement level, getting the program from Ohio State back
into the Dance?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: We're excited. The Ohio State program is used to being in
the NCAA tournament. We're excited to be back.  
  
JAE'SEAN TATE: All the players come to Ohio State to play in March. We had a
couple of down years, but I couldn't ask for a better senior year. I'm going
out with this team in March.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Mike Daum so far, and what are your thoughts
about matching up against him in the first game?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: He's a very good player. Big. Shoots the ball. Makes him
hard to guard. He's a very tough matchup. He's a good player.  
  
Q. You guys had a great season but didn't end it the way you wanted.
Three out of the last five lose, and lost in the Big Ten tournament. What's
the mentality going into this tournament after losing your last game?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Just another opportunity to get the sour taste out of our
mouth. Throughout the season we've shown what it takes to win, and we've shown
what happens when we do those things; we lose. So I think just our ability to
focus on what got us to be No. 2 in the Big Ten and focus on that and just try
to pay attention to the coaching and the scouting and that's going to be the
best thing we can do in this matchup against a very good team.  
  
We fell off toward the end, but we still had a great Big Ten season. We're
capable of winning big games. We're trying to get that taste out of our mouth
and move forward.  
  
Q. Going off of that, a question for both of you guys again. You are in
a class of only four times in the history has a 12 played a 5. What are you
going to have to do to avoid being upset by a South Dakota team that's been in
the Dance three straight years in a row?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Just prepare like we have in the past. And not try to get too
nervous. We know this is a very good team. As long as we listen to coach and
we play for each other and stay together out there, I think we have a good
chance to win the game.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Yeah, definitely. Upsets happen all the time.  
  
Q. Wondering what you guys knew about Boise before you found out you
were coming here?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Not much. I knew you guys were known for potatoes and pretty
much just the blue field. And once I got off the plane I was expecting it to
be a little colder, but it was way more beautiful than Ohio. What was it like
60 yesterday? It was warm. And just the view of the mountains and that. I
didn't expect having that coming off the plane.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I kind of liked the mountains. We don't have that in Ohio.
To see mountains coming off the plane, that was pretty nice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ohio State coach, Chris Holtmann, welcome.  
  
Q. You had an unusually long break going into tomorrow. Are there any
benefits having this break?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: We'll see. I think that's the million dollar question in a lot
of ways. I've been asked that a lot. We'll see. I think it's a question that
all the Big Ten teams are being asked and will eventually answer.  
  
We try to balance rest versus rust. That can be difficult. We also tried to
make sure our guys are conditioned and ready to play. We've been banged up and
we were a little bit fatigued at the end of the year because we had some guys
carrying a pretty heavy load. Hopefully that rest helped.  
  
We went off campus a few times. We had an inter-squad scrimmage at another
site, we changed up the practice times. Had a meal together. And then as
coaches we got a lot of recruiting done.  
  
Q. We know this is your first year, what was kind of your thoughts
heading into the season? Ohio State hasn't been to the Dance in a few
seasons.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: As a coach you always feel, I think we all put tremendous
pressure on ourselves. I think what we felt as a coaching staff in terms of
pressure was we wanted our upperclassmen, our seniors, to experience this
tournament. That's a really unique thing, that we're playing a team that is in
its third straight NCAA tournament and we only have three returning players
that have played in a NCAA tournament game versus a team that has quite a bit
of experience.  
  
I think more than anything you really wanted it for your older guys that
haven't tasted this incredible tournament maybe as much as we would have liked
for them to. So if there was any pressure that's what we felt.  
  
Obviously we understood there were relatively low expectations for us early.
Our guys answered the bell and put us in a position to do this and hopefully
we can make the most of it.  
  
Q. Obviously Bates-Diop is a player that gets a lot of attention. Who
else on the team could be an X factor for you guys in order to make a run?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well, I think our sole focus is on tomorrow, not anything
else. And I think that probably the guys that are always at the top of the
scouting report for us are Bates-Diop, as you mentioned, and Jae'Sean Tate. I
think where we had played well and had success our guards have played well for
us, C.J. Jackson, Kam Williams, Andrew Dakich, those guys have played well for
us. They're going to need to -- listen, I think we're playing the best team
I've played in the opening round as a coach. So we're going to need a lot of
good stuff from a lot of guys.  
  
Q. You guys obviously had a great season, but maybe didn't end the way
you wanted. You lost 3 out of 5, and the Big Ten tournament. What's the
mentality to wash that away and start the new season with this tournament and
get back on track a little bit?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Everybody has a loss or two at the end of the year. So you
could look at a lot of college basketball teams and say that. I think we had a
challenging closing schedule, stretch. I don't think our guys were deterred by
that by any stretch. Obviously you want to stay in this tournament as long as
you can. And that's what we're trying to do.  
  
But I don't sense that they're fragile. I think they've got great respect for
who we're playing. And we had a great closing win in regular season. And
obviously got bounced earlier in the Big Ten tournament earlier than we wanted
to. I think our guys are in a good place and want to play well.  
  
Q. Just going off that a little bit, you are in the classic 12-5
matchup, you are a popular pick. Considering the experience, what are you
going to have to do to get out of this first round and keep your season alive
here?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I get it. I understand why people are picking them a lot. They
have a pro. They have great experience. They've got a really talented team.
It's not just Daum. They have really talented guys around them, a terrific
freshman guard.  
  
People look at not only the 12-5 matchup, and historically what that's been,
but the fact that those guys have great experience being in this thing. When
you have a pro on your roster it makes a big difference.  
  
So I think we know we're going to need to be sharp. We're going to need to
play well. We're going to need to score the ball against their defense and be
able to make them make it difficult for them. They're a very gifted offensive
team. And they play through their guys exceptionally well. They've got
athleticism. They play really well together. You can tell they're an
experienced group, because they play really, really well together.  
  
I think when you get into this thing you realize that any team you play in
this thing is good. But certainly when you get in kind of those middle-seeded
games you're playing a really talented team. And we certainly are.

### [Johnathan Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33110)

_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Gonzaga.  
  
Q. From what you've seen of UNCG so far, what are your plans on how to
break their press and speed up the game from the slow tempo they like to
play?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: We watched them a little bit and they're pretty good. They
have some great shooters. And they basically shoot the ball really well.  
  
As far as their press, just trying to break it, and start offensive right
away. Don't hold the ball and let them set their defense. Once you break the
press, just keep attacking.  
  
Q. As a guy who is a vet and been around the program, how have you seen
it grow in the couple of years you've been there, and what do you think is
next for Gonzaga?  
JOSH PERKINS: I wouldn't say I'm a vet, but thanks for giving me that title.  
  
I feel good being with the guys up here. We've got experience on our team.
Even with Tille and Rui.  
  
As far as that, just knowing that the little things matter in March. Just
preaching that to the guys, taking a charge, diving for the ball or coming
down on the rebounds. Just the little things matter in March and getting that
across to the guys is important.  
  
Q. What were you like in the first NCAA games at the start and how much
different is it now to be at this stage?  
SILAS MELSON: Well, the first tournament games probably speak for all of us, a
lot more nerves than right now. I think as freshmen, our first games we were a
little nervous. But now we have NCAA tournaments under our belt. All of us
here are more comfortable and more experienced with it.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: As a freshman I was real nervous, when I looked at the guys that
were so composed. So just hopefully the young guys seeing how composed we are,
and just knowing we have their backs. And just knowing it's another game at
the end of the day, don't stress too much about it. Just kind of play how we
play and the rest will take care of itself.  
  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: All the freshmen -- last year was my first time having
tournament experience and I feel like it helped a lot going into this year.
I'm not going to be as nervous, just go out to have fun. Things matter in this
month.  
  
Q. You guys are playing at Boise State, a Mountain West school, and you
guys possibly looking to join them out the Mountain West. I'm curious, you're
the only one that might be back next year, what are your thoughts on possibly
joining the Mountain West when you heard about that?  
JOSH PERKINS: I read about, but I haven't heard too much about it. We play who
we play, no matter who is in front of us. If we move, we do. But if we don't,
we don't. We've just got to play our game at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Being so close last year, is that something that's stuck with you
through this year or is it something that you had to erase and just start
over?  
SILAS MELSON: It definitely stuck with us. We all headed into this tournament
with a chip on our shoulder because of last year. And now we haven't been
down, it was more motivating than anything. Coming into this March I think
that's going to be our motivation is to try to get back to the Final Four and
the championship.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: Si nailed it on the head. We just took how close we were last
year, knowing the small things we didn't do in that championship game that we
can just apply to the tournament this year, just doing that.  
  
Like he said, our chip just got bigger coming up short last year. Just hope we
can come up a little bit closer this year.  
  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: Basically it gives motivation. Basically that's what it
is, just motivating us to get back to the Final Four. And little things matter
like taking charges and getting the loose balls. We as a team just want to get
back there.  
  
Q. You play in an event like this, there's a ring of neutral fans, and
what would your pitch be for those neutral fans to root for your team? What
would be your pitch?  
JOSH PERKINS: Spokane is a lot closer than UNC, so please cheer for us
(laughter).  
  
Q. This is like the 20th straight year that Gonzaga has made the
tournament. How much of history are you guys aware of, of the Gonzaga history
going way back, and how big a part of the history is the program today?  
SILAS MELSON: I mean I think as far as history goes, I think we're all pretty
close to the history, just because of the culture, we're all close. Players
from the past are always there around us. We all feel what happened on the
team, we feel what they were going through when they were on the team. The
20th-year milestone is important to us, as it is to the people from the past.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: We're really aware of the history. Guys come back, we build
relationships with the old guys. So for us to just keep fulfilling their
destiny, their history, it feels good to me and to these guys as well. But
we're writing our own piece of it. So it feels good to adding on to that
Gonzaga legacy.  
  
Q. Have you guys seen something similar in this defense and how do you
attack it?  
SILAS MELSON: I don't know if it's at a high level, but Villanova put the
three-quarter press in, and they're obviously the top five in the country so
they're really good at it. That's probably the closest team I can think of.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: I'd say Villanova this year, and we had experience playing them
before. It's our job to take care of the ball. And we need to break their
press. We've just got to play, so I think we're in good hands.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Gonzaga coach, Coach Few.  
  
Q. The big picture question: How much of a challenge for you has it been
to keep last year as a little bit of motivation versus erasing the slate,
realizing you have a new team and going on a new journey?  
MARK FEW: I don't know that we erased anything. I think it was important to be
able to draw off of last year, but it was a journey. We had an almost
undefeated regular season, and the way we handled things.  
  
But this team is just different. And I think at times I needed to take a step
back and be fair to them. And I was holding them to a standard of last year's
team. And again, it was probably very unfair for a couple of months there. I
think I reached a point in January or February to back off a little bit and
let them be who they are. And they've definitely thrived with that.  
  
Q. You have a few connections to Boise. What are your thoughts on being
able to play here in the first round?  
MARK FEW: It's great. The obvious one, just it's in the Northwest so it's easy
for our fans. A lot of travel. We have a lot of fans here in Boise. I have a
ton of family down here and Marcy is from here. And obviously Leon Rice is my
former assistant and he's basically family. So we spend a lot of time down
here in Boise in the off season.  
  
And we've got some great former players, Kore Violett [ph] was one of the guys
who started the whole run from Gonzaga is from here. Kyle Vangenus [ph]
obviously, people remember him, is from here. Then some great ex-players
before the run even started with Jeff Goss and Jarrod Davis, Jamie Dudley all
call this home. So, that's been great.  
  
And there's a small downside of it, I wish my father-in-law was still alive
because he would have gotten the biggest kick out of hosting the Zags down
here, he was kind of a legendary guy down here. That's the only downside. But
pretty cool.  
  
Q. Just wondering how often you stay in touch with Kyle Bankhead and
what do you remember of him as a player?  
MARK FEW: Kyle's obviously close with several of my staff members. They were
in the program together. But he stopped in a lot over the years. And hung out,
watched practice. Kyle was one of the all-time great Zags. He embodied
everything our program is about. He's an incredibly hard worker, incredibly
driven, selfless, did whatever it takes to win. He was one of those guys.  
  
If it meant a charge or getting eight rebounds at 6-1 could barely touch the
net. He'd do that. And then he also wasn't afraid to step up and make a big
three. He did that numerous times for us.  
  
Crazy how it comes full circle, but happy for him that he's in the business
again, and it looks like it's going well.  
  
Q. You mentioned the connections to Boise. There's been some reports
about Mountain West and Gonzaga. Just curious, talking to Leon, he said he
thinks you would be a good fit for the league. Where do the discussions come
from or the possibility you guys would be a fit in that league?  
MARK FEW: I don't want to come in the league, I don't think we could beat
Boise. Leon's got it rolling down here. They had an unbelievable year this
year. I marveled at the job that he did, and the players he did. And the year
Chandler Hutchison had. And they've done a great job developing him. And some
of the crowds you had here were phenomenal.  
  
Look, we've been talking to a lot of people. And this was the one that I guess
leaked out. Somebody leaked it out. I've said all along we're going to do
what's best for Gonzaga and the program moving forward. So whatever that
means, it's not something we're going to spend a lot of thought on this week
or hopefully for a while. But after the dust settles down Mike and I and
President McCulloh will figure out what's best for Gonzaga and go from there.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fans. The word on the street is that there are a
lot of Gonzaga fans making it into Boise. For those of us not familiar with
your fan base, how would you characterize Gonzaga fans and how important have
they been to the success to the program?  
MARK FEW: What's that exactly mean, "word on the street"? Okay. I got you.  
  
Very loyal. Extremely loyal. I'd like to think unconditional with their love
and support for the Zags, that's what's made the job so special. But, yeah,
it's a very strong fan base.  
  
I don't know if you were in Phoenix last year, but I think we had probably the
biggest collection of fans down there out of four teams. And even how it ended
up with us in Carolina at the end.  
  
We have a lot of fans here in Boise. I spend a lot of time in the off season,
and run into people that are huge fans of Gonzaga. And so I expect nothing
less.  
  
Q. Your team has made it to a national championship game, it's
consistently done that. What do you personally see as your vision for that
your next step your program can take? What is your idea where this program
goes from here?  
MARK FEW: I've always just been just to stay in growth mode. We've got to keep
growing and keep not staying still or being content or being content or happy
with where we're at. And I think this year is a product of that.  
  
The fact that we won 30 games, to win 30 is really, really hard in college
basketball. And to do that with the schedule we played, playing in the PK80
and some of the other non-conference games we had. So we'll continue to
schedule at a really high level. We'll continue to hopefully recruit at a
really high level.  
  
The school's done an unbelievable job facility-wise. We just moved into a
brand-new practice facility and finishing up the Hall of Fame which will be
really cool for the people to be able to roll in and see the history of all
the great teams, great players, great people that were involved building this
thing.  
  
And to be honest with you, I mean the greatest thing I think we've done in
this program is the Final Four. It's the 20th straight NCAA tournament
appearances. That shows sustained excellence, in my opinion. Because it's not
easy to do. It's not easy to do.  
  
And I'm really proud of this group for negotiating their way, navigating their
way through all the potholes and everything that happened in college
basketball. And there are times you're kind of wondering, man, I don't know, I
don't know, we might not. This might be the year. But they found a way and
we're playing our best basketball right now.  
  
Q. Another team here in Boise is Davidson. This year marks 10 years
since their run to the Elite 8. When you saw them make that run, did you see
similarities with that team and the early teams for you guys?  
MARK FEW: Some ways. There are some interesting underlying stories there. I
think we were the 7 and they were the 10 and we got shipped out to play 30
minutes from their campus or something. So that was a little rough to handle.  
  
Yeah, we got Steph started, and he was amazing. I mean the performance he put
on down there was simply amazing. We had a freshman that I don't think anybody
remembers that played great named Steven Gray, I think he had seven or eight
3s. If we would have held on to that last one, he would be the story and not
Steph. But they ended up getting the offensive rebound with a minute to go and
threw it out to Steph and he got a big 3 to put him in the lead.  
  
Probably the biggest similarity I see is Coach McKillop has been there this
entire time. So they've been able to build their culture, and have continuity
like that, much like we have.  
  
Q. Leon should be back tonight or tomorrow. Are you going to pick his
brain tonight?  
MARK FEW: We talk constantly. I was with his kids and Robin last night. So,
yeah, I don't know if he'll get back tonight. Hopefully if they win they'll
move on to St. Mary's. Constant contact with him. I can't tell you with how
impressed I am with what he's built down here. He's moved them from the WAC to
the Mountain West, and made them right up at the top of the heap. I was
disappointed it didn't turn out the way they hoped.  
  
But now I see things from a bigger picture, how consistently good they've
become, filling the stands here, which isn't easy. And things like that, how
they recruit, stuff like that.  
  
Q. What have you seen so far from watching UNC Greensboro practice, and
if their style of play might mimic a team you played earlier this season?  
MARK FEW: I haven't watched them practice. Hopefully they haven't watched us
practice. We'll have to check and see if Kyle has got some camera up in the
McCarthy Center.  
  
Really impressed. And again, impressed, anytime you see, I think people see
these seeds and then, yeah, just put those aside. 27 wins is 27 wins. And I
think you can tell a lot about a team when they win the regular season and
they win the conference tournament. That's a team that has a lot of winning
qualities about them.  
  
Obviously the guard Alonso is really dangerous. He's got his hands on the ball
a lot. And he makes a lot of plays. Scores it. Facilitates. He's really
crafty. But then they've got good size and rim protection in the back. Their
defensive numbers jump out at you. They play a three-quarter court press that
slows you down, keeps possessions down. So they play a little slower-paced
game. But we've faced a lot of different stuff.  
  
You get 34 games in you see a lot in the course of a year. So we just have to
draw on all those experiences.  
  
Q. Your team has done yoga for a few years?  
MARK FEW: Heck, yeah, so do I.  
  
Q. Which coach did it and which coach is the best at it?  
MARK FEW: Some of our coaches don't participate, like Donny Daniels isn't a
full participant, which is probably a good thing. And Tommy Lloyd is a
nonparticipant, too.  
  
I don't know if you could have the best when you're the worst, you know what
I'm saying? I can say this, there are some stretches that I can do slightly
better than J-3. J-3 is not the most flexible guy you came across. Sometimes
J-3 and I do some solo stuff with Travis. I always feel good when I'm in there
with Travis and J-3. It's good to not be last in the class.  
  
Q. Wes Miller said when he was looking for his first coaching job, you
allowed him to come watch in practice. Do you remember that? And what were
your impressions of him?  
MARK FEW: I do remember it. And just that we knew he was going to be
successful at whatever he was doing, just talking to him. He was a bright guy
that had a lot of energy, had a plan, was focused enough to go out and take
the time to go and watch other practices and seemed very driven. And had a
great pedigree and good mentors around him. So that's usually a recipe for
success. And lo and behold, here we are. He's done a great job there.  
  
Q. As you've built this program over the years what are the things
you've tried to instill as the things you want to be known for, and you want
your team and your players to be really good at?  
MARK FEW: Just what they are. I mean if you ask anybody from Spokane, they
know our guys aren't just basketball players. I think they're great mentors in
the community for young kids. And I think people respect the fact that our
guys are of high character and value being a student-athlete. I think it's
that term or ideal is under assault right now on the national level. But I can
tell you in our program it rings true and is legit.  
  
I hope people after they watch us and see how we interact on the floor, off
the floor, that they'll say it's a first-class program, because that's what we
want people to think.  
  
Q. On that note that it's under assault a little bit, have you thought
at all about what you would like to see changed?  
MARK FEW: Look, the biggest thing is that I think the idea that this is a
systemic problem across the board is a misnomer. There are obviously some
problems within college basketball, but there's problems within everything
that's that big, whether it's our federal government or professional sports or
anything.  
  
So I think we need to take some proactive steps to help right those and make
them better and adapt probably the model to more reflect what's going on in
society and then also kind of reflect that maybe not all 350 of us are the
same. I mean there are certainly a lot more things and needs and options and
whatever for my guys than there is some of these schools that haven't had the
run Gonzaga has had or Carolina has had or some of us.  
  
So I think we need to probably not treat everybody the same that way. But at
the same time this tournament is going to show like it does every year.
College basketball and this tournament are the greatest sporting event our
country has. And it will prevail like it always does. There's already been a
ton of great games this year. So we need to make some tweaks, we need to open
our mind to them.  
  
But I don't think we need to overreact, and I think we've got a lot of people
-- I've said this about some of the more high-profile people that are
commenting on it, that they're extremely well intentioned but misinformed with
some of the things they're throwing out there.

Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34914)

  
_Boise, Idaho_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome University of Kentucky.  
  
Q. Much was made about Coach Calipari with his Boise comment about
asking the team if they heard where Boise was at. Can you elaborate on that
story? Did he ask you if you knew where Boise, Idaho was at?  
KEVIN KNOX: He asked us specifically if we knew where it was at. He kind of
said the answer before he asked. We all got the answer and we kind of looked
at him crazy. But I'm pretty sure most of us knew where it was, we're all
pretty good, smart young men (laughter).  
  
Q. Could you sum up what you've gotten out of this season in college
basketball.  
KEVIN KNOX: Just grown so much as a person and a player. Learned so much on
and off the court. The coaches taught me something new I can take and put into
my game. I put in a lot of work with the assistant coaches in off season or
before practice, just going to the gym, learning how to be a better IQ, be
aggressive, help my teammates out, be more communicative on the court, being
able to talk.  
  
I just learned so much from high school to college. There's a big difference
in my game now.  
  
Q. When you guys were studying the game film for Davidson was there
anything that jumped out or surprised you? Do you see any potential
mismatches?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Yeah, they're a really good two-point shooting team.
They shoot great. The coach said in the game this year they've made 50 or some
crazy number, 30 or something like that.  
  
It's going to be tough to cover. But it will be good.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: Yeah, coach said they shot 150 3s, that tells us they try to shoot
a lot of shots off the glass, a lot of cutting, back doors. We worked a lot on
defense, making sure we stay between our man and the basket. No easy layups or
no easy 3-point shots.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: They pretty much said what I was going to say. We've been
working on guarding the three in practice, guarding the basket. We focus on 3
pointers and stuff like that.  
  
Q. It seems like every time Coach Calipari speaks on the podium he talks
about how you try to improve your game by getting in the gym, those early
morning workouts. That's difficult to do. Not everybody would do that. What's
different about you that would make you do something like that?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I just like to get my work out early in the day
before I get tired from other activities. Personally for me it's harder to
work out after practice or after school and stuff like that so I just get it
done first thing in the morning.  
  
Q. What kind of coach is Coach Calipari? Is he as intense as he might
seem to be?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: Coach Calipari is crazy, for sure. He's different
from any coach I've ever been coached by. He's intense. He's always on us. We
know he loves us and he's for us, and do anything to get us better. And that's
the best part about it.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: He brings so much passion to the game. He pushes all of us outside
our comfort zone, makes us get to another gear. He tries us to get us to push
each other as teammates. Talk on the floor, off the floor, just be able to
come every day and attack the day. He brings that every day in practice.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: He just wants the best from you. He pushes all of us every day
in practice to be better. He's just a great coach. And he's getting us better
for the next game.  
  
Q. It's no secret that there's a lot of NBA players from Kentucky. Has
any NBA players reached out to you guys and given you any advice? What have
you learned from them from those conversations?  
KEVIN KNOX: In the summer, of course, they were here and worked out in
Kentucky. We were doing a lot of our workouts, they were working out with us.
They were just telling us to be competitive. At the next level everybody is
going to be trying -- you have to be able to have that edge to you, make sure
we communicate as a team.  
  
It was kind of different for us, because they were talking so much on defense
and offense. We weren't used to it, they told us to make sure we keep talking,
because that's a big part of the game.  
  
Q. I know Coach Calipari was afraid this was going to be a six-hour
flight for you guys. How long was it? Now that you're here, what is the
experience being here in the NCAA tournament?  
PJ WASHINGTON: The flight was like four hours, I don't know why he said six.
But it's great being here so far. We have been practicing already. We're just
basically ready to play. We're happy to be here.  
  
Q. Was there any kind of a concern that maybe with Coach Cal's comments
about Boise that the fans maybe wouldn't root for you guys? Your reaction?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: No, we didn't think like that, we just thought he was
just trying to be funny again, like he usually always is. Nothing too serious.  
  
Q. Davidson is probably going to come out with a chip on their shoulder.
They look at Kentucky as the big name program with all of you guys headed
toward the NBA. How are you going to counter that?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I think as of right now we're playing with a chip on
our shoulder. A lot of people think that they can upset us and we're the team
to beat in the first round.  
  
We'll be more than ready for this game coming up.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: Every game we play, we play against somebody that's going to play
their best game. It's not like we're not used to it. Every game we play it's
with people who have a chip on their shoulder and think they're better than
us. We're going to come out and play like we always play. Come out on top and
attack. That's kind of what we're used to so that's how we'll play tomorrow.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: We're going to come out with a chip on our shoulder. We have
just got to keep playing like we played in St. Louis and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Obviously there's a big learning curve for guys in their first year.
What do you think you've gotten better at, the most better at, I guess, if
that's a word, since the season started?  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: I think learning how to work consistently day in and
day out as hard as you can. In high school you didn't really have to, you were
so much better and bigger than guys you played against, but when you had to
work throughout the whole practice or the whole game, that's probably what I
learned the most.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: For me, probably just to be able to play outside my comfort zone
and be able to fight. When you come from high school in practice you're
messing around, just throwing easy baskets. But here in Kentucky, you're
starting to play against all stars every year. You come out and just play
every day, come out hard, because your spot can be taken.  
  
I learned how to fight and play outside my comfort zone and that's what the
coaches taught me this year.  
  
PJ WASHINGTON: I learned how to fight in practice and work for everything you
get. You've got to go out and take what you want. That's what we've been doing
every day in practice.  
  
Q. Have you guys been able to enjoy Boise? What have been some stuff
that you have gone out? What do you think of the city so far?  
PJ WASHINGTON: No, we haven't gone out. But our hotel is nice. The Courtyard
Marriott is kind of good (laughter).  
  
KEVIN KNOX: We haven't really done much. We went out to eat, that's about it.
And went back to the room.  
  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: The restaurant we ate at was pretty good. That's
about it. We didn't do too much. I don't know the name of it.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: It was seafood.  
  
Q. It's no secret you guys had some struggles in SEC play. But can you
point to one game or one day or one specific time that kind of changed things
for you guys and pointed you guys in the right direction?  
PJ WASHINGTON: I think the Alabama game at home, after our four-game losing
streak. That kind of changed things around. We started winning after that. And
everybody started buying into it and we started playing for each other.  
  
KEVIN KNOX: After the Florida game we got kind of smart. So we just came in
together and just decided we've got to step it up before the tournament. So we
just went through the four-game winning streak. We were just playing together
on both ends of the court and just playing as a team.  
  
SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER: The Florida game was the real turnaround for us,
probably our best basketball this season. I think we got exposed that game on
both ends of the floor, and we had to turn it around and we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Calipari.  
  
Q. Now that you are in Boise, how happy are you to be here?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It's been great. Our guys were talking about the mountains and
the views. We went to Owyhee Tavern last night, had a great meal. Stopped at a
couple of Catholic churches in town. And then we went to DK's Donuts. I am not
a donut eater, but I ate some of those donuts.  
  
I've never heard of a place, only in Boise, they're open from 4 a.m. to 9 a.m.
then they're shut down. Who goes at 4 a.m.? So I'm like, policemen, ranchers,
farmers? Who goes at 4 a.m.? Unless you're just getting in. And it doesn't
look like a town like that (laughter).  
  
So we'll figure out something to do tonight.  
  
Q. Today in high schools across the country a lot of students walked out
in protest of gun violence. Do you talk with your guys about social justice
issues, about being involved, and being aware of what's going on in the
community?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I have. We have at different times. The things that have gone
on before them that gave them an opportunity to be who they are, that there
are certain things that if they have an opportunity and they feel like they
want to make a stand, just understand the consequences. Don't be pushed to the
front of the line because of your fame, so to speak. And know that you stand
for everything that they stand for.  
  
So, yeah, we have discussed stuff like that.  
  
Q. Kevin was talking about what he thinks he got out of the season. It
was you challenging him not to be complacent, to be more aggressive, to sort
of stretch his comfort zone. Could you speak to how that fits into your job,
and for him in particular.  
JOHN CALIPARI: All these kids that I get when they're young, some of them stay
one year, some of them stay two or three years, four years. We've graduated 17
players since I've been the coach there. So not all of them leave in one year.  
  
They just did a bracket. How many of you saw the academic bracket? Raise your
hand. We were playing Bucknell in the finals. So it's not just basketball,
it's what we try to do academically.  
  
But here's what I would say: My first job is to get them to understand they
have to conquer themselves first, before they can worry about conquering
anybody else. To get them to think different about how they're going to go
about business, how, if you're undisciplined off the court, you're going to be
undisciplined on the court.  
  
How do you get yourselves to do things that you really don't want to do? How
do you self-evaluate? Because people around you are going to tell you that you
are never wrong. It's always somebody else. They're going to tell you that,
Well, he never takes him out, but he takes you out.  
  
Now, you can buy into all that and never change or you can self-evaluate and
say, I don't like where I am, which then says to you, Now, how do I change? If
I do the same things over and over again I'm not changing.  
  
We had a young man this year on our team, Shai Alexander, who was in the gym
at 7 a.m. shooting, who would come up in the office and want to watch tape of
his turnovers. Who never missed a class. Never missed a tutor. Was always on
time. Worked harder than anybody in every practice. Ready? Robert, who works
the hardest in the weight room? Shai. And it's changed who he is and his
opportunities and all that.  
  
So for me, a lot of this is mental. How I get them to change how they think
about this.  
  
And the other part of this is, how do you get them to understand that they've
got to share? That this is a team sport. That if you don't do this together
none of you will shine. That took us half a year. That a Kevin Knox, okay,
these guys accept that you are going to shoot balls, but you've got to rebound
and defend now. You're not taking bad shots because you're taking shots when
you choose to.  
  
The thing with Kevin is he's the youngest freshman in the country. So he could
still be in high school. Sacha is the youngest sophomore in the country. He
should be a freshman. These kids, because they're 6-9, and you look at him and
say, Wow, he's big, that doesn't mean he's a grown man. They're still
developing who they are and my job is to love them. To hold them accountable.
To keep it real. To make them understand things in no uncertain terms what
works and what doesn't.  
  
Because if my guys choose to leave after a year or two or three, I want them
to have success. Right now I think we have 30-some guys or whatever in the
NBA, who make a billion dollars, not a hundred million, a billion dollars. And
I went in those homes. And those families trusted me with their son. And those
families had dreams and aspirations, and this is an opportunity for them to
realize the American dream.  
  
And I'll say it again, 17 kids have graduated. We've had a thousand on the APR
for the last four or five years, which means that every kid leaves in good
academic standing. Why? Because they have a lifetime scholarship. And four
kids have already started coming back who left early. We had five kids left
with 60 college credits, that's halfway through.  
  
So, you know, I just don't want any of us to devalue education just because a
kid has a genius. When a kid has a genius as a piano player or golfer or
tennis player, it's not a big deal. But when a kid has a genius as a
basketball player, well, he's taking advantage of education. No. I've had four
straight A students. Brandon Knight would go to class and be in the gym at 11
o'clock at night. Why? You're going to leave in a month. Because I don't want
to get a B. I could go on. Great students.  
  
To say these kids don't belong on a college campus is wrong. And when you say
"those kids," who do you mean when you say "those kids" don't belong on a
college campus? Be more specific who you mean. These kids are benefitting by
this experience. And I'll tell you this, I'm benefitting because I'm having a
ball. Coaching these kids, this has been as fun a year as I've had.  
  
Does that thoroughly answer what you asked me? I don't know where that kind of
weaved to, but I kind of liked it (laughter).  
  
Q. Can you give us any update on Jarred Vanderbilt?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, the kid wants to play. I don't think that it's fair to
him or us if he's not able to go in there and compete at a high level. When he
first started playing -- this is what made this year hard. It was hard because
we had all freshmen. We started five freshmen. Five freshmen. I don't know if
it's ever been done, had this kind of inexperience.  
  
But then Jarred joined our team. And then we struggled. And then we started
going good. And all of a sudden Jarred is a Dennis Rodman, 10, 12 rebounds
every game he played, 15, he could have had 20. Passes, runs, athletic. Then
he gets hurt.  
  
Before the tournament, we haven't played a game, we needed our tournament to
figure out how we were going to play in case he cannot play. Now he wants to
play and at the end of the day I've got to make a decision on what I'm
thinking. And right now I just don't think it's in his interests or ours that
unless he's a hundred percent, I would take 97 percent, 95, but you can't take
80. You can't. The games are played at too high a level.  
  
Great kid and I love the kid. But, you know, my guess is that he will not play
tomorrow, didn't practice with us today. So we'll figure out from there.  
  
Q. Two-part question: But have you been to Idaho before? If you could
elaborate more on the story about telling the guys if they even knew where
Boise, Idaho was at?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'll do stuff like that. I'll ask them about players, Do you
know who Wilt Chamberlain was? So I'll ask them questions. And how many of you
know where Boise? What state is Boise in? And a couple of them raised their
hands. And I said, Do you want me to ask you? But I think they all knew.  
  
And I had been to Twin Falls. Great place. I saw Evel Knievel's launching pad.
And I was in the golf course down next to the river. Is it a river? Rapids.
Was it a river? I was down there.  
  
And I hate to tell you, one night I drove to Jackpot, Nevada. I was in
Jackpot, Nevada and there was sawdust on the floors, back then; it was a few
years ago.  
  
But a great campus, College of Southern Idaho. Manicured. I was there for a
week. So I stayed a week. And so, yes, I've been here.  
  
Q. DK Donuts used to be 24 hours, by the way. Thought I'd let you know.
In terms of Davidson's strengths, they obviously seem like a 3-point shooting
team. And you've been good perimeter defensive team. Your thoughts on the
matchup.  
JOHN CALIPARI: They are a really efficient team. They're an execution team.
We're an inexperienced team. We're not an execution team. They're going to
take 30 3-point shots. If they make 20, it has been a heck of a season for us.
They're taking 30.  
  
We've got to make them difficult. But they run some good stuff and they move
that ball. And their assists to baskets made. So in other words, it's not one-
on-one basketball; they're creating shots for each other. This is one of the
most efficient execution teams I've seen in years.  
  
So they're not a 12 seed. They won their tournament. They beat St. Bonaventure
and Rhody back-to-back nights. They're not a 12 seed.  
  
This will be a hard game for us. We know it and our kids know it.  
  
Q. Since you went to DK Donuts, did you try the bacon donut?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I did. It was unbelievable. Here's what I did, I looked at them
and I went, Oh, my gosh. So we did the bacon. And I cut it four ways. So I
didn't have -- it's this big (indicating). I only had like a little bit. And
before I could get another little bit it was gone. We were there with five
guys.  
  
And then I did the bowtie that had the chocolate and maple together dripping
off of it. Is anybody getting hungry right now? There was so much sugar that I
won't sleep tonight. And then I did the apple fritter, and we cut that up. But
I only had a little bit.  
  
Folks, I'm not a donut eater, even though you look at me and say, yes, you are
a donut eater. I'm not a donut eater. The coffee wasn't bad, either.  
  
Q. Is the potato a fruit or vegetable --  
JOHN CALIPARI: You can't ask me those kind of questions. People get mad. Vice
presidents get killed. They spell the thing wrong. Don't ask me; I'm here to
play basketball.  
  
Q. Sorry to get off the donut food train. You were talking about kind of
the history-making nature of your team with all the freshmen. Have you learned
anything from this? I know you do this a lot.  
JOHN CALIPARI: One of the things I tell these guys all the time is I've done
this 30 years so there's nothing I haven't seen or there's nothing that you're
going to do that I haven't had to dealt with. I've done it 35 years.  
  
But what you find out, when we struggled, there was a look in their eye of
fear. And you learn that they're 18- and 19-year-old kids who don't know what
the future holds and are looking to me to help them.  
  
When we lost four in a row, again, they were Tennessee, Auburn -- they were
all NCAA tournament teams that we lost to. Three of them on a road. Normal
teams would have lost four in a row. We had a chance to beat a couple of them.
We had a chance with Tennessee, we could have beaten Auburn on the road.  
  
I got a text from one of the guys, Coach, we need you more than ever now. And
it kind of told me that they're looking at me like, What is this? We need you.
Don't, like, jump ship on us and don't give up on us. And it got me to then
sit back and say at my age losing four in a row is difficult. And I stepped
back and said, What am I worried about how I feel? I've got these kids that
have never experienced this. And I have.  
  
And so it just led me to understand sometimes I get away with they're big and
they're long and they're athletic and they're men. No, they're not. They're
young men. They need this experience. For them to grow they needed to fail,
this team. I had them raise their hand, How many of you -- and I called it a
crap hole -- you go down that crap hole and you're fighting to get out? In
other words, you can't make a shot, you can't make a play, you stink. And
every one of them raised their hand, at one point in the season they were down
in that hole. And they had to figure out how to come back out of it without
being enabled.  
  
Because people enable them. It's not you. It's always somebody else. It's the
story of the marching band, that's a hundred-member marching band in unison,
and 99 turn right and your child turns left and you say, What's wrong with
those 99? These things, it's hard when they go down there because they are so
young that they have to say, This is me, and I've got to get myself out of it.
They needed to fail.  
  
They also needed to fail as a team because we weren't coming together. We
weren't playing it for each other. We had more turnovers than assists, because
everybody was trying to make plays for themselves. But they had to have the
adversity.  
  
And I kept saying, even when I evaluate players, I want to know how he plays
when it's not going good, because if he comes with me to Kentucky there are
times it's not going to be right because the other team's playing like it's a
Super Bowl. And it's a sold-out arena, and they're trying to make their name
at our expense. How do you play when things don't go right?  
  
These kids needed it. It's a great group of kids and their parents who have
entrusted me with their sons, good people, and we've been able to survive it.  
  
Q. Given the nature of this weekend, four-game tournament, you've got to
look ahead a little bit, too. Could you talk about a preliminary scouting
report on Arizona, particularly Deandre Ayton?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, first of all, I'm telling all of you, I didn't know where
we were seeded until I got in my car after the SEC tournament and my phone
started bouncing I was getting so many hits. And then everybody said the same
thing: They did it to you again. You're in a pod that's ridiculous.  
  
And so I know the four teams here, Buffalo and Arizona, Davidson, and us.
That's all. I know Virginia is above us. I don't know who is playing Virginia.
I don't know who else is in our bracket. And I have not looked at another
bracket and won't, could care less.  
  
You're asking me to look ahead? They have good players, a great coach. They've
got veteran guys. They have a possible No. 1 pick with great size. They're
great. Buffalo is good and has had a great year.  
  
And when I tell these guys -- and again, I've done this in this tournament, I
don't know, maybe 20 times, whatever it is, you can't look ahead because a lot
of times you look ahead and the team you're worried about doesn't even
advance. And you spent three days, My god, we're going to have to -- they got
beat. Who am I worried about now?  
  
So I'd rather not move ahead and I'll just stay with the game we've got at
hand, which is going to be very difficult for us to win.  
  
Q. After you lost to Florida at the end of the season and it was not a
good performance, and then Vanderbilt goes out. Were you surprised at how well
your team played at the SEC tournament, putting three straight really good
performances together?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, I knew they were capable of it. But when you say the
Florida game, here was the lesson: I told them prior to the game, when you
play a noon game -- again, I've done this a number of years -- the team that
is more ready to play usually wins the game. If both teams are really ready it
will come down to the last minute. But if one team is more ready at noon, the
other team will let go of the rope. And that's what happened to us. Again,
it's an experience they had to have.  
  
Now tell me, two of the games we played in the tournament were at what time?
Noon. They learned their lesson. Everything here that we've been going through
is like an experience for them to grow. They've not been through anything. I'm
a little worried them walking on to this court. I've tried to build the whole
season towards this, talk about the NCAA tournament all season, but I really
don't know. I have no idea what will happen.  
  
I know we're prepared. I know they're in a great frame of mind. I know I've
got great kids. But this is going to be an unbelievably good execution team.
Do we have the discipline to stay in this dance with 25 seconds each time down
and talk and move? I don't know. But I knew what this team was capable of. I
kept trying to paint that picture in their mind. This is what we are when
we're at our best.  
  
Q. Back to the teams you might face, and I do appreciate that you're not
looking ahead. You gave a broad summary of what Arizona could do that might
concern you. Could you do the same for Buffalo, please?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, because here's what I would say: The only reason I've said
that about Arizona, I have not watched them play a game this year. And I have
not watched Buffalo. I just happen to know a couple of the guys that Sean has.
I haven't watched either team play. I don't know if they play man, zone. I
won't watch any tape on any team until I'm done with this Davidson game. And
the reason is, is if Davidson beats us, why was I watching any other tape? So
I literally don't know a play they run, either team.  
  
Q. The climate of college basketball right now with the FBI
investigation going on, what changes would you like to see being made,
considering you've been in homes with star athletes and the families and the
environments that they come from?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, I'm going to ask you to maybe go back and look at what
I've said in the past. I've been saying the same thing for how many years, you
Lexington guys, four, five, six years. And I haven't changed. And I believe
it. I believe that for college kids, this is an unbelievable experience to
have a gap year if they need it. I think kids should be able to go from high
school to the NBA. I do believe that. But I don't think we should devalue
education. And if the kids do go, so there's 10 that go, 12, why would we
totally change all this?  
  
We just had the highest graduation rate of athletes in basketball and African
American athletes in basketball. We just had the highest graduation rate in
the history of our sport. And we're going to upset this? You devalue education
if you encourage kids. And who are we encouraging? What kids? Are we
encouraging don't worry about education, you don't need education, you become
a pro. So let's say 10,000 9th and 10th graders say, I'm not going to do
education, and who are we talking about? This isn't baseball. This is a
different sport. This isn't tennis. This is a different sport. You don't need
education.  
  
So when I tell you that we've had the highest graduation rate of African
American athletes in basketball, how many of those kids do you think went to
school thinking they're staying one or two years? 90 percent. And they ended
up finishing and getting a college degree.  
  
We've just got to make sure we're taking care of kids. I don't want to get
into it, because this is about this NCAA tournament, but there are things that
we can do to have a combine after the junior year to recommend, you need to go
to the NBA, the rest of you need to go to college. Do we need a basketball
rule? Why? If these 15, 18 kids went to the NBA and the others go to college
they're going to have to stay two or three years or they would have gone to
the NBA. So we don't need all that.  
  
If some kid like Anthony Davis grows from 6-3 to 6-11 and he wants to leave
after a year, okay. What's wrong with that? How do we support these families?
I didn't want to do this, but now that you've got me started. How do you
support these families? I'm in these homes. These families have dignity, they
don't want anybody involved in their lives, they want to do it themselves. But
if you look in that refrigerator and there's a can of corn in there, they may
take something. But if they can do it themselves, they'll do it themselves.
Let them get loans. Let the kids that have loans for their insurance, which we
already give, if you're eligible for that insurance, then you don't need the
money there, we'll loan the money for your families to travel. If your family
wants to move to a town they can take a loan and do it. And then we eliminate
all this stuff.  
  
These families, again, they want their child to have the best opportunity.
They want their child to be with people they trust. And we've just got to help
them. I come back to this, any decision we make, if we say, Is this right for
the kids, you'll be right. If you don't worry about the kids and you worry
about the sport, you don't make the right decisions for the kids. And this is
all about the kids.  
  
I say this with all respect, a 17-year-old going to the D league, who's
overseeing them? What if something happens? Who's responsible now? What
happens for these kids that come to college? They'll tell you it's the best
experience ever. I've never heard a player say, man, what a great year I had
in the G league. Not one. Not one. But they'll come back and say my year at
Kentucky was the best year of my life.  
  
Well, why are we looking at one player and saying this is what college
basketball is? I do have a right to talk about academics, and you know you say
your kids leave early. 17 have graduated. We have a thousand on the APR for
four or five years running. It's us and Bucknell. Please look at that one
there that said when you do by academics it's Kentucky and Bucknell.  
  
Now, I will say Bucknell beats us, but we're right there, fighting hard. And I
just think that we can do stuff. But to say let's throw this stuff away
because of a couple of things, I just don't agree with it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 86  
  
North Carolina - 65  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: There's a hundred things I could say, and yet there's not a lot
to say. We got beat by a team that played better than we did. Got beat by a
team that the coach, head coach coached better than I did. These two guys up
here have given me so many thrills and taken me on so many unbelievable rides.
That's the overwhelming feeling that I have right now. It's one of sorrow and
sadness because we didn't play as well as we wanted to play. I didn't picture
it ending it like this. I pictured it ending with these guys having a huge
smile on their face, but that's not college basketball.  
  
I congratulate Billy and his club. I told him I was really happy for him
personally, and I meant that from the bottom of my heart. We had a difficult
time. We went about a 6-minute stretch there where I was just figuring it up
in the stat sheet we were 0-6 and three turnovers, 0-7 and three turnovers in
a 6-minute stretch from like 11 minutes down to 1137, down to 6-something and
five to six minute stretch there we weren't very good, and then we were
playing from behind. And I've done a poor job of getting these guys in what
they need to do at that point.  
  
So, it's -- again it's on me, but, you know, in coaching, you have some great,
great moments. You have some tough ones. These two guys right here
particularly been involved in some of the greatest moments I've ever had, and
right now I'm very appreciative for them and I can't -- I can't think of
anytime where I'm sadder. So, if you guys will ask the questions to the
players first so they can hustle on back and get showered, that would be
great.  
  
Q. Actually for both, as you guys know, fans are outpouring their love
for you guys and thanking you for the years that you played. Marcus Paige just
tweeted that, you know, he remembers you guys coming in as freshman, dancing
and yelling and arguing 24/7. He thanked you guys for what you've done for
UNC. What do you say to fans as your last time playing ball for UNC?  
JOEL BERRY II: I wish it wasn't my last time. I've had so much fun here and I
really felt like coming to North Carolina really turned my life around and
changed me into a young man. And I think that's the most important thing, and
just thinking about coming freshman year and, you know, with a short haircut
and not looking good on the court and then to now. I mean, I just got to thank
my teammates and thank my coaches for believing in me and having the
confidence in me. And like I said, just been a lot of fun. But, you know,
everybody sees what happens on the court, but, you know, the biggest thing for
our program is to -- well, for coaches to develop players and make -- get the
best out of them, but also, at the same time, make sure that he's continuing
the morals and values that our parents taught us when we were in high school.
And that was the biggest thing that my mom wanted Coach to do, and I think
that he did that for me. And so more than anything on the basketball court, I
appreciate Coach for doing that.  
  
THEO PINSON: I don't really know what to say. I didn't take any of this for
granted. I came in every day with a smile on my face, wanted everybody to have
a smile on their face, even on the lowest of lows when we were going through
stretches where we losing and always came in to try to be that spark as far as
putting a smile on everybody's faces. I know we don't have that right now, but
that's because the three up here are competitors. Everybody knows me, I'm --
I'm always smiling and stuff, but like this is tough but it's life.  
  
Q. Joel, you guys got off to a strong start and I believe was up 20 --
13. What changed after that and brought on the stretch that Coach was talking
about?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. At the start of the game, we were getting to the basket,
being aggressive, and that's what we wanted to do. And then we just started
settling for outside shots and, you know, the 3 wasn't going in, but every
time like we got the ball inside, we were getting some productive. And then on
the offensive end, on the defense end for us, their big guys got going and it
was just tough. It was tough to stop them and go shoot and outside shot and
miss and come back down and get the ball inside and shoot it right at the
basket. I think we just stopped being aggressive after we got the lead, and
that's why everything turned around.  
  
Q. Roy, I apologize if this is repetitive, just back --  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Does it feels, guys -- I was asking your teammates, they all said it
feels less like the end of a season and more like the end of an era with you
guys walking out. Does it feel that way for you as well?  
THEO PINSON: Just tough because me and Joel, we're the type of guys who really
try to bring joy to everybody and we hope we did that. It wasn't like we was
trying to. We just being ourselves. I want people to know that. It's like hope
nobody thinks this was an act. This is me like. I want everybody to have a
good time, enjoy the moment. Probably the main reason I'm not crying right now
is because I've enjoyed every single moment I had with Coach, Joel, and all my
teammates in the past, teammates in the locker room right now, just -- that's
the hardest thing. I won't be able to get on a plane with them, five hours to
L.A. to spend more time with them. It's over. That's the toughest part. It's
tough.  
  
Q. Just in the locker room talking to Andrew and Brandon Robinson,
Kenny, and some of the guys. They were talking about what they learned from
you guys, seeing you kind of grow -- some of them just one year, some two
years, seeing you guys grow and develop to become what you were going into
this weekend. Do you guys have an understanding of how much you've taught
these other guys, how much you passed on to them these last couple of years
from work ethic to competing and all that kind of stuff?  
JOEL BERRY II: For me personally, I just tried to get them to understand that
you got to put in the time and the work to be able to get what you want out of
being at this program. And, you know, it's hard coming in as a freshman and
trying to adjust to being on your own and trying to just being away from home
and learning how to be an adult. Not everyone can do that. And, you know, you
got freshman year I kind of took it for granted a little bit. Once I started
realizing that I had to put in the time and it's what I love to do, I had to
put in time for it. And that's when everything turned around for me. Hopefully
more than anything, I just hope I can leave for those guys that, you know, if
they want to get the best out of what they want to do, you have to put in the
time and the effort out of anything. That's what I want to leave here and
hopefully they can take that from me.  
  
THEO PINSON: Yeah. Like I said before, Coach -- like I said on senior night,
he let me be me. Learned how to -- as far as when it's game time, I know the
time and place when I need to be serious and the time where I can play around
little bit just to keep everybody loose. I mean, that's not -- hasn't been
that way since I've been here. As y'all say, we always loose. We won a
national championships last year, probably as loose we've ever been. Just have
fun playing the game. That's the biggest thing I try to teach the young guys,
have fun playing the game and play for each other and the coaching staff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel and Theo, thank you. Congratulations on a great year and a
great career. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the attachment to players is beyond evident. Talk about how
this program is bigger than basketball, because even after they graduate they
always gravitate back towards you. It's evident this program is much bigger
than what's on this court. Can you talk about the bond that you built with
these guys?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I hope it is. It's my dream, that's my goal. Best time as a
coach is when you see your players accomplish something. It was really
difficult to see the look on their faces. There's nothing better than that.
Nobody has got any job anywhere anytime that's better than the feeling I have
at those moments.  
  
I do try to coach the game of basketball, but I do try to tell them it's part
of life too. I told them it's the most inadequate feeling I ever felt. Feel it
all the time, last game of the year. I think I felt it more today than any
other time. I'm not ashamed to say I love these kids and if you only had any
idea how much fun that they have been for me, and three of the last four years
have been very difficult and those kids were my salvation. They really were.
Things were not pleasant. I didn't like what people were saying to me. Didn't
like what they were saying about me. I didn't like getting a piece of mail
that was addressed to "Mr. Cheating Bastard." Those kids in the court -- on
the court, excuse me, were my salvation and you have no idea how much fun that
was. And I don't want to be too dramatic, but that was hard for a long time
there and those kids really, really made my day everyday. And I've been the
luckiest man alive because I had kids that made me feel like what I said was
halfway important and, you know, when I was a younger coach, you guys know me,
shoot, I can cry at the drop of a handkerchief. I dropped it just a minute ago
trying to wipe something away.  
  
I had a writer one time say that, you know, I guess we're going to watch Roy
cry today. I told that sucker, "Don't tell me that to my face." He ran his ass
out of the room quickly, too. That doesn't bother me in the least bit.  
  
If you're coaching and you try to give them something that can stick with them
forever. That's always been really important to me. It's corny but that's
always been really important.  
  
Q. Coach, how often do you think of retirement?  
ROY WILLIAMS: The last 30 minutes (laughter). You know, I don't do that, guys.
I think about the next practice, the next game. One of my best friends in the
world, Jerry Green, asked me when I was Coach Smith's assistant, what's your
five-year or ten-year plan. I said never have one, never will have one. I try
to coach and do the best I can today and hopefully get a chance to do the same
thing again tomorrow. I realize I'm 67. I can't run up and down the sidelines,
I can't get out and demonstrate like I used to. And I wasn't a very good
player, but I could demonstrate what I wanted to. No, I don't think about
that. I think about jumping off the top of the building right now, but I don't
think of retirement.  
  
Q. Coach, how much satisfaction do you get out of watching two guys like
that grow and mature and pass that on to the younger guys, the way they were
just talking about in the locker room?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I get satisfaction out of that. I got a lot more satisfaction
out of them talking about those things last year after we won, too. But I want
to give them some things. My high school coach, you coach a guy and you see
some things you gave him 30 minutes later. It's your job to make sure it's
something positive. That's me.  
  
But I have a desperate -- probably not a good word -- I have a desperate
desire to win and to see the looks on their faces and in that locker room as
opposed to what I looked at a few moments ago.  
  
Q. Roy, why did their zone bother you so much? And when they weren't in
it in the second half, did that surprise you a little bit?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it bothered us a great deal, and I was surprised because
we've handled some pretty good zones pretty well and we've shot the ball
really well. I've always talked to you guys about having great balance. I
thought that was the most important thing on the offensive end is being able
to score inside and out. We've been way too far to the perimeter shot. Every
big game in the NCAA Tournament every game gets a little bigger. Last year
people thought it was an ugly game and it was if the only thing you care about
is a field goal percentage. You're playing for the National Championship,
there's a little pressure on the kids and perhaps my guys got a little more
pressure today than I wanted them to have because we had a basketball -- being
a basketball player at North Carolina carries some responsibility with it and
-- no, you go back and look. I don't know that anybody has really hurt us with
the zone. We didn't change anything last 48 hours. When the shots didn't go in
early, I really jumped on them because we had never gotten the basketball
inside and go 1-13 from 3 and then miss a wide open one the first or second
possession of the second half and they make two of them. It's hard to keep the
guys up.  
  
Q. Roy, your last answer sort of gives me a couple of questions. The
first one being, when you talk about the pressure that a Carolina basketball
player is feeling today, are we talking about a pressure that comes from
within or are we talking about a pressure that came from Texas A &M?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Oh, I was talking about pressure comes from within. If we lose
two games, people jumping off the boat and think we're about to go whacko or
something. We stayed the course pretty much the whole time. There is, we've
won. I like that pressure. People ask me does it bother me. Hell, there's no
person ever -- my boss is sitting right down there and Chancellor, they've
never put any pressure on me like I put on myself. No, I think you feel a
responsibility. I feel -- I feel a tremendous responsibility to be successful,
yes, but I do it to myself.  
  
Q. The dynamics that affected the game today, did you see Texas A &M --
did you find that their size affected you?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You watched the game. They blocked 70,000 shots. Come on now. It
was a more difficult game for us inside, which we knew, but, let's make sure
we don't do one thing, let's just don't say North Carolina screwed this up or
North Carolina didn't do that. Texas A&M is pretty doggone good. They did some
good things. What they did to us inside early in the game shocked us even
though we knew they were good, because it shocked us because we weren't making
outside shots and now all of a sudden I felt like I had kids looking at the
scoreboard tonight more than I ever had kids in my life. Let's make sure we
give Texas A&M credit, too.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up on that. Roy, did it feel like yesterday you saw a
little bit of this coming in terms of the matchup for you guys and their size?
I'm sure you take no solace in being right. It did seem like their interior
play got the best of you.  
ROY WILLIAMS: They did. We've beaten people up over the years and the tables
were reversed today. We've been able to mask the problem all year long by
making enough jump shots and getting to the free throw line, doing some
things. We weren't able to do that today. Joe, you see probably most of the
games if not all the games this year. I'd say probably the only game where
somebody just dramatically handled us inside or maybe at a higher level, but
they were good.  
  
I tried to recruit Tyler Davis early and Robert Williams. Nobody jumps any
higher and blocks more shots. I still think that Garrison, Sterling, Huff and
Walker, they are -- those guys are going to be good players. I said a couple
of times the last couple of weeks that the kind of guys we have, when they're
juniors, sophomores, I'll say because that means next year, too, sophomores,
juniors, seniors, they're able to handle some of the more gifted freshmen.
Well, today they had guys that weren't gifted freshmen. Tyler and Robert have
been around awhile. I think our guys are going to be good, but today was a
fear. I guess we dodged it quite a bit all season long.  
  
Q. Coach, you play in a tough conference, one of the toughest
conferences in America, and last week you had a grueling week getting all the
way to the Championships game. Then you have to come back and do it again. Do
you think that ever takes a toll on your team or maybe the teams in the
conference based on what happened to Virginia and what happened to y'all
today?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, I don't know. Maybe because I'm not that deep a
thinker, but I didn't think we were -- we had fresh attitude or fresh legs,
either one today. I told them I hate some things about summer basketball. I
love other things because it gives kids a chance to be seen and far more
positive than they are negative. I watched a game one time where one of my
guys I eventually got made one of the stupidest blankety blankety plays before
the end of the game and they lose. They come over and Coach says all right
guys, grab your stuff, we're on court 3 in one hour. I don't like that because
winning by God is important. If you make mistakes I want you to feel badly
about it. It's more teaching and training, but I did feel like -- and one of
the coaches even said they were acting like it's a summer league game. We got
another game in an hour or so.  
  
I don't have an answer for why we didn't feel like we were at a high level
physically. I don't have an answer for why we didn't feel like we were at a
high level mentally. But I thought they had much more a workmanlike attitude
than we did and really pretty early in the game. And that's my thought as a
Coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Thank you, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 18, 2018

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Xavier Sneed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34871)

### [Barry Brown Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34873)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 50  
  
UMBC - 43  
  
BRUCE WEBER: You know, can't say enough about our guys. Just so proud of them.
I know it was an ugly win and probably hard to watch, but they're perseverance
we talked about, their courage, and just it's gutsy. We just kept saying we
weren't scoring, but we kept guarding, we're still winning. And I don't know
if we lost of the lead the whole second half, but, you know, we talked about
being the best defensive team in the tournament. I guess 59-43 are pretty good
numbers against two really high-powered offensive teams. And then down the
stretch, we didn't have many big plays during the game, but down the stretch
obviously Xavier made some big plays, the tip on, the pull up jumper. Kam had
a little jumper. Barry made a big pull-up jumper. Mark got a layup, several
blocks down the stretch. You know, Xavier had some steals. The steal was
probably the big thing. I think it was one and Xavier cut the middle, got the
steal, drove down and got the dunk, got the 3, and I don't know, they might
only scored one basket after that.  
  
You know, I just, again, go back to their character, their courage and
persistence and they bought in, they care about each other, and, you know,
couldn't be more proud we're going to the Sweet 16.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for Xavier and Barry.  
  
Q. Barry, have you ever been in that hard of a fought game?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, yeah, I've been in some tough games where maybe we
didn't come out the second half and execute like we did, but I think with our
guys the experience of having those losses, those tough losses, prepared us
for this moment right here, and were able to buckle down, stay poised and make
the big plays in the end.  
  
Q. The stats show that the defense was key, but there were probably have
dozen times, maybe more, where they came down with a chance to take the lead
and they never did. You guys really shut them down in critical moments. Talk
about that.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Well, I mean, we had a great scouting report knowing what
they did, and I think all the coaches collaborated on it. I think Cielo
(phonetic) took the head on it. We all bought in and we all watched our
matchups and watched improvement, everyone because we knew we'd be switching a
lot this game. Down the stretch, I mean we buckled down and got some stops.
They had most opportunities, like you said, to take the lead and we were able
to fly around. Even when things broke down, we flew them down and contested
every shot and boxed out.  
  
Q. X, the steal and dunk, did that kind feel like the break-through
moment when you guys shook it loose and finally felt like were you getting
control of it?  
XAVIER SNEED: Definitely. Got the steal and dunk, like you said, and just gave
us a lot of energy and that boost to show us we could win this game, and we
pulled through and got the win.  
  
Q. Barry, I'm just wondering if you can talk about -- if you could go
through the challenge that Lyles presented. And you have to feel pretty happy
with how you contained him defensively today.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Yeah. Like I said, we all watched our matchups and I knew
that was going to be my matchup for most of the game. I watched him. As soon
as I found out we were going to play them, I started watching at 1:00 a.m.,
seeing what he did and seeing what he liked to pick his shots and how the team
gets him open: He's a good player, a plethora of moves and ways of scores and
get to the basket and ways to get his shot off. But I mean, it wasn't just me,
like I said, we did a lot of switching. My teammates contained him as well. We
had each other's back when he got into the lane, didn't let him really get
going all game.  
  
Q. X, if you can believe this, a lot of us never had a dunk in this
crowd. Can you walk us through kind of the process of how you know it's going
to come off and finishing that process.  
XAVIER SNEED: I'm always crushing the glass. Somebody didn't box me up. I saw
the shot go up and did the play with the rest of it.  
  
Q. Barry, this is, you know, two games in three days and you have shut
down a couple of the most dynamic scorers that you're going to find in the
tournament. Can you describe the feeling of satisfaction you have when you do
something like this, you know, is it a point of pride?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, I take a lot of pride in my defense personally. My
coaches know that. They trust me and my teammates trust me to guard the best
guard on each team every game, night in, night out. I mean, I guess they see
the work I put in and the watching the film on them and stuff like that. Plus
the scouting report we're going to have every time to let me know some of the
other stuff that they do. And I mean it's a credit to my coaches and teammates
for having my back and trust me to guard the best player.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: When I get it, I'm happy. I hold them to 4 of 15, I think
that's pretty good. Like I said, my teammates have my back. It wasn't just me,
really all of us containing him and stopping him in the lane when he got to
the lane. He hit some big shots down the stretch. For the most part we
contained him enough to the to let him score in bunches.  
  
Q. Both players, can you just describe the feeling of knowing you've
gotten this far and going to the Sweet 16 and also how did Coach Weber hair
get to be like it is?  
BRUCE WEBER: It's real.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: I'm still taking it all in right now to be in the Sweet 16. It's
been a long time since we've been there, first time under Coach Weber here.
Just a great feeling.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, hats off to Coach, man, hats off to our whole
coaching staff and all the players, all the hard work we put. Been a long time
coming, and I'm just taking it all in like X said. And it's surreal to be in a
position that we are, but I mean with the work we put in, we deserve it and
we're going to show what we can do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take credit for his hair.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We had a little pool party in the locker room (laughter).  
  
Q. Barry, when you were having the defensive moment with Maura when he
started hitting 3s, you ended up coming with a steal that led to kind of a
momentum change. Can you tell me about the excitement when you get a change
like that, what takes place in your mind?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I'm not really sure exactly what play, but I mean just
getting the steal, I know he was hitting a few 3s kind of in the same spot
almost and they kind of had the momentum, but getting it still, kind of
shifted the momentum. I remember kind of going back and forth with each other
a little bit. At that time I kind of knew we kind of had them a little bit. We
were flying around and I think it was frustrating them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Two more questions.  
  
Q. Barry, what was the problem with your offense? I mean you didn't
shoot real well. Was it them or were you guys just cold tonight?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I think we were a little bit cold tonight. They had a great
defensive scheme for us, but I think it was execution and just being -- have a
little bit too many jitters, kind of playing me ball, 1 on 1 and not executing
like the Coach drew the plays up. Over the course of the game, we started
buying in a little bit more and staying poised, control ourselves and
executing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more question for the student-athletes. Anyone interested?
Okay, guys, thanks. Head back to the locker room. Congratulations, keep it
going. Good luck to you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When we talked to you yesterday, I don't know how much you had seen
UMBC or broke them down or talked to your players about them. What did you
have to say to them kind of to make sure they knew they were playing an
opponent that was dangerous and could get after them a little bit, one they
hadn't heard of maybe before?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think if it didn't get their attention that they beat Virginia
by 20, the number 1 team in the ACC, in the conference, that they won the
conference and the tournament that had the most teams in the tournament, it
had to catch their attention. I told you guys yesterday, I called them back
about midnight and we had a little meeting and I just said guys, one, I joked,
I told you Virginia wasn't very good; and then, two, I said this other team is
really good and -- I thought we forced some things early, they jumped on us,
7-0, guys trying to make plays, you know. It was a big game for our guys and,
you know, then we settled down and grinded it out. We got lots of stops after
that 7-0 run. Finally got the lead. Kept the lead at halftime. All we talked
about at halftime was positive energy, you know, stay the course, keep doing
what we do, we got to keep guarding. And then -- in the huddles I kept saying
somebody step up and make a play. And you know Xavier stealing the dunk, the
tip dunk. Kam hit the little pull up, Barry hit a pull up. Cartier got a
steal. And Mak blocked a couple shots in that stretch, and there was a lot of
big plays, and, you know, they're good kids. They really care. They want to do
well and they just stayed the course, and you can't be more proud of them.  
  
Q. Bruce, Barry clearly does not like to talk about himself and his
performance. So could you please speak to the effort that he turned in and how
he ought to feel about it?  
BRUCE WEBER: Yeah. I said since the beginning of the season, he's if not the
best defensive player -- Carter is really good at West Virginia in the Big 12.
You know, maybe one of the best in the country. He takes a lot of pride in it.
He's got a lot of confidence. When he was a freshman, I said who is going to
be our defensive stopper? I would hoping some of the older guys would step,
you know, up and Barry said I am. He's taken on that role. He got crocked a
little bit when he was young. But now he studies the game. To do what he did
to Marcus Foster the overnight is -- it takes energy, it takes courage, but it
also takes being a student of the game. And he knew where he was going.  
  
You know, Lyles is so dynamic, can score in a lot of ways. Got him on the 3.
The other part with Barry he was so tired. He was so, so tired and he kept
fighting it. And we were asking him to make plays on offense, make his free
throws, guard the best guys. You know, he just grinded it out, gutted it out,
and, you know, he's been our leader. When you have great leadership and guys
that care, it makes it so easy for the coaches.  
  
Q. Coach, every time we ask something like this, you always praise the
players and talk about it's for them. I know that's sincere. I'll try it one
more time. For you what does this win mean?  
BRUCE WEBER: Again, I'm happy for these guys because they worked so hard. I
threw this at them way back in April last spring. I said guys, we won a game.
The next step is to get to the Sweet 16. I threw it at them a couple weeks
ago. Again, just put that little vision in there. You know, just obviously we
didn't think 16 was going to make -- beat a 1. You thought it would be a
little different situation, but we just said we could write history tonight.
No 9 has ever beaten a 16 to go to the Sweet 16, so we wrote our own history
tonight. They wrote history the other day. And, you know, our staff an
unbelievable job. I challenge them. I've told you guys my most -- one of my
most disappointing losses was LaSalle for Rodney, for Shane, all those guys, I
didn't think they prepared, I didn't think we did as good a job as we would
should. We had our chances down the stretch, but it was so disappointing and I
just -- I challenged our coaches. They were up till 6:00 yesterday morning. I
went to bed about 4:00, tried to go to bed at 4:00. And they did a great job
and Barry talked about it. They buy into the scouting report, they believe our
coaches. They all had part of it.  
  
So, between the coaches, the players, it's just a nice reward and for our
fans, too. It's great. They all -- always talk about Jacob Pullen going to the
Sweet 16. We got another group that did it without our best player, and I
think you talk about that. That's pretty good that they were able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, was there any point in the second half when you felt the
pressure was getting to your guys, because this was a team that wouldn't go
away. Did you feel like they were feeling a little bit of the pressure of the
world against them?  
BRUCE WEBER: Big thing we tried to do, stay in the huddle, stay confident and
poised. No matter how dumb we played or how bad we played, I just kept saying
we're fine guys, we're still winning, keep guarding and somebody step up and
make some plays and we did down the stretch and we didn't execute a whole
bunch.  
  
You know, the thing you guys, you got to realize, in less than a week we had
to change schemes that we've run for five months. And Xavier sometimes he'll
look at me, I'll call something. He goes, "Coach, I don't know." So in the
middle of the play I have to yell something else. Even today we stayed at
shoot-around about an hour and a half because they kept saying, "Coach, I got
to know the out-of-bounds plays, I got to know this." Even the other guys, not
only Xavier but now you put Kam, Cardy, and Barry together, they haven't run
all the stuff. So, sometimes we looked a little ugly but they found a way to
win.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the unpredictability of a 16 beating a 1.
Obviously that's never happened before this weekend. This will be the first
regional ever where there's no top 4 seeds in Atlanta next weekend.  
BRUCE WEBER: Is that where we're going?  
  
Q. Yes. From that standpoint --  
BRUCE WEBER: I haven't looked at it. I'm being honest.  
  
Q. From that standpoint, what is it about this tournament that just
lends to this or the sort of unpredictability?  
BRUCE WEBER: We told the guys before, look at today alone, Michigan State,
North Carolina at home, basically at home losing today. You know, just shows
the balance in the tournament, the vulnerability ability of every team. You
got to come to play. You got to stay away from injuries. Obviously Virginia
gets an injury, Purdue has and injury, we have an injury. So many injuries
down the stretch here. It's what makes March Madness special and it kills the
coaches because it's so hard and you think you have a great team. Matchups are
important. Making the plays, having the right mojo at the right time. And, you
know, again, why does everyone watch it? It's March Madness and you never know
what's going to happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 50  
  
UMBC - 43  
  
RYAN ODOM: Obviously congratulations to Coach Weber and Kansas State. I
thought they played excellent defense, you know, throughout the game. Their
athleticism bothered us at times and their switching certainly early in the
game in the first half throughout the first half. I thought we were kind of a
little bit stagnant on the offensive end. We were standing a little bit too
much and they had a lot to do with that. They were switching and staying --
keeping their bodies in front of us.  
  
In the second half we were fortunate to be down 5 actually at half and we felt
like we hadn't played very well, you know, amongst us in the locker room and,
you know, we came out in the second half. We felt like we had a pressure a
little bit more. Obviously we had some success there. We felt like we had to
move the ball and move our bodies a whole lot more than we did in the first
half on offense, and our guys certainly did that. We tried to get multiple
drives into the paint, felt like we did that. And felt like we got some good
shots, you know. When it was 38-37 Jairus went down the lane and got a shot
that he's made a zillion times for us all year and just didn't go down. Wasn't
meant to be there.  
  
But, you know, nothing can take away this -- this loss can't away what these
kids, these two in particular and obviously the rest of our team has been able
to accomplish, you know, throughout this entire season. Certainly in the NCAA
Tournament, just to be here is a blessing for sure. I wrote one word on the
board for these guys, you know, once we got into the locker room at the end
about how I felt about them and just proud, you know, just very proud of these
kids and what they've been able to do as the representatives that they are for
our university and just captured our country and beyond, to be honest, from a
sporting perspective and it's really, really neat to see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for Jairus and K.J.  
  
Q. Jairus, can you talk about what K-State's defense did to slow you
down, both you personally and the team.  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think they did a good job of speeding us up. We had a lot of
turnovers. But for the most part I felt like we got open shots. We didn't make
any shots today. It happens some games. Unfortunately it happened today. I
felt like for the most part we got open shots.  
  
Q. Either student. Despite this loss, do you guys still see the win in
all of this with the shoes from Steph Curry, like your coach said, the world
fell in love you and everyone was really cheering for you. So even though you
lost a really tough game, do you still see the bright spot in this?  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, I think we do. We put our name on the map. We giving hope to
teams that come to the tournament with lower seeds. I think we're giving hope
to guys that are not even that tall like me. So, people that feel like they
underdogs in their life, I think we given the hope to everything they want to
do in life.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah. Of course we had a great season. We made history the other
night. But we wanted to win tonight. We felt like we had a good chance of
winning, but unfortunately we lost. But I felt like overall we understand that
what we did the other night, we understand we had a great season. We did the
unexpected. So, we're proud of each other for that.  
  
Q. I'm curious if there's any fatigue maybe in the second half? I think
you guys missed some free throws that you typically would make, some open
looks. Did that contribute to it at all?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I'm not going to make any excuses. I got to hit those free
throws. I missed a couple shots I usually make. Just, you know, just one of
those days.  
  
Q. The world was looking at you as Cinderella, but I don't think you
guys looked at yourself that way. How did you -- when did you figure out that
it wasn't going to happen? Looked like you were mentally into it the whole
game.  
K.J. MAURA: I think we never lost confidence in ourselves even when they had a
little run and 5-point lead. Still the mentality we're going to win the game.
We didn't execute it down the stretch.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Like he said, we didn't execute enough. We didn't make enough
plays down the stretch to win. We had a couple chances to take the lead with
about I think two minutes left, or two, three minutes left. But we didn't make
shots, like I said before. And they made shots, timely shots. I think they hit
two buzzer-beaters basically at the end of the shot clock and put them up
about 4 points or 5 points.  
  
Q. How would you describe how different your preparation was the past 48
hours given everything you guys had to deal with from anything you've
experienced before? And secondly, did maybe some of that take a little bit out
of you heading into the game?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I mean we knew coming into this tournament that every team we
were going to play was going to be a high major given our seed. So we knew we
had to prepare for bigger people, bigger players, bigger guards, bigger big
men. We knew it was going to be a tough task anytime we stepped on the floor.  
  
Q. K.J., looked like it was about 9 seconds left when y'all got subbed
out of the game. Not only hugging your reserves but hugging the K-State
players. What went into that moment and kind of what that meant to you?  
K.J. MAURA: I think it was mutual respect. It was a good game. We played hard,
both teams played hard. The guard from Kansas State came out, good people from
Baltimore, too. So we had a good relationship. We was talking during the whole
game. They good kids, good guys. I think we got a little emotional, but it was
just encouraging them to make it happy and make a run in the tournament.  
  
Q. I know it's currently Spring Break, but eventually you'll go back to
campus and everyone else will be there. What kind of reception do you hope for
and what kind of reception do you anticipate?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Well, our fans traveled a long way these past few days to come
support us. We've had a tremendous support from our fans all year, people at
the school. I expect them to be very happy with us when we get back, proud of
us. But, you know, of course we wanted to go into the next round. It didn't
happen that way. I expect a warm welcome.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, I expect them to be really proud for what we've done. I
expect a lot of happiness, lot of smiles around campus. I think we've been
given that from the support of the fans came here a long way to see us. That
means a lot for us, and I really expect a lot of smiles when we come back.  
  
Q. Coach, the guys in the locker room were saying --  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first.  
  
Q. I'm sorry. I missed the opening.  
When you guys look back on your time at UMBC and in five years from now, is
this going to be the thing that stands out the most to you or what will you
think about the most?  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: I got here, when I got here first we were a 4-win team that
year, and then the next year we went on to win 7 games. And then Coach Odom
and his staff came in, we won 21 games and this year we had a tremendous
season. This is definitely one of the biggest memories we remember for life.
So, yeah.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think the biggest moment for us was Jairus Lyles's shot against
Vermont. Nothing can top that. But we really enjoyed ourselves after the
Virginia game. I think it was something that nobody expected. Just us inside
the locker room, we expected to win. Outside of ourselves nobody thought we
were going to win. I think both moments are really big for us and it's going
to live forever for UMBC.  
  
Q. Jairus, a lot of people have been comparing you to C.J. McCollum as
far as his play with Lehigh and what he had done with Duke. How do you feel
about that comparison?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Anytime you can compare it to a NBA player as great as he is,
it's a blessing. There's more work to be done. Hopefully I can play in that
league one day. So, you know, it's always a blessing to be compared to a great
NBA player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: You can head back to the locker room. Congratulations on a
great year and great career. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The guys were saying that you told them after the game about friend
of yours in Rome and another in Korea that couldn't stop talking about UMBC.
Obviously the upset win puts you guys on the map. Why do you think that people
resonated with this team or fell in love with them?  
RYAN ODOM: Certainly we were picked -- we were a 16 seed. I think that's where
it all started. When you began to watch this team and how they played, they
play with passion, they play with heart, they play together, you know, which
what is we say when we put our hands in the huddle every time.  
  
We do things together for one another, and obviously when you have a big win
like that and it's so shocking, you know, people love to see that. They love
to see the upset. And our guys handled it with grace and understood the
circumstances. They weren't pounding their chests or anything. They expected
to be here and expected to compete, no different than they did tonight. And
just didn't go our way tonight and Kansas State deserved to win.  
  
But, I'm just really proud of the way these guys handled themselves, you know,
on a daily basis. And from the moment we stepped on campus to now, you know,
the growth that I've seen in each one of them, you know, is monumental, really
special. I mean from a leadership standpoint, from just everything, how they
handle their business. I don't have to worry about very much with this crew.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously these guys hate to lose. You know them as well as
anyone. Do you think it will be easy for them to focus more on the good of the
season, what they did Friday, what they did against Vermont, versus what they
might feel as a missed opportunity by not having a good shooting night
tonight?  
RYAN ODOM: Absolutely. That's what we talked about in the locker room. We
couldn't really talk about that after the Virginia game because we had to play
Kansas State, you know, tonight. And but once your season ends, you know, you
can kind of reflect and look back at all things that happen throughout.  
  
I go back at the Albany game where we got pounded up there and the way -- like
it takes true character to come back from that and, you know, our guys were
able to do that collectively. Wasn't just one person. One person it wouldn't
have happened. You know, my staff, you know, was unbelievable. I have a great
staff and, you know, I'm just so proud of everybody involved in the program.
Because it could have gone down at that moment, and true character is
determined at moments like that when it's, you know, you're at your worst and
you got to answer the bell.  
  
These guys did that throughout the year.  
  
Q. As your starters left the game with 20 seconds to go or something,
lot of K-State players came over and talked to them. What did you see in that
moment? And I mean you don't see that a lot.  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I think exactly what K.J. said. You know, just a mutual
respect. I mean, I think I've heard from so many coaches around the country
that have texted and just been so excited for what has happened for these kids
and seeing them play the way that they played and, you know, over this
tournament and in our conference tournament. And, you know, I think the Kansas
State guys respected how hard our guys tried to win, and likewise we respected
how hard they tried to win and they got it done.  
  
Q. Coach, if you had a message to your fan base or just the whole
country about what you did here this weekend, what would that be?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, I mean just believe in yourself, you know. I think that's the
first thing, you know. People will tell you in life you can't do something and
if you believe them, then you won't. And these kids never wavered, you know,
throughout, and they believed that they could do this and they got it done.  
  
Q. Where do you feel like you lost of this game here tonight?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I think it certainly was the turnovers. We had way too many
turnovers. I couldn't tell you the last time we had 17 turnovers in a game.
K.J. having -- I think he had 6. He's immaculate with the ball. He had 6
turnovers in this game and credit Kansas State for knocking balls away and
having active hands and putting us in some positions that we didn't want to be
in.  
  
So I think it was there. Certainly the free-throw shooting was not what it
needed to be. This is really the first game that that's kind of really hurt
us. We have not been a good free-throw shooting team all year, not from lack
of working on it. But, you know, usually when Jairus gets up there or K.J.
gets up there, those guys shoot the ball really well from the free-throw line.
Even Jairus missed a few in the game today.  
  
Q. The wins obviously have been great, but when you kind of look back on
this particular group what are you going the take away the most from what they
gave you this season?  
RYAN ODOM: How much they gave for one another. Again, it's unselfish. That's
how I describe them. And, you know, Jairus really grew this year from a
leadership standpoint, him coming back. They had a goal. They wanted to win
the championships. They accomplished that. That's what I'm going to remember
most about them. They set out, you know, to win it and they got it done and
they did it through hard work. They did it through loving one another. They
did it through unselfishness and believing in one another. And, you know, that
shot will go down in history at Vermont. Lot of tears that day, everybody was
crying after that win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. So there's a lot of talk around campus about Jairus Lyles being
perhaps the best player in UMBC basketball history. What are your thoughts on
that?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. He's obviously right there. I mean all time -- the most wins
in school history, you know, he broke the single season scoring record. You
know, he's just been an amazing being, amazing player. And, you know, credit
to -- I think Thomas needs credit for this, too, the previous coach and his
staff. I didn't recruit Jairus and they got him to campus. They got him to
come to UMBC and the rest is history.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Back of the room.  
  
Q. Does your job in recruiting and getting people to know about UMBC
become any easier after this weekend?  
RYAN ODOM: Oh, no. We'll see. We have to -- we all have to go out and recruit,
all the universities, and try to get the best student-athletes that we can
get. UMBC is a unique place, you know. Lot of high achieving kids on campus,
and, you know, that's what we want. We want guys that want to be great, you
know, from a basketball perspective and want to play after college. But, at
the same time, we want folks that, you know, are highly motivated academically
that can -- you know, want to do great things past basketball. Because the air
goes out of the ball at some point for everybody and you don't want to have
the "oh boy, what now moment?"  
  
That's why UMBC is so great, you know. It transforms lives, you know. Our
president is right in there with the students. And it's not just the athletes,
it's everybody and, you know, it's a really neat thing to see.  
  
Q. Coach, your dad was telling a story last week about leading up to the
Virginia game, how were you a ball boy. He could remember you riding your bike
to John Paul Jones Arena as a kid when he was coaching. You talked about
sharing this with your team. But being around your parents over the last
couple of days, is there anything that you'll just kind of take with you
forever, whether it was a conversation or just a few minutes together? Is
there anything that stands out from just being able to share this with them?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. Certainly I love my mom and my dad to death. They're so
supportive. They believe in their sons, you know, obviously Lane and myself.
And, you know, they're just so supportive, but the hug after beating UVA was
very, very special. I'll say this, having dad at practice, you know, the last
couple of days has been really neat. He's so good around the kids, you know.
He jokes with them and they love having him around.  
  
Back in October they sang happy birthday to him at one of the practices
because he happened to be there on his birthday and they were messing with his
hair and all that. He's a funny, funny guy. He loves the game and he loves
kids. He loves to help kids and see them, you know, really, really do well.
And my mom is, as anybody will tell you, is the nicest lady on the entire plan
net.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. Ryan, while we're on the subject of connections like that, I'm
curious if you were able to look into the UMBC teammates of yours and what
that meant to you?  
RYAN ODOM: I wasn't able to pick everybody out. I had so many friends, guys
from Hampden-Sydney, guys from RJR that came to the game. It was really,
really special. Colleague teammates of mine and, you know, it's amazing that
we were this close, you know, that all of my close friends could be able to
come to the game and my wife's friends as well and my kids's friends, my
parents' friends, my brother's friends. It was a special, special weekend here
for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, Coach.  
  
RYAN ODOM: Okay. Thanks.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 86  
  
North Carolina - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from the Coach and take
questions first for the student-athletes.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Great win. Great team win. Great a performance from everybody. I
thought once we slowed them up in transition, our zone gave them some
problems. Fortunately they missed some shots. Did a good job of rebounding the
ball and taking care of the ball, especially in the first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tonny, specifically, for you, this is your second trip to the Sweet
16 in two years. What does this mean to you as a senior?  
TONNY TROCHA-MORELOS: Well, it mean a lot, my senior year, I wanted to do
something with the young guys. I mean I did this when I was a sophomore and
great feeling. I talked to the freshmen, it's nothing better than winning a
game in the NCAA Tournament. So it's really good feeling to keep dancing.  
  
Q. Tyler, how did y'all -- why do you think y'all are so dominant inside
and do you think you surprised them with the overall athleticism that y'all
had?  
TYLER DAVIS: We just stuck to the game plan, played to our strengths. We know
we have the advantage on the inside with most teams. We do what we do
everyday, go to the war on the inside and eat glass.  
  
Q. Other than statistically speaking, what did you guys have that UNC
didn't that gave you this dominant win? Whoever can answer.  
TYLER DAVIS: We had a certain togetherness today. We came out there from the
jump, I thought -- we didn't have the fastest start, but we were together the
whole time. We stuck together and got the W.  
  
Q. Tyler, seeing the way that this team performed on the perimeter, was
that something you noted that if you could make them pay beyond the arc that
it would end up turning the tide in your favor?  
TYLER DAVIS: I can't hear, I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Seeing the way they performed against Lipscomb and Coach Williams
noted the other day any team feeling less than confident about their perimeter
game, they need to play Carolina and everything opens. Is there something you
saw and were able to take advantage of that?  
TYLER DAVIS: We knew we would get open looks. I think we took advantage of our
opportunities. We did a great job of moving the ball, playing inside out,
getting great open looks and knocking them down.  
  
Q. For TJ and Admon, defensively you held them scoreless during a key
stretch in the first half, about the middle of the first half, about a
6-minute stretch there where they didn't score the basketball at all and
missed 8 field goals in a row. If you could take us through just defensively
the intensity out there in that key stretch that allowed you to build that
lead?  
TJ STARKS: Coach Kennedy, he preached defense. We knew today we was going to
play against a great offense team. We knew we was going to have to key in on
defense and lock-down, and we knew we wanted to win, we were going to have to
shut their players down at least a couple possessions, so that's exactly what
we did and we just got the win.  
  
ADMON GILDER: What TJ was saying, Coach Kennedy talked about going into this
game, only team that can really beat us is ourself. And then as you see we
played our brand of basketball, which we do on everyday basis. And so like DJ
got a couple steals early for us, Robert used his size and being able to block
shots. That's what we do, force teams to taking tough shots. And give North
Carolina credit, they're a great team, but.  
  
Q. I'm asking DJ, can you talk about early in the game Tyler dominated
inside and that seemed to open up your game in the perimeter game where really
the 3-point shots started falling.  
DJ HOGG: Our offense is inside out. We have the two best bigs in the country.
They draw double teams. Luckily they got the ball out and around and I was
ready to shoot, got it going.  
  
Q. Question for Tyler and DJ, how would you describe the way that upper
size and length had an impact on Carolina?  
DJ HOGG: Size and length. I think was more effort versus size and length. I
mean, because they were big, too, but we just focused on playing harder and
playing more together, staying connected. And then our size and length, I
guess, gave us an advantage, but I think it was more effort.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Definitely effort. We have great size, we did have great length.
I knew this game, I was going to have to work hard to keep their bigs off the
glass. And DJ and Rob and the other guys did a great job of contract the
glass, helping me out on the glass.  
  
Q. TJ or Tyler, both you guys, you guys are now the second team to make
history in Charlotte. UNC never lost a game in Charlotte prior to tonight. Did
you come in -- did know that coming in, or did your Coach talk to you about
that and how do you feel to be the second team to make history in Charlotte?  
TJ STARKS: I didn't know I was -- this is my first time on a --  
  
Could you repeat the question. My bad.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Carolina never -- in the first round. What is it like being a
part of this, beating Carolina for the first time here?  
  
TJ STARKS: It felt good. We was together, like we all said, we were together.
We came to play and ready the play from yesterday. We was talking about this
our whole life, our whole season, basically, so we was ready for the moment.
It is -- it was very challenging because, like I say, North Carolina, they're
a great team, play together, got great offensive threats, defensive threats.
We came together and got the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Historic because it's your first tournament.  
  
Q. Admon, I think that you guys probably expected from the very
beginning of the season that you would be a team that was capable of doing
this but it wasn't always there. Why do you think the team is what you
expected it to be finally now?  
ADMON GILDER: Because Coach Kennedy, he's done a great job of keeping us
altogether. We've been through so much as a team and he's always preached, you
know, staying connected, staying together. And so we got to give him the
credit. So he's been a day one, he's always talked to each one of us everyday
before practice. He's talked to us some of our leaders that we have today and
so he always adds different things, what we can do better as a team. So I can
say Coach Kennedy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Head back to the locker room. Congratulations.
Good luck to you. Questions now for Coach Kennedy.  
  
Q. Coach, you had three players with a double-double tonight. You had
place touch on the need for comradery, that need to stick together tonight. To
have that much on the glass as well as in scoring, what does that say about
this team?  
BILL KENNEDY: We shared the ball. I think we had 7 or 8, I don't know how many
assists we had in the first half. Moved the ball, talked about making one more
pass. Our goal was to defend the 3-point line and make them take tough 2s. You
block 8 shots, there's a lot of tough 2s. Our game plan worked. They didn't
shoot the ball well, we took them out of rhythm, took them out of transition,
and fortunately when they did get some open looks at the free throw line in
the first half against our zone, they missed some shots and -- that they
usually make. And you got to have some of that happen at this time of year to
continue to advance on. I don't think they played their best, but I think
fortunately we were able to get the win and hopefully we had something to do
with that.  
  
Q. That three-game losing streak in February, at that point in the
season, how worried were you about the direction of the season? How worried
were you about your job, and what did you have to do to get this team to
finish strong and play the way it's capable of playing?  
BILL KENNEDY: We always worry when you lose as a coach, and you always know
your job is in jeopardy when you lose games. And so -- I got tremendous faith
and know God has got my back. We never gave up. These guys bought into how we
needed to play and bought into some details that we weren't doing in that
stretch. And we lost I think 1-point game to Missouri. We lost a couple of
close games and really just had one game we didn't play well. But our biggest
problem was the beginning of the SEC play when we had two guys with knee
injuries, and that's where you want to be your best in the beginning of the
conference play, and we weren't our best at that point.  
  
Q. Your zone took them out of their rim rut in the first half,
obviously. Did you anticipate that they were going to go into halftime trying
to scheme the zone? Because you came out of it and didn't play it in the
second half and they just didn't seem to figure that out.  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, when they had certain lineups in the game, we wanted to
play zone. When they had certain lineups in the game, we played man.
Fortunately I think we rattled their confidence being up 14 at half here at
home, the pressure goes -- reverts back to them. And when they did trap us, we
got a couple of dunks. And when you get layups or make open 3s, we're tough to
beat when we make 3s all year. I don't know how many games we've lost when
we've made more than eight 3s. I don't know what our record is. You make ten
3s and have the post guys we have, we're tough to beat.  
  
Q. Coach, come out the second half, they got to start well to get back
in the game. It felt DJ may have played his best basketball since his
suspension. Would you agree with that with everything he was doing?  
BILL KENNEDY: DJ Hogg was tremendous. Aggressive on the defensive end. He had
blocked shots. He got a steal. He got some deflections. He played like a
junior plays in the tournament that's been in a tournament before, and really
proud of him because he's been through some tough stretches, too, shooting the
ball. But did he some other things to help us win tonight that -- today that
were really big.  
  
Q. Billy, I was trying to get something with Admon, but he was pretty
much just heaping the praise on you. I don't know if it's the stage or what it
is, but why is the team playing its best now? You closed the seasoning losing
4 out of 7.  
BILL KENNEDY: We talked about in the beginning of last spring, we struggled
last year and we talked about March Madness all year long. And that was our
goal, and we came to a point in our season where our backs were against the
wall where we knew we had to win games and I really think it changed, our
whole attitude changed, and we played with more of a sense of urgency in
practice, practice habits got better, and we just got better -- we grew up,
you know, like the light came on. We beat Vandy at Vandy, which is a tough
task in our league. And from then on our guys have been different. And when we
prepare well and we're locked in and we play together, we're as good as
advertised.  
  
Q. Billy, about nine minutes or so without Davis really getting going
offensively, but during the 15-0 run, I think he scored 9. How critical was
that to start feeling the big fella and him to start feeling it offensively?  
BILL KENNEDY: His presence, even though we got him the ball, he didn't get
some shots up. I thought he -- he was holding it too long and waiting to see
how they were going if play him. He went and the got it on the glass. He had
some offensive rebounds, some effort plays that really sparked us and sparked
him, the effort plays he made. That's what he's done all year. That's why he's
First Team all SEC. He's been the leader and the most consistent player on our
team all year with his effort and his attitude and his work habits. And that's
why you see the success that he's had and why we've had success.  
  
Q. Billy, you know, you have to dismiss one point guard, another one
gets hurt, you're essentially down to third string point guard that you had to
bench a couple times. Could you have ever envisioned you would be in this
position just about a month or so ago?  
BILL KENNEDY: You know, I never did doubt, I never gave up because I knew we
had talent. We got talent and we got good kids. We got good kids who make
mistakes. Unfortunately, they made more mistakes this year than I'd like. They
came together when they needed to come together. And I really thought that if
we could always make a run because of our talent level and because of the
quality of the kids that we have and they grew up. We only have two seniors,
and one of them got hurt and is not playing for us. We don't have -- everybody
is young, it seems this time of year. Sometimes you can be young and even be
old, immature. I think we grew up some throughout the season, throughout the
adversity.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how you never let North Carolina make a run
to get back in the game? As a matter of fact, you actually increased the lead
every four-minute TV timeout segment in the second half and kept crowd out of
the game.  
BILL KENNEDY: We knew we needed to keep attacking. Sometimes you play back on
your heals. We kept attacking and that's the kind of guys we have, we have
some -- when -- especially when they're as confident as they are right now, we
kept attacking and I thought we moved the ball really good and got a couple
layups. When you're making 3s like we made them and we were open. I mean we
had good shots. We made the shots today and that bred some confidence and we
were able to increase the lead. I was concerned that they double teamed and
double fist would give us some problems. I thought our guys did a good job of
coming to the ball and making the extra pass.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Congratulations. Good luck.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from the University of North
Carolina. We have from left to right, Cameron Johnson; in the middle, Kenny
Williams; to my mediate left, Luke Maye.  
  
Q. This question is for Luke. When we spoke last year, you know, you
were pretty low key and this year is just totally different, like I know you
can't say that you knew this was coming. But were you ever just sitting there,
like you just wait until I get lit and everyone sees how good I really am?  
LUKE MAYE: Did you just say "lit"? (laughter) I thought I heard that
correctly. I thought the biggest thing for me has just kind of been confidence
-- really, coming off of last year and my end of the year meeting with Coach,
we just talked about continuing the play with confidence and knowing how good
you could be. He gave me all the confidence in the world and the coaching
staff. Then just playing with my teammates and having such a core group coming
back. I knew I had to step up a little bit. I felt like us as a group have
stepped up our games and really started to play well at the right time. I
think it's been really beneficial to our success.  
  
Q. Luke, as well. Luke, you have a pretty daunting task coming into this
game going against Texas A &M bigs. Can you talk about that matchup, please?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah. They're both, all three of them that we've kind of scouted
and looked at are both really skilled. They all do different things. I think
we've had experience going against Duke three times, and having teams like
Louisville and Miami who both present a strong front court, but I think it
will be a great test for us. I think we'll be ready for the challenge and our
bigs come off the bench, played outstanding these past couple games, and
they'll just continue to play their games and play to their strengths is going
to be big for us.  
  
Q. Luke, when you came out yesterday, you got the cheer that's usually
associated with Luke Kuechly here. This is truly a home game for you. How many
people do you have here, and did you feel like the crowd was behind you
specifically yesterday?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, I think coming home is definitely a great feeling. I went
home on Wednesday and Thursday to my house. It was great to see my brothers.
Obviously my one brother is playing baseball, so he's not at home. To be home,
have that family feel, and came out and didn't play as well as I would like,
but all that matters is we won. Get another chance to play on Sunday, and it's
going to be a great game for us.  
  
Q. This question is for Kenny. What is going through your mind when
you're shooting your 3s? When you're feeling it, like I see the look on your
face and how like you get your swag whenever you get in your groove. What is
going through your mind at that time?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: You know, once I hit one or two, I feel pretty good, feeling
pretty confident in my jump shot. You know, if I get another one, I'm just
thinking it's going in. You know, once I hit two, three, four -- yesterday I
hit four, you know, at that point I'm feeling it and I think everybody else
knows I'm feeling it, also, and I think they look for me a little bit more.
But, you know, it's the same whether I miss two or make two. I think it's
going in.  
  
Q. Question for Cam Johnson. You've been played an integral role in the
Carolina team. This is your first NCAA Tournament. Can you talk about your
experience, how you feel?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's exciting. We did play in the tournament at Pitt. That's
why they're laughing. We played --  
  
LUKE MAYE: First win.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's exciting to be a part of this team with these guys. I
love going out there, playing and competing with these guys by my side and
wearing the North Carolina across my chest. And it's something that after the
path I've taken to get here kind of means, you know, has a little bit extra
special feeling to it. It's something I really embrace and have fun doing.  
  
Q. What does it feel like being a UNC player at the "house of Jordan"
and knowing that UNC has never lost in Charlotte? You're playing in the "house
of Jordan." What kind of feeling does that give you? Anyone can answer.  
LUKE MAYE: I mean, it's very special. I mean, playing in our home state, being
from North Carolina, it's really cool to go out there and hear the roars and
the cheers from the crowd. I think the crowd plays a huge factor in every
basketball game, and just be able to step out on that floor and have a little
bit of an extra advantage already, and just going out there and just playing
the game of basketball we all love and in this great state is something
special for a home town kid.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: You know, every time we put the jersey on it's a sense of
pride. I think it's a little bit more when we play in North Carolina because
we want to defend our state, really. We just go out there and we're excited.
We ran out and heard the crowd and the reaction. That pumps us up a little bit
more, knowing we have that many people in the crowd with us. And like I said,
that is just a sense of pride when we put the jersey on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cam.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I really agree. I think it gives us a good home feel, you
know, lot of Carolina support in the crowd, and you can see it all over when
you look around. That really kind of picks us up, helps us along. I really
think the crowd can make an impact in the game, and it's pretty positive, you
know, to have it in our home state in the "house of Jordan," like you said.
Just this stage means a lot and to be closer to home, to play in a game with
so much significance and so much, you know, familiarity is really special.  
  
Q. All three of you guys. You know Virginia better than anyone. Played
them the last game before the tournament. How surprised were you watching last
night? What was that like for you? Did the Coach say anything to you about
that game?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I was actually really surprised. You know, UMBC did a great
job doing what they wanted to do, driving and kicking and knocked down their
shots. They executed their game plan perfectly, and, you know, it was just
surprise to go see Virginia give up that many points on defense, honestly.  
  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, I would agree with Kenny. I felt like Virginia coming into
the tournament was the hottest team out of anybody. And I mean obviously to
lose Hunter was really huge for them. He's great on the defensive end, really
makes a lot of key plays for them offensively. When you get to tournament
time, everybody, it could be their last game. You got to give everything you
have and UMBC just played better, and that's what it comes down to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cam.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah. It surprised me, definitely, but I think UMBC just did
a great job of attacking and scoring and it was their night. They hit a lot of
shots. Virginia is a great team, they proved that all throughout the year and
just crazy. Shows you anything can happen in March.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Are any of you familiar with any of the UMBC players? None of their
names or anything in the junior ranks or anything?  
LUKE MAYE: Coach Odom was at Charlotte when I was going through the recruiting
process. He was unbelievable assistant coach, him and Coach Major really came
and watched me play a lot and being from North Carolina. Really got to know
him and the staff really well. And I was just so excited for him to have that
opportunity to really play on the big stage and be successful was really cool
to see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Cam or Kenny, any connection?  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Jairus Lyles was at VCU before he went there, so I didn't get
to know him really well but I had spoken to him a couple times.  
  
Q. You guys have this opportunity all the time, every year, you're
expected to be on this stage. What do you think it means to those guys to
first make the tournament and then pull off history?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: They got to be on Cloud 9 right now. To pull out something
like that is pretty historic. They got to be riding high right now, feeling
real good. They got another game coming up soon, so they can't fly too high.
Something you got to enjoy, you know. To win a game like that, to have a
performance like that against a team that's very, very good, shows a lot about
your team and your toughness. I think the guys really stepped up to the
occasion. So it's definitely something they got to enjoy.  
  
Q. I guess this question is moreso for Kenny and Luke. How are you
soaking up these last moments with your seniors, especially Theo and Joel,
enjoying these last couple of weeks that you have for them with them?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I think on the court is going out there and giving everything
I can for them. You know, doing everything I can to make sure that they go out
on a high note, controlling that aspect on the court, and then just spending
time with them off the court. You know, they're two great guys, great to be
around. You want to spend time with those two. Joel and Theo specifically, you
know, it's easy to want to be around them because you always going to laugh,
it's going to be a great time. You know, just living in the moment and just
enjoying whatever time I have with them left.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Luke.  
  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah. I'm not really trying to think about it, honestly. I can't
imagine a team without Joel or Theo. They've been so much to this program and
so much to my improvement and my success. Theo is the best teammate I've ever
been around. He makes everybody better, makes everybody laugh. Makes practice
so much lighter. But he just -- both of them are just -- Joel is the best
worker I've ever been around. It's really cool to have such great seniors who
lead by example and vocally. Both each other are very different but they get
the best out of all of us, which is really important.  
  
Q. Cameron, as I recall last year when you decided to transfer, A &M had
pursued you. Could you take us back to that. How much did it come down to
Carolina? Was A&M in the mix and ultimately why did you choose Carolina?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I never talked to A&M. Ultimately I chose Carolina to be in a
position like this, to have teammates like this, and to be a part of something
that's pretty special and pretty big. It took a long -- lot of talking with my
family and a long process to kind of figure it out, and it was difficult at
times. But I feel like I made a great decision coming here and I couldn't be
happier.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay, guys, thank you. Good job. See you
tomorrow.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, he bogeyed 2 and birdied 3, 4 and 6 and I heard he
bogeyed another one. And that shot he hit on the par 5, I thought that was the
right play before I left the room. Is that enough?  
  
Q. You're in this tournament 30-something times. You figure at one point
or another, you're going to get popped in the first round. It's just simple
math. You never have. When you see something like last night, how do you put
into perspective for yourself that not getting beat in the first round is one
of your accomplishments in your career?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, that was unbelievable. 21 -- 21 at halftime and we're
going into eat and second half is starting. And I said guys, I'm not --
literally, I'm -- not doing anything against Ryan Odom. I love Dave. I almost
went to work for Dave at one time. I'm not watching this. I'm going back to my
room and watch Texas A&M and Providence. There's no way that's going to
happen. So, we have beds over here, there's a phone, TV, and around the corner
we've got a nice room. Around the corner I'm watching the Texas A&M and
Providence and I go back and look. Good gosh, I go back and I go back and look
and I finally watched the last three, four minutes. That was unbelievable.  
  
We always try to just talk about playing one game, just one game. I've never
spoken to our guys about, okay, we're a 2 seed and they're a 15 seed. I don't
really think that I've ever said that to them. I said the better we play, the
better seed we get, the better chance we have of continuing.  
  
Last night I saw the thing up on the TV and I really try not to get caught up
in any records or anything like that, but that's one I've been very proud of.
I thanked the team in the locker room. Pretty good streak, we kept it going.
When I saw it up there, 28-0 in the first round, when we tied Coach Smith's
record I think his was 17. It's something I've been proud of. But other than
that, I really don't get caught up in those record kind of things.  
  
I can tell you all five times I shot 69 and those kind of things, but so the
answer the part of it about saying it to my team, I always try to prepare them
-- I did tell them this, that I may miss a year, 2002, we're in St. Louis and
we were playing Holy Cross was a 16 and they had the lead with five, six
minutes to play, and we came back and won. And then the next game Kirk Hinrich
hurt his foot in the Holy Cross game. He's sitting on the end of the bed with
his leg up there on ice. I didn't know if he was going to play. We got off to
such a great start against Stanford, 18-0. And so I have been aware of it and
I've said some things but never made a big deal of it except, let's do
everything we can, be as successful as we can, because when that big
tournament starts which is what we really aim for, perhaps we'll be little
easier at the start.  
  
But that was -- I was shocked. I kept thinking something April Fool's Day or
something. I didn't know what the crap was going on.  
  
Q. You recruit kids that expect to be on this stage and they are
accustomed to playing and enjoying these moments. What do you think the UMBC
kids are feeling right now and going through and how -- as an educator and
coach, how special is that, do you think, to see those kids have that one
chance?  
ROY WILLIAMS: That's the beauty of the tournament. I mean, it's hard on
coaches, one game, bad, you're gone. That's the beauty of the tournament and
to see those kind of things. As I said, I've been there a couple times when
it's been awfully close, but you have to feel so good -- I watched -- at the
end I have no idea what the guys were saying on TV because I had paid no
attention to them. I was just watching the kids run around. It's called
hugger. You don't care how smelly or sweaty, you run and hug each other.
Seeing the people in the stands and the people they identified as parents. I
was really looking to see if they would show Dave Odom, because he has been a
good friend for a long time. North Carolina guy.  
  
But -- the other thing I was almost as stunned by the way Coach Odom handled
himself. He was so daggone -- Jesus Christ, son, do you realize what just
happened? I'd be running around acting a little crazy or something. I was
really impressed with how he handled it. But the kids -- and I've said many
times and I get corny at times, but the biggest thrill in coaching is seeing
the looks on your kids' faces when they've accomplished something really
important, and especially if it was really hard to do. And that's -- you know,
in basketball, that's Chaminade against Ralph Sampson. I can't even think of
anything else that's close to that. Those UMBC kids, they had a tough time
going to sleep last night and so did Coach Odom, too. He's had -- he had to go
inside and scream for something.  
  
Q. You said to this group they were going to play the small lineup, they
had to rebound if they wanted to stick with it. You guys were second in the
country in rebounding margin, maybe a little bit more unconventional fashion,
how you guys go after on the offensive glass. Did you think this group could
ultimately rebound as well as they have, and does anything change when you've
going up against a team with that much size?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'd mad because we're number 2. We were number 1 for awhile. I
sort of got on them for losing that lead kind of thing. Actually, you've heard
me before, it's the most critical factor in the game, the way we play. Maybe
somebody else plays it differently or they can convince themselves. I knew we
would be a real good rebounding team, because if they didn't rebound and
wouldn't boxout, they won't play. But we also emphasize it so much that they
bought into it.  
  
It's been harder because Kenny Meeks was naturally a great rebounder, so he
could get them. Justin was great, Tony Bradley was a great rebounder. The
surprise of being able to do it at that level is there. But if we don't do it,
we don't win is the way I look at it.  
  
Now you watch Texas A&M and they just -- maybe the biggest team I've ever
looked at. And so we've got to try to do it at a higher level now than anybody
else that we've played. We've had three, four games where the other team out
rebounded us.  
  
Duke outrebounded us, and they've got similar size like that, but A&M got it
through some of their perimeter players as well. It's got to be the primary
focus for us. I thought we would be a good rebounding team and perhaps at the
level we are maybe surprised me.  
  
Q. Roy, when you dive into the tape of A &M, how have they really
changed since TJ Starks really started handling the controls and coming into
his own?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, again, I never watched an A&M tape the until last
night. I didn't see when they've had two point guards that they started with,
one hurt and one suspended. I never saw them when they had those guys. I said
in the press conference last night, I remember watching five, six minutes of
the early game, the one that was -- I keep saying it was outside the country
-- was it Germany? Yeah -- against West Virginia. I remember watching a little
bit of that. I saw them play a little bit against Kentucky and a little bit
against Kansas. And so until yesterday I didn't have enough knowledge to even
talk about them. But that's the way I do everybody. Normally I will watch a
game tape the night before we play someone.  
  
Now, with Lipscomb is a little different. I knew Sunday we were -- so I had
watched three full games on Lipscomb. Well, Brad Frederick had the team, he
watched 12 games. Hubert Davis, A&M, by tomorrow he will have watched 10, 12
games. I'll get more idea. I know Billy. And I said last night, I can't have
anymore respect for anybody than I would him. And I'm not trying to act like
we're bosom buddies. I always say hello. When I heard what was going on with
him a few years back, I said something to him. He's a fantastic guy, fantastic
coach who -- the focus that he has is just incredible to me. I've known little
bit more about them just because trying to see how he's doing.  
  
Q. Roy, Sterling and Garrison over the last two, three weeks have
started playing a little bit more, getting more involved. Is that just a
matter of freshmen developing and now being more confident and ready, and how
much are those two going to have to contribute against that big Texas A &M
team?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'd like to say it's coaching but I think it is as kids
developing. And two months ago, three months ago, whenever it was I decided to
go small, and then all of a sudden later, wait a minute, i got to help these
kids be developed, too. So we're going to give them more opportunities. I'm
not going to forget them completely.  
  
And so we're trying to give them more time. We're putting them in the game in
difficult situations and expecting them to perform. If they don't perform, I
chastise them. If they do perform, I pat them on the back. What they've done
so far has been good. Now this is going to be maybe the biggest challenge
they've had. Similar to Duke, because with Wendell and Marvin, the guys they
play are that size. The difference is going to be the guys that Theo and
Kenny. Williams will guard. They've got to come through for us. They've got to
be big.  
  
Q. How big a deal is it that they've stayed engaged and didn't sulk and
didn't kind of drift off and didn't play much?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm very lucky they're not that kind of kids. That's who I look
for anyway. I tell them, every kid I recruit, every kid, I didn't tell --
Tyler Hansbrough came to North Carolina thinking he was going to play behind
Marvin Williams Sean May. I am not a nice guy. I am going to be hard on you.
I'm going to push you more than you've ever pushed. That part of it I don't
really get into.  
  
Q. For all these years, teams have tried to solve your size. Is there
anything you picked up from them that you can try to solve Texas A &M's
size?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Teams have tried to spread us and milk the clock more is the way
they've gone after us over the years. That doesn't really fit me. I don't
really think I can do it. The other way they've done it is when we've driven
the ball to the basket, they blocked every shot. We tried to make sure we stop
a little short.  
  
No, their size is impressive. I just did an interview with Coach Thompson's
group. He said it may be the biggest team that he's ever seen. It really --
when you look at how big -- look what during the opening tip, look at the guy
that Kenny is going to stand beside and the guy Theo is going to stand beside.
They're big guys. They're as big as some of the other big guys we're playing
against. Their perimeter guys are a lot of size. You got to get them off of
you before you try to take an outside shot, so you got to take -- create some
space with your dribble and try to take them to the basket and go right by
them and not try to stretch it out. Because against a shot blocker, you do all
this dipsy-do stuff and you stretch it out. You just give them space to find
it and block it. Got to hope we get them in foul trouble and get down to some
of the other guys.  
  
But they're here because they're really good and hopefully we're here because
we're really good, too. I didn't sleep really well last night, and it wasn't
just because I was excited about us winning or stunned by Virginia. Sort of
watching that tape right before I went to bed. I have a bad enough time
sleeping and they added to it last night. But we are not going to spread it
and hold it. Give you a clue.  
  
Q. Luke said that when his shot is not falling, you stay on him about
remaining involved in the game in other ways. What is your message to him when
you see maybe he doesn't have it?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, some things are not meant to be shared with everybody.
I chewed his butt out last night. You're one of the best players in the
America, first team all ACC, third team All-American Kansas. Just be Luke.
Quit worrying about things. Just play basketball. Sometimes I get a little
more heated with him, and last night I kept him out a little bit because I
wanted this to see if I could get him simmering over there a little bit. He
can't beat the world by himself. And I love kids who care and Luke Maye really
cares. And I don't have to coach Luke very much. Just push him a little bit
and with a little finger and that's about it.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have had a lot of highlights, A &M hasn't had as
many. One of them was beating North Carolina in 1980. You were a student grad
assistant or assistant coach. Do you remember that game at all?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Part-time assistant. It means full-time job, part-time pay. I
remember that part.  
  
Q. Do you remember the game?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Give you a trivia question. Have you ever seen a game where you
have the last shot to win the game and lose by 17 or 19? Because that was that
game. Was it 17? We had the last shot to win the game in regulation and missed
it and they beat us by 17. I remember that game, yes, walking out of the gym
in Denton, Texas. Eddie Fogler looked to me. We have to get to Albany, New
York, a guy named Sam Perkins up there to help us.  
  
Q. Does Manley have an increased role for tomorrow because of his
size?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Not really. I mean, what I do is I put him in first or Garrison
in first and whoever plays the best the first time, they get in get a little
more time. Last night I thought Sterling defensively would help us a little
bit against Marberry, make it more difficult. But Garrison got in, had three
assists, and did some good things. I went back with him first. So it's a go-
by-the-seat-of-the-pants kind of thing.  
  
I didn't like the way Sterling was a screen and roll, and I didn't like the
way he got back to the roll guy. So I took him out and put Garrison in. The
first play Garrison did it well. When I put Sterling back in, he got three
rebounds in a row. It's more of a seat-of-the-pants kind of thing.  
  
Q. Coach, Cam said yesterday he had 7 rebounds yesterday. He said late
in the game you pulled him one time because he didn't crash the boards. He
said maybe one of the biggest adjustments about playing for you is that
constant mandate of never letting up, even a guy like him who has got 7
boards, banged up, but he didn't do it one time and you pulled him out. How
has he handled transitioning into dealing with the mandate that you give these
guys, regardless of what the circumstances are?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, if he dealt with Jamie and he dealt with Kevin, now he's
dealt with me, he's dealt with Three Stooges. Maybe I'm the worst of the
three. He's already done it. He's in is a demanding family. His dad has pushed
him and he pushes himself. He's dealt with three different personalities in
four years because he red shirted one year.  
  
But I had already taken -- I think I had taken Kenny out for that reason once
as well. I exposed and said it straightforward to Cam about it. I took Cam out
because he didn't go to the boards. Because in the first half I was really
ticked because Luke Maye shot the ball twice and I got four guys standing
outside the 3-point line and not one dadgum guy went to the board. That
happened twice. I ripped all of them at that point. I felt like that should be
enough. The one I took Cam out was in the second half. I'm not going to tell
Luke Maye you can't shoot because we don't have anybody to rebound. Those
other guys better get their butts up there and rebound also. Luke is our best
percentage shooter from 3 and maybe our best from overall as well. His doesn't
go in all the time either. Somebody got to go rebound it. If I'm not mistaken,
we were up rebounding-wise like 3 or 4 in the first half and I think we ended
up being up by 19. 18, 19.  
  
Q. Roy, the last couple years you've been to the tournament, your
program has been under scrutiny for things that happened off the court. Has
life returned to normal this year, and especially given the context of all the
other things going on in college basketball, has that been nice for you that
you haven't had to deal with that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It really has been. The last three, four years I've been on
record saying the kids and my time on the basketball court with the kids has
been -- I'm not trying to be too dramatic -- it's been my salvation. If I
hadn't those, I would have gotten out the door. I felt like I needed to stay
and see the thing through. I didn't feel like I had anything to do with it,
but boy those kids really made me feel good about being with them.  
  
This fall we had couple of guys visit who were Top 10 or Top 15 kids. We
hadn't been able to get those kids on campus for three, four years. That felt
better. There's no question about it. And coming to a press conference when I
say, guys, come on, let's please talk about the tournament and other people
wanted to talk about the other stuff. It wasn't nearly as much fun.  
  
Yeah, it's been more fun. This team has been sort of like the rest of them.
They've really been a salvation for me, even though I've been having more fun
anyway so it hadn't been needed as much. But no, you're exactly right. I think
you said pleasant. I think that's the terminology you used. It's been more
pleasant for me, yes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. What are your feelings on tights-sneaker day in Chapel Hill? Do you
have any?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. There were a lot of other people around. Let's
make sure you understand we're going to talk about tights, not just me and
you.  
  
Q. Do you have any rules as far as what your guys can wear as far as
headbands, tights, any of that kind of stuff? Any feelings on that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Headbands went the way of Gonzaga in 2006 in Madison Square
Garden when I walked out on the court and got five of six guys in headbands.
We got beat. We stunk. There's never been a headband, never will be another
headband on another North Carolina player. Shane Battier, if he wanted to come
back and play, we would talk about it.  
  
Tights, I kid them all the time. "All my coaches wear them out there." I told
them I'm really going the surprise them one day, I'm going to walk out with
tights on and Theo just about puked right there. You know, it's crazy, me
wearing them one leg and not the other. I see that. The next day you may
switch. I tell them, I wouldn't mind wearing them sometimes it's cold. But no,
that is honestly the full extent of our conversation of tights. Make sure we
understand that. Guys, thank you very much.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from Kansas State. We have from
left to right, Xavier Sneed, Barry Brown Jr, and Kam Stokes.  
  
Q. Barry, you guys had a good four days of preparation, watching film
for Creighton, and now you got to turn around on 24 hours and take on a team
that just dismantled one of the best college defenses out there. What are your
early thoughts on this, and how do you approach this? And Xavier, if you could
pipe in on this, too, with getting ready for this game.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Well, I mean they're a great team. They share the ball
really well, especially in transition, get it out, lot of different guys that
can bring the ball up. So -- but the quick turnaround is something we're kind
of used to. We had a Big 12 tournament. We've had games during regular season
where we had the one day turnaround or play back-to-back days. It's nothing
that we haven't seen before.  
  
Q. Is there any similarity between this team and some you've seen in the
Big 12?  
XAVIER SNEED: Definitely Oklahoma. Get up a lot of 3s quick, especially in
transition and they're a fast-paced team. So similar to Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Kam, I'm curious if you guys, you specifically, could walk through
the emotions of last night. You get the win. You know you're moving on to the
second round. I'm sure it's a great celebration. At what point do you realize
what's going on in that Virginia- UMBC game and what the evening was like for
you guys.  
KAMAU STOKES: We got back to the hotel, talking with our family and
everything, and then we turned and looked at the TV and Virginia losing.
Pretty sure nobody expected that, but you can't look past UMBC. They're a real
good team, like Barry said, and share the ball very well.  
  
Q. Would you be expected to march up on Lyles? He's obviously played
really well. He played well against Virginia and he had the big shot in the
conference tournament to win that. You expected to be matched up against him
and have you watched tape on him i?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Yeah, I mean, I watched tape on him already since last night
when I found out we were going to play him because that's going to be my
matchup. That's the guy I'm going to be guarding for most of the game, see
where he picks his spots and what he likes to do and how he likes to score and
help his team win. I've been watching film on him since last night. The
scouting report tonight we're going to have and hopefully I can shut him down.  
  
Q. Any of the three of you, the country is going to be rooting against
you. They're going to be rooting for Cinderella. What's your mindset going in,
saying hey, story time is over, this is basketball?  
THE MODERATOR: Xavier.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: Just come out here and play our game, be focused and be
prepared. I feel like we can come out of here and get the W.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, we know that everyone is kind of looking for that
Cinderella story. We just going to keep playing K-State basketball like all
year and not worry about who they beat or yesterday or two days ago or
whatever. We're going to play K-State basketball and respect our opponent and
play and hope to win.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: You can't look past UMBC, especially in the tournament anything
can happen. You just have to prepare for them and get ready for the game.  
  
Q. Kam, this is for you. You're a Baltimore guy. What do you know about
this school, this program, growing up and coming out of high school?  
KAMAU STOKES: Growing up they recruited me. I know some of the players that's
there. Everybody see they play fast. I knew that. They're a real good team.
Got some guys in this year that can do a lot of good things. We got to be
ready for that game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kam, are you surprised by the contribution the last couple of games
by Mike McGuirl, where his confidence come from, what do you expect from him
moving forward?  
KAMAU STOKES: I'm not surprised at all. He showed that in the Big 12
tournament when he came in the game and made some good plays. He's prepared
for it the whole year. So, I'm not surprised at all.  
  
Q. Barry, they like to spread the floor, dribble, penetrate. Do you see
any similarities in how they attack with their guards, attack the rim kind of
like what you guys do?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Yeah, they like to get in the lane and kick a lot of roll
backs and try to make the next defender help and trying to get wide open 3s.
Shoot a lot of 3s. It's a big chunk of their offense and a big chunk of their
points, game in and game out. We just have to contain, play some good
individual defense, but still have our brother's back when they get beat, have
high close-outs being put on the floor and not get the wide open 3s.  
  
Q. Kam, just curious, their point guard, K.J., is 5'8 ", 140. You don't
really see that too much at the division one level, quite frankly. What do you
think about him as a player? Why is he able to play with the big boys of
Virginia, and would it be possible for you to post him up low, given the size
advantage?  
KAMAU STOKES: I mean, that's all within our system. I'm going to make plays
still running the system. He's a good player, you know. That's obviously why
he's at the Division 1 level. Can't look past him or underestimate him. He
works well with their team.  
  
Q. I'm curious, how different is your role from the 3 to the 4 spot? Is
it significantly different and which one do you enjoy playing more?  
XAVIER SNEED: Interchangeable, really. I made the 4 a lot last year as well,
and it's nothing really different for me and like playing different teams like
this. They space out the floor. It's a little bit easier for me. I feel like
it's better for the matchups for us.  
  
Q. Barry, forgive me if this was like one of the first questions because
I arrived a little bit late, but I think that 9 seeds make it to the Sweet 16
maybe 4 percent of the time. Of course, usually there's a number 1 in the way.
How do you guys look at this opportunity to maybe get into a Sweet 16?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It's a big-time opportunity for us. We still have a team in
our way right now. We're not looking towards the Sweet 16 because we have to
worry about the 32 that we're in right now. UMBC is in our way. All our focus,
all our efforts and energy is on beating them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. Okay. Guys, thank you. Good job. See you
tomorrow.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Coach, just first your reaction. I mean, I don't think anybody really
expected to see what happened there with UMBC last night and, you know, I'm
not sure if you guys were already scouting Virginia film or what was going on.
What was reaction to what happened and your thoughts heading into Sunday?  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously it's history. It's never been done before. And not only
when you think about the magnitude of it, how Virginia's year and how they
dominated what I guess -- we feel like we had a good conference, but obviously
they had more teams in the NCAA Tournament and they won the league and won the
tournament and played at such a high level. Obviously, they lost an important
player, but you think they'd be able to -- be able to survive that, but, you
know, they didn't.  
  
I told our guys, the best team on the court won. They controlled the whole
second half. And I kind of beforehand, you know, motivation stuff, you know,
when we talked about our bracket, Virginia is really not that good. The
coaches looked at me like I was crazy. So last night after -- it was kind of a
neat situation, Embassy Suites and all our fans, family, our players, all kind
of watching the game when we got back and lots of cheering and stuff, and I
just made sure we got them together and make sure that we understand how good
they are and we got a big challenge in front of us tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Bruce, I don't know if the parallel is exact, but back in 2002 nobody
really knew who you were, you beat Texas Tech, Georgia in the tournament. How
did that change your career, how did that change your life, and can you sort
of sympathize with what Ryan has gone through the last 24 hours?  
BRUCE WEBER: Well, one they got back really late and so many things going
through, I'm sure -- I know one day I did 25 different interviews, radio stuff
and different stuff. And at that time you just say yes to everything. You want
some exposure for your program. And you got to give him credit. But he's been
around it. Obviously I've known his dad forever. He's been around high level
basketball program, high level players. He's been through the tournament. And
I'm sure he'll handle it well. But it is daunting. When you do something like
that, everybody wants to talk to you and have a piece of you. And I told our
guys, most important thing for us, we got to be prepared. We can't worry who
we play. We got to be worried about our preparation.  
  
Q. Coach, you said a couple times this year about Mike being kind of the
surprise of the summer. With that quote in mind, I'm curious about his
recruiting process and then what that surprise was, what you didn't know about
him when you got him on campus.  
BRUCE WEBER: It was more I asked the players who was the surprise. I always
say who worked the hardest. We always have our summer ending meetings and go
through some stuff and who worked the hardest, who made the most improvement,
who has been the biggest surprise. To the man, every player said Mike McGuirl
is a surprise. I guess they -- part of it again is recruiting. They didn't
much about him, wasn't as much hype. Coach Frazier kind of discovered him. We
watched him that summer before his senior year. He had some recruitment but
not at a high level. Picked up, he had a really good summer, got better and
better. Loves his explosion, his athleticism. He's got a little bit of the
cockiness to him, as you saw last night. And I just -- as I've said before, I
have felt bad for him on his year. From injuries to red shirt to go not red
shirting to not getting a lot of minutes that he wanted, and it's great for
him to have the opportunity in Kansas game here to show what he could do and
he rose up. He took advantage of the opportunity. We talk about that all the
time. You never know when you're going to be called upon. You got to be ready
to do it, and obviously he was last night.  
  
Q. First of all, which of your assistants has the scout for this game?
And with that, watching what they did offensively to a very good defensive
team last night, what are the challenges in trying to slow down this team?  
BRUCE WEBER: You know, the good thing is we face some of the best offensive
teams in the country from last night Creighton to the Kansas game to TCU to
Oklahoma. And so we face some of those teams so we're familiar. It starts with
transition defense. They're so good in transition. Last night they had four
guys that could bring it up. Now it's probably more two guys or three that can
bring the ball up, but those two are really good and cause havoc for you
because they can get to the paint. They're good at flipping, flipping it back
for 3s. Put a lot of pressure on the defense. I thought last night was one of
their better things, we grind it out on offense and played great transition
defense.  
  
Now, the little difference maybe between these guys and Creighton, they attack
the paint on the close-outs. We're going to have to really do a good job of
containing when -- we call it rope action or dribble action -- when they get
in the paint kick and they got good 3-point shooters and again we just faced
TCU, Kansas, Creighton, three in a row that are -- and these guys are three of
the -- four of the top 3-point shooting teams in the country. Did a good job
last night. Got to do it again tonight. For the scout we divided it up on
Sunday. Coach Korn and a coach took the first game Creighton. Coach Frazier
was going to help us with somebody. I said Coach Lowery, you can kind of cover
everybody including UMBC. We had a little bit of stuff, but we had to work
hard last night. You know, I went -- probably 3:30, 4:00 I went to bed. I know
when I left, they were still up working. I think a lot of them stayed 5:00,
6:00 in the morning. But we were ready for the players when we got to
breakfast. We had clip tape, we were ready for them. We started going on
personnel and making sure -- the one thing I did last night and after we all
-- all watching the game. I called them back to a meeting room. I had told
them they could go to bed after meeting with their families and eating. I
wanted them to make sure they understood the task they had and how good they
were.  
  
Q. I have a couple questions for you, Bruce. First of all, status of
Dean Wade? And I have a follow-up.  
BRUCE WEBER: What else? Dean did some stuff today again. You know, just little
bit on the court. Just kind of see what happens. Again, I think -- if he
plays, it would be a limited basis probably. But, you know, never know,
miracles happen and it would be nice to have him. Obviously, we would have a
nice matchup advantage if we had him inside, but we don't and it's next man
up. Michael was it last night. Mak was it against Kansas. We got to have
somebody else step up tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Follow-up question. Everybody in the country is going to be rooting
against you, rooting for Cinderella. How do you handle that, being the
villain?  
BRUCE WEBER: The coaches talked to the players about that last night, about
how they wrote history. And we actually had a little saying this week is the
person who wins the war, gets to write their own history. Now we kind of --
they wrote their own history last night.  
  
Now we've talked about us. We're going to have to -- that task, we have a
battle and I was a little surprised at game time, and I don't know all the
logistics how they decide that, but obviously, you know, Prime Time on Sunday
night, they put our game there. So like you said, I think a lot of people will
be cheering for them.  
  
Q. Opposite 60 Minutes, I think. Bruce, Greg McDermott suggested
yesterday not having Dean in the lineup kind of affected them, changed you
defensively and affected them. And of course you'd rather have been Dean, but
are there some attributes to your defense when Dean is not on the floor in
terms of perimeter defense?  
BRUCE WEBER: You saw it with Virginia last night. If you play two bigs against
a team that's small, you know, it's tough to matchup and they got it moving
all around and they do a great job moving the basketball, getting into the
paint, like we talked about.  
  
Dean still has been -- I've said many times, he's one of our best defenders,
one of our smartest defenders. The one thing we had when we played Kansas,
playing small ball, we could matchup. Last night we could matchup and again I
think tomorrow night we can matchup. It gives us a little bit of quickness. We
actually put Kam on their 4 man yesterday but their 4 man was really -- he's a
perimeter guy and he picked and popped a lot. And so in some ways we have
better quickness, we have opportunity to switch things that we normally
wouldn't if Dean was in there. But I promise you, the players would love to
have Dean back and I know the coaches would.  
  
Q. Coach, I wonder if you could address UMBC's backcourt with Lyles and
Maura. What do you think of those two? And second part of that, with Maura
being 5'8 ", 140 and I may be oversimplifying the game, but why don't teams
just throw a point guard down there and back him down on the low post and
would that be part of your strategy?  
BRUCE WEBER: If you got a big enough point guard, you can get mismatches. I
suppose you can do that. And I'm not sure in their league if you have big body
guys that can do that -- you know, last night Tony, they run their offense and
they just kept running it and they didn't have that opportunity to do that. So
if we get some mismatches, we might look at that. You know, but those two
guards are very good. They always say guards win in the tournament and Lyles
is very similar to Marcus Foster. A guy that can create. He scores on all
three levels, jump up and make the 3, get to the point, shoot a pull up. He
can get to the hoop and make plays. He had some nice passes. That's the thing
we showed our guys. If we overdo our help on him, he'll make the right pass.  
  
And Morris is -- he's one of those guys you hate to play against. He pestered
the heck out of Virginia, their point guards and made it tough. They had them
-- they couldn't run their offense in comfort zones because that first pass
was way out on the court. And so the good thing with us, hopefully, we have
three different ball handlers with our lineup now, so I said this is not an
ego thing, this is a smart thing. Whoever he's guarding, get down the court
and let somebody else bring the ball up. We'll have to deal with them, but
he's so clever, he can score, he's a great distributor, he creates and gets in
the paint and causes problems. He's definitely a little pest that you got to
deal with.  
  
Q. If I understood you correctly, you said earlier in the week as kind
of a motivational point with the team, you told them Virginia is not that
good. And then for them last night you're calling the team back in after
Virginia loses. How is that tinkered with or does it tinker in any way with
just motivation, psychology?  
BRUCE WEBER: I actually told them, I said it last night, I'm pretty smart. I
told you Virginia is not very good (laughter). I just played off of it. I'm
not sure all of them got it, but -- you know, you're looking for things. I was
staying up Sunday night after the pairings, and they had George Mason and CVU
and talked about a lot of psychological things they did beforehand and just
kind of prepping them. And I said we got to focus on Creighton. If we don't
beat Creighton, it doesn't do any good. If we get there, I just said I don't
think they're that good. The coaches are like throwing things at me and stuff.  
  
You just kind of play with their minds a little bit and last night I did
again. Hey, they're not that good, but this other team is really good. We got
to be ready for them.  
  
Q. Coach, I imagine Barry is going to have the assignment of stopping
Lyles. What do you see in that? Is he close enough to Foster that Barry can do
the job? What's your expectation of that matchup?  
BRUCE WEBER: Like I said, they are very similar. The older guards that know
how to create and they got that step back 3, they can get from the paint. They
use isos him. He's good in transition. So, it's similar. Barry stayed up last
night, he wanted to watch tape. We sent him some synergy stuff. We wanted him
to go to bed. This morning he put a little time in watching again. And that's
why we've been successful is that our guys prepare and they care and want to
do a good job. Hopefully they're all cut in. That will be the big thing. We
had great team defense last night. Barry was big time and Xavier was big time
on Thomas, but they had a lot of help from a lot of guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it say overall that it actually happened that a 16th
seed has beaten a number 1? Has the parity gotten that much better and why?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think there's no doubt the parity and somebody brought up my
Southern Illinois team and that -- I think since that time, you know, the
early 2000s, you know, everybody has jumped up and some of it you could say
the one-and-dones, losing some of the top kids, you know, early that aren't
getting the opportunity to play. Older players win, they got older guys, you,
know, and they got athleticism and quickness and great guards. I said it
before, you know, always been said, guards win in the tournament and make the
plays. When you have experience, older guards, guys that can make plays, gives
you a chance.  
  
But it had to be the right story. I think obviously it doesn't happen, first
time in whatever it is, 300-some games. It had to be the right story. Virginia
loses somebody. The matchups, again, you talk about when you get in a
tournament how are your matchups. And there's no doubt there's more and more
parity in college basketball. You see Buffalo, Arizona, whatever, there's
always Loyola winning the other day, so it's fun. It's what makes March
Madness special.  
  
Q. Bruce, their point guard, I would assume would, be the smallest
player in the Big 12 at least in terms of height. Did you scout that in any
way? Did you prepare the guys for that size?  
BRUCE WEBER: I said before kind of -- it's that little pest, the guy you go on
the playground you hate to play against because he's everywhere and makes
plays and he'll steal the ball off you, he'll drive you, flip it back over his
shoulder for a 3. He just does a lot of different things. We said you look at
him, you got to respect him because he can play. It's going to be a key
matchup for us tomorrow, how we deal with him, and obviously Lyles is really
good but Maura definitely creates for everybody else and makes them go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from UMBC. We have from left to
right, Joe Sherbourn, junior; Jairus Lyles, a senior; and to my mediate left,
K.J. Maury.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, how was the party? What did you do last night after that
victory?  
K.J. MAURA: We got back to the hotel and all our fans were waiting in the
lobby, a great feeling. After that, coaches encouraged us to go back to the
room and I couldn't sleep. I was up until like 5:00 in the morning.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like K.J. said, our fans and family were waiting for us.
We shared a little moment with them. Then our coaches told us to go upstairs
and get some rest. We tried to go to sleep, but I don't think anybody really
got to sleep until about 4:00 a.m.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: Exact same answer (laughter).  
  
Q. With that in mind, is there any chance of a let-down? Have you
achieved your goal at this point? Are you satisfied or is there a chance for a
let-down?  
JOE SHERBURNE: Of course not. We want to win every game we're playing, and we
think we have just as good a chance at winning this game as the last game and
the game before that.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like Joe said, we don't really want to get too high on
ourselves. We made history but we -- I encourage my teammates to try to block
out everything. We've got a tough team we have to play on Sunday. We're
preparing for that right now. I think we'll be ready.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, we're not satisfied. We go in tomorrow with the mentality
we're going to win another game. Yeah, we never satisfied. We hungry for more.  
  
Q. Jairus, this would be for you. I'm curious how much you have looked
at Kansas State, what your initial thoughts are of their team?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I haven't really -- we haven't really watched film on them yet.
Our coaching staff has. We saw them playing yesterday for a little bit, about
three minutes. They're pretty big. Their guards like to attack the rim. We get
back to the hotel and watch film. I'm probably go back the my room and watch
more film when I'm by myself.  
  
Q. I was just going to ask one more. I got to see you guys play for the
first time last night. Do you play like that all the time?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah (laughter).  
  
Q. Two different questions. You guys just got a new arena February 3rd,
5,000 seats. It's a really big deal for you guys. What is that like? And then
getting out here on the Hornets arena against the No. 1 seed, is it a totally
different world?  
THE MODERATOR: K.J.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think it got us a little bit prepared because it definitely is
not compared to all this. But it was a great experience for us to have that
new arena and feel the environment we needed to feel coming up to March. This
is a whole different world to me.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think playing Arizona in the beginning of the year, they got a
really big arena. Playing SMU and going to Maryland. We were kind of prepared
coming into this. Most of our team has been in big games like this. Wasn't
really that new to us.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: The new arena helps helped us a lot because of the of adjusting
to the shooting background when we came into that arena is big background with
seats, big giant wall. We come from the small field house. So it helped us get
used to shooting in big open spaces.  
  
Q. Completely unrelated. Of the most of the guys that come through this
room prepared for this moment, been on this stage before. This is your guys'
first time on this stage. You're now America's sweethearts. This is your
party. What do each of you want America to know about you? How did you get to
this school? Do you guys play chess? Sport night? Tell us about you guys.  
JOE SHERBURNE: We're the Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, not Golden Retrievers. I
saw that on Sports Center. They had that. That's the state dog of Maryland.
That's what you should know (laughter).  
  
After I hit my first 3 of the second half, I did a big championship belt for
Aaron Rogers because I'm his biggest fan. I want him to see it on TV. They
didn't get the shot. I was just out of frame. If anybody knows him, I've been
trying to tag him.  
  
Q. I know them very well.  
JOE SHERBURNE: You talk to her.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: One thing, I think everybody on our team can probably have a job
at being a comedian. We're a really funny team. That's all I got right now.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think we probably the funniest team in the country. We Top 10
for sure. I always have a smile on me. You see me in the court, I'm always
smiling. I think that comes from where I'm from, Puerto Rico. I play for them
and my guys. I want to make everybody proud.  
  
Q. K.J., when you see guys listed and you see their heights and weights,
it's usually a little fabricated, 6'2 " guys suddenly become 6'4". You're
listed at 5'8", 140, are you that or even smaller than that, just curious. And
Coach Weber just referred to you as -- affectionately, I guess -- a little
pest that he would never want to play in a playground because you're the type
of guy, stealing the ball away from him. Tell me about your style of play, and
if you can answer the first question as well.  
K.J. MAURA: I'm 5'5" on a good day, but I'm 5'7" most of the time. Yeah. I
took a lot of notes on short players like Muggsey Bogues, JJ Barea, one of my
heroes, of course. I had to play like that. If I want to be successful in the
court, I got to be a pest. I got to bother the ball and make them
uncomfortable. I think my size is an advantage because a lot of guys are
taller than me and they don't expect me to be pressuring the ball at that high
level. So, I think I use my size as an advantage.  
  
Q. I wonder if each of you could sort of describe the thing or things
that stood out to you in terms of reaction, what it seems to mean to people,
whether it's your fans or even nationally, media, social media.  
K.J. MAURA: I think this is the biggest win in school history. Our president
went to the locker room and said it's the biggest moment in school history. I
think this is a very special moment for the country and for our school, most
likely.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Like K.J. said, very special moment for UMBC, our team, our
coaching staff, the players, our families. We're just trying to soak it all in
right now.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: What got to me the most, like my friends who are telling me
back home in Wisconsin they have entire bars rooting for you in BC, entire
houses rooting for us and nobody believes them when they're wearing my UMBC
practice jersey that they know me or that have a connection to the school. I
think for now people -- I never heard of UMBC before I came here. Nobody in
Wisconsin knows what it is. So now everybody knows, I hope.  
  
Q. You were very specific about the Chesapeake Bay Retrievers. What
distinguishes the Chesapeake Bay Retriever? What is it that stands out about
that as opposed to the Golden?  
JOE SHERBURNE: They are a dark brown. They have a thick waterproof coat of
fur. And I'm not sure about what else.  
  
Q. Last night Coach Bennett said that your 4 guard lineup really messed
with them. Kansas State plays a 4 guard lineup. How do you see that matchup?  
K.J. MAURA: I think it's a hard matchup for us, but I think we're going to use
our size in the 3 guard and in the 4 position. We going to run our stuff and
it's going to be a fun matchup.  
  
Q. Jairus, after you guys knocked off Virginia, Virginia Tech is out, no
other D.C. teams have made the tournament. As someone who went to high school
De Matha, how much does that mean to you to go forward?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I know everybody on the team from Maryland. We have a lot of
guys from the area. It means a lot. We've been getting texts, social media
posts, just people we don't even know from Maryland just saying how excited
they are for us, how they're rooting for us. It's very special.  
  
Q. I know you said you're trying to block everything out now and not let
the moment get too much for you. How do you actually do that? Y'all seem
really calm and composed right now, considering how historic last night was.  
JOE SHERBURNE: Luckily for some people like K.J., they're getting so many
notifications, their phone doesn't work. That's a good thing, I guess.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Like Joe say, my phone is not working so I put that past me
already.  
  
Q. What happened to your phone?  
K.J. MAURA: I'm getting so many notifications that my phone froze. And it does
that every time I open an application, so I just can text.  
  
Q. For any of you. Last night you took apart one of the best defenses in
college basketball and tomorrow night you'll face another team that likes to
play really good defense, takes a lot of pride in it. What exactly did you do
to Virginia and at what point in the game did you know these guys can't stop
us?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think it started on the defensive end for us. We pressured
their guards a lot of. Didn't give them any open looks. We made their bigs
work and they got frustrated and it helped us on our offensive end because
they kind of got distracted, got inside them so they're not hitting shots and
running their offense like they usually do. They had defensive breakdowns and
we kind of took advantage of that.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think we studied them well. Our preparation was the best we had
all year and we had good tips to what to do on offense against their defense.
And Jairus sent us a video the night before the game how to beat Virginia,
what we got to do against their defense. And I think we have the guards to
beat almost everybody off the dribble and create plays for our teammates.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: Once we started hitting 3s, we were able to get inside past
them even more and kick it right back out for 3 again. So we know we were
going to have the make a lot of 3s. We were 12 for 24 in 3s. That was really
huge.  
  
Q. Jairus, for those of us who don't know your complete background
story, you have graduated, correct? And did you have chances to go other
places to play? And I guess you have a relationship, pretty close
relationship, with the president. I wonder if you can take us through why you
ended up staying there and who else was interested in you and why did you stay
at UMBC?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Well, I won't get into too much of who else was interested in
me, but I kind of made a quick decision of staying at UMBC. Wasn't really a
decision for me. I knew I was going to stay there all along. This is my
family. I created a legacy here. I knew we could do things like this. This is
one of the reasons I came back. I have a great relationship with our
president. Last year I got to spend a day with him. The first time I met him,
I got to spend one -- like a whole day with him. It was very special to see
how he operates on the campus, just follow him around.  
  
Q. What is it you like about him?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Authentic he was. He was honest with me. We got to talk about
more than basketball. We weren't just talking about basketball, talked about
life after basketball, his story, my story. So we kind of connected real
quick.  
  
Q. Question is all three of you. So many teams come through here and
they say we just have to be better for 40 minutes and we can win this and
nobody really believes them. You guys believe that you can do this and you are
only here because of a late basket in your conference championships. What
makes all three of you and your whole team believe that you can and will
win?  
JOE SHERBURNE: Go ahead.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think the trust we got in each other is what gives us that
little boost. Play for 40 minutes or to hit a game-winning basket. We trust
each other so much that Coach called a play against Vermont, me and Jairus
waived him off. We said we got this. We know what to do. So I think yeah, the
confidence we got in each other and the trust is a key for our success right
now.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like K.J. said, we're very connected as a team. We're very
close with our coaching staff. The players on and off the court very close. We
just trust each other. Every decision we make on the court, we're encouraging
guys to shoot the ball like we don't really ever want him to pass when he gets
it. We're just very connected as a team.  
  
Q. This is for Jairus or K.J. I was talking with one of your assistant
coaches outside and I was talking about your head coach, Coach Odom. He stated
he's very even-keeled and as you guys were going on that run, his kind of
demeanor helps keep you guys calm. Can you talk about him and that and going
into this game and how he's helping you guys manage kind of the emotion and
how big this moment is for y'all?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Well, he has a great role model in his dad who coached at the
biggest stage on this level. So he does a great job of bringing to us what his
dad brought to him. He keeps us even-keeled. We keep him even-keeled. He never
really gets too angry with us. He doesn't really yell at us like that. He's a
player's coach. We kind of like that as players.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think he brings a winning mentality to our team. Since he
touched campus, he told us we're not underdogs, we step on the court to win a
game. Even when we was up 16-14 with four minutes left, he kept us on track,
like don't get too confident. Finish the game the right way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question?  
  
Q. The call against Vermont that you guys waved off, it wasn't the game
winning shot, was it?  
K.J. MAURA: Yes, it was.  
  
Q. So what was the call? You guys just waved it off and you two just
knew what to do.  
K.J. MAURA: He looked at me and said run -- I can't say the play. Run a
handoff play. And it was like no, we wanted to isolate Jairus and let him take
him. Then he called another play and we also said no, we don't want to screen.
Jairus one-on-one. We knew he was going the take the shot and make it.  
  
Q. It was a 3, right?  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. Okay, guys. Thank you.  
  
RYAN ODOM: I'll just take questions.  
  
Q. Ryan, your dad outside said that when you started your coaching
career, he did not want to put you on his coaching staff, wanted to sort of
let you find your own way. What were sort of the good things and the bad
things for you about that path and what impact do you think it might have had
on where you are now?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, I think it's only negative I would say is that we didn't have
that experience together, father and son, you know, coaching together. I think
that could be -- it has been for others a special, special thing.  
  
But, you know, I think it was best for me, you know, without a doubt. Dad, you
know how it is, your dad knows best. For me, it allowed me to experience
basketball and allowed me to experience coaching under other great coaches.
And I've worked for some great coaches along the way and to gain new
experience and new ideas, new styles, which has helped me in this moment right
now for sure.  
  
Q. Players said that they didn't get to sleep until 5:00 or 6:00. It's
certainly understandable. How concerned are you there will be a let-down that
maybe they accomplished everything and be a let-down against Kansas State?  
RYAN ODOM: It's always a concern. This is a historic event. And our guys, we
knew that would be an issue. I'm not the type guy that's going to take their
phone. That's just not how I do things. It's more about they've got do the
right thing, learn how to do the right thing. And, you know, for us, we
experienced this on a much smaller scale when Jairus hit the shot at Vermont.
You know, there was a ton of focus, you know, on us at that point that we
weren't really used to, mostly within the UMBC community, greater Baltimore
area, everybody was excited about going to the dance.  
  
Now this is a little bit different story here. We've got to encourage our
guys, and I already have, you know, to kind of turn the page and we got to
focus here. The biggest thing is, do you want to be done now or do you want to
try to put your best foot forward and continue on? We're playing an excellent
team, all right, that easily could dismantle us. We've got to do a great job
of focusing, just like we have every other game that we've played this season
to put our best foot forward to have a chance.  
  
Q. This is really oversimplification. But do you ever a sense of being
America's team right now and just the idea of the country getting behind
this?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, when you see Sports Center talking about other events and
comparing the game yesterday to other historic events in sports, it's pretty
special, it really is. We certainly understand that. I want our guys to soak
that in, without a doubt. But there are two sides to it, too, for me. It's
obviously a bittersweet moment because I have so much respect for Tony
Bennett, his staff and team, you know. We've got this major emotional high and
obviously they've got this emotional low, you know, at this point. And it's
two different things going on and it's life, you know, it is. It's life.  
  
Q. I did want to ask you about Tony. He was so gracious after really a
rotten situation for him last night. I wonder if you could elaborate on your
sense of him and your appreciation of how he handled it?  
RYAN ODOM: To me he's the best coach in the country. He's a great father
figure, great mentor to his team, not only his players but his staff. He's a
great representative of the university and college basketball in general. I
said it before we played them. They're what college basketball should be all
about and they have high character kids, they have great students, they
compete, you know, to the bitter end in every game, and they don't pat
themselves on the back after they get a win and they do special things.  
  
You know, they understand that they're in this situation for a reason and, you
know, there should be a lot of programs modeling themselves after what he's
been able to do.  
  
Q. Ryan, obviously a few years ago you were put in a difficult situation
here taking over for Allen. What did you learn from that experience? And then
kind of looking back on it, obviously I would imagine there's disappointment
in how it ended. How would you characterize what you learned and where you
went from here?  
RYAN ODOM: Just to be ready at all times, you know. There's going to be --
life is going to throw you some things, you know, that you have to adjust to.
And certainly that was the situation where our primary concern was Allen's
health. And thankfully he's good to go now, and I spoke to him prior to the
NCAA Tournament and he's doing really well.  
  
But, I mean what I did learn most? It was faith. That's what I learned most
during that time. It was a dark moment, certainly for me and others. And, you
know, if you don't have faith you're not going to be able to get through it.
If you don't have your family to help you through those tough times, you're
not going to get through it.  
  
I'm fortunate that I have both and, you know, the good Lord looked out for me
and my family. My son was sick at the time, and so we had a lot of stuff going
on. And, you know, to be sitting in this situation right now, I mean it's a
blessing. It's not me, it's a blessing.  
  
Q. Coach, you played a team last night that prides itself on defense and
you're going to run into that again tomorrow night. Give me how these two
teams are similar defensively and how much they're differently, do this
different?  
RYAN ODOM: Repeat that.  
  
Q. How are these two teams similar defensively and how are they
different?  
RYAN ODOM: I think they are very similar. I think they're very balanced on
both sides of the ball. You know, I think Virginia in terms of ball screens
when they're facing ball screens is very aggressive and they know exactly what
they're doing. They step out hard. Kansas State does it a little bit
differently, but it's a similar effect in that they don't let you inside of
the 3-point line and we're going to have to find ways to still get in there.
That's what we do. We kind of are who we are. We drive the ball. We try to get
inside the defense to be able to kick the ball out or finish at the rim like
Jairus was able to do last night. They are very similar in that they're very
stingy in the half court. I think offensively they're a little bit different.
That's where the major differences are between the two teams.  
  
Q. I know you said you're trying to get your guys to turn the page. Roy
Williams was in here earlier. He said if it was him, he would have to scream
at some point last night to sort of acknowledge it all happened. What was your
night like last night? Did you ever have any sort of release and how are you
trying to get the guys to turn the next page and really focus?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean, obviously it's a tremendous moment, you know, for
basketball in general, tremendous moment for UMBC. We have a great university,
you know. I'm so excited for our kids to be in this moment, but I'm so excited
-- I'm equally excited for UMBC. And we've got a great institution. We have
great leadership, starting from Dr. Hrabowshi to my AD sitting in the room
here, Tim Hall. So many great people. And, you know, for UMBC to be able to
tell its own story now across the world is really, really exciting for me.  
  
What was your other question?  
  
Q. How do you keep the kids focused?  
RYAN ODOM: It's just -- we got to do what we got to do at this point. We're
going to turn the page to Kansas State and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. Some of the Virginia players were saying last night that the way you
defended them reminded them in some ways of what Virginia Tech did to them in
their only ACC loss of the season. Was that part of the preparation footage of
that, and if so, what did you take from that?  
RYAN ODOM: I watched the last five or six ACC games, plus the conference
tournament. We felt like our only chance was to pressure their guards. We had
to outplay their guards in order to have a chance and we had to hold our own
inside. And we felt like if we allowed them -- whoever had the ball up top to
just direct. Like I would equate it to like a quarterback. If you don't put
any pressure on the quarterback, then he's going the see wherever he needs to
see. And guy comes open on the wing, oop, he can make the pass.  
  
So our focus was totally on disrupt the ball handler up top, disrupt their
timing, and that was kind of our focus throughout. And I thought it put us in
position. Our guys were tremendously tough getting through screens. They set a
ton of screens and really hard to guard. And they tire you out, you know, with
that screening. I thought our guys played really, really tough and the
rebounding was critical for us.  
  
Q. Offbeat question, but you had mentioned UMBC and kind of getting your
brand out there worldwide and certainly nationwide. In the niche community of
chess, you guys have been known for a long time. When did you become familiar
with the program history with chess and that niche community and have you had
any overlap at all in the past?  
RYAN ODOM: They won a national championship. We're obviously equally proud of
them, you know, as we are of winning this game. That's the great thing about
UMBC. Everybody cheers for one another across campus. There's so many
different things going on on campus that, you know, it creates a great
environment, you know to learn in. Lot of great mentors. None better than our
president. His relationship with Jairus is -- he's the best president in the
country. I've been fortunate that I've been around lot of different places and
he's -- to be as active as he is and within our teams and not just men's
basketball, it's all the teams, you know, is really, really special. And it's
not just -- obviously athletics. He's so -- and STEM is huge and they're
patterning programs, copying programs that UMBC is doing across the country.  
  
Q. Ryan, for many coaches who pull big upsets in the tournament it's a
life-changing, career-changing type of moment. Have you had a sense in the
last 18 hours how maybe -- how your life is going to change going forward
based on what happened last night?  
RYAN ODOM: No. I'm just totally focused right now on our team, you know, and
where we're at in this moment. This is such a special moment. I'm so excited
for them to be able to play, you know, for an opportunity to go to the Sweet
16. That's mind-boggling to me. I'm going to do my best to help coach them and
mentor them through this, and hopefully we'll put our best foot forward and
have a chance.  
  
Q. Ryan, great first name. My question is, it's obvious that all the
casual viewers who tune in tomorrow's game on TV will be cheering for you. How
much does it mean to you, knowing anyone in here that's not wearing K-State
colors, who maybe only heard about you in the last 48 hours are going to be on
your side the whole time?  
RYAN ODOM: It's huge. I think Jairus mentioned it last night. He was so
excited about all the UMBC folks that traveled down here for the game. We had
a pretty big contingent here. And to hear them cheering for the guys and --
gave them a lot of energy and that's what March Madness is all about, and
we're just happy that we're a part of it.  
  
Q. Ryan, I've had the pleasure of meeting your father, and when this
conversation started, you talked about not coaching with him. But I am curious
as to even though you didn't, what you've learned the most about the game from
your dad?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. Certainly just to be passionate and to be all for these kids.
That's what he did. His entire career was never about him, you know. His focus
was totally on his players and helping them become the best that they could
be, both on and off the court. That's why I do this. And I'm very fortunate
that I'm able to do it at UMBC with these tremendous kids.  
  
Q. Coach, the challenge of preparing for Kansas State when most of their
film has Dean Wade on it as a traditional big 4 and now they're having to play
small without him. How much does that change them offensively and
defensively?  
RYAN ODOM: I haven't watched them a ton with him at this point. Yeah, I think
it definitely changes. They're certainly very athletic when they play that
smaller lineup. Their ability to get inside of the defense worries me. Their
athleticism, their bodies against our guards. We're going to have to do a
tremendous job of trying to keep them out of the paint. Our big guys are going
to have to really fight. They're very opportunistic in transition. So when
their defense is really going and they're knocking balls loose, they're
excellent at finishing ahead. I watched the Kansas game this morning, and that
was a knockdown, drag-out, closer than the final score indicated at the end
there, but, you know, we're excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. As a follow-up with that, Dean Wade is a first team all Big 12 guy.
In some strange way, losing him, does that make them pair better against you
now that their 4 guards are very similar to what you do?  
RYAN ODOM: We'll see. I don't know. I think certainly bigger guys can
sometimes struggle against us. I think that's what you're saying there in
terms of spacing and having to guard the line, you know, but 40 minutes. You
got to play it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you.  
  
RYAN ODOM: Thanks.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from Texas A&M. We have from
left to right, TJ Starks, who is a freshman; Admon Gilder, junior; Tyler
Davis, junior; and Robert Williams to my immediate left, sophomore.  
  
Q. Tyler and Admon, if you could take us through the opportunity of
going up against the defending champs, basically in their backyard, and the
excitement for that.  
TYLER DAVIS: It's a blessing to be able to compete against such a great coach
and team. It's was a lot work done for, you live for these opportunities.
We're all excited and ready to play.  
  
ADMON GILDER: Like Tyler says, a blessing to be playing against a winning
organization. Each one of us are ready to play. Give it our best effort.  
  
Q. There's this is a question for TJ. I don't know how much you expected
that you would be playing during this season when it began, but can you tell
us a little bit about like what you thought was going to happen and how it
sort of evolved into you playing such an important role?  
TJ STARKS: At the beginning of the season, I knew I was going to contribute to
the team, but I didn't know that I was going to take on a great role the way I
am right now. So, I just put in a lot of work and I knew my time was going to
come eventually, so I was really prepared for the moment.  
  
Q. Robert or Tyler, I don't know how much you know about Carolina, but
they have a different lineup this year. They're not as big as they've been in
previous years. How do you guys feel like you match up with them? Do you feel
like you do have an advantage on the inside against them?  
THE MODERATOR: Robert.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: Yeah, we definitely feel like we have an advantage obviously
against anybody on the inside because of what we do. Carolina is a different
matchup. Their bigs, 1 through 5, shoot. It's going to be a difficult task for
us. But our coaches are putting together a good game plan and hope we'll beat
them.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: I feel like we always have the advantage on the inside, but their
bigs are really talented. It's going to be a different way to guard them.
Going to be tough to guard, but I feel like we have the versatility to guard
any position.  
  
Q. Robert and Tyler, you guys have had a few different starting point
guards during this season. Is having the point guard changing, does that force
you guys to adjust or do the point guards sort of play up -- play a particular
style in a system? Tell us about adjusting to different guys at the point.  
TYLER DAVIS: We just -- we play to the system, but I mean not every point
guard is the same. TJ, he's a scoring point, but, you know, we play to his
strengths and he plays our strengths. I think we did a good job of that.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: Like TJ is a scoring point guard and with that ability, he
opens up a lot of stuff for the team of the guards and we use it to our
strength.  
  
Q. Tyler and for TJ. TJ, if you could speak to the challenge of going up
against Joel Barry. And then defensively, Tyler, they've got Maye at the 5,
how difficult of a challenge that is?  
TJ STARKS: Joel Barry, he's a senior guard. Of course, he has good experience,
so I just have to come ready to play. I know he's going to give me a good
challenge. We have to stay focused and stick to the game plan.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Luke is really good. I know what kind of player he is and what
kind of mindset he has. He has the worker's mindset. He's going to come at me
hard like he does everybody else, from what I've seen. It's going to be a fun
matchup. It's going to be a lot of fun having to guard him.  
  
Q. The veterans for Carolina have played 13 games I guess now, in this
tournament over the last three seasons. How do you guys combat that experience
edge that they have, and how have you prepared for the tournament setting
where you're getting ready for a game 48 hours after you had played another
game against a team that you don't see regularly?  
THE MODERATOR: Admon.  
  
ADMON GILDER: We just stick to the Coach's plan. We try to play our brand of
basketball each and every game. And like we've seen last night on the TV, it's
anybody's game. So as long as we come out and play hard and play aggressive,
it's anybody's game.  
  
Q. If I could, I'd like to go one each for TJ and Admon. TJ, when you
got handed the keys to the car, what was that conversation like with Coach?
Probably wasn't something that you initially were expecting. Tell us about
what that dialogue was like.  
TJ STARKS: He just tell me to play my game, just do what I know how to do.
Told me to stay poised and just control the game, control the tempo. And he
tell me that I don't play like a freshman, I don't act like a freshman. So he
just tell me to be mature about the situation and handle it the right way. And
I feel like that's what I've been doing this whole time, and I just keep
believing in him and he believing in me and we just going to keep rolling.  
  
Q. Admon, after a couple of different people have played point guard, TJ
steps into the role and you guys end up being successful. How important was it
that he was there to sort of step in there? If you don't have TJ, how do you
think the arc of the season might have gone?  
ADMON GILDER: I know TJ is a hard worker. I say that each and every day. He's
in the gym every day before and after practice. And I guess, you know, if he
wasn't there, I guess we'd know he's the next man up. That's how this program
is. So I think everybody on this team has done a great job of being ready to
play. And so, like we said, we just go out there and do what we do.  
  
Q. Guys talk about it, I guess this is for Tyler, Robert. This is
essentially a home game for Carolina. Talk about playing in this type of
environment, and do you think the fans going against you will kind of fuel you
or work against you?  
THE MODERATOR: Tyler.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: We've done pretty well on the road in neutral court games. So,
they're going to have a really good crowd, lot of fun, lot of energy. But we
know it's going to be us out there battling against everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Robert.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: We know they're going to have a big crowd out there. We know,
we live for the moment, we play and impact the way of games. We feel like
there's nothing but fuel. We don't fear it at all.  
  
Q. Admon, you touched on this a minute ago, what was it like for you as
a basketball player, even though they're in the opposite pod, watching the
UMBC game last night?  
ADMON GILDER: We were watching at the hotel. It was just amazing to see how
UMBC came and they played, brought it to them. They played hard, they played
their brand of basketball. That's what we try to put our hats on playing our
brand of basketball wherever we play. And so we have great bigs. We have great
guards who play different positions. Just knowing that -- seeing that, it
gives -- gives teams around the country knowing it's anybody's game in any
given night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay, guys. Thank
you. Good job.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Excited to have advanced in the tournament. That's what it's all
about, and makes you feel a big part of it when you win a game and you can
kind of follow how the tournament goes. And to play against a Carolina team
here in Charlotte is something that every coach and every player would be
looking forward to. So we're really excited to be playing against a really
good team. Know we'll have to play really well to get the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the arc of your season to arrive here, how much of
that do you think had to do with the depth that you had at point guard on this
roster this season?  
BILL KENNEDY: You know, I think we played a lot of different lineups, we've
gone through a lot of different things. And I think just the experience of
playing TJ starks at the 2 earlier in the year and he played -- backed up the
1 against some really good preseason teams that we played, he's been -- his
first start was at Kansas, I think helped get him ready for this moment. I
think that's a good point. I think that's one of the reasons why we're here
today is because he's been through some different things and our team has been
through some different things. We've weathered the storm and been pretty
resilient through it.  
  
Q. Just to follow-up on that, yes, you did weather the storm. What was
it like being the coach in the storm?  
BILL KENNEDY: It wasn't a dream situation. some of the things we went through.
One of my toughest years as a coach because we had such great expectations and
started off so well. We started out 11-1, fifth in the country, and rose up
real fast and we did it with a broken lineup even then. Robert Williams didn't
play against West Virginia in the beginning of the year. We added him to the
team in Brooklyn and we continued to win and we continued to press on, and I
thought we got better and then we had the injuries. The injuries were the
biggest problem. When you lose Duane Wilson, who is an older senior for us and
experienced, one of the true experienced guys that we had, that's been in the
NCAA Tournament, that's played in the Big East, played -- we lost of him. That
was a big loss. Losing Admon Gilder the first, I think, four games of
conference play is not when you want to lose a guy to injury. He had had knee
surgery and came back and really muffled up our lineup, muffled up our
rotations. We started one group one way and then next week we started the
older guys and went back and forth. So, hopefully that we survived it, it made
us tougher. Our guys hung in there and believed what we were telling them and
thankfully we're in this position today.  
  
Q. I came in a couple minutes late from your locker room. I've sorry if
this was asked before. The challenge Joe Barry presents your freshman point
guard when North Carolina has the ball, but then also when they run Maye at
the 5, which they've been doing, the challenge that that presents
defensively.  
BILL KENNEDY: No question. He's the most experienced, probably best point
guard in Roy Williams's system in a long time. When you look at the games
they've won and what he's done. I saw him in high school, he's a five-star
player, won a State Championship. The kid is about winning. The kid -- he
understands how Coach Williams wants to play and it will be a tough matchup.
But TJ hasn't surprised me. There are no surprises with TJ. He can make two
great plays, he can make two plays and I'm pulling my hair out. So, I don't
think there's anything that TJ is afraid of. That's the one thing we like
about him. He doesn't lack any confidence and that's a good guy to have in
your fox hole when you're going against Carolina in Charlotte, to have
somebody who is not afraid.  
  
So, hopefully he won't get caught up in the transition game and we won't just
run up and down with them because that's not something we want to do. We want
to wait on our bigs. It will be a new experience for him, but I like our
chances because of his confidence and what he's been through already.  
  
Q. With Maye?  
BILL KENNEDY: With Luke Maye, that's a tough matchup with anybody. That's why
they've won so many games, because he's an experienced post guy who goes on
the floor and push it on the break. I knew they were really good. I knew their
personnel before. I was sort of watching them on tape. As you watch them on
tape, you see Theo Pinson pushing the ball in transition one minute and Luke
Maye the next play and back to Joel Barry. That's what makes them so good in
transition. You can prepare for it but -- in a short amount of time, but you
don't know how good until you see it.  
  
Q. Coach, we saw history last night. It's known that Carolina has never
lot of a game in Charlotte. Is that something you talk to your team about, you
know, let's do something else, let's make more history here in Charlotte as
you head into this?  
BILL KENNEDY: That just motivates me a little bit more. I didn't know that.
We'll use that as motivation. We've got -- we're going to come in here loose
and play. That's the thing, we come in here and have fun and enjoy the
experience. And we're here to win. We're not here to just show up. We've
talked about this moment from the spring on last year. The Final Four is in
San Antonio. We don't want to go there to eat chips and salsa. We want to
play. In order to play, you got to be able to beat Carolina or beat good teams
that are in your way. We'll use that as motivation. And we know it's a tough
task because Coach Williams is a great coach and Carolina is Carolina
basketball. You just know it's going to be a challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the challenges that Joel Barry and Luke may
present. What about this matchup gives you confidence? What are the things you
like before you go into this next game?  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, we've got five guys who can get you double figures
anytime, also. At the 3, 4, 5, and our length and size is something they've
not seen a whole lot of. I thought Providence, Coach Cooley made an
interesting comment that our length really bothered them. Until you go through
it and see it, you know, it's a tough experience. So, hopefully our inside
play and our size will be a factor and our guards will make shots. When our
guards make shots and take care of the ball, we're hard to beat because Robert
Williams and Tyler Davis are a load in the post.  
  
Q. Playing with motivation and playing with momentum is a great thing
and a bad thing. How do you hone in that motivation into something great
instead of it's overwhelming your players into making mistakes to where it
causes a problem?  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, again, you hope preseason experience and the teams we've
played, you look at who we played against and playing at Kentucky and playing
against a good Arizona team on the West Coast, Kansas. We've seen a lot of
different things. You hope your experience prepares you for this moment. But
you never know until you go through it. That's the one advantage Carolina has
over probably anybody else. They'll play all year and they've had it all
season long, they've experienced a national championship and experienced it
moreso than any other team left playing.  
  
So, if you're going to get past that, it's good to play -- now is as good a
time to go through it.  
  
Q. Coach, there's only a limited number of hours that you get to prepare
for this game. Can you sort of give us an idea about how much of the time is
spent focusing on the things that you guys have done and how much of it is
taking a look at Carolina and what you can do to them?  
BILL KENNEDY: We do transition defensive drills everyday. So I mean, we spend
-- from the beginning of the year to this time of the year, even today we
practiced, we work on transition defense. That's an emphasis. But in the short
amount of time -- we got to watch them play the first ten minutes here and
then we went back at the hotel. And not knocking Lipscomb, because we know
anybody can win, but we started watching Carolina right away. And the thing
about Carolina, I've been watching them my whole life. So, I think we'll know
more about them than they'll know about us. I hope that's an advantage.  
  
You know, you see them all the time. You don't see Texas A&M on television
every night or hopefully you're starting to see us more and more. It is
different. Yesterday, yesterday that's all I did. I was locked in my hotel
room watching film, trying to get as familiar with their personnel as
possible. Today we're going to go through it, show film tonight, and then
we'll just go play. But you got to hope that your body of work in practice
throughout the season prepared you for this and not just this last day and a
half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions.  
  
Q. Billy, I don't know if you heard Roy Williams' comments yesterday,
but he called you one of his heroes because of what you've had to go through
as a coach and through seven years and maintaining strength and overcoming a
lot with your health situation. What did that mean to you when you heard
that?  
BILL KENNEDY: It's obviously special because I got so much respect for Coach
Williams and we've talked about it on the road some, because he's had some
health issues and he knows some people that have had Parkinson's Disease. He
understands that it's a challenge, and he's really been supportive. Every time
I see him, Roy is Roy, he's a special man, he's a special coach. And for him
to say something like that it's definitely touching and encouraging.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions at all? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

### [Kenny Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34857)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 84  
  
Lipscomb - 66  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm not going to start out by telling you how Tiger stands
because I don't know how Tiger stands. I'm very appreciative of these guys up
here with me and very appreciative of the guys in the locker room. We didn't
play our best. Lipscomb was more active than we were early. We had I think
five turnovers in the first eight minutes and they had more points off
turnovers at half and ended up with more points off turnovers than we did. I
looked down at the stat sheet and we have five guys in double figures. We
shoot almost 52 percent, hold them to 36 percent.  
  
So, there were a lot of good things. I think late in the first half, I yelled
at them in the huddle and they tried to show me how dumb I was and they went
out and played very well the last four minutes and got us a little bit of a
margin and then just kept playing and making plays. Theo was 15 points, 10
rebounds, 7 assists. I love that. Kenny being 4 of 5 from 3-point line. So,
you got to win one to be able to stay around and so we won one, and I'm
pleased for the guys up here and the guys in the locker room.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kenny and Theo.  
  
Q. Kenny, just talk about how special today was for you.  
KENNY WILLIAMS: It was very special. I was excited all week to come to play.
My first game playing heavy minutes in the NCAA Tournament. So, you know, this
is what you look forward to growing up. So, you know, I was a little bit more
excited about that.  
  
Q. Theo, what was your preparation for Garrison Mathews?  
THEO PINSON: Just to make everything tough. I mean watching clip tape, you
thought everything he was going to throw up go in. So, we just wanted the make
everything tough, and we knew we couldn't support the that much on him. Once
he gets going, he gets going. I remember I was watching because Mike was my
teammate, so I was watching the championships game and I saw he had like 39 or
36 or something like that. I knew if he got going it could be a long night for
us.  
  
Q. Theo, can you tell me when you incorporated the coast-to-coast part
of your game and why exactly that happened? Did you get the Coach's
permission? Did you see the floor open? When was that and why was that?  
THEO PINSON: I think I got coast-to-coast when I was five. I remember when I
was five, they got mad at me because we was doing jump balls and I just
grabbed the ball and tried to go coast-to-coast and lay the ball up. It didn't
start now. Building confidence and understanding that I have a gift and I
could put pressure on the defense, especially playing at the 4 position, I'm
the trailing big so it gives me a little more room to operate and make plays
for my teammates and myself.  
  
Q. Theo, you just said you're the 4, yet you've become the main
distributor ever since went with the small lineup. How have you embraced that
role, and have you had to change your game to adapt to it?  
THEO PINSON: It's just -- that's something I've been doing since I've been
here, trying to make plays and give get my teammates open and open shots. At
the same time I'm more -- I'm a focal point now. People want to stop that, of
course, but at the same time, I think if I can get into the paint or I can
draw somebody's defender and we got great shooters, like Coach said, we got
really good shooting team Cam, Joel, Luke and Kenny. We even had a
conversation during the game. I tried to get Kenny's man to draw to me a
little bit longer, which I could have picked to him, but just trying to make a
play and get his defender to come off so I can kick it to the great shooters
we have.  
  
Q. Kenny, you guys had some trouble getting clear of them the first
half, but was it a matter of just not turning the ball over and did you feel
like once you kind of took care of that, you'd be okay?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Yeah. We were turning the ball over. That's what kind of gave
them confidence. I think they had 13 points off turnovers in the first half.
That gave them a little confidence and let them stick around. We were beating
ourselves. Once we got over that hump, we were all right from there and we
just had to get stops and finish on the other end.  
  
Q. This is almost the same question. But Theo, why do you think you guys
started so slow and was that a product of whatever?  
THEO PINSON: I don't really know. I guess just trying to get your feet wet.
It's a big time game. You win or go home. It's the bottom line. If you don't
have jitters, you're not human. We needed to get our feet wet, and once you
saw we got going, we got going and I think we responded well.  
  
Q. Question for Theo -- actually I'm going take one for each. Theo,
question for you is, Kenny was really good on the 3 point arc today. When you
guys were in Brooklyn, he did a lot of finishing the break. What part of his
game do you really, really impresses you the most?  
THEO PINSON: He's a basketball player. That's the biggest thing. People want
to just call him one thing and that's a shooter. I mean today he made a left-
hand floater, left-hand floater. Wasn't it left hand? He's just not --  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: That was a bad shot. That was a bad shot.  
  
THEO PINSON: But he showed them he can make it. So maybe he got an opportunity
to do it again. Kenny is a basketball player. That's the type of players Coach
recruit that they can do more than one thing. Just showed today.  
  
Q. Kenny, since it became the post-season you've been playing really
well. Is there something about the big games that you think maybe stirs
something inside of you?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: You know, I think so. I'm competitive, so I think that's just
the competitive nature of me wants to step up when the games get bigger. And
also know now it's do or die, win or lose, win or you go home. I know I had to
step up my play going into the post-season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Kenny or Theo?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Before they leave, let's get this straight. That was a bad shot.
You guys need some coaching. Why was it a bad shot?  
  
THEO PINSON: I don't know.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: I don't know.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: He doesn't practice it during practice games. I'm dumbfounded,
this rascal doesn't have the answer. He was standing under the basket. All he
had to do was bounce, pass, layup.  
  
THEO PINSON: I clapped like you did.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Theo is always ready to stay longer if you need him.  
  
Q. Roy, can you speak to the way that Kenny has played here down in the
post-season?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, he has had some good games. He's had a pretty doggone good
year. I think he's one of the five best defensive players in our league. He
led our team in charges, he's really good defensively. Today, he picked up the
two early fouls but he made two 3s, but he's had a pretty doggone good year
all year.  
  
Now, one thing, the team the other night when he got somebody else asked a
question about his layups -- you or Roger or somebody else? Makes no
difference. The other night they were trying to press us. So Theo broke the
press and threw it to Kenny because we do believe in attacking against the
press. He's a really good basketball who is hungry. Last year he got hurt and
didn't play all that time period. His freshman year, he was 1 for 13 from 3.
He likes having success. But he has had really a good year for us all year.
He's been our most consistent defender. And I'm not sure who is the leading
3-point shooter, either he or Luke. They shot it pretty well. He's taking it
to a little bit of a different level, which is okay for me.  
  
Q. Roy, you said yesterday you wanted the team to have fun here and
enjoy themselves. Was your pregame routine chilling with your grandson there
on the bench, was that part of your effort to have fun?  
ROY WILLIAMS: No. The kids grow old so quickly. I used to get Courtney on the
bench if I could, mostly at home. I never let Scott come down to the bench.
That's one of the things I regret. So later on after he got older, Neil was my
assistant, even I got Neil to have his sons down on the bench. We came back to
Chapel Hill and I got Coach Robinson and his sons and the same thing for Coach
Davis. I love the picture a hundred years ago. You guys never saw the picture.
I saw a picture of Tark sitting on the bench and his son Danny was sitting on
the bench with a coat and tie on. Danny will hate me saying that looked like a
sweet little kid. I've always remembered that. I know I didn't have that neat
memory with my own son.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you've been successful at a lot of places. You're
now 15-0 in this building, 12-0 in Charlotte. What about Charlotte brings out
the best in the Tar Heels?  
ROY WILLIAMS: We have good players who have really played well. The fans do
help us, and I'm willing to see if we can pass a law that says we play all the
NCAA games here. I'd be willing to go for that. But usually we played really
well here. '05 -- excuse me, '05 particularly I thought we played great here.
So, players play. I've never lost to a building, but this has been very
comfortable for us. Hopefully, it will last one more game.  
  
Q. Roy, Joel Berry passes Michael Jordan on the all time scoring list. I
know Michael didn't play four years, but is that a line of demarcation for a
Carolina player? How would you put that into perspective when you pass him in
the record book in that way?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm sure every kid, you know, you say something like that, I
start grinning. I mean, my gosh, but the 23 was pretty good. Having that extra
year probably would have helped him, too. But you still, you're ahead of
Michael Jordan in something. Lot of guys aren't ahead of Michael Jordan in
anything. I'm happy for Joel. But also I've never had a point guard goal tend
a shot that was not going to go in. Let's remember that's one thing I told him
on the bench and in the locker room, to goal tend a shot that is not going in
was not the smartest point guard play I ever had.  
  
Q. Roy, you're going to go up against a big strong team Sunday. Have you
seen a team like that this year? How will you matchup with Texas A &M?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'm sitting on the fence with it because I haven't seen them
very much. Maybe it was the ACC tournament. I watch a lot of games, but it's
games against people we're getting ready to play. I watch 10 or 15 minutes of
an NBA game if one of our guys is in there. I saw a few minutes -- I think,
who did they play first game of the year, some other country? West Virginia.
Wasn't it out of our country? I watched that. That was the first game. Watched
a little bit of that.  
  
I saw them play a little bit of Kansas for about 6, 7 minutes. So I really --
I know Davis is a heck of a tough kid around the basket. I know Williams -- I
wish I were related because he's as good an athlete as I've seen. His dunks,
he dunks them straight down. His dunks don't go in sideways.  
  
Billy, just think about what that guy has gone through physically and mentally
over the last five or six or seven years. I'm a big fan of his. I'm a big
admirer, the health problems that he's had and still doing what he's doing the
way he's done it. I really am. I'm a big hero. He's one of my big heroes
because he's handled some tough stuff. But I don't know that much about their
team, and I need to find out a lot more in the next 48 hours. I know a lot
about their head coach and I'm a great admirer of his.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Three more questions.  
  
Q. Roy, Scott tells people he's really pissed off at you for sitting him
on the bench.  
ROY WILLIAMS: I offered it to him, but I let him get a little bit too old. He
said he would rather sit with his buddies. I know he has not said what you
just said, either.  
  
Q. Same thing about Theo, the busting out, is that the alignment or his
maturity or you just saying take the dadgone ball to the basket? How did that
happen?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's something that's been happening since Theo started playing,
number one. But this year it stands out more because he is the 4 man. The 4
man has got to try to pick him up. Every year even, Theo's freshman year, for
Justin Jackson, for Harrison Barnes, every perimeter player I've ever coached,
I said if you get the ball off the board, I want you to bust out on the break
because I'm old school, old guy. The best fast break basketball I ever saw in
my life was Magic Johnson getting the ball off the backboard. It wasn't when
Kareem got it and made an outlet pass or James Worthy made an outlet pass.
It's when Magic got it off. He busted out on the break and already left two
defensive players behind. He made good decisions on the other end and could
take it to the basket himself and lay it up.  
  
I'm not trying to say that Theo it is Magic Johnson, but that's been in my
brain for a long time. I coached that same way at Kansas, I've coached it that
way at North Carolina every year. The perimeter player gets the ball, busts it
out on the break. I think it's the best fast break there is.  
  
And Theo, his freshman year he had a bad assist to error ratio. His assist to
error ratio has been really good. A couple of his turnovers were offensive
fouls I thought were questionable. He's a play maker. I like for him to do
that. If he doesn't get the rebound, I want him to run to the low post on the
other end. Because again, the guy that's going to have to guard him is a 4
man, he's going to come and set a rear screen on the lob, gets him out on
court against a 4 man. It's been more evident because he's attempting it more
and the 4 guys are trying to pick him up.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your perimeter defense. You
took away your 3-point game today and really did a good job with that.  
ROY WILLIAMS: It was one of the three things I put up on the board. We put up
three things before every game. And it didn't have to be a nuclear physicist
to figure out we needed to stop them or try to hold they percentage down. We
really wanted them to not shoot a good percentage from 3-point line. That was
one of the things we put up. But you know, with our guys, we're the biggest
remedy for anybody that's got 3-point shooting woes. I'm telling you what, let
me make sure, Kenny Cooper was a 1-55 before tonight, so we decided to help
off in the post. He makes three of them. Another guy that made one at the end.
And I don't mean to pick on somebody that was 6-36. Like several years ago we
didn't go into Kentucky and play them they can't make a 3. Shoot, against us
they make every daggone one they look at. If you have a bad 3-shooting team,
just play us and you're percentage will go up quite a bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. UNC since the tournament kind of have rocky starts in the beginning.
How did you plan to combat that going throughout the tournament?  
ROY WILLIAMS: First of all, it's hard for me to answer when I disagree with
what your question is. Last year we played Texas Southern. We won by 40 or 50
or something. Justin made five 3s in the first half. Back in 1982 before you
were born, we had Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins, James Worthy and we blew out
James Madison in the first round 52-50. There have been some struggles there.
You just got to play. I've never thought we struggled in the first round. I've
always thought we struggled more each and every round we go. But winner stays,
loser goes home. That's the way we try to approach it. Thank you guys very
much.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 69  
  
Creighton - 59  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously we're so thrilled for our guys. You know, since day one
last spring when we got back, after, you know, we lost in the NCAA, took our
couple weeks off, Barry took leadership. They didn't question anything. They
came everyday, worked their tails off. And we said this is what you work for
to get this opportunity and thought they took advantage of it. We were very
well prepared. We said we have to guard them, they're one of the best
offensive teams in the country. Some of the best offensive players in the
country. We did a great job defensively, made it really tough on them.  
  
Obviously Barry did a great job on Marcus, who is a really good player. But
all our guys, it was a team defense and you hold them to 59, I don't know if
anyone has done that all year. I've looked at that closely, but it's pretty
impressive. And then, you know, we always talk about somebody stepping up and
having a special moment and obviously Mike McGuirl since the beginning, I
thought he was the surprise of our summer. And then he had injuries, and to
his credit, you know, he's been very, very patient. Took himself out of red
shirt when Cam got hurt and came back. He got his chance the last couple games
and rose up and plays like a veteran. Played a lot of big plays. Cam got us
off going, it was good for him to get his shot going. You could see a little
smile on his face. He had his struggles, but I thought both ends of the game,
and then Barry kind of took it over in the second half, you know, made the
plays we needed to make. So it was a great, great win for our guys. So happy
for them, and now we get to move on and, you know, see who we play on Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Cam and Barry, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Cam, for you specifically, how big a relief was it to come out, make
your first three shots, get your team the lead you guys pretty much held
throughout the game?  
KAMAU STOKES: Seeing the ball go, it really felt good. It all came down to
focusing on making a shot. And like I said, seeing the ball go through the
hoop felt really good.  
  
Q. Barkry, what was the key to shutting down Marcus? I know it's a team
thing, but you were on him most of the day.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Just I watched a lot of film with him -- I meant on him with
Coach Frazier, just trying to see where he picks his spots, what he likes to
do on offense, and kind of memorizing their plays a little bit. So I kind of
knew the play before they ran it through and so I was just jumping a lot of
stuff and kind of denying him a little bit and it worked out. My teammates had
my back, back doors and stuff like that, especially on switches and hedges and
ball screens. It worked out.  
  
Q. Barry, what was different about the way you guys operated without
Dean Wade tonight?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I felt like it was -- we had our backs against the wall
knowing D wasn't going to play. Like Coach said, credit to Mike. He stepped up
big time, gave us a big lift off the bench we needed. I mean, we missed some
of the stuff that D does. Some of the guys stepped up and rebound and defended
like it was our last game, and that's our mindset going through this turn.  
  
Q. When did you find out Dean wasn't going to play?  
THE MODERATOR: Cam.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: Game-time decision. We didn't know. Yeah, it was just a game-
time decision.  
  
Q. Can either one of you talk about the contributions of Mike McGuirl?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Mike he played his butt off today, 6 for 10 from the field,
3 of 5 from three. But all the little stuff you don't see. He had some great
defense. He might not have got a steal, but he had some great defensive
contributions, switches and talking and knowing where to be and helps out. He
had a great game today.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you --  
THE MODERATOR: Players first.  
  
Q. Barry then Cam, is this the most rewarding win you've been a part of
at K-State?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It's very rewarding to show what we're about, and we can not
only make the tournament win a game against a top offensive team, hold them to
59 points when they're averaging way more than that. It's very wonderful for
our guys to know how we worked in the off-season to be to this point.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: It's very rewarding knowing how hard we worked to get to this
point. We wanted to get here and win a game, and winning the game is
rewarding, but we still got work to do.  
  
Q. Barry, can you describe what it was like when Coach told you Wade
wasn't going to play? And for Cam, what did that make -- how did that make you
feel?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We knew -- like I said, we had our backs against the wall
without Dean and we huddled up and we had guys that stepped up. Mike stepped
up, like I said. Cam hit some shots. Cartier hit some shots. Everybody stepped
up and contributed a little more to make up with what Dean brings to the
table.  
  
Q. Told you in the locker room?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It was a game-time decision.  
  
Q. Cam, you were in the middle of a dynamic play towards of end of the
first half. Cartier blocked, you get the ball, alley ooped to Xavier. Talk
about how it helped you guys keep going with the momentum?  
KAMAU STOKES: A play like that is a momentum changer. Makes you feel good and
your energy goes up. Credit Xavier for running the floor. He always does that,
been doing that this whole year. It was an energy booster for us.  
  
Q. Barry, Creighton never led this game. That's not the first time
you've done that lead from wire to wire. Every time they made a push at you,
you guys pushed back. What's different about this team and how good are you at
maintaining leads like that?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, I think the Big 12 kind of prepared us for this time
and I think it's just we have a little bit more poise. Lot of guys played in
this situation before last year and we weren't able to pull it through, but I
think that year of experience helped us to stay poised and stay calm and
confident when they made that push. I think they cut it to like 2, and so we
were able to make the plays and defend and come out with a win.  
  
Q. Barry, I don't misquote you. You said something earlier this year
about riding with your Coach and how much he meant to you. Did you want to get
this win for him tonight?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I wanted to get this win for Coach. I know how much he cares
about it and how much times he puts into this basketball program when he could
be with his family. I really wanted to get it for him and our fans, just the
whole Wild Cat Nation. I want to get it for our players, myself, everyone.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more question for the student-athletes if anyone has one.
Nope. Okay. Thank you, Cam and Barry. You guys head back to the locker room.
Good job. We'll now take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sorry, Bruce. Could you, if you can, tell us what you said to Marcus
as he walked off the floor for the last time tonight?  
BRUCE WEBER: I just congratulated him. I said all along, you know, I have
nothing against him. I'm in this for -- I started years ago. I was a fifth
grade teacher. I coached kids on the playground and that. It's about kids and
that's why I've stayed in it. And I want guys to be successful and if he -- I
just said congratulations. I'm happy. I hope you got your head-on straight.
And he had a heck of a career.  
  
So, I mean I told him the same thing and asked about his mom. Got a great mom
and family. You know, again, I'm proud that I recruited him, coached him, and
I'm proud that, you know, I maybe helped him get in the right path or right
direction.  
  
Q. Coach, that was a season low for them, tied a season low, 59 points.
What was your strategy going in and how were you able to contain Foster?  
BRUCE WEBER: Barry is one of the better defenders in the country, and from day
one I asked when he was a freshman, I said who is going to be our stopper. He
raised his hand and he said I am. I just kind of blew it off. He's taken that
role, he loves it, he's -- and the thing he talked about, he has been in the
office every day since, you know, since Monday watching film on them. And
because we knew how good he was and what he did and you can take away a couple
of the quick hitters, where they get them on the back doors where he can get a
couple easy ones, you know, it makes it tougher on him on the tough shots to
contest it.  
  
The other thing we talked which was just stay in on him a lot, like Trae Young
we talked about, when he drove, we told him to call, to stay there, make him
make tough shots. He never -- he made one at the end, but other than that he
never really got going. So it was -- we've been good on defense. Plays some of
the best offensive teams in the country. We told the guys that this was
probably more like Kansas and Oklahoma or TCU, but, you know, they rose to the
occasion and they took the challenge on. And beside Barry, Xavier was really,
really effective, because Thomas is really good player, too, and Xavier did a
great job on him, gave us great energy, hit a big 3 when they kind of made a
run. Somebody asked about the question about seemed like every time they made
a run, we made the big plays. Xavier got some big rebounds. Obviously the free
throws was the one thing we could have been even a bigger margin. Just happy
to win and advance.  
  
Q. Bruce, in terms of when you're replacing Wade and dribbling his
minutes and responsibilities, I mean was McGuirl the like Option A or how --
what was the thought process by which you ended up with him taking those
minutes?  
BRUCE WEBER: We've been through this before when Kamau Stokes got hurt in the
third game at Big 12, breaks his foot at Texas Tech. That's when Barry showed
great leadership, called his own team practice, got with Dean, said hey, we've
got to take this team on our back. So they've been through it. Word I put on
the board today was "persistence." There's nothing more important in this
world than being persistent. You got to -- we told them we can't replace
Dean's scoring, but we can guard them. If we keep them at a minimum, then
somebody else has to step up. I guess the best thing was Mike and Amaad and
some of those guys got a chance against Kansas last Friday to get in there and
get a little confidence and feel good about themself. And so when they got in,
I mean obviously Mike didn't hesitate. It looked like he's been a starter or
played many minutes all year. So, you know, it had to be a team effort. I
thought we made some tough shots early, you know, but we kept making big plays
and Barry got going on some of those ball screen actions and in the second
half. Just a great team effort. You can't replace Dean. He's one of the best
players in the country. But you had to do it with great team work, great team
defense, and some people stepping up.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you talked about being happy for the guys, but how
gratifying is this for you? Does this relieve any pressure for you?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't worry about that. I'll be honest. It's just helping the
guys and preparing them and I put my heart and soul into everyday. I love
coaching, passion for coaching young men and watching them develop. And, you
know, it's about them having the experiences. I've had these experiences. Do I
want to go to the Final Four? Heck yeah, that was an unbelievable ride. It
would be fun to do something like that again. But, at the same time, for those
guys to experience this, it's special and they're pretty focused. They were
excited in the locker room, but they know obviously we're going to have a
tough task on Sunday.  
  
Q. Can you just take us through the decision process with Dean?  
BRUCE WEBER: Dean tried to do some stuff on Wednesday before we left, little
more active stuff. Then yesterday we got him more involved with some stuff and
we just wanted to see how he would be after. And today we went to shoot around
and, you know, he just said, "Coach, it still hurts. I don't think I have the
mobility. I don't know if I can do some things." You know, so Dr. Macatee
(phonetic), Luke Saber (phonetic), and myself met with Dean. We talked about
still being ready if we needed to have him take the ball inbounds or an
emergency thing. You know, he's so smart, if it came down to one reply and
getting the ball, I'm putting Dean in there and he was willing to do that. I
talked to his parents right when I got on the bus and told them I didn't think
he was going to play and they understood. You know, I love -- Dean, we
couldn't get him to talk, but in the first huddle when we were going on the
court, Dean was up talking. He was talking to Mac the whole time. He's really
grown up. And it's sad he's not part of it, but it's still great for our other
guys that they were able to rise up and find a way to win.  
  
Q. Coach, follow-up, is there any chance he plays on Sunday or are you
ruling him out?  
BRUCE WEBER: We told -- Dr. Macatee, we talked to Dean. We said come back
tomorrow and we're going to go back and do some treatment on him. We'll have a
short practice, you know, see if it improves and he wants to go and give it a
shot and we need him, I don't think it's going to be major minutes, but, you
know, he wants to be part of it. If it helps us have success and move on, I'm
sure Dean will be there giving his all.  
  
Q. Coach, you put "persistence" on the board. Was this -- is that
exactly what your team did and won this game with a great deal of persistence
and tenacity?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't think there's any doubt. Resilience. Whatever the words
are. I look for the quotes for the week and the game. There's nothing more
important in this world than persistence, and it can overcome talent and the
intelligence. That's what they are. Barry is probably as persistent as anyone.
Little stubborn, but he's very persistent. And I thought our guys really --
every time -- obviously that shot at the end of the half was huge. Then we
came out, made the run, and they make the run and we come right back and make
plays. And, you know, I'm just proud of them because they've been very
resilient, persistent throughout the year.  
  
It hasn't been a smooth sail the whole time. We've had to deal with injuries
and tough losses and a lot of the different things, but they've stayed the
course and really bought in and listened to the coaches and can't be more
proud.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Kansas State - 69  
  
Creighton - 59  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Congratulations to Kansas State. I thought they played a heck
of a game and defensively were very disruptive early in the game and I thought
forced us into some uncharacteristic decisions. Rather than maybe using the
pressure against them, we probably fell into the trap of trying to beat it too
early in the possession and probably didn't get as good a shots as we'd like,
especially early in the game.  
  
Defensively they had 32 points at the half, they hit two 3s as the shot clock
was running down and their center who has made 2 all year hits one. I really
felt like defensively we did what we needed to do to be in a good position. We
just weren't very good offensively and K-State certainly had a lot to do with
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: The questions are now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcus, why was it important for you to give Coach Weber a quick hug
before you left the floor after a tough night?  
MARCUS FOSTER: He called me over there. I was going to give him a hug after
the game anyway. He called me over there and told me he loved me and proud of
everything I accomplished.  
  
Q. Any of the players, on the defensive end, as the game wore on, how
deflating was Kansas State's ability to make tough plays even when -- even in
situations where you were in the right position to defend it?  
THE MODERATOR: Toby.  
  
TOBY HEGNER: I mean, you got to give Kansas State a lot of credit. They made
tough spots when they needed. We were in the right spot a lot of times.
Sometimes tough shots go in and you got to give credit to them and wish the
best for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Marcus.  
  
MARCUS FOSTER: Xavier Sneed, he hasn't been shooting the ball that well. He
hit a couple 3s that got them going. And McGuirl, he got going, too, and we
never seen him play. And they just did a lot of things to get us out of rhythm
and really couldn't get our rhythm back on. We got it down to 2 points and we
couldn't get over that hump.  
  
Q. This is for Marcus. Great scorer such as yourself to have this kind
of night, what are you trying to do during the game to maybe get yourself
going and why weren't you able to get any sort of rhythm?  
MARCUS FOSTER: I was really just trying to get my teammates involved more. I
seen they were collapsing the paint hard when I drove and they were attaching
to me as soon as I crossed half court so I couldn't get the ball. You know, it
was just giving me hard looks all night and I really just couldn't find my
rhythm.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Toby, Tyler, or Marcus?  
  
Q. I guess Marcus, given how much pressure you were under all week and
given how it ended, what are you going to think about the most, your Creighton
career this season despite having kind of a sour ending to the story?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Just a family bond that I built with these guys and how they
taught me how to be unselfish by their attitudes day in and out. I'm just
going to remember all the trips that we took, and I'm just going to miss going
to practice every day with my guys, you know. I'm sad we lost the game. I'm
even more hurt that I won't be able to spend as much time with my guys like I
usually do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay guys,
thanks. You guys head back to the locker room. Congratulations on a great
year. Questions for Coach McDermott.  
  
Q. Specifically what did K-State do to take Marcus out of his game so
much?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: They met him early and made his catches very difficult and
then obviously anytime he put it on the floor they were really rotating with
help. They're very physical and Marcus at times can overwhelm you with his
physicality and they were able to match that.  
  
We were trying to maybe try too hard to try to get Marcus something easy to
get him going, and unfortunately we could never get him started.  
  
Q. How tough is it as a coach to see a player end his career with a game
like that when obviously he's capable of playing much better?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I mean, you play a lot of games and games like this are going
to happen. Just a reality. As I told Marcus in the locker room, a lot has been
made this week about what Marcus -- what Creighton has done for Marcus Foster.
What hasn't been talked about is what Marcus Foster has done for Creighton.
The changes he made in his life to become the person and the player that he is
today certainly have benefited him. We've been the recipient of a great person
and a great player and back to back NCAA Tournament appearances because he's
made those decisions in his life.  
  
So, I wanted to make sure he understood how much we appreciate what he's done
for us.  
  
Q. I missed your opening statement. Sorry if you addressed it. You knew
K-State would be pretty physical and aggressive defensively. Why do you think
the guys weren't able to adjust in the moment?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: In some ways defensively without Wade, you know, they can
switch everything four ways and because of that, we weren't able to get in the
teeth of the defense. And they're extremely athletic across that guard court,
very physical, and when we had good shots early, we didn't make them and
really that 10-2, 12-2, whatever we were down early, that pretty much ended up
being the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Just in the huddles reading the players' body language and things
like that, how I guess constantly deflating was Kansas State's ability to
always just keep you close enough to think you got a shot but then make enough
tough shots to put some separation between you guys?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I thought we weathered it pretty well the first half because a
couple of those were back breakers. The one they hit at the end of the shot
clock, Mawien hits the one in transition and hit two all year and then of
course the one at the end of the half. We were able to bounce back from all
those, and that's 9 points. And in a game like today, 9 points is like 20
points because it was such a low possession, grind-it-out game. I thought our
guys were able to keep their senses about them and because -- because we had
some really good defensive possessions that ended with them hitting some tough
shots.  
  
And sometimes you have to tip your hat to them. You know, as you look at the
stat sheet, we had more points in the paint, points off turnovers were the
same, we had more second chance points, fast break points were the same. They
just -- they made more shots than us and were able to get to the free throw
line quite a bit more than we were.  
  
Q. Greg, it's easy from my vantage point to draw parallels between last
year and this year NCAA Tournament games. I guess from where you sit, are
there things that showed up a year ago that maybe showed up this year as well
in terms of the preparation or getting ready for a game and the way it
unfolded?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Our preparation was really good this week. Obviously it's
difficult to simulate what they do because they're so physical and they've got
some length in the guard court and our prep was with Wade playing. They're
quite a bit different without him. Some ways better defensively. Obviously you
take him off the offensive end, it's a totally different team because a lot of
what they did was to get him the basketball. So in some ways our plan was
thrown out the window because he didn't play. Like I said, defensively we
played well enough to win. We just -- we didn't make shots today and -- but
Kansas State deserves a fair amount of credit. They made some tough shots at
the end of some good defensive possessions and we missed some tough shots at
the end of some defensive possessions, and sometimes that's the way it goes.  
  
Q. There are obviously some emotional embraces with the seniors. This is
probably a loaded question. But what did you say to each of them as they
walked off the floor? And then also Khyri is in an interesting situation
because his future is kind of up in the air based on what he hears this
summer. What did you tell him as you took him off the floor for the last time
tonight?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I told him no matter what he decides, I'll love him just the
same. I'm here to support him and we said we'd wait until the end of the
season. And that's now, so we have to start having some conversations. But
Toby and Marcus, I told them how much I appreciated them. Toby has been
through -- his first year was Doug's, Grant and Ethan, his senior year we were
at the top of the mountain. The next year we went 4-14 in the Big East.
They've seen the program at a high and then as low as it's been and now back
to the point where we're in back to play NCAA tournaments. Tyler and Toby have
been an important part of that because of their leadership, because of their
unselfish attitude, and obviously Toby had a tough six weeks with his mom's
diagnosis. He hasn't really let it impact his ability to do his job in
practice and be the teammate and the leader we need him to be.  
  
I told Marcus how proud I am of him. It's a great story because not every
young person that gets lost ends up finding their way. And it took the effort
and patience of a lot of people. The most important person in that process was
Marcus. Marcus is the one that had to decide, you know what, enough is enough,
I'm going to make the changes in my life and get back to the person that I
know I can be. And I'm proud of that, extremely proud of that. Proud to have a
hand in that, proud to try to be a mentor for him and show him the right way
and let him know when I'm disappointed and when he makes a poor decision but
also celebrate the good times.  
  
Because he had had enough of people telling him what he was doing wrong. He
was well aware of what he was doing wrong. So, it's one of the neatest stories
that I've been a part of in my 30 years, to see someone really do a 360 in
their life and to have a hand in that, it's way more important than winning or
losing a basketball game.  
  
Q. Greg, your players at times this year talked a little bit about
toughness and needing to, I don't know, just kind of match the physicality or
toughness of the opponent. How big of a concern was it through the course of
the season? And going into today, were you concerned about just being tough
enough to compete?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I think anytime you play a team like K-State you're concerned
with toughness. We were plenty tough tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you.  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Jairus Lyles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35075)

### [K.J. Maura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35073)

### [Ryan Odom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35071)

### [Joe Sherburne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35074)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
UMBC - 74  
  
Virginia - 54  
  
RYAN ODOM: Obviously historic game, you know, for UMBC. Unbelievable. So proud
of these kids. I take so much joy in watching them smile and not just at the
end there but throughout the game. You know, I think it's pretty easy to tell,
everybody in the arena, these guys have passion, these guys love to play this
game. This game means a lot to them and, you know, just a special, special
effort. You know, particularly the game, I thought our defense, you know, in
the first half really helped us out to go in 21- 21 at halftime after not
really shooting it particularly well, you know. Obviously Virginia has a lot
to do with that. You know, was tremendous. Gave our guys some life there. They
felt like they could play, you know, with them.  
  
Then the second half, you know, we continued to get stops, and then all of a
sudden we began to run much better than we did in the first half and our
spacing was tremendous and we were able to get some shots off in transition
that would not normally happen had we not been able to get a stop. You know,
obviously, you know, these guys right here, Arkel was tremendous, Jordan was
tremendous. Throughout the game, our big guys came in and did what they
typically do and defending, you know, really well and rebounded.  
  
But, you know, I'm so happy for the three seniors. Obviously Joe is getting
ready to be a graduate here soon, too. He's getting ready to be a senior.  
  
But the other thing I would say is Virginia, an amazing year. Coach Bennett,
amazing Coach. Their staff unbelievable. You know, I love Orlando Vandross
like he's my brother. And obviously you could see the pain, you know, after
the game once it settled in there. You know, you feel for them. But, certainly
doesn't take away the happiness that I have for these guys right here. These
guys have worked extremely hard to earn a moment like this, and to have two
back-to-back moments, you know, America East championship with our backs
against the wall, down 9, to come back and win that game and then, you know,
just to go toe to toe with the number 1 team in the country, I mean,
unbelievable is all you can say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jairus, we were having discussion before, are your parents UA
graduates?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yes.  
  
Q. Lester Lyles, is that correct?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Lester Lyles and Carol Motley.  
  
Q. Will that be any subject of conversation in your family?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think they wanted us to get the win most importantly, but it
probably will be a topic of discussion for a little while.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned being tied at halftime as giving you kind of some
confidence. Was there a moment for each of you where you felt like hey, this
was going to be your night?  
THE MODERATOR: K.J.  
  
K.J. MAURA: We started getting stopped on a constant in the first half and
that give us the confidence to get going on offense. The first half was low
scoring game, but we knew it was getting the shots we wanted. We wasn't making
it the first half, but the second half we shot the ball with more confidence
and that gave us a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think at halftime when we were tied at 21 and we hadn't shot
particularly well, we made some silly turnovers, then we felt there's no way
we're not going to win this game. All we have to do is start hitting shots.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: I think we had the confidence coming into the game. I don't
think there was any point in the game that we thought we couldn't play with
them. We knew we could play with them before the game. Tying up with them at
halftime definitely gave us more confidence. And like Joe said, like K.J.
said, we didn't have a lot of shots, we had a lot of turnovers, me myself
included. We definitely went into the second half with a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. I saw you checking your phone on the way in. Are you already starting
to get texts from friends about this? Second part of the question is, can you
put in perspective the magnitude of this upset, number 16 seeds have been
0-135 in the NCAA Tournament.  
JAIRUS LYLES: Of course we just made history tonight. It's always exciting to
make history. It's a very exciting moment for us in UMBC especially.  
  
Q. It seemed like at some point in the second half you couldn't miss.
You had that running one-handed 3-pointer. When did you realize that this was
a night you just sort of had to take over?  
JAIRUS LYLES: They did a really good job of me in the first half, but I had to
be patient and slow down, read the plays better. And I did that in the second
half and my shot was falling. So, credit to my teammates for finding me.  
  
Q. I know that you came back to UMBC with a goal to win an America East
title. Could you ever envision yourself in the position you are right now when
you came back?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Definitely moments you dream of. We didn't know what seed we
would be when we won America East championships. Once we saw that 16 seed we
knew we had a chance to make history. It's a very surreal moment.  
  
Q. Jairus, you and Jourdan were there in the final seconds drilling out
the clock. Just what was that like as you looked around and saw all of this
finishing?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I just wanted to give credit to our fans. They traveled a long
way to come here and support us. They were in the game the whole time. It
really helped us throughout the game. Credit to them. We were just having a
moment saying we did it. We knew we could do it. It's a special moment we
shared right there.  
  
Q. This question is for K.J. Just for a point of clarification, was that
your family holding the large head of you and the Puerto Rican flag as well?  
K.J. MAURA: Yes, that's my family. They've been watching the last couple
games, especially the championship game of the America East.  
  
Q. So my question for you on that is, I guess how much significance does
the Puerto Rican flag or heritage and the family being here for this
tournament run mean to you, not just in this win but in all you've
accomplished in your career so far?  
K.J. MAURA: Yeah, I carry Puerto Rico in my heart. It's a very special moment
for them right now, making history as a team, but I'm also making history for
my country. I play for them, especially after what happened with the hurricane
and all that stuff. We've been hurting lately. This moment give them a little
bit of life to my country, and I'm very proud and happy for that.  
  
Q. Any of the players, to beat the number 1 team overall seed, I know
you said it hasn't totally sunk in yet. Does that change or alter maybe your
outlook of what you can get done in this tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I don't think so. We go into every game thinking we have a
chance to win. Kansas State won, right? They're a really good team too. We
have another big challenge ahead of us on Sunday.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, like he said, a big challenge on Sunday. Kansas State,
very good team. But beating the number 1 team definitely gives us confidence
going into that game. We've got to stay level-headed and focus us, execute the
coach's plan read the scouting report, go from there.  
  
Q. This question is for Joe. You had the first 6 points in the second
half to give the team the lead. What was going through your mind and the
team's mind when you knocked down those shots?  
JOE SHERBURNE: In the first half I passed up a couple 3s and that really
angered my teammates. So in the second half, I made sure I got some off. And
there was one I missed and Arkel got the rebound, passed it right back to me.
I thought about doing an extra pass over to K.J., but I knew everybody was
going to yell at me if I didn't shoot that one, too. I just let it go.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you guys. Could you sense at any point in
the game like was there a shift where could you feel like Virginia knew what
was going to happen? Did you ever feel like you sort of took the spirit away
from them?  
K.J. MAURA: I think the first media time out we took 7-point lead. I think at
that moment we started believing more in ourselves and gave us confidence to
keep getting the shot selection we needed and put them in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think we were up 6 right away early in the second half and --
7 right away in the second half, and we were getting real excited on the bench
but there was still like 16 minutes left in the second half. I personally was
trying to stay really level-headed and you know that they can come right back
right away real quick because they're the number 1 team in the country for a
reason.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, you guys realize you've just inked your names
in college basketball history forever, right?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Yeah, definitely. We were talking about it before the game, just
trying to go out here and make history, doing it for our program, our
teammates, our coaching staff. We just wanted to make history today.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think we kind of all wanted to be in the One Shiny Moment
video. We were all in the locker room singing the first line because that's
all we know, but I think we're going to have to learn the rest of the song,
too.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I haven't seen it actually yet. It's still an undescribable
feeling. Maybe it will sink it when I get back to the locker room.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Congratulations. You can head out to the locker
room. Questions for Coach Odom.  
  
Q. Yesterday the players described going up against K.J. in practice as
very annoying. Clearly his defensive style is good enough to make him
Defensive Player of the Year in the Conference. So what you saw from K.J.
today, was that same old K.J. or do you think he just went up another level
during this game?  
RYAN ODOM: To me it was pretty much same old K.J. He's a pest. That's what we
encourage him to do each and every night. Obviously he's giving up a ton of
size, ton of weight, but his heart is as big as there is in this country and
he's not afraid of anything and -- or anyone and he just attacks. We felt like
from a pressure standpoint, that was the key to the game for us going in. We
had to try to wear them down and pressure their guards. And they're really
good at getting under the basket and coming off of screens, and their big guys
are very good as timing when to screen. And that can wear you down, and we
felt like we had to wear them down more in the full court, you know, before
they got to half court, and K.J. is a big reason why we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Can you put this win in perspective given your family's history with
Virginia, the way you're feeling right now?  
RYAN ODOM: Obviously Virginia is a special place. I mean, it's a special
place. It was a special time for the Odom family when we were there. You know,
so many high level people, so many high character people, so many successful
people, and we were just fortunate to be a part of it. And, you know, for us
to be able to beat a Virginia basketball team that's had an amazing season. I
know that they just lost one of their best players, so that is a factor as
well.  
  
You know, they probably will not say that because that's who they are, but
Hunter is a big, big player for them and -- but, you know, take nothing away
from our guys. Our guys just battled throughout.  
  
Q. You've expressed kind of your respect for Coach Bennett. I'm curious
if you'd share, what did he say to you after the game?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah, he just said "Congratulations." He said, "You guys did an
unbelievable job." That was pretty much it.  
  
Q. Kind of the mirror image of that earlier question, but given your
many connections to Charlotte, was it special to do that here?  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean certainly, you know, my family and I, we had an
unbelievable experience here in Charlotte because so many friends and family
here, not just at the university obviously at UNC Charlotte, but just in
general. My brother still lives here. My parents live in Winston-Salem. My two
best high school friends live here. You know, so absolutely it's special to
win here for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, against the best defensive team in the country, talk to us
about how your basketball team was able to shoot 19 for 28 from the floor,
almost 68 percent and score 53 points against the best defensive team in
America.  
RYAN ODOM: I think it starts with our defense. We were able to get stops, and
when we're able to get stops, our guys are able to run and push the ball. And
K.J. and Jairus are very, very good in transition, and we're hard to match up
with, you know, when the guys -- they're sprinting it up the court. He's a
little wizard with the ball and finding guys and, you know, our guys are in
sync, you know, right now. They know where each other are going to be on the
court. And we knew going into the game, you know, a big key was going to be
the 3-point line. For us, we had to dominate that stat right there in order to
even have a chance and, you know, certainly that proved to be true. Our
defense, while the shots were great, our defense was magnificent.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had some stints at UNC Charlotte with Nolan Ryan. Can
you talk about your coaching journey and your stints.  
RYAN ODOM: It's a blessing, you know. My time at Charlotte was tremendous. We
had great family-type atmosphere that was created there. Judy is right here
and Ken, just great people. And, you know, it started with them. And Allen
obviously got sick in the middle of that year, and that was our main concern
was his health. And that certainly helped me -- you know, the confidence that
Allen had in me, the confidence that Judy had in me, to finish the year there
was tremendous and it gave me on-the-job training.  
  
You know, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Neil Mackey (phonetic) who passed
away this year. He took a shot on me at Lenoir Rhyne. And the kids that I
coached there, I've talked about it ad nauseam to my guys at UMBC. I had some
of them in the stands tonight from LR, quite a few people came to support.
And, you know, that season was magical. It really was. The amount of passion
that those kids had, you know, for the game was unbelievable.  
  
Then to get the opportunity at UMBC, Tim Hall who is here, you know, gave me
an opportunity there or here. And, you know, these kids have been equally
unbelievable and, you know, from day one. They've just bought in and, you
know, they believe in themselves. We've taken our lumps, but at the same time,
we've just persevered and we have a very resilient group.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to know when Jairus Lyles in the first half had 5
points and then in the second half scored over 20 plus, when he gets on a roll
like that, that he did in the second half, do you just let him play it or do
you call any plays?  
RYAN ODOM: I always let him play. I never try to hold him back at all. With
Jairus it's all about just reading the plays. He's got an amazing nose to
score the ball. He's unbelievable. But his teammates have so much confidence
in him, and when he gets going like that, it breeds confidence into the other
guys and I think you saw that tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Billy Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30583)

### [Robert Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35095)

### [Tyler Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30813)

### [Admon Gilder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30841)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 73  
  
Providence - 69  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Good to win a hard fought, physical game against a well-coached
team like Providence. I thought we played through our post guys and did a good
job of getting it inside and did a good job of rebounding for the most part.
And I thought Admon Gilder the first half was tremendous. When we really
struggled scoring, he made some big plays for us posting up and scoring in a
variety of ways.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now raise your hand.  
  
Q. Both you guys, Tyler and Admon, you missed your first ten shots. You
go 633 without scoring. How good was the defense intensity there to keep
yourself in the game when you weren't scoring a basket?  
ADMON GILDER: We put our heads on playing defense. Coach Kennedy tells us
everyday that's where we're the best. Having the bigs, Tyler and Robert, with
the shot-blocking ability they have and the keeping the guards out of the
lane. Just we just kept on fighting and that's what we did today.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: We just played defense, man we played hard. You know it's going
to be stretches where they make their runs offensively. We hang our hat on
defense. That's what we've done all year.  
  
Q. Admon, you're usually pretty businesslike. When you hit that 3 late,
that was a little bit of draining there, can you tell me what went through
your mind there?  
ADMON GILDER: I new it was a gig shot. TJ drove in the lane, does a great job
of getting in the lane. Once I fit the 3, I felt good and all the emotion came
out of me, so --  
  
Q. This is for Robert and Tyler, just the importance of rebounding the
way you did, how much of an advantage is that in any game you play, much less
against a team that maybe doesn't have your size?  
THE MODERATOR: Robert.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: It's something we take pride in every game. Our coaches
stress to us before the game, the other team emphasize hitting us, boxing us
out. We wanted to guard them and show them and be more aggressive doing what
they do.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: We're out there doing our jobs. We know we have the advantage
inside most games, so this is just another game where we came out and gave a
hundred percent effort on the glass.  
  
Q. Robert, what were you thinking on the dunk like you tried to size up
a highlight reel moment and late in the game?  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: Actually wanted to go through my legs, but I thought the
Coach would take me out.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: He can't go between his legs, believe me.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: I thought he was going to take me out. Highlight moment, like
you said, to create memories.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Admon, how about TJ, especially in the second half where he was
scoreless in the first, this guy has so much confidence. How big was he in the
second half with 15 after the break?  
ADMON GILDER: He did a really great job of keeping his composure. He kind of
struggled a little bit, and in the second half he got it going for us inside
the lane. He started hitting the 3s. He started running our team like we know
he's capable of doing.  
  
Q. Talked about rebounding, you two out-rebounded their whole team. You
couldn't have even thought that would happen before the game started.  
TYLER DAVIS: We got a lot of help from our guards, too. Our guards put bodies
on the outside so we can play one-on-one on the inside. It was really a team
effort. We were able to snag a couple boards.  
  
Q. Robert and Tyler, Providence does a decent percentage of its scoring
slash to the basket with the ball. Your size seemed to really be a counter on
it.  
Are you the kind of team that you know neutralizes teams that go to the
basket?  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: We're the type of team that tries to execute the Coach's game
plan and scout. We figured Providence is a slashing team. They play small, try
to take advantage of the bigs so me and Tyler had to move our feet, get dirty
with the guards, I guess you can say that, any way to help our team win.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Just doing our job. Rob got it.  
  
Q. Admon, I'm curious, first half 33 percent, second half 68 percent.
Any difference? What led to that difference?  
ADMON GILDER: Came out and played hard. We was up by one at the halftime. We
know we said in the locker room, Coach said to keep your foot on the gas.
We're here to have fun and enjoy the experience.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Admon, Coach already talked about what you did in the first half, you
know, especially offensively kind of brought you guys back into the game. Did
you feel like that needed to be done with the start that you guys got off
to?  
ADMON GILDER: You can say that, but like I say, I said, we said we had the
size advantage and luckily I got going in the paint. That's something you
don't see everyday. Like I said, we execute the game plan and got it done.  
  
Q. Admon, I know that you talked a little bit about how Starks played
today. But generally speaking, the way that he's come along during the season
to be the guy he was today, can you describe what you see in the way that he's
developed?  
ADMON GILDER: He's developed like extremely -- I know everyday -- he's one of
our hardest workers. He's in the gym every day, putting up shots, working out
before and after practice. I'm not surprised of what he's accomplishing right
now. I think he has more to come. And so as long as he keep his composure,
keep his mind right, he's going to be a great player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more question for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler or Admon or Robert, whoever wants to take it. I'm curious, can
you talk about what the -- I guess for lack ever a better word -- the mood or
atmosphere was like in the locker room halftime. Surely you don't feel like
you didn't play well, yet when you go in with a lead after the slow start that
you had.  
TYLER DAVIS: We just stressed staying together. We know there's going to be
ups and downs in the game, but at halftime we knew we had to stay together,
talk things out, what do we see on the court, and come out and win the first
five minutes of the second half.  
  
ROBERT WILLIAMS: I say a lot of reassurance, just letting your teammates know
and coaches know we're supposed to be here, we deserve to be here and we have
a mission and go out and destroy the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Admon, Tyler and Robert, good jobs. You guys head back to the
locker room, which is still open. We'll take questions for Coach Kennedy.  
  
Q. You guys were tied I think 50 all with 9 minutes left, went on a 12-2
run during a critical sequence. What went right for you guys when you finally
wrestled some control away?  
BILL KENNEDY: I thought we made some blocks and shots and got some run outs.
We were able to get some easy baskets in transition to play. Tyler got -- the
intentional foul was a big play that separated us in that possession but I
thought we did a better job of getting stops and breaking. Look at Diallo and
Bullock, they both had 22 and 21 points at that position, they started making
3s. We had to start switching ball screens late and, I thought that helped us.
Robert switched out. We blocked some shots on the mismatches when they went
one-on-one and that broke us open, broke the game open with some freelance
plays.  
  
Q. Billy, when you weren't scoring, 633 without a point and missed your
first ten shots, how good were you defensively? Can you just speak to that
stretch where you guys didn't get down on the defensive end?  
BILL KENNEDY: We started out the game in zone, something we haven't done all
year, just to try to throw something at them a little bit different. They were
prepared for it. But I thought we got the ball inside, we just missed some
shots. I thought Tyler had some opportunities around the basket with his jump
hook. If we can get him one-on-one on the block, most times we're going to
live with that.  
  
I thought we had some good looks. We just didn't score. That's what I told the
guys at half, guys, we missed shots, we got the ball where we wanted to. As
long as we keep taking care of the ball and keep going inside out, we'll be
right to break the game open, and fortunately we were able to do that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what Admon meant to you defensively
when you're playing man-to-man. When Chandler was in there, he's got Diallo,
and when he wasn't, he's covering Cartwright. Those are two completely
different type players. He's covering them both.  
BILL KENNEDY: Yeah, he was tremendous. I think. I think having a week to rest
his knee some and get him up close -- he's almost a hundred percent healthy.
That's it. He played the whole game, and coaches kept saying do we want to
give him a break. I said no, we're going to go as long as we have to go with
him. He's played 40-minute games for us in the past last year and he plays
both ends of the floor, and that was critical for us in winning this game.  
  
Q. Billy, I'm curious when you went man what your defensive focus was.
Was it Cartwright? He never really seemed to get going.  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, it was Diallo and Bullock were our game plan to matchup
with them the right way, and early on we didn't switch ball screens. I think
when we did start switching ball screens, it kept Cartwright in front of us
and I think we blocked the shot, one of his shots in the lane was big. And
then Robert Williams guarding Bullock did some good things late and sort of
getting out on him quicker and blocked some shots for us. It was big for us.  
  
Q. Billy, how big was the early Starks 3 kind of got him going and I
think you had three straight possessions with an assist in there, then made a
layup. How important were the first few minutes of the second half for him?  
BILL KENNEDY: We've learned you got to take the good with the bad with him,
you know, because as a freshman he can get streaky and offensively be
dominant, and then he can try to do too much at times, which I thought he was
right on the edge of doing too much part for me, but we got him out of the
game and recomposed and our guys did a good job of lifting him and standing
together and act encouraging him through times where he got frustrated, he
thought he got fouled a few times and got frustrated. His play in going
downhill he's really hard to stop once he gets going.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the way that that front line works, I mean you
were talking about it a little bit yesterday that 6' 9 ", 6'10", 6'10", how
unique a thing do you think you have here and how big a difference did it
make?  
BILL KENNEDY: Well, obviously when it's good defensively it's really good for
us, and I thought we did a good job. Robert was more active offensively than
he's been in a awhile. He's raised his game up a level, knowing he's got to
play more aggressive this week. And first five minutes of the game, he got the
ball twice and he missed shots, but he was aggressive going to the basket.
When he's aggressive like that, he's as good as anybody in the country and
that was big for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Kennedy? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
BILL KENNEDY: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

### [Jalen Lindsay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35023)

### [Alpha Diallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34878)

### [Rodney Bullock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30774)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 73  
  
Providence - 69  
  
ED COOLEY: I appreciate you guys waiting. Lot of emotions go through your head
in those types of games. First you got to give credit to Texas A&M. They
played well when they had to, so congratulations to them and good luck in
their next round.  
  
As far as Providence, I don't think we played well and I think that had a lot
to do with it. I just didn't feel my team played with the purpose and energy
that we've played with in the past. I thought we did a great job coming out of
the gate in particular in the first half, but we couldn't throw the ball in
the basket so defensively I thought we did a good job. Halftime we're right
where we needed to be. Cut the lead to one couple of times in the second half
and couldn't get over the hump.  
  
But when you look at the big picture, I'm really proud of the group. It's
really sad that I have to see these seniors leave and, you know, do what
they've done at Providence College over four years getting to the tournament.
I feel like I let them down. Hopefully, I do a better job with the next group
if we're fortunate to get into this game again. It's just sad. It's the
finality. You don't have any more games with these guys, and I couldn't be
more proud of them. But give credit to Texas A&M, they did a really good job.  
  
I thought their length, it bothered us particularly around the rim in the
second half, but I didn't -- I don't think we played the way we wanted to play
and then we tried to hold on for dear life and we weren't fortunate to move
on. But, you know, it's part of life. You win and you lose and you learn from
the losses.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alpha, how would you describe the impact that their front line size
had on the way that you guys wanted to play the game?  
ALPHA DIALLO: Their length really bothered us inside. They would throw the
ball in almost every possession and when doubled they would get tough layups.
We tried to limit their second shot opportunities, but as good as a team they
was, they got some, got some crucial ones, too. So --  
  
Q. Rodney, in the second half you guys finally made some shots. You made
two back-to-back 3s. How frustrating was it in the first half to just not to
be able to make some shots?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: I mean it was frustrating not to make shots, but at the end of
the day we were still in the game to win it and a few balls didn't bounce our
way and they had the last punch.  
  
Q. Jalen and Rodney, with your time here in Friar Town done, when you
look back on your time as a Friar, what are you going to think about?  
JALEN LINDSEY: I just think about the great memories I've had with the players
that have been through here that I've played with and the players I'm
currently playing with. And honestly, man, at Providence College is more than
just basketball, and I think they helped me become a man and taught me life
lessons along with how to be a better player. So, you know, I'm blessed to
have the opportunity to go to Providence College. I'm definitely going to miss
it, so --  
  
RODNEY BULLOCK: The experience that I've had here, I've grown up and became a
man. And it's just been great with all the experience playing in the Big East
tournament, playing in the NCAA Tournament, feel how it feels to win. And be
here five times in a row, it's something nobody will ever be able to do and
it's rare. It's just been great for five years here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alpha, in the second half A &M shot 68 percent Did they do anything
differently in the second half offensively?  
ALPHA DIALLO: I wouldn't say they did anything differently. We tried to limit
them, limit their shot attempts and contest most of their shots. They're
definitely getting a lot of 50/50 balls and then those led to easy 3s for
them, which hurt us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Alpha, this team had some ups and downs throughout the middle of the
season but stayed up and had a great Big East tournament run. As a sophomore
with this team, can you speak to what the senior class meant to getting you
guys to peak at the right time this season?  
ALPHA DIALLO: With the leadership of these guys -- without the leadership of
these guys, I don't think we'll be anywhere close to where we are now. Kyron
does a great job. Rodney, Jalen, and other guys in the locker room, they do a
great job of basically leading us on and off court, telling us what to do and
not to do and it sucks to lose in the First Round and having these guys, their
last time here. But we're definitely going to be in the gym this summer and
work on all our flaws and hopefully get back here next year for a 6th
straight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rodney, they missed their first ten shots, but I think in that
stretch you guys only got off to a 6-0 lead. Was that a little frustrating to
maybe not create a little more distance at that point, even though it was
fairly early?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: In the game I thought we did come out with low energy. I feel
like we did have a few shots there that just didn't go in. It happens at the
beginning of the game. I mean, just didn't roll the way we wanted them to
roll. We still had a chance to win the game, so that's it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Rodney, Alpha, Jalen, thank you. You guys head back to
the locker room. Congratulations on a great season. We'll now take questions
for Coach Cooley. Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Ed, all season long it's been tough to find the pulse of this team.
Did you think that they came out the way they needed to? Obviously
offensively, as you talked about you, just missed some shots, but overall,
were they ready to go?  
ED COOLEY: You know, normally when we're getting stops, that's when we're
really efficient offensively and we just couldn't find that -- we had great
shots, looks at the basket, whether it was zone or man, we were getting the
shots we wanted. But part of our Achilles Heel this entire year was not being
able to complete an assignment and that's missing shots. Definitely was
frustrating, but at the same time, I still thought we were where we needed to
be in striking distance of winning the game. And I thought Alpha hit it right
on the head. Two stretches in this game that I thought was -- it was death to
us. There was a 10-point swing. We missed a 3, they get a 50/50 ball, of which
they had five out of seven possessions when they scored five times. That was
critical. We miss a 3, they make a 3. We miss a layup, they get and a 1, game,
set, match. Now you're trying to play catch-up and hoping to get a call here
or there. That's the most frustrating part for me, because I don't think we
played nearly as well as we needed to or had to in order to advance in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Ed, how much are you encouraged by the way that Alpha progressed this
season and what he can be for the future of the program?  
ED COOLEY: Alpha is a very competitive young man, very prideful, very proud of
him and his development and how far he's come in a short period of time. He'll
be one of the better players in the Big East, if not the best player in the
Big East in time to come. This year is a great learning experience for him. I
thought he grew up a lot last year as a freshman and definitely took a big,
big leap this year. He'll be one of the veterans we look forward to, to lead
us back next year.  
  
Q. Ed, in terms of the Aggies' front line, 6'9 ", 6'10", 6'10", how
unique is that and how impactful is that?  
ED COOLEY: Their length was very impressive. Definitely bothered us around the
rim. They blocked four, five jump shots that I haven't seen anybody in our
league do. But, you know, their length was big, but at the same time
Providence didn't play the game it needed to. I didn't coach the game I needed
to. Hopefully, again I said next year we get an opportunity to be in this game
again. Their length is pretty impressive and definitely bothered us.  
  
Q. You talked about needing to boxout to get those rebounds and
everything. Big difference in the rebound totals today. What was -- was it
that, was it something else that kind of caused it?  
ED COOLEY: We missed a lot of shots in the second half. That was for sure.
Even though we were checking out and I thought we did a decent job, they had
length rebounds, you know, they had length rebounds. There's really nothing
you can do. That's God's gift to them. It's really nothing you can do about
it. You keep encouraging your kids but you know when you got 7-6 wing length
and 7-5 wing length, that's genetics. It's like you. You're short, I'm tall.
That's your problem. That was our problem today. We weren't long enough in
some of the balls they got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
ED COOLEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
UMBC - 74  
  
Virginia - 54  
  
TONY BENNETT: First, hats off to Coach Odom and his staff and UMBC. They
played a terrific game. They thoroughly outplayed us and they did a heck of a
job. Very hard to guard offensively and they defended us well. I was concerned
with the 4 guard or a 4 perimeter offense heading into this, and we didn't do
the job. And I told these guys in the locker room, you know, a week ago we
were cutting down the nets at ACC Tournament and how good that felt and they
had a historic season, they really did. I said that to Tracy, CBS, after the
game, in terms of ACC wins and ACC Conference Tournament Championship and then
we had a historic loss being the first 1 seed to lose.  
  
So, that's life. We talk about it all the time. The adulation, the praise, it
comes and we got a lot of that this year. Then on the other side, they'll be
blame and people pointing that out. That can't, in the end, you know, define
these guys and our team or us, because it was a remarkable season but we got
thoroughly outplayed. That's the reality of it. And I hate for this team, the
way they played to lose like this, but for Devon and Isaiah to go out like
that and Nigel being a fifth year for us.  
  
So, with that, if you play this game and you step into the arena, this stuff
can happen. And those who haven't been in the arena or in the competition,
maybe they don't understand that. But there's chances for wonderful things to
happen, but when you're in the arena, stuff like this can happen and all those
who compete take that on. And so we'll accept it. And again I want to
congratulate the job that Ryan and his staff did. They played well and we did
not.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kyle or Ty, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, what was UMBC doing effectively really at both ends
of the floor and then especially at the start of the second half?  
TY JEROME: They spread the floor, they made shots. I don't think we defended
well. We didn't pass the ball well. We didn't come off screens well. We didn't
do anything well tonight, to be honest. And give credit to them, too, because
they played well. They're a good team, but we didn't do anything well.  
  
KYLE GUY: Defensively they were very quick and were beating the screens and
were cutting and stuff. Just hard to get in a rhythm. Once we got down 8 or 10
we we're trying to make home run plays because you don't want to be in this
position and so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Kyle or Ty?  
  
Q. Ty, you know, you listed a bunch of things that sort of were
happening about why you guys didn't -- about how you guys didn't play that
well. Do you have any idea why it happens that way?  
TY JEROME: You know, it's basketball. You're not going -- I mean, I don't know
why. I don't know why, no. I guess we didn't -- maybe we didn't come ready to
play today. We didn't shoot well, that definitely doesn't help. But to only
have five total assists as a team is pretty bad. So, I guess we didn't move
the ball well, didn't shoot well. We probably should have gone into the post
more. I don't have the answers.  
  
Q. Both you guys, obviously it's a tough spot to come in here and answer
questions. I'm curious what have you learned from Coach Bennett that prepares
you for this part of basketball?  
KYLE GUY: You know, I love Coach Bennett, but there's not really a whole lot
that can prepare you for this kind of feeling. He has instilled a lot of
humility and unity throughout our team. So it will be easy for us to bounce
back, but there's not really any answer to make you feel better in this
situation.  
  
Q. This question is for either one of you. What did you guys talk about
at halftime being tied 21-21? What did you think you needed to do in the
second half to sort of swing things back in your favor?  
THE MODERATOR: Ty.  
  
TY JEROME: It's tough to remember but I think we just said every possession
was going to matter. It was 21-21 and they had a 3 off an offensive rebound
and a 3 when we didn't scramble correctly and make a right rotation. That's 6
of their 21 points. Every possession is going to be matter, we're going to be
in for a battle and we had to buckle down, especially defensively, and
offensively just be more aggressive, spread the floor a little more. And we
didn't do either one of those things.  
  
Q. Kyle, Lyles had taken only two shots in the first half, I believe,
scored 5 points. Then gets 23 after intermission. What did they do differently
and what made it so difficult to check him after halftime?  
KYLE GUY: He was, you know, a tough player to guard. He's very shifty and
could hit tough shots. And the first half, honestly he wasn't being all that
aggressive. You know, Devon was playing pretty good defense but other guys
were hitting shots so didn't need to do much. The second half he got it going,
and, you know, Coach said when you let a team hang around for awhile, they get
a lot of confidence and he definitely had that.  
  
Q. Ty, were you aware that a 16 had never won before and did you just
kind of dismiss that ahead of time?  
TY JEROME: I think everyone is aware of that. Thanks for bringing that up
again. But, you know, I was aware of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Last question for student-athletes.  
  
Q. What kind of life lessons does this teach both of you?  
TY JEROME: I mean, if you're worried about the outside world, Coach Bennett
and the staff told us earlier in the year that it's a flip of a coin. It's the
same people that will tell you how great you are and praise you, you know,
when you're on top, you feel like you're on top of the world, will the same
people are going to kill you when you're at this point.  
  
But to be honest, I don't think this team has never been worried about you
guys, the media, the outside world. But it just shows you that really anybody
can beat anybody and if you don't come to play you're going to get beat. It's
basketball.  
  
KYLE GUY: You know, it's all a blur right now. It's really hard to answer
these questions as you guys know. And one thing this team is really good at
and built on is resiliency. I think bouncing back from something that's so
heartbreaking will be a huge key for us. I just, you know, just feel so bad
for Isaiah and Devon and Nigel because it's not how we wanted to send them
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. You can head back to the locker room. We
appreciate you being here. Congratulations on a great year. Questions for
Coach Bennett.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's got to be difficult for you to tell these guys
really anything to sort of comfort them now, but in the locker room post game,
what do you try and tell them?  
TONY BENNETT: There's not a whole lot you can say right now. We talked about a
few things, but, you know, heads are down. And again that's the reality of it.
You can say all the soothing things or whatever and time will heal. And I did
share with them what I started my opening statement with, that's life. This is
not the end of the world, okay? This is not -- there's a lot of worse things
that can happen. It's the first time it happened, but this is a possibility.
We knew that.  
  
Again, we had a remarkable year, but we also knew our margin for error wasn't
huge and they just played. They were so good. I was so sad that now we're done
with this group because they did everything I asked. And when we weren't quite
right, we couldn't keep them out of the paint. And you ask that question
whoever did about Lyles coming off the ball screen, 33 or 13 are both 4 men
who can really shoot. So I think at times we were worried about we got to get
back to the shooter and didn't stop the ball. They had us in no man's land.
They put pressure on us in ways they did.  
  
But back to the deal. There's not much you can say. I think they're strong
character guys and have to bounce back. Like he said, resiliency has been
their strength. Now it will be tested in a way I don't think they thought it
would be tested.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier in the week that you've seen Lyles at your
camp. Son of UVA alumni, what did you remember?  
TONY BENNETT: Not much. I mean, he's really great. He went to VCU, obviously.
I think he came back for his fifth year. I wish he wouldn't have done that
now. But really good. One heck of a senior year or fifth year and dangerous.
You saw the shot he hit to get them into the NCAA Tournament and again the way
they play with the 4 guards and the spread and the quickness and that's --
their point guard did a heck of a job.  
  
K.J., he was so quick and he managed the game. They really defended. So that
quickness with a 4 separate ball screen has always been an issue if you can't
switch it. And they put us in a tough spot and we didn't do a great job with
it.  
  
Q. You alluded to it earlier about them being uniquely gifted with the
4-guard system. Is there another team that you've seen in the last two years
that kind of reminds you of them? They're very --  
TONY BENNETT: We've at times had a little trouble with 4 perimeter teams, 4
guard teams. And this is not an excuse, but without De'Andre, I thought we had
enough with what we had, but that allowed us to sometimes switch and he could
-- his versatility helped us. When we didn't have that, we were always a
little nervous. I think again their quickness -- their size is small and we
couldn't -- couple times we couldn't take enough advantage of that. They did a
great job blocking out, but again they put a lot of pressure on you with that
and they run their offense. That's why I wanted to give credit to Ryan. They
run their offense so fast. That ball just pop, pop, pop and they do the
dribble handoffs, keeping it and moving it. If you're not really disciplined
and really sound -- and we worked as hard as we could preparing for it, but
it's like you can't mimic that until you go against it.  
  
We lost our way. I think it was a good point, tried to get it back in one shot
and got out of character. And I'm sure I'll look at the tape and I probably
made a lot of poor adjustments and that's part of it. I'll grow from it as a
coach, but our young men tried. They battled. It wasn't a lack of effort, but
it was a hard team for us once they got ahead of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Bennett?  
  
Q. Tony, in the steps you've taken to build this program, how will you
view this season given that, as you said, you guys achieved a lot getting to
number 1 but to have it end this way?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah. That's a good question. I don't know. Remarkable 31 wins.
I think this team maxed out as much as any team that I've had. We were so
healthy and so good up until this last game, so we needed all hands on deck.
You'll remember this. It will sting. Maybe a 1 seed will get beat again, maybe
not. Maybe we'll be the only No. 1 seed to ever lose. It's life. It goes on.
We'll have to get past that. For some reason this is what we've got to deal
with, and my job now will be to say hey, how do we bounce back, our players
and all that. But a life lesson is sitting there about defining yourself by
maybe not what the world says, but there's other things that matter and then
you get back to it.  
  
Phenomenal year. Can't take away an ACC Championship, can't take away the most
wins, can't take away an ACC Conference Tournament, and can't take away so far
being the first 1 seed to get beat and lose.  
  
I grew up, played at Wisconsin-Green Bay, the hyphenated schools. I know how
good they are. Said it yesterday, good basketball knows no divisions or limits
or qualities. And they played. All that matters is who plays the best. They
earned their right to play in this tournament. They earned their right to move
on. It's who played the best for 40 minutes, and they absolutely did. Won't
take away from some of the things, but it certainly stings. You know, I'll --
ask me that maybe next year or another time. We'll see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
TONY BENNETT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Casey Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35041)

### [Garrison Mathews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35039)

### [Kenny Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35037)

### [Rob Marberry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35038)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 84  
  
Lipscomb - 66  
  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Congratulations to Carolina. Everybody knows it takes a
magical performance from somebody like us to beat somebody like them and we
didn't get that, and so we were fighting uphill all afternoon it felt like.
So, I thought our guys really competed and continued to play all 40 minutes.
Just couldn't get enough balls to drop. Couldn't create enough of our own
momentum to really give us a chance. Tip our hat and we'll go home and start
over.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rob, Kenny, and Garrison.  
  
Q. Kenny can answer this question. To have such a historical moment for
the school, what is it like for you to be part of this history?  
KENNY COOPER: It's an honor just to be a part of this Lipscomb basketball team
and where the program has come. So, to make our first tournament appearance,
being a part of that is -- just exceeds expectations that we have and so we
plan on being back, that's for sure. We're going to work our tails off this
upcoming off-season to get back, and hopefully this is just a start and we can
build on to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Rob, you want the answer that as well.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: It's a great accolade to have for this team, for Lipscomb, and
the community around us. We played our butts off all season, and we've made
history throughout the whole season. Beating Belmont twice was a big accolade
for us, having the 21 season again, back to back, that's a record for us.
Making it to the tournament, winning the conference. We had so many great
things happening. This one loss doesn't determine, doesn't make our season. We
had so many wins, so many great accolades throughout the whole season. We're
going to hold our heads high and just --  
  
Q. Casey, you got the bulk of this team coming back so you don't have to
worry about recruiting yet, but when you get around to worrying about
recruiting --  
THE MODERATOR: Just for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Garrison, can you talk about the players coming back, what kind of
team you have guys coming back?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: We're going to have a great team next year. Obviously we're
going to miss the guys that are leaving. They've been a huge part of this
program and getting us here. First senior class to get us here, so we're going
to miss them a ton. But I love these guys right here and the guys we have
coming back. It's going to be huge for us next year. We've got a lot of
experience. So it's going to be good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Rob, Kenny or Garrison?  
  
Q. Rob, how do you enjoy the moment of going with this team for the
first time without losing focus on getting ready for this game or --  
ROB MARBERRY: We enjoyed it just as a team throughout the whole season, too.
We knew we had one objective and that's make the dance. So I mean everybody
loved each other, everybody did it for each other. So, that's how you enjoy
it. I mean knowing all the hard work is paying off, you know, going 3-0 in our
tournament, having ten good practices before this game. We did it or each
other and the coaching staff, all the administration behind us. We had fun
with it throughout the whole process. We also knew we had to come out here and
play our butts off.  
  
Q. Garrison, North Carolina talked about how you were a focal point
coming into this game, kind of slowing you down. They mentioned your 39-point
game against Florida Gulf Coast. Can you talk about how they disrupted your
game offensively today?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It was for sure tough to get shots off there, hard close-
outs and had some good guys down low, they were interfering with my layups and
stuff. It was tough. They played great. Defensively Pinson and Williams, they
played great. It was tough to get shots off for sure. It was unacceptable the
way I played. I take full responsibility and will work hard this off-season
for next year.  
  
Q. Kenny, talk about that stretch late in the first half, you guys were
leading 33-31. How did it feel during that stretch and then what do you think
happened during their 10-1 run?  
KENNY COOPER: I think things were flowing for us. We were making shots. Not
quite get as many shots as I would have liked, but they were scoring. But we
were kind of trading baskets for awhile, and then shots stopped falling for us
for a little bit and they went on a little run because they continued to
score. So, again, they're a great team. So, it's hard to slow them down when
you're not scoring and they're so good in transition. That's one of the things
that kind of let them extend the lead a little bit.  
  
Q. Rob, what did you make of the big Lipscomb contingency that made the
trip to Charlotte and all the other thousands that tuned in on CBS?  
ROB MARBERRY: We loved it. Pretty much the City of Nashville behind us right
there showing out. To see those guys and the fans, see them in the hotel
cheering for us, it's an incredible feeling. Next season we're going to build
off that, and if we have one more fan in the stand next season, it's a win for
us. So, we were super excited about that when we saw everybody. Means a lot
that we worked so hard throughout the season, and to have those guys show up
and cheer for us, it means a lot to us and to the coaching staff, the families
that are involved with all this, because it looks like we're paying off
finally.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay. Rob, Kenny,
Garrison, you guys can head back to the locker room. Congratulations on a
great year. Questions for Coach Alexander.  
  
Q. What I was going to ask, how will recruiting be different now? How
will this program be different now that it's an NCAA Tournament team?  
CASEY ALEXANDER: That's the job of our staff. We have great short-term
benefits for winning, coming -- you get to come play, you get to experience
it, you create a lot of excitement for yourself. But the residual effect, the
long-term effect, is where our staff has to get to work and capitalize on it
and continue to grow incrementally. We're not going to just all of a sudden be
somebody we haven't been, but we can continue to take the next step and knock
on some doors we haven't knocked on in the past and let that continue to help
our program get better.  
  
Q. I'd like your take on the stretch at the end of the half. Obviously
you had the lead with three minutes left in the half and it didn't seem like
the stage was too big for you, but they just had -- ran away from you during
that stretch.  
CASEY ALEXANDER: We lost a little bit of momentum when Garrison got his second
foul. He didn't play the last probably 6, 7 minutes of the half because he had
been playing pretty well up until that point. And then we had one very
specific possession, I remember, where we had subbed at a free throw. We made
a free throw, and the next possession they come down, we weren't matched up.
Pinson got and 1. That was a real tough break because it was a mistake that we
made that shouldn't have happened. Then it was really just -- they scored five
out of the last seven possessions, I think, and we scored zero out of the last
seven possessions to end the half.  
  
I felt like we lost our poise a little bit offensively, kind of gave into the
momentum offensively and therefore we had the margin that we did. I was
disappointed for sure because I felt like we really competed and had a lot of
really good moments in that first half. To go into the break down 9 was tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, what adjustments did you make to try and hang around as it
started to gradually slip away?  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Nothing significant, honestly. I felt like big picture we
were doing okay. There were some subtle things that, you know, that we work on
all the time, ball screen coverage, you know, the communication problem we had
at that free throw time. Things like that were the things I felt like we
needed to eliminate. I didn't feel like there was just anything that we had to
change significantly. We did make one adjustment in the second half
offensively. We went to a different style of offense where we had a lot more
player movement. Felt that might open some good things for us. Got a couple of
good looks out of it.  
  
Q. Casey, go through and talk about the team you've got coming back. Who
do you lose and talk about who comes back for this team.  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, as Garrison mentioned we lose three seniors that gave a
lot to this program. But for people that are just looking at stats, they
weren't significant contributors. We return all five starters. We return Matt
Rose who was a really good scorer for us off the bench, and we'll earn return
Nathan Moran, a three-year starter for us and thousand point scorer almost
that didn't play a single game this season. And so we do have a really good
group coming back. We're not going to be so talented at all where we could
just show up and win, but between the experience that we have and the quality
of depth that we have, then we should walk into the off-season with some
expectations.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the historical significance for you. We talked
about with the players. What about this moment for you being on the stage and
what it means for this program going forward.  
CASEY ALEXANDER: Yeah, I hope it means we'll be back on this stage going
forward. That's the goal. For me personally, you know, I get the most joy just
out of sharing it with my family and all of the Lipscomb community that
supports us. You know, when somebody gives you a chance to be their coach and
they give you the resources you need and the support that you need, the love
that you need to go do your job, it's awesome to be able to hand something
back over to them and see them experience this moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. All right. Thank you, Coach.

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Joel and Theo.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel any less pressure this year?  
THE MODERATOR: Joel.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: I mean that's a hard question. I mean I don't feel any
pressure. You know, this is our last one, and we just want to enjoy it as much
as we can and just do like we did last year and take it one game at a time and
make sure we're focusing on the game that's coming up. We don't want to look
ahead. I know everybody, you know, the question is do we want to make it back
to the Final Four. I mean that's the ultimate goal, but right now we just have
to make sure we're taking it one at a time and just focusing in on that game.  
  
THEO PINSON: I agree with what Joel said. We'll take it one game at a time. I
think my biggest thing is living it up right now, just enjoying the process,
enjoying this, all the practice coming up, all that type of stuff. Staying in
the moment. I think that's the biggest thing for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please address your questions to a specific student-athlete.  
  
Q. This is for both you guys. You've been to a few NCAA Tournament games
before, you've been here before. What are you guys doing to try to help the
freshmen grasp what's getting ready to happen?  
THEO PINSON: I think we're just being ourselves. I mean going around,
laughing, having fun with each other, and taking it as a regular game. We know
it's not a regular game. Everybody understands what's going on, but at the
same time, we want everybody to be relaxed and just know that we need to just
take it one game at a time. I think we're doing a good job of that right now,
just making sure the young guys understand you can't win it all until you win
the first one. We have to take it one game at a time and see what happens.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. I think what helped us out the last couple of years is
just us coming into, you know, doing the interviews and going out to the
court. Every time you see us, we're always laughing and joking around. That's
how you have to be. If you sit around and think about the game too much and
think about if you lose you go home, that kind gets to you a little bit. So
just us -- with our personalities ad; the way this team has been over the last
couple of years of us just going out and just always having fun and laughing
and joking, I think that kind of relaxes everybody and you get your mind off
of, you know, the one game and you go home. It just gives you a chance to
relax and enjoy the moment. I think that's helped us.  
  
Q. Question for Theo. Apologies if it's a bit of an essay question. You
and Mike Buckland from Lipscomb, high school teammates, two State titles,
right?  
THEO PINSON: Yep.  
  
Q. Can you describe for us what the relationship between the two of you
is like, what it was like when were you playing in high school ball, and if
you guys have had any communication since you guys got paired?  
THEO PINSON: Me and Mike are really good friends. In high school he was always
that guy to look up to the older guys. He always listened, he always tried to
learn from us, even though he wasn't as big of a freshman -- I mean as big of
a player as all of us were. We were all highly ranked and stuff like that. He
was always under the radar. But he always worked hard and always wanted to get
better. I haven't talked to him that much since I've been at college because,
I mean, I've been where I am and where he is. We're not the same age or
whatever. But he's a really good dude and I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. This is to either one. Lot of people want to can call this a rebuild
year for you guys. Do you guys feel like that way, or do you feel like you
have a solid identity on who you are going to the tournament?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think this year was kind of a rebuilding year, but I knew we
were going to have our ups and downs with the young players that we have. But
to make it as far as we have and to be at the point where we are now as a
team, I wouldn't have thought we would have been this good.  
  
Like I said, we're having the young players and guys from this team who are
stepping into different roles from last year. You know, it was really only me
and Theo the ones that were returning from the run last year that actually got
a chance to play in the game and got some good minutes. Everybody else, you
know, Luke, Kenny, you know, they weren't playing as much, and so even those
guys are stepping into different roles this year.  
  
So, you know, it's been an up-and-down year, but towards the end, you know,
for some reason we always end up clicking and that's when you want to be
playing your best basketball. And I think that when we went up to the ACC
Tournament, even though we wanted to win, we made some strides and, you know,
showed ourselves that we can be as good as any team in the country. We just
have to put our mind to it.  
  
You know, it is a rebuilding year, but I think we've done a great job of
getting the young guys to buy into the system and the older guys to play a
little bit better, and me and Theo led this team and, like I said, we made
some strides this year.  
  
Q. Both players, how important is it to have a healthy Cameron Johnson
in the lineup for you guys? And as guys who have been through this before
couple of times, does it give you a rush to see an older guy like that going
through this for the first time and kind of discovering all things you already
knew about this tournament?  
THEO PINSON: I think, like I said, with Cam being on the floor, it's another
threat. You have to be aware of him being on the floor because he's such a
good shooter and he can open up the court. And even if he's not moving well,
with him being on the court it opens up driving lanes because you don't want
to help off of him because he will still knock down the shot that's not going
nowhere. That's a big thing for us.  
  
Yeah, I mean, at the same time, I just try to make sure everybody knows just
be in the moment, enjoy the moment. You never know when it's going to be the
-- you don't know if you're going to come back here at all. You want to enjoy
every moment.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Basically what Theo said. Cam is a great shooter, and you know
that's what he does, and if we can have him out on the court, regardless it
opens up the court. We want to be able to drive the ball and get it into the
lane. Even though this year we've taken a lot of 3-pointers, we still want to
get the ball down low, and still get in the paint and get some driving lanes.
So having him out on the court spaces out the court to where you have to
respect him as a shooter. And so we need him to be out on the court, and he's
doing everything he can to get his body right and I'm sure he will play, you
know, with. You know, with him being the older guy, he won't sit out the
tournament. He's pretty excited, you know, coming from a team who didn't make
the tournament, and so I think that he's pretty excited to be in this and we
want him to be able to enjoy it as much as possible. So they're doing
everything in -- our trainers are doing everything in their will to help him
get out there on the court and play.  
  
Q. Both players. Before Sunday, how aware were you of Lipscomb? Did you
even know Lipscomb was a team and what have you learned since then, since
preparation has begun, about them?  
THEO PINSON: I did, of course, because my old teammate went there. But also I
remember we was looking at film on Tennessee and they played Tennessee right
before we did, so we saw a couple clips on them before. I mean that's about
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel?  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. I've heard of the school before, but, you know, I really
didn't get a chance to see them play much. But we've been watching film and
been watching tape. They're a good team. They like to get out and play a fast
pace like we do. I think they average more points per game than we do. So, we
know it's going to be a fast-paced game, which we like. We got to make sure
that they're not playing it better than us.  
  
Q. Theo, you're such a catalyst for this team. When you look back at the
Virginia Championship game, what went wrong in that game and what do you think
your role in this tournament should be for this team?  
THEO PINSON: Well, me going 1 for 10 wasn't good at all. Also, just -- they
made big-time plays, big-time shots at the end of the game. Kyle made some
big-time shots. Those are the ones that you just got to tip your hat to them.
Those are huge. We were right there, we made a couple plays at the end and
made a turnover that tried to throw to Garrison that was terrible, speaking
personally.  
  
Other than that, I mean in the tournament just be Theo. Do what I've been
doing pretty much the whole season. Get my teammates the ball, staying
aggressive and doing it on defensive end also. Just doing whatever it takes to
win games is the biggest thing for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Time for two more questions. Anybody else?  
  
Q. Are you guys doing anything differently going into the tournament
this year to try to avoid any complacency or anything like that?  
THEO PINSON: We just lost so it's not really any complacency as all. That adds
a little more fire to us. Just the fact -- we went four days in a row of
playing quality teams and had a chance to get a championships and we fell
short. So, if that doesn't get everybody motivated I don't know what will. And
it's the NCAA Tournament. We've been here before. We're excited and we want to
go out on top.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Middle of the room.  
  
Q. After being in the ACC wars for the last two months, how does it feel
to get a chance to play some different teams for now?  
JOEL BERRY II: That's what Coach was stressing in practice today and practice
the other day before we left, is that now we're getting a chance to play
against different teams who necessarily don't know our offense as much as a
conference team would. We have to make sure that we're going out there,
executing what we're doing and what we want to do. You know, it's hard in the
conference when every team knows exactly what you're about to run and know,
you know, every single play that you have, and now you're going against teams
who don't know us.  
  
We have to make sure we're executing and doing -- running the plays that we
want to run because they're going to work and eventually the teams catch on to
it in the game. But right now, you know, we're going against teams who don't
know us as well, so that's a great thing, being able to go against another
team from another conference that, you know, we don't know each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. This is a question for both guys. Can you describe in what ways you
feel like this game against number 15, Lipscomb, feels dangerous?  
THEO PINSON: I think anybody can be beat. I think we saw last year, I think it
was Middle Tennessee State beat Michigan State or something like that. I mean,
it can happen. But, at the same time, we're focused. We know they can score
the ball. They scored 106 points in their championships game. I mean, I don't
know if we hit that this year or not. They can score the ball, great shooters
and so we're mentally prepared and we'll be ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah. I mean we're coming into the tournament. We want just do
what we have to do regardless of what team it is. I mean, we can't look down
on any team. They call it March Madness for a reason. Anything can happen. All
it takes is for one team to play great that day, and I mean that's all it
takes and the next thing you know, you're going home.  
  
We have to make sure regardless of who it is, 1, 16, you just got to come out
and play basketball. If you're a competitor you don't worry about the runs,
just go out there and do what you do on as a basketball player and compete on
every single play. I know personally I will do it that and I'll do my best to
try to help my teammates to understand that if we want to be the best that we
want to be, regardless of what seed they are, we just got to be out and got to
play Carolina basketball and do what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks guys.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Opening statement would be see that Tiger Woods just birdied a
hole. He's the sole leader now at 4 under par through 16 holes. That's all I
got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions about that or anything else?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: He doubled bogied a hole, two. He's 4 under with a double bogey.  
  
Q. We've been over the Luke story before, but I feel like there is this
misconception that he was sleeping on the sidewalk outside your office begging
for a roster spot when really he was pursued by a number of different teams in
your league. And what did you have to say to him to turn down those
scholarship offers from other schools? I know eventually he's always been on
scholarship, but when were you recruiting him, that wasn't the case.  
ROY WILLIAMS: You're exactly right, Joe. A funny story. I go see him play in
the spring of his junior year, I think it was, and at an event in Myrtle
Beach. And I was there, head coach at North Carolina State was there, the head
coach at Clemson was there, the head coach at Virginia was there, the head
coach of Notre Dame day was there, the head coach at Davidson was there. It
was perhaps the worst basketball game I've ever seen in my life. And Luke fit
right in, but everybody had seen him before that time as well, but no, he
could have gone anyplace he wanted to go, really. I mean Notre Dame offered,
Clemson offered, Virginia I think had offered. He could have gone anywhere.  
  
What I had to do is just convince him that you're going to be treated just
like a scholarship guy. You'll never have anything different. If the
scholarship guys run ten sprints, you'll run it. If they get filet mignon,
you'll get if filet mignon. The only thing, because we don't have a
scholarship, your first year mom and dad are going to have to pay the bills.  
  
I want you here. I think you fit in here. I think you're going to be
successful here. You're going to surprise people here. I really did believe
that. He had been to our camp two years or maybe three, and so I felt that
strongly that he would be successful and both mom and dad being North Carolina
parents and graduating from our place was pretty good, too.  
  
Q. Roy, do you have an update on Cameron Johnson's health? And how
important is it to what you do to have him out there and functioning, you
know, close to a hundred percent?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think at this time of the year, you need everybody that's been
important to you all year to function at a high level. You need those guys
coming off the bench to be able to do and step up their play a little bit
more. Cam practiced this morning. We've already had practice. He got through
it, didn't seem to have any problems. Unless he's laying back in there on the
floor that I don't know about it, I would feel that he would be fine.  
  
He adds another shooter from the outside. He's a good basketball player. He
can make plays, too. He's got to get better defensively and all those kind of
things. But no, he's important to us and I expect him to be full go.  
  
Q. Quick question. How are you soaking up these last moments with
Theo?  
ROY WILLIAMS: How am I soaking up these last moments with Theo, I'm really
sort of counting down when I'll get rid of the rascal (laughter). What are you
thinking? He's a unique young man that I've really, really, really enjoyed. In
some basket ball games, he's dominated the game without being a great scorer.
He's one of the best leaders in practices, one of the best talkers I've ever
seen on the court, when it's very appropriate to talk. He talks a lot of other
times, sometimes when it's not appropriate, I guess. But no, he's a unique
individual. He really is. I'll miss the sucker so I hope we get to play a few
more weeks.  
  
Q. Aaron Rohlman is a guy you took a chance on last year. He's now a
senior, chance to go 2 for 2 in this event. What does it that mean to you?  
ROY WILLIAMS: If he can pull that off, he'll be one of the greatest players in
North Carolina history. I don't think there's anybody that's been there two
years and won two. Aaron is a fantastic kid. I don't know what's wrong with my
throat. But a fantastic kid, been a great addition to our team. Everybody else
on the team just adopted him immediately. He takes kidding very well because
they kid him, I kid him, but he's been a pleasure to coach as well. Great
young man. He's going to be very successful some day. He'll be my boss one
day.  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen from Lipscomb? Is there anything -- what's
the one thing that sticks out at you that they could possibly give you trouble
with?  
ROY WILLIAMS: There's a lot of things that stick out that could give us
problems. But their ability to shoot the ball, ability to score, the pace they
play. One thing that really jumps out at me is Mathews has shot, I think -- I
don't have the stats up here in front me -- I think he shot 130 or 140 more
free throws than anybody on our team. I mean, that's remarkable. Tiger may
have made another birdie. My phone is buzzing.  
  
But it is something, they do a great job of getting to the free throw line.
That means the team they're playing is in foul trouble a lot. So we got to
play defense without fouling. We always go up and down every practice so we're
used to running, but this is a team that's going to run back at us. Yesterday
in practice we had two different occasions where we didn't get good defensive
balance and the blue team lays it up. That's what we're going to face
tomorrow. We can't give up -- they have scorers who are expected to score and
come through for them every time. They have rebounders, defenders, guys who
set screens. Casey has done a nice job. It's a very well-coached team. The
thing that jumps out at me is how many times -- because everybody talks about
a shooter. He can really shoot the ball, but my gosh, he's not just a shooter,
they don't foul too many of those 3s.  
  
Q. So just to be clear you get Tiger updates sent to your phone
immediately. Is this going to be a distraction for you, this Tiger comeback
that seems to be enthralling the country?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I was looking around. Taylor Czar (phonetic) was at the Final
Four that -- that was not, somebody wanting tickets (laughter). Why even check
the doggone thing? Taylor Czar said one time at the Final Four, "Where does
Tiger stand today?l" right before I walked in. I'm a huge fan. Michael Jordan
and Tiger Woods to me are the guys that I really have a great deal of respect
for because they were the best and nobody had better focus, nobody had better
work habits and all that. I'm amazed by those kind of guys. Michael -- I'm
pretty close to Michael and I've seen it up close and personal. I met Tiger
one time, I talked to him on the phone. He's surprised me. I never thought he
would get back here. I really didn't. I did not have the faith, but I am a fan
so I enjoy -- what else will I do, sit here and wait for 30 minutes until I
talk to you guys? Come on.  
  
Q. Two?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Two formers players are asking for tickets tomorrow.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think we're getting recognition. It's what we deserve. We
didn't win the regular season or the tournament. We're a pretty doggone good
basketball team. I believe if we play well and do the right things, that we
can play a lot and so that's probably the way people are treating us. I heard
Jay and Seth, and I forget who else it was, nobody picked us to go to the
Final Four. Michael Wilbon did. I'm not saying he's a lot smarter than the
rest of those guys. What we try to do really is just enjoy the experience. I
want our guys to enjoy this today. Then I want them to play their tail off and
enjoy the locker room tomorrow. And if we play well enough, perhaps somebody
will let us stay around and play again. And that's the reason we do all the
stuff on putting in how many teams are left. I know it's a thing you guys
don't like to hear, but we really do take it one game at a time. Somebody
let's us play again, that's great.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked your players this question, I'm ask you, too. Your
thoughts, you've been playing ACC teams the last two months. Getting to play
somebody different for a change?  
ROY WILLIAMS: We talked about it with the team, that there may be some things
we'll do in the game tomorrow they may not recognize before we do it. Once you
get in the league and playing people 18 times and things like we do in your
own TV every game, if we call "box right," the coaches on the other staff they
yell "box right." So, perhaps we might get something that they're not familiar
with and the same thing. We showed our team clips yesterday on Lipscomb the
first time. I started watching tape -- I can't even remember -- I guess Monday
night, but throughout the course of the year you're playing people, you watch
tape, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 weeks, see them play 8, 10 times. We've been in some
tough, tough first round games. I mean I've been in some really tough ones.
Kansas one time we were the No. 1 seed and Holy Cross had us beat, we're down
9 with five minutes to play. Kirk Hinrich hurt his ankle. He's sitting on the
end of the bench with a ice wrap. Two years ago Florida Gulf Coast. A really
good basketball game. We probably blew them out by 5 or 6. I can't remember,
but it was something like that.  
  
So, we do try to realize that we've got a target on our back. And that's okay,
I like that.  
  
Q. Coach, has there been a player maybe behind the sense in practice who
has really made a post-season leap, you know, ever since the regular season
ended in practice or whatnot?  
ROY WILLIAMS: If you were to ask each one of them, they probably say it was
them. I don't think so. Our guys, those other guys that don't get all the
minutes, they've been pretty steady for us all year long. I think K.J. Smith
has gotten better all along as we go. Aaron Rohlman that we talked about a
minute ago, just does a marvelous job. He can play the 5, the 4, the 3 with
the scout team. I don't see anybody that's jumped out. I know for awhile there
Garrison Brooks, his minutes and production slowed down a little bit. I think
he played better in the ACC Tournament. But other than that, nobody jumps out
at me.  
  
Q. Roy, anybody this year or in recent history that Lipscomb really
reminds you of that you've played against?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, two bad memories, Belmont and Wofford. Belmont beat a
pretty good team in the Smith Center a few years ago and Wofford beat a pretty
good team in there this year. Mathews can shoot the ball. Marberry gives them
another guy up front. Little more balanced than people think I would hope that
they think those are compliments because both those teams beat us. That's
exactly who it looks like to me. One of our coaches said it reminds us of
looking at ourselves because they do push the ball, they do share the ball,
shoot from the outside, they do score inside. So -- but I think those two
games.  
  
Q. Someone asked Joel about this being a down year. He said it kind of
was a down year and he didn't expect this team to be where they are now. What
are your thoughts on that? Would you reflect his answer or did you expect your
team to be where they are now?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I expect to win every game, I really do. Start the season, first
meeting I told them, I'm standing here looking at guys that are good enough to
win the whole blessed thing. You got to play. You got to buy in. You got to
wish -- we saw tape on Virginia, not just from the game but this is the way we
want to play, I think that should be very flattering to Tony and his team.
2005, middle of the season I brought in tape of Illinois to show our team how
unselfish Illinois were. They were the number 1 team in the country that time.
They were playing better than anybody. We ended up playing them. We beat them.
I don't really try to figure out where we can be and be up or down myself. I
just think let's practice every day, work every day, try to be better every
day. And that sounds corny as all get out, but that's exactly what we do.
Today I said let's get better, let's get better.  
  
Coach Wooden told me one time that at the start of the season he would get his
schedule and mark down which games he thought they would win and which games
he thought may lose. And put it in an envelope and put it in his desk and
wouldn't get it out until the season is over. He would get it out. Coach, I
can't do that. I can't even remember who we played the second game. That is
true. But I said, "Coach I'm sure you're pretty close all the time to what you
expect."  
  
For Joel to say that, he was looking at Justin was gone, Kennedy was gone,
Isaiah was gone, Nate Britt was gone, who is going to take those guy's places.
I'm sure there were doubts, but I really don't try to look down the road to
figure out what what we would be.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome juniors from left to right, Barry Brown, junior and
Dean Wade, student-athletes from Kansas State. We'll have about 15 minutes.
Ask you to raise your hand, let us get the handheld mike do you. Let us know
who you are, who you're with, and please direct your question to the specific
student-athlete.  
  
Q. Dean, I'm sure you didn't expect this question today, but how are you
doing physically with your foot?  
DEAN WADE: I'm doing good. Gets better everyday. So, it's doing better.  
  
Q. Are you expected to play?  
DEAN WADE: Just a game-time decision.  
  
Q. You shut down some pretty good scorers. What are your plans, if
you're the one guarding Marcus Foster, what do you plan to do with him?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We have a good team defense and we have a particular way
we're going to try and guard him and contain him and not let him and some of
the other scorers get loose. It's going to be my responsibility, but I mean my
teammates going to have my back and I'm going to have theirs.  
  
Q. Barry, you look a lot better than the last time we saw you. How is
the eye? What went through your head as were you laying on the Sprint Center
floor?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: My eye is pretty good. Maybe 98 percent., I guess. It's
doing good right now. I can see pretty much a hundred percent almost. I mean
-- but when it happened, I was just kind of in shock. It was just scary to see
a lot of blood in my eye and I really wanted to get back there on the floor to
help my teammates out. Ultimately I couldn't, so I just tried to cheer from
the bench.  
  
Q. Dean, you said it's a game-time decision, but the fact it's lose-and-
go-home-type situation, how likely are you to play?  
DEAN WADE: Depends how I feel. I would love to be to be out there. This is
what you dream of as a little kid, being in March Madness, everything like
that. I'm itching to get out there. We'll see what happens. If I can't, I'm
going to be the best cheerleader we got, not -- our actual cheerleaders are
pretty good. I'll be on the bench and I'll be cheering them on.  
  
Q. Dean, not playing in Kansas City in the play, talked about how Mark
played and how important it was to see him step up into that kind of role?  
DEAN WADE: He played amazing. Ton of energy on the floor. Was very focused,
very motivated. He played physically but he was also under control the whole
time. Just a technician down there. They couldn't stop him. Him playing that
well boosts his confidence a ton, and just seeing him fight like that I think
gives our team a little more confidence in him. And, you know, they thought
hard. That was the best fight I've seen out of him this year, and we're going
to need that in the tournament so hopefully we keep that rolling.  
  
Q. Barry, you've played and defended a lot of really good guards in the
Big 12. Are there any that you think are somewhat similar to what you'll face
in the game tomorrow night?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I can't even think about that now. I'm sure it is. He's a
scorer. Kind of a lead scorer, 20 points a game for his team. And so I've been
watching him a lot these past few days since we found out who we're playing. I
kind of know what he wants to pick his shots at and where he likes to get his
shots off now. I'm going to do my best on him.  
  
Q. For either one of you. The chances we'll see the two-one throw backs
tomorrow night?  
DEAN WADE: I wish.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I wish. I don't know. I don't think the NCAA allows it in
March Madness. So, I mean, I wish they did but I don't think it's going to
happen.  
  
Q. Dean, of all the things you've accomplished this year, in particular
inference play, I'm just curious where you feel like your game has grown the
most over the course of this conference season?  
DEAN WADE: You know, I've grown as a player. I think most of that has to do
with my maturity mentally and just how I approach the game. You know, every
game is a do-or-die situation in the Big 12. That's how I thought about it,
and I just wanted to be aggressive a little more consistent than I was the
past couple years and I think that had a lot to do with my teammates just
keeping me going, keeping me -- keeping my confidence up when I was down. And
I think it's just a combination of a lot of hard work in the off-season that's
paying off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Both of you, how important is it for this program to get this win, to
get through the round of 64 and kind of get that monkey off the program's
back?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: It's very important for us. We are really trying to not only
get into the tournament, which is one of our goals as a team, but win some
games in the tournament. And so to get this first win will mean a lot for our
program and fans, our coaches and even us as players. We made it here last
year. Unfortunately we got knocked off in the first round. Hopefully we're
ready and little more mature to handle this first round.  
  
DEAN WADE: I mean it would be huge for us, just shows like we're picked low in
the Big 12, it would be big come out and prove some people wrong and so it
would be big for our program.  
  
Q. I know you're not sure on your status yet. Assuming perhaps did you
play tomorrow, would you have any concern about conditioning, your rhythm with
the team being away from practice for a little bit?  
DEAN WADE: Yeah, I'd be pretty concerned with it. I just focus on defense. I
haven't really been out there with them guys practicing, keeping the condition
up, but I just focus on defense and doing what I can do which is defense,
playing hard, and rebounding.  
  
Q. This question is for both of you because it's about both of you. You
two seem to have grown really close as the season gone on, not that you
weren't close before, but there seems to be a real bond, something about being
the two guys that has really clicked with you guys. Am I accurate in that, or
do you really hate each other when you walk away from the podium?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I think we've grown a little bit closer, just trying to
rally our guys together early in the season, trying to boost our stock in the
Big 12 and ultimately in the seeding for the tournament. We kind of just try
to take the team under our wing and be the best players we can be on and off
the court, be vocal leaders and lead on and off court, in the weight room,
class, all kind of stuff. And I think that kind of jelled us together, brought
us together a little bit. I think teammates are kind of following our lead.  
  
DEAN WADE: Just off what Barry said, we're the older guys, we have a lot of
new guys, young guys haven't really been through the fire, I guess you could
say. Kind of took it under ourselves to take them under our wing and just
really show them through the ways and, you know, how to keep stay focused
through the Big 12 season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll see you tomorrow
night.  
  
We welcome Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you just update us on Dean Wade's, how he's doing?  
BRUCE WEBER: We had him in the boot basically all week. You know, during
practice he would do treatment and some running in the pool, some different
things, and today is probably the first day let him do a little bit. We were
in another gym, just let him get some shooting and moving around. We'll let
him shoot this afternoon and just see how he feels. Probably be a game-time
decision tomorrow with him. Barry is fine, Barry -- he was back in practice on
Monday. I don't think he had total a hundred percent vision on Monday,
Tuesday, but he's back to normal right now, no problem with him at all.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what was your first reaction when you saw this draw kind
of come out and obviously Marcus and also Nigel Johnson of Virginia?  
BRUCE WEBER: Kind of laughed about it. You know, to me the most important
thing, we got in the tournament. My second wish was maybe for Dean's sake to
play Friday and get to play Friday night and get a little bit of rest. Marcus
is a very good player, good offensive player. Proud that we -- our staff found
him, helped with the development. Obviously he had some -- I don't know if you
call it setbacks or whatever, some different situations came up and he's done
a great job for Creighton and Coach Mac. And then Nigel obviously had some
different things with him but we can't worry about that. All we're worried
about is playing Creighton and seeing if we can stop them and one of the key
players will be obviously Marcus as their leading scorer.  
  
Q. Coach, with all the attention on Marcus, not just off the floor but
on it, does a guy like Khyri Thomas seem like someone who might not be getting
enough attention this week.  
BRUCE WEBER: I said the first day after we got the Selection Sunday night when
we had the little media get together that Marcus is very good at scoring but
Thomas overall all around he might be a better player. I don't think there's
any -- he does so much for them. He's a lock-down defender, he's strong, he
can post up. He plays a little bit of point, little bit of 3, 2, for them.
He's shooting the 3 ball well. Just he's a good compliment to Marcus and their
team. He's a good player. There's no doubt about it. You look at the potential
draft boards and pops up on there so he must be very good if he's there.  
  
Q. Does it make preparation more challenging not knowing if Dean is
going to play or not, I mean as far as putting in sets and how you're going to
play, not being aware whether or not you're going to have him?  
BRUCE WEBER: All we can -- we kind of prepared without him. We did stuff
without him, and I guess it helps because they've been playing small ball for
the most part. So kind of when we played Kansas, when -- welcome to 6'5" and
under. It's similar to -- give us -- if they were big now, we might have a
little bit of an issue, but it's going to be tough no matter what. But we've
been dealing with it. Obviously if Dean is there, it gives us a little bit of
a big guy that can score inside with Mac. Hopefully that will give us an
advantage.  
  
Q. Bruce, just if you could sort of give some insight into how the
decision is going to be made with Wade. Is this going to mostly be about how
he feels working out on it, or is it possible there's a component of this
decision that's going to be you throttling back his enthusiasm and in his own
best interest?  
BRUCE WEBER: The most important thing is his best interest for his future.
Obviously he's one of the better players. He's got not only a future with
K-State but hopefully in the NBA and we can't let that -- we don't want to
harm him where something would happen he couldn't play in the future. So,
we're relying on our team doctors and trainer. Dean wants to play. He wanted
to play against Kansas on Friday night, and we just said for your future and
to have a chance to play this week, we needed to sit him and rest him. And
we'll just -- we'll see how he feels and then, you know, talking to the
doctors and the trainers, we'll make the final decision.  
  
Q. Based on the information that you already have, are you predisposed
to leaning one way or another?  
BRUCE WEBER: We've gone without him all week so we're prepared that way. If he
plays, obviously you got one of the best players in the Big 12, one of the
better power forwards in the country. It would be a nice addition to us. We've
got to see what happens and can't always plan. I didn't plan to have Barry
Brown only one minute the other night either. You expect the unexpected. You
just got to play.  
  
Q. Coach, sticking with Dean, you've been at this a long time. When you
watch Dean Wade play, he's not a highlight reel. He's kind of the opposite.
He's fundamentally sound, almost a coach's dream to work with?  
BRUCE WEBER: Yeah. There's no doubt. And his improvement from -- you guys have
seen it that cover us from day one, from high school, the guy -- if you saw
him in high school, his confidence, his strength, he's really intelligent as a
player, he's so versatile and he does stuff on both ends of the court. He's
one of the better defenders for big guys. He knows ball screen schemes. He's
probably one of the best passers for a big guy. We almost kind of joke, if he
was at maybe some other place besides Manhattan, Kansas he would be getting a
lot more attention nationally. I think that will come in the future. I know as
the season went on, a lot of NBA calls, lot of agent calls, all that so he's
got a future and it's been fun to coach him, watch his development. And the
best thing about him his character. He wants to win. He's so humble and it is,
as you said kind of a dream come true for a coach .  
  
Q. At some point you're going to have a conversation with Marcus, if not
before the handshake after the game. Do you have any idea what you might say
to him?  
BRUCE WEBER: I'm just happy for him. If he's successful and he's doing things
the right way, that's great. And if I'm part of that, that's even better. I
said it over and over, you know, it's my job to help them, help them. There's
more than just basketball. There's school, basketball, and there's also life
and doing things right. And, you know, if he's making progress in all those
things and I had something to do with it, that's great.  
  
Q. Bruce, I'm just wondering how big are you a proponent if Wade is only
shooting for the first time this week? Maybe he's been in film sessions and
understands the game plan, he hasn't been out there executing and practicing
it. Does that have anything to do with your decision at all he hasn't had --  
BRUCE WEBER: Not really. We played all year. If this was week two or
something, I'd be a little bit hesitant on it. And what we just talked about.
He's so smart and he knows where everyone should be and that was our biggest
fear against Kansas because he's kind of -- I don't want to call it the
football free safety. He kind of sees it all and he's there in the right spots
and covering up for when guys make mistakes. So that part I wouldn't have --
getting his rhythm, his explosion, and it's like Kam was out three, four
weeks. When you're out that long and don't play basketball, it takes a little
bit of time. But obviously he gives you a big body, smarts, he does so many
things for us. He still can help us. I really believe that.  
  
Q. Coach, addressing nobody in particular, you had to hit the reset year
three after things happened, you lost seven underclassmen under that group.
When you went back to do the rebuild, how much did character play into when
you looked at guys like Dean and Barry because they're high character guys
that are accountable and hold themselves accountable?  
BRUCE WEBER: It was very important. That and we talked a lot about getting
guys that have won. If you look at Barry Brown, he took his team to the Final
Four. Dean Wade won a bunch of State Championships. Kamau won State
Championships, City Championships. Levi won State Championships. You get guys
that care about winning. It's important. Talent is one thing and it's great
and you need talent, but if you can find guys that care and they want to do
things the right way and give you great leadership, it's probably the best
thing about our team is the leadership. It's made it so much easier. It
definitely helps and it's something that we did address as a staff.  
  
Q. Bruce, you told us Sunday when you had the conversation with Kam when
he was -- when you had been shooting free throws, told him to relax. Has he
responded the way you would like to at this point?  
BRUCE WEBER: The nice thing we actually had practice this week. He hasn't had
practice. You know, when he came back during the middle of the games, you
maybe had one practice a week, you got preparation, you got a game, and then
you got the day after where you're just kind of going through things and
shooting. So we had really three good days of practice. I thought he did well.  
  
Q. You know, I told him to focus on all the little things that can help
our team, whether it's getting us into the offense, guarding, you know, if he
makes an open shot, that's fine. But, you know, think about it, last year the
st game of the NCAA he had 24 against Wade. He's got experience. He's been
through it. Hopefully all that will add up and he'll have -- it would be nice
for him to see a smile on his face and help us get -- be successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Thank you.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the student-athletes from UMBC. Senior Jourdan
Grant, senior Jairus Lyles, senior K.J. Maura, and junior Joe Sherburne.  
  
Q. Jairus, I believe you started your career at VCU. Could you talk
about your time there and what happened, the moves you made to eventually get
to UMBC?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I played under a great coaching staff, Shaka Smart. I learned a
lot from them. Lot of pros on that team that are currently in e NBA right now,
one that plays on this team, Charlotte Hornets, Treveon Graham. I learned a
lot. A great experience for me. It didn't work out unfortunately and that led
me to Robert Morris where I stayed for a semester then I transferred to UMBC.  
  
Q. Jairus, you know, Virginia has done a really good job this season of
just keying in on a team's best scorers, especially when the offense is keyed
around one player. When you've watched tape this season -- or of their games
this season, how do you feel like they've kind of defended teams' best scorers
and how do you kind of plan to maybe get around that?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Got a great overall defense, number one defense if the country
for a reason. I fully expect them to try to take me out of the game. I got to
get my teammates involved and do a great job of moving the ball and making
them chase us.  
  
Q. Jairus, you were there under the previous coach and then when Coach
Odom in at UMBC, how quickly did you realize that things may change under his
regime?  
JAIRUS LYLES: Immediately. He came in a with different mindset than our last
coaches had. We immediately clicked as a team. What he wanted us to do we
bought in immediately. So last year we learned a lot, lot of growing pains,
but we eventually came together. So I think this year kind of like a testament
to what him and his staff brought.  
  
Q. Jairus, were you surprised as you brought the ball up court for the
last possession against Vermont that Coach Odom call timeout and when he
didn't, did that give you confidence to know that he believed in you guys to
execute it properly?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I wasn't surprised. I know how he trusts us as a team. We trust
him as a coach. He knew that we would make the right play ultimately and
that's what happened. We weren't really surprised. But yeah, just shows the
trust we have in each other as the team and coaching staff.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I'm curious, you guys made a tremendous
strides defensively this season improving. What is it that has made your
defense better this season?  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think right in the summer before this season that was our
first focus. Last summer, their first time here, our coaches, the first thing
we did all summer was work on our offensive fast break and plays. But this
summer all we did was focus mainly on defense with some drills that just is
basic as sliding and keeping your hands in the right position. Right from the
bat this year they really set that tone.  
  
K.J. MAURA: Their point of emphasis was to play great defense and pressure the
ball so we can get out and run and make our transition offense better. He
talked to me a lot this summer about pressuring the ball full court no matter
how quick is the guard so I can make him uncomfortable.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: One of the biggest emphasis was just like Joe said, sliding and
guarding without our hands, not putting our hands on guys and guarding them
with the chest and keeping ourselves in front of the ball, keeping us in
between the ball and the basket.  
  
Q. This can go to any player on the panel up there, I don't know if
y'all are familiar, but there is a statistic out there that measures luck of a
particular basketball. Basically it just kind of measures like how lucky you
are to win a close game based on your winning percentage. I was just wondering
if I could first off get your initial thoughts on there being a number that
calls you guys like the luckiest team in the country or also talk about how
your tournament journey has been, I guess, a little bit more than just about
luck.  
THE MODERATOR: Jairus.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: We don't think anything we've done this year has been luck. We
put in the work since the coaching staff got here last year. The testament to
our hard work. We had a great season last year coming from 7 wins two years
ago, going to 21 and 24, 67, 89 working for our 25th win. We have a tough task
on Friday and we have to go out and compete.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jourdan, want to take a crack at that?  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: We've worked for everything we've earned. It's a tough task on
Friday and ready to attack it.  
  
Q. Jairus, it's been made about how you're a grad transfer this year and
had an opportunity to go play someplace else. When you hit that shot against
Vermont, did you think in this moment or even in the moments after, you made
the right choice if for nothing else because you sent the team to the
tournament with that type of play?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I knew I made the right choice as soon as I made the choice. It
was never really a choice with me. I knew I was going to stay all along. It
just shows you that that's why I came back. I didn't came back to win the
championship and we did that. I'm grateful for it.  
  
Q. I know that there's been a lot of talk about the shot and obviously
it's gotten a lot of replays and everything. Have you guys sort of moved past
it or something you're still thinking about and using as sort of motivation or
anything else?  
JAIRUS LYLES: We definitely moved past it. Of course it will go down in
history and we'll relive that moment forever, but we definitely moved past it
because we know we got to play Virginia on Friday, not Vermont. It's Virginia.
We got to prepare and focus up on that game.  
  
Q. Jairus, Coach Bennett mentioned the other day he had seen you at
their camp. Was that a team camp? What do you remember about it, and did it
show you much about their program?  
JAIRUS LYLES: I don't even remember. That was probably so long ago. It's funny
because my mom and dad attended Virginia, so I'm kind of familiar with the
campus but not that familiar.  
  
Q. Just want to ask you about the challenge of being a 16 seed and then
ask if you watched any of Penn State with Kansas for a little bit earlier
today?  
K.J. MAURA: We felt we could have been a higher seed an 16. We don't feel like
the underdogs. We saw a little bit of the game of Penn and Kansas. They stayed
in the game for a long time. We're here to compete and not afraid of the
challenge. We think it's going to be a good game.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: Coach emphasized they're just numbers, 16, 1, 15, 2. Either way
it's going to be us playing a really good team, so take that for what it's
worth, I guess.  
  
Q. I'm curious, because of your defensive focus this year, is there
something special about playing Virginia since they lead the nation in
defense? Is that a cool matchup for you guys because of that focus?  
K.J. MAURA: I think it's a good matchup for us. Their emphasis is getting
stops. I think if we get a good game offensively we can subtract their defense
a little bit. In our end we got the make sure we pressure the ball and keep
them uncomfortable so they don't get good looks at the basket.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I don't know about any connection about your question but I
think it's a cool to play them just because they're the number one seed
overall. I think that's really cool.  
  
Q. Jairus, I'm curious, have you told your teammates what they might
expect when they play against Virginia, specifically what they do?  
JAIRUS LYLES: We have actually sent them some film on how they guard a lot of
ball screens and how we play. So I sent them some film. We watched some film
together. Yeah, we definitely discussed that.  
  
Q. Anyone on the panel, what is it exactly, what do y'all believe it is
about UMBC basketball style of play that could potentially give your team a
run in the tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: This year Coach Odom had a big emphasize on finding a way to
win games. Sometimes we don't shoot the ball well and sometimes we don't get
as many stops as we need to. When it comes down to it, it's just finding a way
to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joe.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think we're really unselfish and it doesn't matter who is
scoring. Jairus scores most of the points a lot of time. So many guys on the
team have led the team in scoring. We just play for each other all the time.  
  
Q. Jordan, what is it about Coach Odom? This is his third year as a head
coach. He's won 20 games each place. What is it about him that makes him so
successful?  
JOURDAN GRANT: He came in from day one and really implemented the offense that
really gave us the freedom to shoot the ball at will, and he just really
believes in us. We believe in him. When we step on the floor, he just says go
have fun and believe in yourself. I think that's a big key to our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have about four minutes left. Other questions? Front row.  
  
Q. Offensively Virginia, Kyle Guy, what do you see from their offense
and their outside shooting for any of the guys?  
THE MODERATOR: K.J.  
  
K.J. MAURA: I think the emphasis for us is to stay attached to their man when
they're coming out of pin downs and down screens. They run a lot of sets for
-- to get him open especially for Guy and Jerome. We got to arrive on the
catch and make sure he doesn't get a good look at the basket.  
  
JAIRUS LYLES: Like he said, they do a good job of making you work the whole
shot clock. We've got to stay patient and be discipline and not try to rush
it. Speed them up. Definitely make them uncomfortable, but just be patient.  
  
Q. Jordan, going off your last answer there, what does it do to you to
have a coach like that that gives you the freedom to kind of be yourselves, I
guess?  
JOURDAN GRANT: Man, with Coach Odom it just -- it really gives us the
confidence to play the way we play and be ourselves out on the court is
probably the best thing that he can do for us. I mean, we play a lot in
transition and he trust us with the reads we make with our offense. Lot of our
offense is based off of reads. He just says go out there and make the right
play. We've won 24 games. We've made a lot of right reads this year.  
  
Q. Follow up on that. I guess that's why it's not a surprise when he
let's Jairus dribble the ball up with the court with 20 seconds left and make
a play?  
JOURDAN GRANT: Jairus is a big shot maker. He's been hitting those shots all
summer on us in pickups. We just believed in him. He actually waved him off to
-- Coach Odom was calling a play and waved off. I'll take it myself. We all
believe in him.  
  
JOE SHERBURNE: I think a lot of us waved; him off.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: All of us did wave him off.  
  
Q. As players who have had to probably go up against K.J. in practice,
what is it about his style of defense that just makes him so great to the
point where he can win Defense Player of the Year.  
JAIRUS LYLES: He's annoying. He's always in you. He makes you work for
everything. Even if you can -- the height advantage we have, we can see over
him. He's still up in you. It's making you uncomfortable whatever you do,
wherever you go. He's always there, never not on you. That's kind of annoying
when you're dribbling the ball and trying to get your shot off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan.  
  
JOURDAN GRANT: I can agree with that. Going against this guy everyday in
practice has been a blessing and a curse because he's annoying, as Jairus
said. But like he said, just being on his hip and ball pressure really gets to
people sometimes. That's what he gets for being Defensive Player of the Year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One final question. Anyone? Okay. Thanks, guys.  
  
Here we go with Coach Odom from UMBC.  
  
RYAN ODOM: How is everyone? Jim Miller.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what was the play that you had called for Jairus that
you called off?  
RYAN ODOM: It was a play actually for him to get the ball back eventually, but
he would have to give it up to get it back. And his call was the right one.
Let's just keep it. We got it in our best player's hands. And you know, kind
of the rest is history. My total focus at that point was -- you got to think
quick. I wasn't calling a time out. You got two seconds to decide okay, what
am I going to do here?  
  
My goal was to make sure that everybody was kind of out of his way and get
guys in position in position so he could do what he did. What an amazing shot
for him. What an amazing moment. His moment became our moment and just really,
really special. For him to come back to school as a graduate student and have
the ball in his hands on the last possession, to go to the NCAA Tournament.
That's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you talk about your early days in Charlottesville and
growing up sort of with the UVA program and what that meant to you?  
RYAN ODOM: Just a special time, you know, in our lives. We moved there I'd say
I was in third grade, something like that. Stayed there, you know until about
you know, 10th grade, going into 10th grade. We left that summer when dad went
back to Wake Forest. Just around so many highly successful people. And
everything started with Coach Holland and how he created that family
atmosphere around his program. And I just think about it, you know, and how
lucky -- I didn't realize it at the time, obviously when you're going through
it sometimes you don't really recognize it until you're out of it, but I'd get
home from school, ride my bike across that bridge, we lived two doors down
from the Hollands, and I'd go over there and watch practice. I would sit on
the side with Jeff Jones who had just graduated. He was just out of college a
couple years and wasn't allowed to be on the court at that time. So he and I
would sit on the side and dribble the ball between our legs and watch these
great players and coaches go at it. You think about Coach Holland and all of
his assistants that he had that have all been successful in their own way and
gone out and done amazing things. The players that have gone on, you know, to
be successful in life. Just I feel very blessed to have been a part of it.  
  
Q. Seth Greenberg described you the other day as his roommate. Were you
ever --  
RYAN ODOM: I was. I was. That was right when we moved there. And so I guess
Ralph graduated was that '82? Right, '82, '83? Okay. So that next year Final
Four year obviously Coach Greenberg was on the staff. When he first came on
staff, he stayed with us a little bit and so we had two little twin beds and
so he was in the room with me for a bit. I guess, you know, he was forced to
hire me at the end, you know, when I got into coaching at South Florida.  
  
Q. It seems like from talking to the players that if you had of called a
timeout and kind of told Jairus what to run, that goes against everything
you've done there for two years with just letting the players be themselves.
Give you a chance to elaborate on that.  
RYAN ODOM: Absolutely. I knew I was not calling timeout. As soon as I looked
up at the clock and we had the ball, you know, and the shot clock was off, I
was not going to give them the opportunity to set up what they wanted to do
defensively. You know, it played out right for us and obviously I'd be remiss
if I didn't say Vermont has had two exceptional years. I mean unreal. Not
covered enough nationally. To go undefeated las t year, go into the NCAA
Tournament and then -- yup -- I'm sorry. Were you lifting your hand there. And
then this year only lose one game and then lose to us in the finals. Just an
amazing, amazing job by John Becker and his staff and players. But yeah.  
  
Q. I was wondering, as you look at the players that are on your team
that are reaching the end of their collegiate career, if you could talk about
what exactly they have done to embody what UMBC basketball is all about and
how they've liked translated that on to the court.  
RYAN ODOM: First and foremost, they're high character kids. Everybody on our
team is like that. They're all great students. They're there for a reason.
UMBC is a tremendous academic institution and you have to be really, really
good in that area to succeed there and they understand the importance of it.
It's not just about basketball, it's about the whole experience while they're
there.  
  
This particular senior crew, they've been there from day one when I first got
there and they've been very, very coachable. The one word I would use you
know, to describe our team is they're very unselfish. I don't know how we'll
play tomorrow but I know that they'll pass the ball to one another, they'll
look out for one another, love each other while they're out there and give
their best. That's what they've done for two years for me.  
  
My comfy blanket will be gone at the end of this year. I'll have to find a new
one.  
  
Q. Ryan, continuing with the throwback Thursday theme, we've been told
today that you were officially a ballboy at UVA.  
RYAN ODOM: I was.  
  
Q. What do you remember from being on the floor and could you have
forecast down the road coaching against this team you saw growing up?  
RYAN ODOM: Definitely couldn't have forecasted coaching against this team
because when I was growing up I didn't want to coach. I actually wanted to --
wanted to get into banking world and that's kind of what was my focus. I love
playing the game and I was fortunate to go on to Hampden Sydney and played for
an amazing Coach with Tony Shavers, got the Carolina ties with Dean Smith. Had
amazing friends there.  
  
It wasn't until I got out of college that it was time get the air was out of
the ball at that point, to try to decide what I wanted to do. That's where
Coach Greenberg came into play and my brother was coaching at the time, dad
was kind of at the height of his tenure at Wake Forest. Seemed like the right
thing to do. I wasn't ready to give it up.  
  
Going back to Charlottesville in the early days, I was on the basket. I was
sitting on the basket when Ralph was shooting his last free throw and the ball
bounced off, I think, and he gets the rebound and puts it back in. That was
the last shot he made, I think in U Hall.  
  
So, that's where I started, I was on the basket and run out on the court when
the team was on the other side and wipe it, wipe up the sweat and get off the
court. Try to stay out there a little bit longer, you know, so everybody could
see the little kid.  
  
And then I graduated to honestly sitting behind the opposing team's bench and
so I would hand the opposing team's players water behind the bench. I saw them
all come through there, I saw Dean come through, and Coach K and Jim Valvano,
Bobby Cremins, Lefty Driesell.  
  
I sat right behind all of them. I would rebound with our players prior to the
game, sometimes go in the other end and passing it back to MJ on occasion when
they were in town. Just -- it's some amazing memories. Just very, very
fortunate.  
  
Q. Your father the other day said that you're much more like your mother
than you are like him. What have you gotten from him?  
RYAN ODOM: Well, probably that long-winded answers right there (laughter).
That's the first thing. We don't speak in very are sucise (sic) statements.  
  
Patience, I would say. My players will probably tell you I have a pretty easy
way, laid back, you know, style when I coach. Hopefully that gives them some
calmness when they're in tough and tight situations.  
  
But, you know, what do I get from my dad? I think it's the passion, you know,
for the game to do things the right way. The game is meant so much to our
family and you know we just want -- each group that comes through, each player
that we're fortunate enough to coach, you know, that's their moment and their
time in college and so our job as coaches is to make it the best that it can
possibly be and that's the way he approached his job each and everyday and
that's the way I try to do it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Five more minutes. Next question.  
  
Q. Your dad also said that in the situation you were in against Vermont
he would have called two timeouts, drawn up the wrong play twice Jairus still
would have made the shot.  
Do you feel it's come full circle because he said when he comes to Baltimore
to visit he comes to your practices now and he watches.  
  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I was crazy watching his game. I'll be dead honest with you.
I used to throw stuff watching his teams play when I was watching it on TV.  
  
When you're out of control, like it's not within your control, so much harder
to watch a loved one do this and I remember last year watching, you know,
Chris Collins and his father and his reactions and that just struck a cord
with me because I used to do it as a kid watching dad and now he's definitely
doing it watching me and mom just has to sit there and, of course, calm him
down or get away from him.  
  
Q. We asked you back up on campus a couple days ago if you were going to
show your players footage of the Chaminade victory? It might come out. I don't
know if you plan to show that as kind of motivation at all?  
RYAN ODOM: It hasn't yet. That was certainly an amazing game for Chaminade. I
was actually a part of that because dad was there so probably steer clear of
that one.  
  
Q. You talked about how amazing that shot was and how historic it was
and sort of has become this team's moment.  
Has there been any difficulty at all with sort of getting the team to
refocus and say, okay, we do have a game tomorrow, we're playing Virginia and
what are you expecting out of the game tomorrow?  
  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean I gave them two days off, know so Sunday was kind of a
celebration day for us and our campus and community. Then I gave them the next
day as well.  
  
We had a meeting, you know, at noon or so, that's about the time we practice.
My whole focus there was just to try to get the focus off of the shot and kind
of what had happened and we've got to prepare for the next opponent.  
  
It's a tremendous opponent, the best in the country, most disciplined team on
both sides of the ball. We're going to have to play lights out basketball just
to be in the game.  
  
Our guys understand that but, at the same time, I want them to be confident
because they haven't won 24 games for a reason. I want them to go in there
freed up and follow exactly what the game plan is and we're trying to win.  
  
Q. Building off of what were you talking about of the day dedicated to
celebrate with the campus and facility, what does it mean to the team, the
campus and community to be the representative from the State of Maryland for
the national tournament?  
RYAN ODOM: It's huge. Certainly we'd love to have more teams in the tournament
from the State of Maryland. We're obviously the last team remaining and we're
excited about that.  
  
But, you know, I think most important for me is seeing these kids smile. The
experience that they're having right now, you know, is unlike any. The
greatest show on earth. They're getting excited about we got Cokes in the
locker room. They got everything. They're not used to that.  
  
They're certainly not used to this and I want them to soak everything in and
enjoy every moment because it literally is, it's hard to win -- if you're a
one bid league it's hard to win that tournament. Everything has got to go
right for you to be able to experience this.  
  
And these kids, you know, worked tirelessly to make this happen. We have a
saying that's up in our locker room, "The work you do in the dark will reveal
itself in the light." They've worked extremely hard the last two years to make
this a reality.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Couple more.  
  
Q. Ryan, you mentioned that your father is a little high-strung watching
games. Can you imagine him in the NIT Selection Committee room when Lyles's
shot goes in and his reaction and he's screaming and high-fiving everyone in
the room?  
RYAN ODOM: Oh, yeah, I can definitely imagine that. He was probably crying. He
probably had plenty of tears there, when you're able to watch your son.  
  
I have a hard time watching my son play. Now, obviously, I know what that
feels like and it's a special feeling to watch your young one do something
like this. I'm sure he's taken a lot of pride, as is mom.  
  
My wife -- I would be remiss if I didn't mention her. She's the rock of
everything in our family. She's amazing. The two boys. Had a great moment with
my son right after the game when we won. Somehow he just found his way to me.
That it was literally the first guy I saw. I had a great hug with Conner.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Take one more. Last question.  
  
Q. So I brought this up to your players but I don't know if you're aware
that there is a Ken Pom statistic that mentions luck for a team, basically.  
RYAN ODOM: We're the luckiest.  
  
Q. Yeah. I was wondering if you kind of share your thoughts on there
being a quantifiable fact that your team is supposedly lucky to be here at
this tournament.  
RYAN ODOM: Yeah. I mean for sure. We follow Ken Pom, obviously, and take pride
in moving Ken Pom's work when he choosing somebody else or the numbers choose
somebody else.  
  
But our guys are excited about the opportunity. Absolutely we feel lucky, for
sure. We're very fortunate to be here and our guys understand that and they're
going to do their best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to start our interviews with the student-athletes
from Creighton. We have from left to right, senior Marcus Foster, junior Khyri
Thomas, senior Toby Hegner, and senior Tyler Clement. We'll have 15 minutes.
Please raise your hand.  
  
Q. Marcus, I know you probably talked a lot about extra motivation
facing Kansas State and as a follow-up, how did your two years in Manhattan
affect the way you are as a player and as a man now?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It really just made me learn. You know, things I went through I
had to grow up and mature, and now I'm in a spot now I'm the man I wanted to
become and just a little learning curve I had to go through. Everybody has to
go through things, but you face adversity and you get over it and move on.  
  
Q. Motivation?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Extra motivation for me is this could be my last game. There's
not any other way I can put it. I have to put everything on the line so I can
be able to play until it's all over.  
  
Q. Marcus, I'm curious if you've had any relationship with Nigel
Johnson. He's also kind of playing here and if you guys have spoken or plan to
speak at all?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Me and Nigel talked the night we found out there's a
possibility we could play each other. He was my roommate for two years at
Kansas State. We've been talking throughout the years. Me and him are
definitely excited to be able to play each other, you know, on different teams
this time.  
  
Q. Obviously you can't reveal specific like tactics or plays and
whatnot. What has Coach exactly helped emphasize in practice like even
anecdotally to prepare you for the upcoming matchup?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Kind of the same things we've been going over and over this
season. We struggle on the defensive end and teams are going to try to punk
us. You watch Kansas State play and that's what they're real good at. They're
good at stopping teams and being tougher than teams. We have to bring a
another other level of toughness. Try to keep them out of the paint a little
bit. They are good shooters, so we have to be able the contain the 3 point
line and also keep them out of the paint.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Khyri?  
  
KHYRI THOMAS: Marcus kind of just really put everything out there on the line.
Just really focus on the level of toughness to match theirs or be a little
better than theirs. That's one thing. And really just getting those guys a
little frustrated with whether we trap or what our game plan is. Just really
to kind of get in their heads a little bit, because I know they're going to do
the same to us. But at the same time, you know, maintain our focus but to get
them riled up and cause them turnovers which will eventually lead us to our
game, which is a fast pace and knocking down 3s.  
  
Q. What was your reaction when you found out you were going to play K
State? Was it kind of a roll of the eyes or anybody but them? What was your
reaction when that happened?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It was kind of different, you know. I mean, I was just happy
for our name to be called, but, you know, I wasn't expecting to play them. I
knew coming in there's going to be a lot of media attention towards it. That's
the one thing I wanted to stay away from just because I'm so locked into this
last game that I have to play and I want to be at my best and I don't want to
have to worry about other things rather than just going out there and giving
it my all.  
  
Q. I guess this is for any of you guys. When you found out you were
coming to Charlotte, what was the reaction from Davion and Ty-Shon? What did
they tell you about Charlotte?  
TOBY HEGNER: They were really excited. We were just as excited for them, as
you know, going back to we're in the tournament and we were all excited at the
moment, but it meant a little bit more to them to come home and play in front
of some of their friends and family. They were pretty excited. Pretty good
feeling to witness that.  
  
Q. Any of the players. Every team's goal at the beginning of the year is
to make it to the big dance. What's your feelings now that you're in the big
dance with a chance to play in a national championship?  
TYLER CLEMENT: Yeah, that was one of our main goals coming into the season was
getting back to the tournament. We talked about how we've gotten to the
tournament five of seven years but not necessarily happy just to be here
anymore, we want to make some noise and win a couple games for sure. I guess
our whole sentiment, we're happy we're here, we're not satisfied with that. We
want to keep rolling and keep extending our season. We're trying to make some
noise.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Toby.  
  
TOBY HEGNER: The big thing for this team and especially for us, no Creighton
team ever made it past the first and second round. Our goal going into the
season was to make a run, like Tyler said earlier. And that's something that
we can do, but we got the take it one game at a time, and right now our focus
is on K State and what we have to do to win that game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Khyri, your turn.  
  
KHYRI THOMAS: Toby just hit it right on the nail. Not just to be here and get
past that first and second round, you know, we did it last year, kind of
looked past the Rhode Island game. Unfortunately we lost the first round. To
get past the first and second round will mean a lot to us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Marcus.  
  
MARCUS FOSTER: All year we talked about how we can exceed our expectations and
at the beginning of the season, we weren't the team we were supposed to be and
lot of people doubted us, and over the season we got better and better. The
more we started talking about the tournament, we were like we're not going to
be happy to be in there. We're going to try to make some noise, like Tyler
said, and want to leave our mark on our school by making history by making it
to the Sweet 16. We have to take it one game at a time, unlike we did last
year.  
  
Q. Toby, in watching film of Dean Wade, what exactly do you see from
him? Give me your breakdown of Dean.  
TOBY HEGNER: Dean is a great player. You ask anybody in the Big 12, they'll
tell you he can do it on both ends of the floor. One of our focuses is post up
game and transition is very, very good. And we're going to have to do whatever
it takes to keep the ball out of his hands and make someone else put it on the
floor and score.  
  
So, we've got a lot of things on our mind to take Dean Wade out of the game,
but it -- it's a team effort no matter the situation and that's what we
prepared.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question? Anyone else before we let them go?  
  
Q. What's been the top song in the tournament play list rotation that's
been going on in the locker room, just for anybody?  
TYLER CLEMENT: Martin has been playing "The Middle." I don't know who sings
that. We're getting kind of sick of it because he keeps singing it. We don't
have a song that's kind of fueling us. We're tired of "The Middle." "God's
Plan," maybe.  
  
TOBY HEGNER: There's a lot of different songs going through our locker room
right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thanks, guys.  
  
We're ready to start with Coach McDermott from Creighton.  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Well, we're thrilled to be back in the NCAA Tournament. You
know, this is the second year in a row that we've had a pretty serious injury
to one of our key guys that has ended his season and had to figure out a way
to rally around that. And I'm really proud of the way this team has functioned
since we lost Martin Krampelj. Guys had to play different roles. We had to
have some guys step up, even a red shirt that wasn't playing that had the red
shirted pulled in Jacob Epperson. We had to kind of reinvent ourselves after
that injury and it took a little time. We certainly have moved the right
direction and extremely proud of those four guys you just talked to because
their leadership has been critical in us sitting here today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Marcus answered the question the way you would hope he would. It's
just another game, NCAA Tournament, all the pressure on survive and advance.
Do you sense there's any extra with him because he played at K State?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: You know, it wasn't probably his top choice of who he would
like to play when the pairings came out. But he and I had -- because we're
playing K State, it gave us an opportunity this week to have a lot of
conversation about it. And I don't know how Marcus answered your questions,
but in my conversations with him, you know, we all make mistakes when we're
18, 19 years old and he's taken ownership of those mistakes. And to his
credit, he's made the changes in his life to be the person that he is today
and be the leader and the teammate that he is today, and that may or may not
have happened had he not made those mistakes when he was 18 and 19.  
  
So, while I'm very proud of what the stat sheet says about Marcus Foster this
year, that doesn't hold a candle to how proud I am of who he's become off the
court, the friend, the teammate, the father that he is today is a very
different person than the one that first met with me when he left Kansas
State.  
  
That's why I do this, that's why Bruce does it, and to see guys grow and
hopefully move on to bigger and better things in their life, and the
combination of the two experiences have led him down this path and in the
landing spot that he is today. I'm extremely proud of him.  
  
Q. Greg, what adjustments, if any, have you made in preparation leading
up to this week, things maybe you've gathered from your last couple of
experiences here?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: You know, we've had a little more time. Last year we played in
the finals of the Big East tournament on Saturday and get turned around on
Tuesday and jumped on a plane for the West Coast. We've had a little more time
to really get our legs under us. I think from that standpoint I think we're a
fresher team than we were a year ago.  
  
But we've had enough guys that have been here and they've done a really good
job throughout the season in helping our freshmen move along when we really
needed them. And they've done that this week in helping prepare them for
what's ahead this week. And it's the biggest stage in college basketball, but
at the end of the day you go out and do what you do.  
  
There's not a lot of surprises and secrets that you're going to pull out in
the middle of March. You try to execute your stuff as well as you can and try
to disrupt what the other team is going to do.  
  
So I think we're in a good place and I think the guys are really anxious to
get out on the floor tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, when I say "Dean Wade," what do you think?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I like the vision of him with the boot on instead of the boot
off (laughter). No, honestly I hope he's healthy and he's able to play, but I
had a chance to watch Dean in high school and we recruited him a little bit
but probably were too late. He committed to K State shortly there after. But
his development since I saw him in high school is really incredible. I've seen
him play a little over the course ever his career. I haven't studied him like
I have this week. He shoots a 3 point shot extremely well. He can beat you on
the block. He's got great pace to his game when he catches it on the block but
also catch it off the block and face you or back you down.  
  
Having said all that, what makes him dangerous is his ability to pass the ball
if you attempt to come with some help. He can make some of those other guys
very, very efficient, very, very effective with his ability to pass the
basketball. I've been incredibly impressed with him. I think he's a really
good player. I think he's got a bright future ahead after college.  
  
Q. I guess just going back to the freshman a little bit, they've had two
kind of big stages away from home that they've had to play well against,
obviously the Villanova one at home. What about those three players gives you
the confidence that extend their minutes, extend the rotations in big
situations when you need important play from your team?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Number one, they've earned it with their play in the practice
floor. Even when they -- when Mitch and Ty-Shon weren't shooting it great in
games, they continued to shoot it in practice and continued to spend the time
off the practice floor preparing themselves. I had lunch with those three the
other day, and one of the things I talked about and actually thanked them for
is they've all had to play a role different than probably what they
anticipated. You know, Ty-Shon really got thrust into the point guard role
because of Caleb's injuries and he did a good job so we left him there. That's
not his true position. Ronnie recently goes down late in the year when we're
playing the three most important games of the year to try to get into this
tournament and we slide Mitch Ballock full-time to the power forward position,
a position he never really played except for a few minutes with us early in
the season. And Jacob Epperson was going to red shirt. He's sitting there in
the middle of January just icing his knee, taking his time before gets back to
the practice floor after the meniscus surgery, and all of a sudden on January
27th he gets thrown to the wolves because of Martin's injury. They've all --
it wasn't a typical freshman year because we really asked them to get out of
their comfort zone and do different things. And if one of them fights us on
there or one of them can't embrace the role we've asked them to play, we're
not here today. You know, what made me really think about it, I rewatch the
Providence game and looked at the start of overtime. We've got Khyri and
Marcus and three freshmen on the floor to start that overtime. So I think that
speaks volumes to the progress that they've made.  
  
Q. As a coach, what does it mean to you having your team back in the
NCAA Tournament?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: You know, it never gets old. I've been fortunate to do it
quite a few times now, and it's the same level of excitement when your name is
called as it was the first time. You're just as happy for your guys because
it's so hard to get into this tournament. I've watched a few NIT games the
last few days as you're trying to kill some time and get to the game and those
are really good teams playing. And, you know, you can't ever take for granted
the fact that you're here because things have to go right. You need the bounce
of the ball some and you've got to have a pretty good basketball team. And for
that reason, I'm really proud of our team to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question?  
  
Q. Coach, as the mentor of Marcus Foster, when you saw this pairing, did
you think it was an unfortunate set of circumstances that he has to talk about
all this in the final weeks of his college career?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I would say it would have been unfortunate if he's not
prepared to talk about it. But I think it's important that K State fans
understand that the person that Marcus Foster was as a freshman, guy that's
hungry to play and great teammate and always in the gym, he's back now and
there was a lot of bumps in the road, some in Manhattan and it wasn't always
rosy in Omaha for that first year, especially. But because of the fact that
he's matured enough that I think he can address it as someone that recognizes
that you know a lot of what happened was my fault and decisions I made put me
in this position, and decisions that I've made since then have put me in the
position I'm in today.  
  
So, you know, because he's grown so much, I think it's healthy for him to have
to be able to answer it, because he let down some people and let down his
family and that was one of his motivating factors to get his life back on
track. He's got a wonderful family and he really disappointed them and now
they're pretty happy, as you can imagine.  
  
Q. You remember a time that you realized, okay we're going to get
through this, like you said, the first year Creighton was a little bit of a
challenge. Do you remember a breakthrough, Marcus is going to be fine?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I don't know if there was ever one particular time. I was
seeing -- I was seeing constant growth. Sometimes it was very slow, sometimes
it was a little bit more rapid, but just some of the decisions he would make
and some of his interaction was his teammates. I recruited him out of high
school. I've known him since he was 15 or 16 years old and knew his family I
knew what he was like back then. I knew the Marcus Foster y'all saw as a
freshman at Kansas State. I really felt he was still in there, we had to bring
him back out. And with the help of his family, we were able to do that.  
  
His decisions got better and his -- I think once he recognized, you know what,
I'm in this position and I'm sitting out this year at Creighton because of
decisions I made at Kansas State. Once he grasped that, I think he was able to
move forward quicker.  
  
Q. The first time you spoke to Bruce, I imagine you spoke to Bruce when
were you talking about taking on Marcus, do you remember what that
conversation was about, what Bruce said about Marcus and where they were at?  
GREG MCDERMOTT: I remember exactly the conversation, but I'm not going to
discuss in it this room. Bruce was very honest and up-front and open like I
would be if the shoe was on the other foot. And he called me. He let me know
exactly what I was dealing with, and I appreciated that and we moved on after
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
  
GREG MCDERMOTT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Bill Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20715)

### [Admon Gilder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30841)

### [Tyler Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30813)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has our first question?  
  
Q. This question is for Admon. You've done a great job all year of
guarding the opponent's best scorer. What do you know about Diallo, who has
been Providence's leading scorer, and how are you going to defend him?  
ADMON GILDER: We watched a whole lot of film on him. He's a big guard, about
6' 7". I know they punch it in to him a lot. Just know, stick to our bigs, we
front the post from the guard's standpoint, and we have a great bigs who will
be able to help us on the help side and come over and even block a shot for
them. I think it's a good match for me, not just me but the whole entire team.
Looking forward to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: What was the next question?  
  
Q. Tyler, you have a size advantage in the post. You've had a size
advantage for a lot of years. What is it going to take to get you involved,
one, and also to take advantage of that size on offense and defense?  
TYLER DAVIS: I just need to do my job like I have been all year. Coach Kennedy
is going to get the ball into me. I got to make the right play, make the
basketball play. Use my size to the my advantage. Seal inside, be a force in
the paint, do my job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the next question?  
  
Q. I'm curious, have you guys watched Providence on TV at all, all
season long?  
TYLER DAVIS: Not on TV. This past week. We feel like we know them well.  
  
Q. Follow-up. Your size has been a big advantage all season long. Looks
like it could be in this game as well. I imagine could you just talk about how
difficult your practices are practicing against each other?  
TYLER DAVIS: It's fun. Playing against Rob, Tonny, Isiah, and we have a guy
that's not playing, next year he'll be good. You got to get ready to go every
single day, go to war. It gets you better and I love the competition.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Guys, thank you.  
  
Questions for Coach Kennedy, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of the way that Providence is, they have a lot of
players who can be installed at different positions on the floor with the
exception of the point guard who is always the point guard.  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: Right.  
  
Q. Is there some aspect of preparing for a team that has that level of
versatility, that is different or more difficult than someone who plays a lot
of people at traditional positions?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: It's definitely different. You know, playing a Carolina
East Coast style of basketball, we're taking advantage of people one-on-one.
Got to be able to make physical plays on the defensive end. Hopefully we won't
get our guards in foul trouble. Their size on the perimeter is an advantage
with their team, and I think our size with our post guys is an advantage with
us, but it's definitely different style of play. We've practiced against a lot
of different teams this year, played Penn State probably closest to a similar
as Providence when we played Penn State earlier in the year.  
  
Q. Billy, your thoughts on the matchup on Kyron with TJ, guy has been a
senior that's been in this tournament a lot, against a guy that's only started
about half the year, and do you think that the last two games going up against
Sexton prepared him for the moment?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: I don't think he could have gotten better training by
guarding Collin Sexton the last couple of games and going what we went through
with that. There's a lot of drama involved in that matchup, so I don't think
he could get any bigger than that from that standpoint. The difference is
Cartwright has got a lot of leadership qualities with this team and has been
in this tournament before. It will be interesting to see how that matchup
plays out. But I like TJ. He's very confident. He'll come in here if we can
keep him within confines of the offense and taking care of the ball, something
we've been emphasizing all year. I think he'll play well. I expect him to play
well.  
  
Q. Coach, you have brought three, four guys from the 2016 team that went
to the Sweet 16. How do you think their experience has helped the younger guys
in preparation for this week?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: They know what they're playing for, the sense of urgency,
they've been through it before. All the media and the different things that
come with the NCAA Tournament, they've experienced. I think you'll see them
comfortable in this situation. It will be Tyler Davis and Admon Gilder for us
who provide the type of leadership. Tonny Trocha played big in the NCAA
Tournament. DJ Hogg. We have some guys that have experience. It's the biggest
thing is them understanding that you can't change anything for this
tournament. You got to be who you are, stay together and do the things that
got you here, and that's something I hope those guys are able to relay to the
rest of our guys.  
  
Q. What do you need out of Robert tomorrow to sort of swing the matchup
your way? What are you expecting from him and what is it about him that makes
him such a special player?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: His ability defensively to block shots is something that
can cause some problems for anybody, especially 15 feet into the basket. They
run a flex offense, very good around the basket his ability to block shots, if
we can get him to block shots, i Think that's something that's changed the
game for us. We're getting easy transition baskets when he blocks shots. On
the offensive end we need him to be more aggressive. We will go to him a
little bit more. The last couple of games we tried to go to him more. We want
him to be more of a scoring threat because he has some abilities we don't
always get out of him. We want him to be more of a scoring threat around the
basket.  
  
Q. Billy, why do you think Admon has been so successful defensively
against some of the guys y'all put him on that are high scorers, he's been
able to contain them. How do you think he's going to match up in that role
against Diallo?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: He takes it as a challenge when he knows he's guarding one
of the guys best players. He understands how important defense is. He's been
that way from his freshman year. We've made him a defensive stopper. He buys
into that role. He's guarded a lot of different guys. He may guard Diallo, so
it will be a little bit different guard, defensive responsibility for him
because both of these guys are 6' 7" and power guys who like to post up. Most
of the guards he's guarded are perimeter guys. Be interesting to see but I
know he'll fight. That's the one thing, he buys into that role and that's been
big for us.  
  
Q. In terms of the way that Providence's style plays, on defense they
get a lot of deflections because of their length. You guys have had issues at
times with possessions and turnovers. Do you envision that as being a
potentially volatile mix?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: That's something we're concerned about, definitely. When
we have taken care of the ball, we've been very hard to beat because of the
second chance points we get on the glass and our ability around the basket.
But they do, they get a lot of deflections. They bump you, they're physical
defensively. You got to be able to play through that to be ball tough.
Something we've talked about all week is taking care of the ball and being
strong with the ball and being able to handle contact, play through contact is
something that they're good at. And we've got -- that is something we've got
-- that's a big key to the game is our ability to handle the ball and get
shots at the basket when we can go chase the misses when we did miss it and
not turn the ball over and lead to transition baskets for them.  
  
Q. On the other side of that same coin, Providence comes from a
conference where they are known for the physical nature of the play. But you
have a lot of strong, big guys on your front line that you were talking about.
Do you think in some ways your club is well-suited to take on a team that
plays that style?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: I think it's -- that's what makes it a great matchup., is
that we're both physically dominant at times, and when we are physically
dominant we're tough to beat. We hope our size and length is something they
haven't seen a whole lot of. That usually gives people problems because we go
6'10", 6'10", 6'9" at the front line and at times play some zone, and that
will be able to bother them some hopefully, also.  
  
Q. Your size that you just spoke of, it seems to be the basketball is
going away from that or the big guys certainly have to have an awful lot of
versatility. Tyler, for example, is more of a traditional low post guy. Why do
you favor this current collection of guys, or is it just you've been fortunate
in recruiting?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: We've been fortunate in recruiting. It is different. We
can basically play two 5 men at times with him and Robert. It is different,
and at times we've had problems going out guarding a perimeter 4. We've been
able to play small, Tonny Trocha is really a 4, 3 and DJ Hogg can play the 4,
also. We've been able to go small, but we like the fact that people sometimes
have to matchup with our size and that's been a plus for us most nights.  
  
Q. Coach Cooley talked about "boxing out" was their key word. He's even
put signs up on their lockers and all that stuff. What's the one thing that
you've emphasized this whole week towards your players?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: We've emphasized the same thing. You know, I probably need
to take that and steal that and use that tomorrow, put a sign on everybody's
hotel room tomorrow morning when they wake up and they know to block out.
Because that's something we're concerned about, too, is blocking out. I talked
about earlier the other thing is taking care of the ball and our guard play
being efficient offensively, shooting the ball when we're open, making the
right plays and being ball tough and taking care of the ball. That and being
physical are the two things we've emphasized all week.  
  
Q. Also mentioned he respects you, a man of faith. He said tomorrow he's
going to pray a little bit harder than you. Is that possible?  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: Whoever is going to pray the hardest, I don't think it's
going to matter either way. But I know we both -- that's important part of my
life, my faith is important. I wouldn't be here today without God's help. Our
team wouldn't be here. We've had some ups and downs, but we've been blessed to
get through it. We've known each other awhile. Ed is a good man and a heck of
a coach. I look forward to the challenge. If it's just about praying, I think
we're both in good shape.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
COACH BILL KENNEDY: All right. Thanks.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Kyron, and Jalen, you both part of a group that has made four
straight tournaments in your times here, and you guys have had significant
time during that period. What does that mean to you being a member of the
Providence Friers?  
JALEN LINDSEY: I think it's a testament to the program, coaching, staff and
the players that have come through here. We've put in a lot of work in the
past four years to get this, and we couldn't have done it without our
teammates that have been along side with us this entire time and the players
that were here. So, you know, me and Kyron, we're still grateful to be here
again and we hope to make a run in this tournament.  
  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Just been fun. You know, a long time coming. It's what you
dream about, just been fortunate to be here for four years and, you know,
starts every summer, you know. It's what we've been working hard for and our
teammates have been working hard as well, and it was just fun this year to
make history.  
  
Q. Questions for Nate. Has it sunk in as a freshman you're about to play
in the NCAA Tournament and what is that feeling like?  
NATE WATSON: It's a great feeling. A lot of good teams out there and just
feels great.  
  
Q. Rodney, I'm curious how often do you think about the lay-up against
Southern Cal a couple years ago. How much will the experience of playing in
these games help tomorrow?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: Thinking about the lay-up, I mean, it feels like it happened
like yesterday and it was a great moment, and just to have the experience to
come and play here another year is just going to help me and our team, and
hopefully it shows throughout the time that we're here.  
  
Q. This question be directed towards Alpha. What kind of changes have
you seen around your team last week before the Big East tournament before you
guys went on the run versus this week? Have you seen anything noticeable from
your team mates?  
ALPHA DIALLO: Yeah, definitely. Lot more confident, playing two number one
seeds back to back and taking them into overtime was definitely a confidence
boost for the guys and us. We're happy to be here, and we feel like we can put
our foot down and make an imprint in this tournament.  
  
Q. Kyron. The other day you said it's a completely different atmosphere
between the NCAAs and the Big East tournament. Can you specifically define
what the difference is in the atmospheres between those two and how you expect
to raise your game to that level?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I would guess, you know, it's always a familiar location
when it comes to the Big East tournament. Playing there every year, you know
where it's going to be. You pretty much know who your matchup is going to be
before you start based off seedings, standings in conference. And playing in
the NCAA Tournament, lot of times it's a lot of fresh faces, teams you haven't
played before. Gives you a fresh perspective. The team doesn't know you as
well, you don't know them as well. It's more fun to play against those types
of teams you don't get a chance to normally due to scheduling and stuff like
that. Just the overall excitement, the atmosphere, and as you guys know, you
watch basketball every year, lot of crazy stuffs happens in March out there.  
  
Q. This is for Rodney and Nate. What do y'all know about Admon, Tyler
Davis and Robert Williams?  
RODNEY BULLOCK: We know they're a great rebounding team and have to keep them
off the boards. We got to plan and just hopefully box them out and try to
limit as much offensive rebounds as they can get, and they'll have to guard us
on the other side of the floor. We both got to think we got to take care of --  
  
NATE WATSON: They're definitely a big team, get a lot of points off the second
shots. Got to come under a box out, be big in there and try to stop them.  
  
Q. This question can be for Kyron. Just kind of talk about the momentum
you guys built in the Big East tournament and how you plan to carry that into
your game tomorrow.  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: I felt our momentum in the Big East tournament, we were
playing just as well as anybody in the country. Even with shots not falling we
were still right there in every game and, you know, it gave us a lot of
confidence knowing that we can play with those top teams if those two teams
were number 1 seeds but, at the same time, you know, that stuff that we did in
the Big East tournament doesn't matter anymore. Every game is you win or you
pack your stuff up and go home. We got to lock in this game, try to take care
of business and at the same time try to enjoy the moment and have fun.  
  
Q. Questions for Jalen. Jalen, what have you and the seniors kind of
told the young guys like Nate or some of the other freshmen about playing in
the NCAA Tournament since it's an experience they've never had before?  
JALEN LINDSEY: Yeah. We just tell them to have fun with it, you know, it's
definitely something that is exciting. You know, you can get a bunch of
jitters and be nervous. You got to enjoy the experience. When you get out
there, don't let the crowd get to you and stuff like that. Just keep enjoying
it and just play your game, just stay focused and listen to what the Coach has
got to stay, trust what they're saying and trust the older guys in what we're
telling them and learn and just get better from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Kyron, can you talk about your matchup with TJ Starks, a freshman,
and Admon, what you plan to do there, how to attack him, how you'll attack him
or what your experience will help you against a freshman?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: You know, I'm going to go out there, step on the court and
be holding the ball, look straight to the bench. Coach Cooley is going to call
a play, and I'm going to look at my teammates and yell out and run the play,
try to play as hard as I can on defense, try to get a lot of stops and just
try to bring some energy to my guys.  
  
Q. Rodney, how is this team this year's Friars team different or maybe
some comparisons that you've seen to some of the other teams you've come to
March Madness with, you've been here four, five times.  
RODNEY BULLOCK: Well, Friers, I mean, this year I feel like we have more depth
and we have this year little bit more than the past couple years. We got a
little bit more chemistry and I feel like it showed in the Big East tournament
when everybody was healthy and nobody was ill, and I mean it shows we can play
with anybody.  
  
Q. Rodney and Kyron, you were talking about the differences between
playing in the Big East conference tournament and playing here in the NCAA. In
the Big East tournament you got a body of knowledge, you really know the
opponents that you're playing against because you've already faced them a
couple of times.  
In a situation where you're playing against a team that doesn't know you and
that you don't really know, in your mind do you think you guys have an
advantage?  
  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Advantage, I mean not really.  
  
Q. Are you harder to prepare for?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: Are we harder to prepare for?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: It's up for the coaches who prepare to decide that. We play
a lot of positionless basketball. A number for our team is just a spot on the
floor. We got guys that can play. Besides me I'm the only person with a set
position, you know. We got Alpha up here who can play any big from the 2 to
the 4 and Jalen from the 2 to the 5 at times if we need him to. And the same
with Rodney. I just think we're a very versatile team.  
  
RODNEY BULLOCK: We got a lot of positionless players. It's hard to film us.
We've got so many plays. Going to take a long time to scout us. We do have a
huge advantage in that standpoint.  
  
Q. Kyron, what is the scouting report on Texas A &M?  
KYRON CARTWRIGHT: What's the scouting report on Texas A&M? You know, they got
bigs, two bigs, two traditional bigs, and when we woke up this morning
everybody saw what the scouting report was in their room, big yellow paper
right in front of the TV that says "box out." That's the scouting report, box
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thanks guys.  
  
COACH ED COOLEY: I can't tell you how happy Providence College is to be here,
exciting time for us and our program, exciting time to be one of the
representatives of the Big East. Really proud of our staff, our players to get
to this moment here and eagerly waiting to play against a very talented Texas
A&M team. But to be on this stage and to be sitting on this podium here, it's
a dream for all of us and hopefully we can make this a magical year for
Providence College and the Big East.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you speak so highly of Coach Gavitt, so when you found out
that you had matched his record for most NCAA appearances by a Providence head
coach what did that mean to you in?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think it's a good question. I don't think about it as much,
but at the same time, it's an honor. It says the stability of our program,
talks about the leadership from our athletic director and our president and
our staff and the job that they've done and we've done collectively. It's an
honor but it's just a number. Doesn't mean much as far as the number. I'm just
-- hopefully there's many more to come.  
  
Q. Coach, Rodney has started 100 or 101 consecutive games for you guys.
How has he grown and matured over these years both on and off the floor?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I'm really proud of Rodney Bullock. He's a graduate first and
foremost, I'm really proud of that. Feels like Rodney has been here since I've
been here. He's gone through a lot of practices, he's gone through a very
turbulent time early in his career. The fact that he can respond from that,
become a graduate and lead us to a record, for his class, the only recruiting
class in the history of the school to come to four consecutive tournaments is
a testament to his mental toughness and fortitude. I couldn't be more proud of
Rodney representing Providence College.  
  
Q. Ed, looking for something on Alpha's growth in the two years he's
been here. If you think back when you were recruiting him, I know you liked
his flexibility and that's really played out especially here in the latter
half of the sophomore zone.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Coach Thomas and myself, Coach Battle, when we went up to
watch Alpha play at Brewster Academy, what stood out to us was versatility.
Alpha can play five positions and really embraced that role. You can post him,
you can put him in a ball screen, you can use him as a secondary ball handler.
I think his versatility has allowed his growth. But his biggest growth is him
trusting what we're teaching and what we're doing and that's been a great
thing to see, his maturity. His versatility, being that Swiss Army knife has
been something that's really helped our program. Alpha is a physical young
man. He's embraced that role as trying to get the ball in the post as well.
It's good for him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please wait for the mikes, please.  
  
Q. Kyron told us that a big part of the scouting report was a big yellow
piece of paper that said "box out." Could you speak to that in terms of the
importance of that for y'all tomorrow?  
COACH ED COOLEY: It's no secret, you know, Texas A&M is a very physical team,
they're a powerful team, they have NBA size in a lot of different positions.
And we feel if you allow them second, third and fourth opportunities, they're
going to have a chance to really beat you. So high alert on checking out -- it
was definitely talked about in everything that we do. You may have a block out
sign on your back right now and don't even know it (laughter).  
  
Q. What do you feel y'all match well against A &M?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Can you ask the question again.  
  
Q. Where do you match up well against A &M?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Where do we match up well? We're still in our preparation. I
don't know where we match up. I just know we're matched up to play each other.
They have a lot of size where we're concerned with that. The point guard play
has been very, very good as of late. I don't know where we match up with them.
All I know is the ball is going up tomorrow at noon and we got to hoop. I
don't know. That may be a question for them, not for me.  
  
Q. Ed, with the grind of the Big East tournament having to play three
overtime teams, two against number one seeds in this tournament, how do you
refuel the gas tank in time to get yourselves as prepared as possible for this
tournament as well?  
COACH ED COOLEY: We're ready to play Sunday. We're ready to play the next day,
you know. We have young kids who are passionate, they're hungry, the 18 to 22
years old. We have no time to be tired. This stage not about being tired. It's
about opportunity to advance. Having a senior like Kyron, Jalen and Rodney,
they've been in this situation before and all we're trying to do is get to the
next game. We have to be disciplined in our approach to the first one, but how
we advance, right now we're not talking about fatigue, we're talking about
opportunity.  
  
Q. For us not seen y'all play --  
COACH ED COOLEY: You don't know anything about us. I like that, though.  
  
Q. What did y'all do last week in the tournament so well as opposed to
earlier in the zone when you are struggling a little bit? What have y'all done
better?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think it's a great question. We trust each other a little
bit more. As I always tell the players, it's a long season that goes fast and
a lot of ups and downs. It's not how we start, it's how we finish. You got to
see what guys can do, what roles -- what role fits the player to help the team
win, and then you got to get a little bit lucky. I think all those came at the
right time. Anytime you have a chance to play in the Big East tournament and
the energy that's in New York City and the energy that's in Madison Square
Garden, it somehow brings the best out of all teams. That's why to me it's the
best conference tournament in America. I think that sets all our teams up for
success in this tournament that we're fortunate to move on. We just came
together at the right time.  
  
Q. Ed, you mentioned that this team has gone through a lot of ups and
downs this year and you're playing your best ball late in the season. What was
the turning point for this group?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I would say the turning point was us having more fun. We as a
coaching staff not being as angry with the little things, smiling a little bit
more. At the end of the day, it is a game. But really trying to have some fun
with the guys being in their world, not us being 45 to 50 years old, but
trying to be 18 to 22 year olds with them as far as enjoying what we're doing.
Sometimes in coaching you don't enjoy what you do because you're worried about
the unknown. My job is to try to stay in the present and enjoy the moment and
let the players see that. Once the players saw that, I think we played at a
different level.  
  
Q. When was that?  
COACH ED COOLEY: You asked when was that in the season? I would say JB a
couple of weeks ago, three weeks ago, we kind of turned that page a little
bit. And Coach Battle would always tell me, you got to enjoy the moment. And
it's hard to when you're a Nervous Nelly like I am. I appreciated our staff
for saying that and trying to enjoy the process.  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen maybe that's a little bit different about
your team on Monday of last week before the Big East tournament and then fast-
forward to this week when you're getting ready for the NCAA Tournament after
the success that you had in New York this past week?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think the players are feeling a little bit more confident.
We played some tough games, as you all of us do in the country. I think having
some success has given our guys some confidence they can play with anybody in
the country, and that's what that tournament can do for you. I just feel our
guys are a lot more confident, little bit more energetic. This time of the
year when you're able to get to this tournament, it gives you a different
energy, focus. And obviously our job as a staff is to try to get our group to
believe that they are better than they are to advance.  
  
Q. Ed, I guess how have you personally grown or changed as the head
coach and the leader of this program since this NCAA Tournament run first
started?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I feel I've grown a lot. I think it's been something to me,
it's still a dream for me, you know. I can't believe I'm on this stage talking
to you, to be honest with you. I feel very blessed and very fortunate. But
having been to this tournament and what you have to do to try to advance, how
lucky you have to be. I think I've grown as a game coach as far as preparation
with our staff. I think our staff does an amazing job. I think our staff are
all head coaches, and I think they've helped me grow in the process of not
being too nervous all the time but try to smell the roses sometimes, and it's
hard for us to do that. But I feel I've grown a lot in a lot of different
ways, and I give all the credit to our staff to help me.  
  
Q. Ed, is there another team that compares to A &M that you faced this
year?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Georgetown has a really big front line and versatility with
their small forward. They would probably be close. We played Minnesota early,
I think game 2. They would simulate the size the strength and the brawn of a
front line of Texas A&M. Those two teams come to mind right away with their
length in front of the rim and their athleticism and their guard play. Those
two teams would be very similar.  
  
Q. Coach, preparing for a big game like this what tools do you use other
than watching video of the other team?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Pray. Pray, man. I believe. It's not where can you get a
basket when you need it when you're scouting. A lot of these tournament games
come down to last second plays, special situations, are you prepared for that,
is your team prepared for that? Those are the things we're trying to prepare
for, because it does come down to little things in these tournament games.  
  
Q. Coach, are Nate, Kalif, and Rodney ready to match up with the size A
&M has?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Are they ready? If they're not, there's a problem. My babies
are ready for sure. Those kids are ready to play, you know. If they're not,
there's a problem. They're more than ready to play. We're excited. Our kids
are so energetic right now, I can't wait to get out on the floor and practice
with them today. Our kids are living the dream. We don't want that dream to
come to an end anytime soon.  
  
Q. With Kyron's experience, how much do you feel he can take advantage
of that, being a veteran going against a true freshman point guard in TJ
Starks at Texas A &M?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think once you get to this time of the year, these kids
aren't freshman anymore. He's played 30-some-odd games. He's been coached by
one of the best coaches in the country. He's in the a freshman. Hopefully some
of Kyron's game experience can help us down the stretch. This is all about how
you get to the end, not so much how you start, how you get to the end. And
Kyron has had some big, big games late in games. He's made big shots, big free
throws. I'm just hoping his experience can help us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Ed, a lot of your players were sort of talking about the team's
versatility when they were up there, guys who can play a 2, 3, 4 and maybe
even the numbers don't mean that much in your scheme.  
Do you think that because of the versatility, you are a harder team for an
opponent to scout and prepare for because guys do so many different things?  
  
COACH ED COOLEY: We love versatility. And when we go out to recruit, we look
for multi-positional players other than if you have a 7-footer or a Mighty
Mike with the ball. At the same time, the way the game has changed, you know,
we've kind of evolved with the changing of the game and just get multiple
players that can make plays, pass, catch, shoot, defend. It's not about our
size. It's versatility puts a lot of coaches in a stuff spots. That's why you
have these preseason games. You look to guard that, look to schedule games,
schedule early games to see where are you in your season and then post-season.
Our versatility has been our greatest asset. And one of the greatest strengths
of this program is guys that can play multiple positions. So we go out and
recruit guys, you're not going to play just one position, you're going to play
multiple positions for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. I was going to say there's going to be an awful lot of praying
between you and Billy Kennedy. You mentioned him being a top coach. How well
do you know him and what is y'all's relationship?  
COACH ED COOLEY: We don't have a relationship where we call each other every
day to see what foods we're eating. I've seen him in our business for a long
time. Always praying for his health. Watch his teams played. They do a really
good job, they're organized. I just respect the job that he's done. Really
great league that he plays in. I hope my prayers are a little bit stronger
than his tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Isaiah Wilkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30894)

### [Devon Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30893)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Virginia seniors, Isaiah Wilkins and Devon Hall.  
  
Q. You're the number one team in the country, the number one seed in the
tournament. Does that put additional pressure on you or do you look at it more
as respect?  
DEVON HALL: I mean, I think all the unnecessary pressure you guys make those.
We just try to get better every single day. Coach preaches that. Not really
worried about the pressures or the target on our back. We know every team is
going to come after us. We have to be ready.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I think he covered most of it. I just think that at this point
in the year none of that even matters anymore. If you're here, you won. It's
time to show up and play.  
  
Q. Do you guys -- kind of going off what the question just asked about
the number 1, would you guys say there's any added pressure or are you just
kind of used to maybe being so highly ranked since you guys have been up there
in the rankings throughout the season?  
DEVON HALL: I think that was kind of similar to what he was asking, and I
don't think there's too much added pressure. I think what really matters is
what we've got going on inside the locker room and practice. To add more
pressure to ourselves, I think -- I don't think it's anything that's going out
inside our locker room. We want to get better as a group.  
  
Q. Obviously it's been beaten to death you -- your team was picked to
finish 6th in the ACC and clearly that didn't happen. So at what point do you
think this season was the switch flipped that y'all realized that your team
could really not just build something special for a tournament run but build
somebody special to be the best team in the country?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I never thought or I didn't think that was our mindset at all,
like we never looked at it like yeah, let's try to finish 6th. We're a
confident group and we believe in each other. I mean all that. Like we said
earlier, that stuff doesn't matter now and didn't matter before the season to
us. It is what it is that the point.  
  
DEVON HALL: I agree with him. I don't think our confidence wavered at any
point this season. We knew maybe some bumps and bruises, but we learned as a
group every single day. I think that we just had the most confidence in
ourselves.  
  
Q. Isaiah, talk about how big a surprise was it when you found out
De'Andre was out and how much of a blow has it been?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: We knew that he was playing hurt, guys knew that he was
struggling a little bit even before that game. So it was a game-time decision
for him. And he decided to play and it was huge, but it hurts and we're sad
for him. I like for him to be able to play. But, at the same time, nobody --
like nobody else is going to care that he's hurt. At this point you got to
step up, next man up and be ready to play. Feel bad for him, but we got ball
to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like the style of ball that you play is an advantage
in a tournament setting like this? And I'm curious what you think about fans
-- obviously not Virginia fans, but fans in general who kind of feel like it's
a less fun style of basketball to watch?  
DEVON HALL: I don't think we necessarily have to apologize for the way we play
or try to be favored by everyone else. If you like us, then you like us. If
not, I mean so be it. I think the way we play helps us win and we enjoy
playing that way. We play great that way as a group. So I don't think we
necessarily have to, you know, help everybody like us or make everybody like
us. That's the nature of the beast.  
  
Q. It's the dream of every college player to get to play in the NCAA
Tournament. Tell me how y'all feel about getting to play.  
ISAIAH WILKINS: It's exciting. You want to play ball, a lot of people come up
and watch this as they play and they want the play on the stage. We're here
and thankful for that for sure. Yeah, excited.  
  
DEVON HALL: Heck of an experience. I'm looking forward to it. Should be a lot
of fun. When -- like you were saying, when you're younger you watching us and
to be able to play on this stage is really fun.  
  
Q. Isaiah, have you done anything different in preparation physically
for this tournament or late season as opposed to last year when you obviously
missed a game?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: When I was sick? No. I eat more vegetables (laughter). That's
it. That's all I got for you. I'm healthy this year.  
  
Q. Guys, having been through this a few times already, when you look
back at your previous experiences, how much does it change this time of the
year in terms of what you need to do, and what are the biggest keys in the
single elimination kind of format?  
DEVON HALL: I think preparation is really, really big when it comes to this,
because you have one -- you have a couple days coming into it to prepare, and
then depending on how you do, you may have one day just to prepare for it. So,
I think that preparation and film and making sure you're locked in on every
aspect in this setting.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I feel like we got to punch first or try to punch first at
least. It's hard to play from behind in this format because everybody is
revved up and ready to play.  
  
Q. Devon, with De'Andre not available, will you expect to see more time
filling that role that he played in the small lineup as the nominally the 4?  
DEVON HALL: Maybe so, depending on what matchups are in or if it -- may be to
our advantage, then maybe so, I'll play some 4 or maybe we may go more
traditional at times. We'll see. I mean, I'm comfortable playing. I played a
little bit last year, so I enjoy playing that position anyway, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else?  
  
Q. Devon, did you guys watch a lot of these games that have been held up
to this point? And if so, have you learned anything?  
DEVON HALL: What do you mean?  
  
Q. The NCAA games to this point.  
DEVON HALL: We were just watching Rhode Island and Oklahoma. That was a good
one, went into OT. Watching the Gonzaga game in the locker room before we
walked in here. This is a competitive nature -- I mean this competitive
nature. Who doesn't want to play in this atmosphere. And I know every player
across the country playing in this is excited right now and amped up.  
  
Q. You guys have always been a chip on the shoulder kind of team and the
program sort of been defined by the underdog mentality. How hard is that to
maintain when you're a one seed and do you get a little extra bit of that now
with De'Andre out and some doubters kind creeping in again?  
DEVON HALL: I think it's more of us challenging each other in practice and
make sure we keep our humble mindset going into the game, knowing that -- I
mean any given day we don't come out to play, we can be beat. I think that we
have that mindset of knowing we have to fight, be continuous and be relentless
and own every possession. It definitely helps us keep that underdog mentality.  
  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think there was ever a point where we won a game or
something and we all got together yes, like now we have arrived, we're here.
That's not how it goes. So, we're getting after it every single day. If
seeding mattered, the tournament wouldn't be a thing. Just whatever.  
  
DEVON HALL: I think we most definitely have room to improve and we're trying
to keep improving every single day. We watch so much film and we learn, you
know, from each other, learn from Coach Bennett and his staff. I think the
room for improvement is definitely there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else?  
  
Q. What are some things you as the older players are doing to calm the
nerves of the younger guys?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think we're a super uptight team anyway. We play
around and stuff like that. Dev does a really good job of like filling the
guys with confidence and things like that. We're still holding each other
accountable. We played North Carolina before. It's basketball. Show up.  
  
DEVON HALL: At the end of the day, we try to keep the guys loose and keep
confidence with the team. But at the end of the day, what it boils down to the
nerves get settled and it's time to really sit down and play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thank you, guys.  
  
We're about to start with Virginia Coach, Tony Bennett. Welcome Virginia
Coach, Tony Bennett.  
  
Q. What's your reaction to De'Andre and talking to Marco he said he was
taken off the green team and -- do you kind of anticipate him getting some
more minutes in this game?  
TONY BENNETT: I think the game will dictate that and obviously I was really
discouraged for De'Andre and for us. He had a heck of a year. I thought he
really developed and, you know, helped us so much with his versatility,
offensively and defensively. We talked a lot about that. But that's -- you
can't control the timing. Those things happen. I think there's enough in that
room, and of course as the old saying goes, next man up, you step up and guys
like Marco have to be ready. And just depending on how the game goes, you see
how it goes but it was -- yeah, an unfortunate thing and he seems to be
handling it well and I think the guys, everybody wanted him to be part of
this. But we're glad he's here and we're going to have to fight like crazy to
keep going.  
  
Q. What do you see Mamadi's role now that De'Andre won't be available,
and what do you anticipate from him going forward?  
TONY BENNETT: The game will dictate what you do, whether you're playing more
traditional. And guys like Mamadi and Marco, you mentioned Nigel, those guys
who have come off the bench for us, and De'Andre before, certainly have to be
ready. And with the team that we're playing and UMBC, they spread the floor
and shoot the ball very well. Their 4 men can play almost like a perimeter. It
will be how we're defending and how they're guarding us. You can't say until
the game gets going but hope that guys like Mamadi and Nigel and Marco will
seize the opportunity and the guys in the starting lineup will continue on.  
  
Q. Tony, seeing as De'Andre hit 6 free throws in the final minute
against Carolina, when did the injury occur? Was it in the Clemson game?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah. He had sprained his right wrist. I can't remember when did
he that. That was taped for awhile, but in the Clemson game I think, you know,
it was when he went to the basket and then he ended up playing. He had x-rays
and everything was looking good. And it wasn't until when we got back and it
still was bothering him and then he had an MRI, which was the definitive
thing. A real slight, slight crack but on his left, and your job as the coach
certainly and with these young men is to protect them. And he has such a nice
future and I think De'Andre would have tried to play, but long-term that's not
the wise thing. It's to get this taken care of and do it the right way and
give him the best chance for a full recovery, which is certainly what we
expect. But it was -- I believe it was in that Clemson game, I think when he
landed.  
  
Q. Tony, obviously you guys have been a No. 1 seed before, you've been
good for a long time. Given the season you've had, how do you access the
opportunity in front of your team going into this tournament? And also do you
need to break through to a Final Four to kind of get rid of maybe the final
narratives that hang onto your program?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think -- well, first of all, you know, to be given a No.
1 seed it's kind of a reflection of the year that we had and that's -- it's an
honor. But really what it does, it earns you the right to play one game and
we've earned that right just as UMBC did and play and earn the right to get a
next game. But it was a heck of a year, you know, and I think our guys -- of
course every program wants to win a national championships and get a Final
Four bid, those kinds of things. I was fortunate to be with my father when his
program at Wisconsin went there and that was a great run. But, you know, as
far as our program, I'd love it, but I know the way to do that is to lock in
and say all right, earn the right to get to the next game.  
  
There's so many good things have happened this year that won't be taken away,
but how you choose to judge your program, I look in our league, look at the
programs like Duke and Carolina and the national championship, they've done
that. That's why we're continuing to try to knock. We got a door knocker in
our locker room. Keep knocking and a step at a time. Tremendous opportunity,
certainly. We received the opportunity to compete against UMBC. I told our
guys maybe a month ago, I mentioned it to our media many times to not
overcomplicate it. Don't worry about seedings, how far you go, what happens.
Just have a mindset we're going to improve, we're going to play to win, and
we're going to be ready to go. And I think that not complicating is the best
way for us to have as much success as we can.  
  
Q. We talked about this a few years ago when you guys were playing here,
former Charlotte Hornet coming back. What are your memories from the city,
what's it like coming back and your thoughts on it?  
TONY BENNETT: This has been -- I have wonderful memories of Charlotte. It's
where a couple dreams come true. Happened one -- I had a dream as I young boy
that one day could I play in the NBA, and I was given that opportunity by the
Hornets. Dave Twardzik, maybe he was the one in the war room saying we should
draft the little lefty from Wisconsin Green Bay. But to play on that Hornets
team, to be part of a playoff team and some special years here with great,
great teammates was a dream come true for me. And I got to meet my wife here.
She's not from here, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana but she was an assistant
youth director at the church, Forest Hill that I went to. You meet your wife
and get to play in the NBA -- it's more important to meet your wife, let's get
that straight. Those are two pretty awesome things that happened here. And got
to meet wonderful people that I was part of this community when the Charlotte
Hornets, the hive was alive, the Coliseum was great. I cherish those memories
and thankful where this road has taken me.  
  
Q. Tony, a lot of players never get to play in the tournament, lot of
coaches never make it to the tournament. You've done both. What does it mean
to you now to get to be a coach and bring your team back to the tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: It's great. When I played at Wisconsin Green Bay, you know, that
was such -- we'd have to win our conference tournament and then get the chance
to do that. I remember how exciting that was for our city and our university
and the NCAA Tournament is amazing. The regular season championships is
amazing, the conference tournament and then the NCAA Tournament. So much has
been made of it and rightly so. I think it's the most exciting sporting event
going, little bias of course, but to be able to do it as a player and get the
perspective to watch your young men have the excitement and the opportunities
to play is great and step into it in arenas like this and just gotten more
coverage, more excitement, I think is wonderful.  
  
Q. Other than the dramatic way that UMBC sort of made it into the
tournament, what have you learned about them from watching the film and what
are you expecting tomorrow?  
TONY BENNETT: I think Coach Odom, both of us being coaches' sons, in two years
what he's done with that program is terrific, how they've played and just I've
been really impressed in watching them on tape. They shoot almost 40 percent,
39 percent from 3, they shoot 20 plus, make 10, and they spread the floor,
their 4 man can shoot. Jairus Lyles is a heck of a player. I think he had 31
against Arizona. I didn't realize their point guard was Defensive Player of
the Year. I can see it because he's quick. They really spread the floor and
attack and play hard and are well coached. And that's the thing. You know,
when I was at Green Bay we always talked about this. Good basketball knows no
limits, knows no divisions. Doesn't matter what conference you're from, what
your seeding is. Good basketball sticks and it shows. I think for them to go
into Vermont and beat them in the ball they played is very good. That's --
again as I get back to like we said, you don't overcomplicate it. Try to
improve and you play it to win and you just -- you prepare well and you have
to prepare well to play UMBC because of their uniqueness and spacing and all
of those things, run very good offense.  
  
Q. As you may have heard Ryan Odom is a former UVA ball boy. Were you
ever a ball boy?  
TONY BENNETT: I was something called -- my dad was the coach at University of
Wisconsin, Stevens Point. I was what they called a "pointer pup." We'd go in
at halftime and get to do -- actually you'll see when -- not that you guys
will watch, when we go out there to warm up, we do a little ball handling
routine, Pete Maravich, the ball in a circle. The pointer pups would go out
there at halftime, right leg, left leg, dribble it high and low at halftime in
front of the crowd. Kind of that. And a lot of times I sit right behind the
bench and did some things for my dad's team. That's when Terry Porter and Brad
Soderberg, one of my assistants, they were playing for my father but a pointer
pickup. I know only Coach Odom when he was at UVA and Ryan was at Virginia
Tech, lot of good places.  
  
Q. I wasn't sure if you were using that as an analogy. Do you really
have a door knocker back in Virginia?  
TONY BENNETT: Ever since I've been coaching, not to make a big deal out of it,
even at Washington State, I think we acknowledged that you just -- that's the
way to touch something special. You keep knocking and sometimes the door gets
slammed in your face and sometimes you knock and it opens an inch and try to
put your foot and shoulder in there and keep knocking and trying to bust
through that door. That's the mentality. So we had that at Washington State
all my years, got a doorknocker and have it at Virginia just as a symbol. So
many programs have different things. That symbolized that. As a matter of
fact, I get a lot of texts from former players and lot of times "keep
knocking, Coach." And I think that's a great way to describe a program that
is, you know we're trying to be as blue collar as we can but pursue excellence
in the better manner we know how and it's our way. It's not other ways and
wherever that takes us, it takes us.  
  
Q. Tony, as I walked in you were talking about offensively, defensively,
they seem very multiple. In terms of prepping for their defense, what do you
see and what's allowed them to improve on that end this season?  
TONY BENNETT: Ryan is a good coach and they have some quickness and they can
go down the floor and put some pressure on you, whether it's three-quarter
court or make it hard for you, and then they played some good zone and again
they can pressure the ball with their quickness and their versatility. You
have to be ready and be sound with the ball. They turned -- I thought they
turned the game around Vermont, got after it and showed them a few different
looks. Very capable. And again being a coach's son you have to make your team
play defense or your dad disowns you. That's one of the rules of being a
coach's son.  
  
Q. Tony, as a shooter from your background, when you look at a player
like Kyle Guy, first of all, he's had a special year, but secondly is his
release among the fastest that you've ever seen as a player or coach?  
TONY BENNETT: Dell Curry had a pretty quick release when I played with him,
just a wrist flip and off. Kyle has a very quick release, quick set-up and
sometimes he can even adjust in the air. He's got live legs. Joe Harris played
for us, he had a quick release. Fortunate enough to coach Klay Thompson, one
of the quickest release. He really does have a quick release and again a good
foot work and moves hard without the ball and sometimes he'll adjust in the
air and turn a little bit which lot of guys can't. JJ Reddick could do it, Rip
Hamilton. Some of those guys you watch and they have them. Kyle has that kind
of foot work and ability to get it off. At his size, that's good. He gets off
the floor a little more than you think. If you saw his two dunks in the ACC
tournament, you know that.  
  
Q. Tony, I know you're a man of strong faith. How has your faith been
important in your coaching?  
TONY BENNETT: It's for me, everybody believes what they're going to believe,
but that has been my foundation in my life for so long. It gives me a peace
and perspective that really helps me and guides me in terms of how to treat
these young men, how to coach, how to honor the opportunity that I've been
given. Because I look at being a coach as a tremendous opportunity, as a gift
really to try to influence young men to be all they can be. Obviously as
players, as a team and sports gives you great lessons, but if there's life
lessons after. We have some pillars we talk about that are about humility,
passion, unity, servanthood that I think so make for a great team. There's
some life lessons in there, too. It's number one in my life. What matters most
without a doubt, then my relationship with my wife and my family and then the
opportunity to be with young men and coach. So, very thankful to certainly
have that as my rock.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Last two.  
  
Q. Tony, just to go back to the keep knocking theme. After the Syracuse
game, I was there in Chicago, you kind of freaked me out with how calm you
were. You didn't seem to be phased at all by what happened there. As you went
into that to reform the program to have the team you have now, was that just
sort of the perspective that you had to take on it was we knocked once, didn't
break it down, got to go try again? Was that kind of how you thought of it?  
TONY BENNETT: I think that mentality, and as the gentleman just asked, my
faith helps me in situations like that to see a bigger picture and
perspective. Doesn't mean it doesn't sting and you don't want to be there.
That's life. You're not always going to get what you want. We were on the
doorstep of perhaps advancing. And then you advance and there's always going
to be what's next, what's next? Nothing is ever enough, I understand that. All
these things are going to fade, but that idea of knocking after that game, we
addressed how can we improve. Every tough defeat, every tough loss, I think
brings incredible wisdom and that's one of our pillars about thankfulness is
will you be thankful for what adversity or losing teaches you. If you're able
to look at it as not enjoyable as it is and really glean from it, I think you
can grow in ways you probably wouldn't grow in success. And of course after
that, you look at things how to improve your program. I've been fortunate to
have the right kind of guys this year no one expected us to be in this spot.
But guys just have come together and they're so connected and so unified, and
now we've lost a key player. So we'll have to remain that way and even more
so. But that tough loss, yeah, I think it helped. But a lot of these players
weren't even a part of that. Devon, right? Correct me if I'm wrong -- Isaiah
-- Devon and Isaiah, get mad at me. Those guys, this is a different time, it's
a different year, and I think that's important to not dwell too much on the
past.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. As you've seen your team transition from the regular season to the
post-season, has there been any particular player that you've seen maybe
behind the sense in practice really make a post-season leap, or do you think
it's just kind of continued a season long progression?  
TONY BENNETT: I think it's been a season long progression. What's made this
team thus far be where they've been at is that they've improved in the off-
season, had good off seasons with their individual skill development and their
weight room stuff. All those things have mattered, and I think collectively
that's lifted them up. There's some guys with uncertainty. We were unproven.
They've stepped up well. And again there's been a unique chemistry in how
they've played. I think that's continued on, and it will have to obviously
keep continuing for sure.  
  
But different guys at different times, you know, De'Andre when we played at
Virginia Tech, he was a catalyst like he kind of came on. Mamadi, Jack,
different guys -- that's been unique about this team -- have stepped up when
called upon or when needed. You can't put your finger on one guy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, raise your hand.  
  
Q. Any of the guys, when you have the title game against Florida Gulf
Coast, what sticks with you more, the hot shooting in the first half or trying
to hold them off in the second half going into this tournament?  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Definitely the hot shooting from the first half. The first
half was a dream. The second half felt more of a nightmare but then it
finished with a dream. You're always going to remember the dream, not
nightmare.  
  
KENNY COOPER: The way we played the game was with a lot of joy and passion. We
played for each other in the first half, like we did in the second half. For
the most part, the fact that we won that first half really, really sticks.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: The first half was a great first half for us. Second half showed
our resiliency throughout the whole 20 minutes and showed we can get the job
done even with a lot of pressure.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I think the first half is what you remember for sure. You
got to use the second half to learn from it. Obviously North Carolina is
probably going to look at that film and see what they can do to speed us up
and press us. We need to learn from that as well.  
  
ELI PEPPER: I wish the first half stuck with me more, but the second half does
because it reminds me we're about this close not being able to sit right here
and be in this tournament.  
  
Q. Garrison, you mentioned the fast pace. How do you guys play against
the fast pace and how much of a challenge does that pose against a team like
North Carolina who likes to speed up the tempo?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It's going to be tough for sure. Obviously it's one of the
better teams in the nation. Kenny has done a great job all year of breaking
presses and stuff. It hurt us in the second half having him out. Buckland is
not a true point guard, but he's done a great job stepping into that role when
Kenny is out. It's hurt with us Nate. Those two guys are the key for us going
against a defense like that for sure.  
  
Q. I'm wondering what it's been like since you guys made the tournament,
reaction on campus, all of that, and then to get seeded against North
Carolina, do the emotions and all, I'm wondering if you can take me through
the whole week.  
ELI PEPPER: It's been incredible, the support of the campus, everybody is
coming up and saying things. It's a fun time but when you get seeded with
somebody like North Carolina, it's even better because we're here to win a
game and play the best first. That's the best case we can get.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Garrison.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It's been an amazing feeling being around campus with
everybody and celebrating with them. It's not just about us, it's about the
whole community. And obviously it's the first time, so it's been a great
feeling.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: Talking about community, Belmont, Vanderbilt, MTSU, they're not
in the tournament. TSU is not in the tournament. All eyes in Nashville are on
us. That's a great feeling to have that we're kind of the center of attention
right now. Obviously have Tennessee being a 3 seed, but locally in Nashville
we've got all the attention. So it's nice to have that and obviously the fans
of Lipscomb, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kenny.  
  
KENNY COOPER: Like Rob said, we have a ton of local guys. The City of
Nashville is behind us, and also Eli said we're going in here to win a game,
we're not just happy to be here, we're not dissatisfied with this, but we want
to make some noise.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Really put in perspective for me when we got back to campus
and there was 500-plus students waiting up for us at 11:00 at night in the
pouring rain. So, it really put in perspective how big of a deal it is, not
just for us but for the school and the community of Nashville and ultimately
we're representing our school.  
  
Q. We hear a lot about the 2-15 upsets, Gulf Coast beating Georgetown, a
team you guys beat, Lehigh and Duke. Is it something you talk about in the
locker room?  
ROB MARBERRY: It's something we always talk about. We're not here just to have
fun and shoot around with the UNC team. We always have it in the back of our
heads and always going to practice like we're going to win. That's what we're
going to come out and do.  
  
KENNY COOPER: It's good to have that in the back of our minds. It's very
doable. Like Rob said, again, we're not here to just for the experience or
just to play. We're here to compete and win a game.  
  
Q. Along those lines, in 2010 Lipscomb took North Carolina to the second
half, 59-56. You guys closed the gap by 3 points. Do you gain any confidence
from that? Has that come up at all, anybody?  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: That was a long time ago. A completely different team put
together right now. Two completely different teams. I don't think it has much
to do with tomorrow's game, but we'll take the confidence that we were there
then and we can be there now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Eli.  
  
ELI PEPPER: I think we take all of our confidence from this past season and
just winning the championships. That game that you just spoke of, it's not
going to gain us one point in this game we play, so we're going to take our
confidence from our past this season.  
  
Q. This can be for Eli, or if Michael wants to touch on it. It's Spring
Break this week and how nice is that not to have to worry about school and
kind of enjoy the moment and soak it all in?  
ELI PEPPER: This is the best spring break I could have ever asked for.  
  
THE MODERATOR: They're all enjoying their spring break.  
  
Q. You guys mentioned how Nashville is supporting you. Will the City of
Nashville show up, is there any fear of you going into what's essentially a
Carolina home game?  
KENNY COOPER: I think Lipscomb got a bunch of tickets, and they've all bought.
We're sold out of tickets, fan tickets. That's a sign to know that we'll have
a section cheering for us, rooting for us. We know like this will be
essentially a Carolina home game being so close to their campus, but we're
excited, we're really excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: It puts the odds more against us knowing there's going to be
a lot of Carolina Blue out there in the stands. At the same time, we're going
to have our people and the people that care about us most in the stands, and
that's what matters to me the most is that people that care about me and the
rest of the guys in the locker room are going to be out there cheering for us.
That's all we need.  
  
Q. You guys talked about upsetting North Carolina at the selection show.
Address to this Garrison, I guess. What's the strength you guys have? What's
something North Carolina is going to have to worry about against you guys?  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I would say our 3-point shot. I don't think they defend very
well on the perimeter. That's going to be a huge key for us. Obviously pay a
huge amount of mind to Rob. When you have a post like him, they bring help
side and everything which opens up the outside. It's going to be tough to
guard the inside out for sure.  
  
Q. Michael, you're from High Point, right?  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Tell me about your recruiting process, how you ended up at Lipscomb
as opposed to any of the basketball schools in North Carolina?  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Throughout my whole recruiting process, I would have never
told you I'd leave more than three hours from home. I'm a big homebody guy.
Definitely grew up around here, wanting to go to school around here at one of
the big schools but ultimately what made the decision for me was the faith-
based community in Lipscomb. Not just with the school but with the basketball
program in general, and that had a big influence on where I ended up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Rob, can you talk about the matchup in the paint with Maye and some
of their bigs.  
ROB MARBERRY: Luke Maye, big player, really athletic. Going to be tough
keeping him off the glass and the offensive rebounds. Try to isolate him as
much as possible in that aspect and just try to stay consistent on offense and
stay in my rhythm ad get some shots up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? We have plenty of time. No one else.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask Garrison and Eli, just when you guys are playing at
your best, what distinguishes you from other teams?  
ELI PEPPER: I think when we're playing with a lot of speed and rhythm, that's
when we're at our best, got people firing on all cylinders. We struggle
sometimes when there's a press. Lot of people like to blame our second half on
Florida Gulf's press. Tell a lot of people that you don't beat a team that
good without putting two halves together. You look at the Oklahoma State game
with Florida Gulf Coast, they start press, Oklahoma state is up 15 and all of
a sudden down 4 points. They're a good team. We figured out a way to get that
done. We practiced on it all week and we're ready for it now, too.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I think what starts us off on the defensive end, we've shown
when we can get it down on defense, it fuels our offense and get out in
transition and push the ball. That's when we're at our best for sure.  
  
Q. For the panel, can you compare -- you guys played a strong non-
conference schedule but you also -- the conference had some good teams. Does
North Carolina remind you of anybody you've already played?  
THE MODERATOR: Kenny.  
  
KENNY COOPER: It's hard to put them in the category of one team, but I believe
they're going to beat Tennessee where they have a lot of good players, but if
we come to play, we can compete and that's our whole mindset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael.  
  
MICHAEL BUCKLAND: Going to be like all other high majors we played and they're
going to be more athletic, more skilled, more highly touted players than we
have but at the same time they have five guys on the court and we have five
guys on the court. If we out-execute them and play our game better than they
play their game, we'll have a shot to win at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Kenny, the video feature on you guys just came out. You guys are
eating pizza and playing Fortnite. Is that kind fun to show what life is like
off the court in the midst of all this craziness?  
KENNY COOPER: Puts perspective that we're still human, that we're still just
average students on campus but we just play basketball. It's kind of cool for
them to come video us just living our normal lives.  
  
Q. Are you relishing the role as kind of being underdoing against a team
like North Carolina coming in here? Lot of people say they're a powerhouse
program. You guys are kind of the underdog. Is that exciting to in that
role?  
ROB MARBERRY: When we played Gulf Coast in the Championship game, we were also
the underdogs. We take it and run with it, honestly. We can play with any
team, we can compete with any team. Having them as a powerhouse and having us
as the underdog really doesn't matter to us. We're going to practice all week
like we're going to beat them. We're going to play the 40 minutes like they
play the 40 minutes. All that talk before the game doesn't matter. We're going
to practice and win.  
  
KENNY COOPER: Kind of go into this game like we have nothing to lose but
everything to gain, you know. We can go out here and play hard, compete and
win a game, then that builds our culture at Lipscomb, builds a better
basketball program within itself and become more known. I'm just going into
this game trying to better the name of Lipscomb and get the name of Lipscomb
out there.  
  
Q. You guys are on a pretty solid win streak here to end the season.
Does that help give you guys any confidence going into the first tournament in
school history?  
THE MODERATOR: Eli.  
  
ELI PEPPER: It helps a ton. If you want to peak at anytime during the season
it's, right now. That helps us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Garrison.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: It for sure does. North Carolina is not like any other team
we played in our conference. Big time school. If we want to compete with them,
we've got to bring our A game for sure.  
  
Q. Do you guys have any pregame rituals that you do before something of
this magnitude?  
ROB MARBERRY: Play a little Fortnite in the hotel. That's about it. Get a win
in Fortnite.  
  
Q. For any of the players, North Carolina doesn't start a big lineup but
they do play a lot of bigs. What does that matchup do for you guys as far as
their size?  
KENNY COOPER: All week we've been practicing on boxing out. They're one of the
best offensive rebounding teams in the country. So that will pose a little bit
of a problem for us. We just have to be willing to go get boards more than
usual. And I mean, they're a big team, but we're also a good rebounding team
as well. We've got Eli, Rob, Gary, Buck, they're all good rebounders. I didn't
include myself, but they're great rebounders. I have all the confidence in the
world that we can out-rebound if we have the will to go get the ball.  
  
ROB MARBERRY: They've got a huge lineup, 1 through 5, we'll play defense as a
unit. We'll be fine. We have Kenny and Buck on the backside, Gary on the
backside. So I think we'll be fine. I front the post and we've got backside
help from the paint. When Luke Maye gets it one-on-one, that will be my
hardest job to do. But if we isolate him and keep them off the boards, I think
we'll be fine throughout the 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Any of the players, did any of you watch the ACC final that Carolina
played in? Familiar with them at all from watching on TV?  
THE MODERATOR: Garrison.  
  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I watched a little bit of it the overnight on ESPN. Coach
had mentioned in practice the other day that somebody that scouted them said
they're a lot faster in person than they are on film. That's obviously
something that's going to be huge for us to try to stop them in transition,
but I watched a little bit. Luke Maye is a great player and Barry. We need to
key in on them.  
  
ELI PEPPER: I didn't watch much of that game. We watched a ton of film on
them. They're a lot faster in person. But that coach also said they're a lot
more relentless in person than you thing. The first minute and a half we'll
have to try to shut it down in transition as much as we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? To our left.  
  
Q. Questions for Rob and Kenny. I think that people sort of from the
outside, you know, people who watch on TV, they take a look at a 15-2 game,
they don't see the two teams as being that close. How would you explain to
them that the gap between a North Carolina and a Lipscomb really isn't that
big.  
ROB MARBERRY: It's really not that big in the sense we've played Top 25 teams,
we played Tennessee and Purdue. We've competed with the best. We've prepared
all season for it, too. Even with preseason, we practiced like we're going to
play against UNC at the end of the season. We're ready for it. The 15-2 gap
you've seen throughout the years of Lehigh, Duke, obviously they're beatable.
I don't think people should look away from a 15 -- 2 upset.  
  
KENNY COOPER: Just a mindset thing. We're going into this game to win and our
playing styles are kind of similar we like to get out and run, they like to
get out and run. It's going to be a guns-a-blazing game. Whole bunch of fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.  
  
Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Casey, what more have you learned about North Carolina since we last
spoke, kind of validated what you already knew and then what else?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, I'll say our respect level continues to rise, not
that it wasn't already high, but, you know, I don't know if we've learned
anything new, but we've certainly fine-tuned some things, the intricacies sees
of how they work and why and so forth. Really good team. We knew that to start
with.  
  
Q. I look back at that 2010 game and Lipscomb cut it to 3 points late in
the second half. I know that didn't have anything to do with this team and
anything to do with you, you were across the boulevard at the time. Can some
confidence be gleaned from that? That was not a great Lipscomb team, it was a
great North Carolina team. I mean, this program is better now.  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I didn't even remember we played in 2010 and so we
haven't talked about that. I think our experience this year will help us, you
know, play four teams in the tournament, Alabama, Texas, Tennessee, Purdue,
all of which present different problems, all of which are really talented
teams. We'll use those experiences to help us here. We have talked about the
teams in our league that have had success, the Dunk City story that everybody
is well aware of. Mercer the following year was in our league when they beat
Duke in the first round. They were a 15 seed. We talked about those things.
Again we've drawn upon the experiences of this year more than anything. We
played Purdue, that was the last of those four games and it was a post-
Christmas game, maybe December 30th or something like that. I really felt like
we played well. The final margin was 30 or something, but I felt like we
played well for the first 25 or 30 minutes. And so we left the locker room
that day, my message to them was that is the team you're going to see in the
NCAA Tournament, not Purdue specifically, but a team like that in the NCAA
Tournament. And you need to know right now that when you walk on the floor,
you can compete and you can expect to win even though we know it will be very
difficult.  
  
Q. Coach, what matchup with Carolina concerns you the most individually
or area?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, we're concerned about all of them without a
doubt. The one that concerns the most probably is Maye inside, honestly. Barry
makes them go. There's no doubt about that, his experience and toughness, his
willingness to help them win. But Maye is a tough cover because of his ability
to play out on the floor and to use screens and to shoot it quickly and that's
a situation that even though our guys are undersized in the post, we're not
used to guarding in the post. So that would be the most specific thing that I
could give you as far as personnel goes. What I'm worried the most about is
just their relentlessness on that end of the floor. They totally know that
they're Carolina and totally know that Carolina plays a certain way and they
embrace that and really good at it.  
  
Q. Coach, what's all the extra media attention been like and how do you
balance that trying to get Lipscomb's name out there but obviously stay on
focused at the task in hand?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Nothing is more important than making sure our team is
ready. They know that. I'm kind of a no frills kind of guy anyway. Our
players, we've prepared for this game like every other game. We've even had
more time to do it. The media attention has been great for Lipscomb. That's
one of the benefits both short-term and long-term that playing in the NCAA
Tournament does for a school like ours, especially for the first time. You
know, we've been places that we've never been before as far as attention goes,
national exposure, CBS tomorrow, blue blood program like North Carolina.
That's an unbelievable experience for everything that is Lipscomb. The long-
term, the residuals may even be more important, how we can take this and use
it in recruiting, how we can continue to build our program, how we can make
this a somewhat frequent event for our program, as a coach is what I'm most
concerned about.  
  
Q. How daunting is the task just like taking on Carolina and what's
going to essentially be a home game?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: It's daunting because they're really good, you know.
They always are, and this is just to show up and play another game for them,
where it's not for us. This is a first time for us. We don't have a single
player in the locker room. Got a couple of coaches that coached in the NCAA
Tournament but no players. And so that's what's daunting. But out message to
them will be we get to the first media timeout, I promise you it will feel
like every other game you've ever played. Just recognize that, be ready to
kind of withstand those first few minutes, and then go with it.  
  
Q. Sort of to follow up on what your point was about once you're in a
game it feels like a game, is the first tournament as much about dealing with
all the stuff that comes before the game like the attention, the added
interview sessions, all those things that you have to manage moreso than the
idea of playing a game, these guys have done that a bunch of times.  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: For sure. That's the biggest difference. We don't have
anything like this anytime during the year, you know. So that's what's so
different and that's what we're having to kind learn on the go. But again, we
recognize how important this is. We recognize what this exposure means to the
Lipscomb community and so we embrace that, we celebrate it, have some fun with
it but at the same time the game what is we're here for and that's kind much
-- it's been important to keep that in perspective throughout the last couple
of weeks that everything has occurred because we've got a game to play
tomorrow afternoon against a really good team.  
  
Q. Coach, after the title game, do you talk more with the team about the
first half when you couldn't miss or the second half?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I don't even remember the second half. I tried to
forget that entirely. We played pretty flawless in the first half and pretty
terrible in the second half. We've got to learn from the mistakes we made and
so forth. What mattered the most on that day was that we win the game,
whatever form and fashion it came in, we needed to win the game so that we
could be here today, and we did that.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you guys are very high scoring team, 108 points in
your last game. In fact, almost 200 points total in that game. Are you taking
that as momentum into this game and are you planning on just going wide open
with hopes of scoring at the normal pace that you have been scoring?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Yes and yes and yes. You know, I anticipate that
Carolina is going to score plenty, so we better score enough to keep up with
them right, is the way I'm looking at it. That's really how we play. I'm not
good enough coach to change that now and try to do something different. If
we're going to have a chance to win the game, we have to be the best version
of ourselves that we can be. We can't show up here and be somebody that we
haven't been all season long and expect to play with North Carolina and give
ourselves a chance to win. That's what we'll do. It will be a fun know game to
watch from that perspective, I anticipate. But even then, you never know. We
may have trouble scoring, they may have trouble scoring. It may be a turnover
game. Coaches prepare to do it one way, but then that's what we get paid for,
you got to make adjustments as you go.  
  
Q. Coach, you seem to have a good perspective on a lot of things because
you played several teams that are in the tournament already. So I wonder if
you could talk about how much, if any, talent disparity there is between your
average 15 and 2 seeds, the type of players you recruit versus a North
Carolina and yet we see these upsets come fairly regularly.  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, there's undoubtedly talent disparity player by
player. We don't have a single player on our team that was even considered to
be a player for North Carolina and we didn't recruit a single player on their
team because we didn't think we would go very far. It's understandable that
there's a big difference. Sometimes you can look at this moment and you could
draw upon our experience or having a bunch of four-year guys or something like
that, but that's not the case here, either. They bring as much experience into
this game as anybody in the country, you know, starting two, three seniors and
two, three juniors and a lot of guys that have won national championships and
played a ton of post-season games. The key is what I tell our team, we're not
here to -- for Lipscomb to be better than North Carolina. I mean, we
understand the differences. We're not going to walk out of here with people
putting our programs in the same breath. We are where we are for a reason. We
understand that.  
  
The key -- we have to be better than them for 40 minutes one time, that's it.
One time for 40 minutes. That's how we'll approach it.  
  
Q. Coach, similarly to the previous question I asked your players about
the 2-15 upsets, Gulf Coast over Georgetown, Lehigh over Duke, and he spoke
very confidently about them not just coming here to practice against North
Carolina or them just coming here to shoot around with North Carolina. Do you
talk about those upsets, and what do you guys think -- what do you think your
players get that confidence from as younger guys?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I don't know if it's so much confidence. It's probably
them just regurgitating to you what I've told them more than anything,
thankfully. We make no mistake, it's going to be really tough. We're going to
have to play great for it to happen. But you have to draw upon the experiences
of others and understand that the game can be won, and we didn't come here
just to show up, you know. We want to play our best game tomorrow. Win or
lose, we want to play our best game tomorrow. We want to make sure we play
with incredible effort, togetherness tomorrow. We have one chance to play this
game. That's really been the message all along and I do believe with great
performance, great execution, a couple of bounces that go our way, that we can
be in the game. I'm not going to sit up here and tell you we're going to win
the game. That's the reason we came over here was to win the game, and we've
seen that it's happened other places. I sat on a bench at a 15-1 game myself a
few years ago, Belmont, Duke, we were one possession away from winning that
game. I personally withdraw upon that experience.  
  
Q. You mentioned how just being in the tournament, like what the has
done for your team. What do you want people to know about Lipscomb going into
the game about your team, about your players?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I think people will see real quickly how much our team
loves each other, plays well together, embraces each other, plays for each
other. Those are the things that every coach wants to say, and it's the best
way to win. There are a lot of ways to win. Different styles, different kinds
of players, different philosophies. Ours is to go get a bunch of like-minded
guys who love playing at Lipscomb, would have considered going to school at
Lipscomb anyway even if they weren't playing basketball, bunch of guys that
would have gone to college anyway, would have graduated from college anyway,
that come from great families, great programs, put all that together and you
got the mix of a pretty good team. That's what I want people to see and I
think that they will.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 69, Florida - 66  
  
MIKE WHITE: Obviously really competitive game, high-level basketball game. I
thought congrats to Texas Tech. They're a terrific team. They made big plays.
They made the plays down the stretch, of course, and got the defensive stop
when they needed one.  
  
Coach Beard and his staff and his team have had a great year, and we wish them
luck moving forward.  
  
I thought Keenan Evans was terrific. They got downhill a bunch. They cut
really well. They drove it well, of course, defended at a high level. They
really defended us from the three at a high level. Zhaire Smith I thought was
terrific with 18, 9 and 7 assists to one turnover. I thought he was really,
really good.  
  
I thought they hit timely shots, especially in the first half, late shot clock
shots, and hit a couple there in the second half, as well. I know Evans hit a
huge contested three by, I think Chris was on him late, opposite their bench,
was a huge shot.  
  
Tough deal for us. I thought we played well enough to have a chance. I've said
this a bunch to our local media over the past couple weeks: I've been really
proud of the way this team has evolved and developed and how we finished the
season beating Auburn, winning at Alabama, beating Kentucky. I thought we got
a little bit out of character in the SEC tournament, and then we turned right
back around, and I thought in this tournament, we were really good the other
night. And I thought we were pretty good tonight and just got beat by a team
who's probably just a little bit better, at least they were tonight.  
  
That said, this is a very tough night for myself and my staff as we lose these
two guys to my left, who have meant a lot to this program, to this team, but
more importantly to this program, two guys who are terrific players and better
people, two of the toughest guys in college basketball.  
  
If all 13 of my guys were as tough as these two, we'd still be playing. Some
of those young guys are going to continue to develop, but these guys pound for
pound are absolute warriors. They've given us every ounce of energy and focus
and work ethic that we could possibly ask for.  
  
I'm sad for these two guys that they don't have another opportunity, but I'm
really proud of them, and the year that Egor had and the career that Chris
Chiozza had.  
  
Q. Chris, just how difficult is it to kind of end your career in this
fashion, with a chance to tie it, last second shot at the end of the game?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It's tough to go out that way. I don't think it's hit me fully
yet. As soon as the buzzer sounded, I felt it a little bit, but so far I don't
think it's hit me fully yet that my college career is over.  
  
But we've had some games like this where we would have made that shot, a
couple times where we had a couple big shots earlier in the season and stuff
like that, and we just couldn't get this one to go down. We had two chances.
But that's the way the game goes sometimes. We got what we wanted, and we just
didn't make it.  
  
Q. Chris, what was the defensive game plan to try to stop or slow down
Keenan Evans tonight?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Just not let him get any easy looks early. He had some tough
shots. A couple guys hit a couple tough shots late in the clock. I felt like
we did a good job of defending them. But he's a good player, so he's going to
get his points. We just tried to limit the damage he could do.  
  
Q. Egor, tell me about the look that you had at the end of the game, and
also what you saw in the scramble situation and the look that KeVaughn had, as
well?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah. We pressed. We got the turnover we needed, was kind of
ready to shoot there in the corner. I bobbled the ball a little bit, and then
I saw the guy kind of fell down or kind of trip. That threw me off. It was a
good look. I had a good look earlier, too, with the shot clock winding down.
You know, it's tough. It's tough.  
  
Sometimes you hit those shots. I didn't come through for my team today, but
you know, just how it is sometimes. Earlier in the year, we hit some big-time
ones, and we just couldn't come through today.  
  
Q. Egor, obviously this was your only season at Florida, but can you
talk a little bit about how much it meant to you and what your feelings are,
obviously emotional as you are, as it comes to an end tonight?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah, sure. Like Chris, I don't think it's like fully hit me
yet that this is over. I mean, it's sad. It's really sad because the whole
year we've been -- we've grew so much throughout the year as a team, as
people.  
  
It's been a lot of fun being around this program, just around the coaching
staff and players, I mean, the managers, everybody who works for the
University of Florida. It's been a blessing for me because when I made my
decision, I said I'm not going to look back and just go with it, and I'm just
-- I couldn't be happier that I came to the University of Florida, even if
it's for one year.  
  
Q. Chris, I know it's a little sudden question for you, but how do you
reflect on your career at Florida and everything you managed to accomplish?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It was a fun ride. It was wild. I had a lot of ups and downs.
You know, but I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. I'm glad that I chose
to come here and stay here with the coaching change, and it's probably the
best decision I made in my whole life, just sticking through that process and
just staying with my team and just forming a brotherhood and gaining new
family members.  
  
It's just something I'm never going to forget. It didn't end the way I wanted
it, but I'm not going to look back and say I didn't have any regrets. I played
as hard as I could, and we just came up a little short today.  
  
Q. Mike, Evans was obviously a huge factor in this stretch. Was there
anything you felt like you could have done differently with regards to some of
his play making and what he was able to do down the stretch?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, they do such a good job with their random movement, with
their motion. I don't know what Chris calls it. We consider it a freelance
passing game motion type offense. We call it motion, à la Arkansas. They
really move it well. The ball changes from side to side, of course. Screens
are so random, players and pin-downs and away screens and cross screens and
back screens. And when we moved with the basketball, when we loaded to the
basketball, all five guys, one guy being on Evans, the other four moving to
the basketball, we did a decent job.  
  
We had some breakdown with all of that ball movement at times where we have a
guy or two, whether he got out of his stance or not, he didn't move to the
ball. We didn't load to Keenan Evans a couple times when we needed that, at
least a couple times. He got to the rim too much, of course.  
  
We got straight line driven, just one-on-one, just Keenan Evans versus a
defender, like he's at the park one-on-one, he's at the rim. That can't happen
to get to the Sweet 16. That said, it's very difficult to contain him. He's
big. He's strong. He's physical. And he's got a really explosive first step.
It reminds me of Jalen in person. I didn't know he was quite that explosive.  
  
I thought we did a good job of going under ball screens when we switched to
zone, doing a better job of, again, just keeping him out of the paint. And
again, all that said, he goes three of four from three, as well, so he hurt us
from everywhere.  
  
Q. A lot of people will say that your team lives and dies by the three,
but it seemed more with Chris Chiozza out after he picked up his fourth foul.
Would you say it's more accurate your team lives and dies by Chris's play?  
MIKE WHITE: At times. We've been effective with him out of the game a few
times, of course. Obviously with Chris in the game, we are better both
offensively and defensively. He's our best defender, recognized by getting
that award, deservedly so. Offensively, he's arguably the best passer in
college basketball.  
  
I don't know if he stacked up with all those numbers, but taking care of the
basketball, getting guys shots, we weren't the best shooting team, the best
scoring team. Otherwise his numbers would have been inflated even more. But we
do play through him. When he's out of the game, we have a tendency to call
more stuff. We're a little bit less freelance. And so yeah, at times we have
been stagnant with him out of the game. We're going to miss him dearly, of
course.  
  
Q. You had a time-out left, but the floor was scrambled. Did you like
how it looked at the end there?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, you know, I'm going back and forth in my mind, of course, do
we call one, do we call one. They're terrific defensively, and we had a good
offensive lineup out there. The ball is in Chris Chiozza's hands with the
floor spread, and I'm not sure we would have drawn up anything better in a
couple looks we got.  
  
I'm pleased with those looks, of course. Chris got to the rim. I thought Keith
Stone made a great decision when he got -- he got a tough rebound and hit
KeVaughn, and just unfortunate they didn't go for us. But you know how it is.
If we had made a few earlier in the game or gotten a couple stops or kept
Keenan Evans out of the paint or bum rushed him, late clock, you know, when we
allowed him to get a couple of those threes off, and we're up five right
there, we don't need those shots to go. So we were in a position. We had to
hit a huge one, and they got a stop when they needed one.  
  
Q. Zone defense was really effective at the point --  
MIKE WHITE: The first time all year. How about that?  
  
Q. You had to use it because of the foul situation, right?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, fouls and just the flow of the game. We were afraid that it
was going to get away from us. They were scoring at a high clip. It was a
tough decision. I'm glad we went with it. It obviously gave us a chance.  
  
We've worked on it all year, and we've thrown it out there at times for
whatever reason, probably because it's very average. We've gotten torched with
it. Tonight it was pretty good. It was good for us. I thought that we
communicated pretty well. Our attention to detail was decent. We struggled to
rebound out of it, of course. They got a big offensive rebound, extra
possession versus it, if memory serves correct. But I thought our guys made a
pretty good adjustment.  
  
Q. Coach Beard said he wanted to keep this game in the 60s and limit the
pace. Did you want to play it in the 70s or 80s or even higher, and if so, how
did Texas Tech slow the game down or keep you in a lower scoring game?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, first off, we always -- we want to play in the 80s, but we
want our opponent in the 50s. Every team, every coach wants that. If you've
got to choose a ton of possessions versus very little possessions, we'd rather
more, but we've also fallen into a trap because we've been so prolific at
times in transition offense and inefficient in transition defense where we've
been taken advantage of in terms of falling into a trap of shooting it quick
and having teams grind us out defensively.  
  
Four or five games this year, the time of possession for us, kind of like a
football game, was very, very lopsided. It's hard to make shots when you play
three fourths of the game on defense. So we've had to evolve as a team. I
don't know if you saw us earlier in the year, but when we were playing with
teams that wanted to run with us or teams that -- you say whether it had to do
with us or not, teams that were playing really fast, our guys liked that, and
we were pretty good with it. And then we ran into some teams that were making
us defend for most of the game and weren't really as effective.  
  
Getting back to your second question, how did they do that, I think that -- I
think Chris has got a disciplined team first off. I thought their transition
defense was good. I thought their floor balance was good. They're really,
really fast. They're as fast as I've seen this year at changing ends, both
offensively and defensively. And then I thought they grinded us out.  
  
You can hear them over there demanding some passes and some movement, and they
-- a part of our 6 of 22 from three is probably having to do with the fact
that we're in a stance and we're negotiating screens and playing long
stretches on defense, and I thought they did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Just how difficult was it navigating the foul trouble? You had Jalen
with three fouls, had to sit him for about five minutes in the second half,
and Chris, bringing him in and out, and how much did you wrestle with bringing
either back sooner?  
MIKE WHITE: A bunch. The whole second half, it was just probably the biggest
topic of conversation amongst the staff, whether we were in time-outs or not,
when do we get this guy back in, what's your gut feeling, what do we do
without Chris on the floor, when do we go back with Jalen.  
  
Some of that had to do with the decision to go zone, too. We threw it at the
wall and it happened to work, and we considered another zone that we've dinked
with a little bit. But yeah, it's no fun dealing with foul trouble, of course,
but we've put ourselves in that situation. Overall, I don't think it was a
huge factor. I think Texas Tech was just good, and I thought the environment
was great, so hats off to their crowd and the way that they brought it. It was
a great college basketball environment.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola - 63, Tennessee - 62  
  
PORTER MOSER: I first want to say all glory and thankfulness goes to God. He's
been so good to this group, me, this University, and the glory goes to him,
first and foremost.  
  
Second, just it's amazing when you have a group of people who believe. I mean,
just this group is resilient. They believe. We've come back from deficits.
We've lost leads and found ways to win games. You know, they just kept
believing, and then -- this group has been ultra resilient, and I'm blessed to
coach them, and I just thank Clay, thank you, it was a great shot. I'll leave
it at that.  
  
Q. Clayton, can you just describe what you saw on that shot and what you
were thinking as the ball bounces up off the rim? Probably seemed like it took
a while to get back to the rim.  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, Coach put me in a position to make a play at the end,
and I'm very appreciative of that. I mean, the only thing I can say is glory
to God for that one. I mean, the ball bounced up on the rim, and I got a good
bounce like that. But the only thing I could think about after the game is
that that's all the hard work that I put -- like that you put in to get in a
situation like this, and all those hours, those waking up early in the morning
and working out. For all that hard work to come up to that lucky bounce is
worth it, and I think all the hard work, the basketball gods helped that one
go in, and I'm just super blessed to be in this situation right now.  
  
Q. Aundre and Ben, what does this win mean for your team, advancing to
the Sweet 16, for your team and your school as a whole?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It just means our season is not over. We reach no finish line.
We just took another step in getting where we want to get, so we're going to
go back and get ready for the next game.  
  
BEN RICHARDSON: I would say the same thing. It's great to get some exposure
for our school and our fans. And on the national stage, we know there's so
many loyal fans that have come up to us, that have been fans since '63, the
National Championship team, and they're so proud of us, and it just means the
world to us to bring that pride back to this program.  
  
You know, it's just a tribute to all these guys, all the guys in the locker
room, Coach, and all the administrators that have supported us. Like Dre said,
this is just another step, and we're planning to advance, and we want to win
every game we're in.  
  
Q. Clayton, what was discussed during that time-out with ten seconds
left? What was the plan or the play?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, it was just we ran like a safety to get it into me,
and then Krutwig, I was going to kind of dribble over to the left kind of, and
then Krutwig was going to come up and act like he was going to set a screen
and then drop it and kind of just let me go like with my right hand, went
towards my right hand, kind of felt that -- kind of got him going fast so he
wasn't going to be able to contest my shot when I shot it, and just elevated
and shot it, and I got a good bounce.  
  
PORTER MOSER: We've still got another game. You can go left.  
  
Q. Ben, what's it like watching your best friend since the third grade
hit that shot to go to the Sweet 16?  
BEN RICHARDSON: You know, like he was talking about earlier, I've seen him
make one, two dribble, one-two pull-up probably a million times. And I have so
much faith in that shot just because I've seen him make it -- like when we're
just working out and stuff, he makes it like a 98 percent clip.  
  
So before games, I'm always just like, get to that one-two pull-up, get to
that one-two pull-up. We try to tell him because it is such a high-percentage
shot for him. He knocks it down so much. It is fitting that he hits a big shot
going one-two pull-up like we've been doing in the gym for our whole lives
working on that shot. I'm so happy for him in this moment. It's something I'll
never forget.  
  
Q. You guys have talked about the idea of every game could be a
different guy, and it seems like it's coming true. Like these last two games,
it's been a different hero at the end. What does that say about your team just
the other night it's Donte hitting the big shot, and tonight it's you?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I think that that just speaks to the culture in our program.
We don't care about -- some nights some people get more shots than other
nights. There's some nights where Dre might only shoot four or five shots, and
I might shoot 12. And there's some nights where Dre will find himself open
more than I find myself open, so he shoots the ball 12 times and I shoot the
ball five times, and we don't care how many shots we are going to get on any
given night.  
  
The ball is going to find you if you're open, and we trust -- we have so many
weapons that we trust that people are going to make plays. I mean, yesterday
-- a couple days ago Donte hit the shot and today I hit the shot, but anybody
on our team could make a big shot down the stretch. I think it just speaks to
the culture that we have in our program.  
  
Q. Aundre, what does it mean to you to have this moment back here in DFW
with friends and family, get to share it with them?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It's just an amazing feeling. I spotted out all my friends and
family out in the crowd. And once I had a good game and then once we won the
game, I went up to them, and it was just crazy. It was an unbelievable
feeling.  
  
Q. No offense, but when you guys take the court, you're not the most
imposing-looking team. Does that sort of play to your advantage in some ways?
Do you exploit that in some ways? Does that work to your advantage in some
ways?  
BEN RICHARDSON: We're not scary looking?  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: We don't scare you? I think we're pretty scary.  
  
BEN RICHARDSON: I mean, you know, it's no secret we're not the biggest team,
but Coach teaches and he's been preaching since I got here just principles and
culture and things that you can reference on every little part of a
possession.  
  
I mean, before the game, Coach was always saying, he was preaching before the
game, it's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in
the dog. I know that's cliché, but that's something we've really embraced, and
we've embraced every part of our culture well this year, and that's why we've
gotten to where we are because you don't need to be the biggest guy when
you're guarding the  
  
SEC Player of the Year down there. You just have to fight harder, and you've
got to have help from the rest of your team.  
  
It takes five guys out there, and we've been connected very well this year,
and I think that's why we've been able to compete and rebound and get stops
because it's been five guys connected and linked together.  
  
And then we just executed and kind of bought into the culture that Coach has
been preaching all year, wall of culture. We've bought into all that stuff.  
  
Q. Coach, when are you going to shed this image of the underdog, and do
you think Vegas is going to make you the favorite the next four days?  
PORTER MOSER: You know what, can't talk about Vegas up here, but I say it
every press conference, listen to these guys. How unbelievable. You heard
Donte the other day say anybody can make it. You saw how genuinely happy Ben
was for Clay making that shot.  
  
I mean, it's amazing what you can do when you get a group of people believing
and that are really tight. I said that since day one. I've said it for years
now. The guys -- we have a close-knit culture, and the guys in the locker room
pull for each other. They share the ball. It's just amazing. They really -- we
all, we really believe.  
  
Q. A lot of times after a big win like you had on Thursday, teams have a
letdown and they come out flat the next game. What did you do to keep that
from happening today?  
PORTER MOSER: Well, we came out struggling on defense. I think they had 15
points in the first five minutes. And we called a time-out, and then they had
ten points the last 15 minutes of the half.  
  
I think one of the things we talk about, we've been doing it now for about a
month or two, is that we knew we were having to win and win the conference and
then get to the conference tournament, and it's been this mentality of you
win, enjoy the moment.  
  
I've been asked a million times, are you letting the guys enjoy it. I'm like,
heck yeah, I'm letting them enjoy it because it's a mature, close group. And I
want them to enjoy it. Then the next day, we all say put it in the bank, next
one up. You heard one of them reference it right there.  
  
These guys after we beat Miami, it was great. We had a great meal just our
team at the hotel. It was just really a special team meal, and then they had
some rest, and the coaches went to work. And we talked a little bit before
they went to bed. The next day, it was completely locked in, the film
sessions, the walk-through in the ball rooms. We came here and shot.  
  
They had put it behind you, and it's a credit to everyone in the locker room.
They enjoyed it, and then they moved on. And we're going to enjoy this. I
guarantee you we're enjoying this. I hope the people in Chicago -- I can't
imagine St. Patty's Day in Chicago because Chicago has embraced this team so
much, and to embrace this in Chicago on St. Patty's Day, wow, my younger self
would have loved to have been there. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Admiral Schofield scored 11 points in the first five minutes and then
three the rest of the game. What was the plan to slow him down?  
PORTER MOSER: Well, I think he said I'm an Illinois guy, I'm going to give it
to them right out of the gate. Wow, he was hot. We had to regroup. I called a
time-out. And it just shows the culture of these guys. Trust is a big thing,
and I always say that.  
  
I remember working for Coach Majerus, Coach Barone. You can get on kids if
they know they love you. That's a big thing in today's society. If they know
you care and that you love them, you can get on them. I got on them as hard as
I've gotten on them in a month at that first time-out when they scored 15
points. And they just, I got it. I mean, they knew. We turned it, the way they
responded in the next 15 minutes.  
  
But Schofield is -- he is a terrific player. He's a terrific competitor. He is
a terrific competitor. He's hard to guard because he can shoot the three. He
can rise above you. And he can get you on the block. He is a very hard match-
up.  
  
Q. Porter, offensively it seemed as if the ball movement was working,
ball fakes were effective. Was that an extra point of emphasis tonight against
a more athletic team, or is that the way things always go when things are
clicking?  
PORTER MOSER: Well, they're so athletic, and I know they run people off the
line. They're trying to get you to make the extra pass, extra pass, and they
cover so much ground. We kind of talked about it. That's what we've been doing
all year is making the extra pass and not just settling when they -- because
they really cover some ground with their length and athleticism, and they run
you off the line. They run you off that line. And we talked about not
settling, shot faking, going downhill, change it, change it, and that fits
into what we have been doing all year. I thought we really were moving the
ball once we got settled in after that first five minutes.  
  
Q. You've mentioned that time-out a couple of times. Right after that,
you insert Aundre into the lineup and he gets two great baskets and an assist
fueling a 6-0 run himself.  
PORTER MOSER: Aundre is one of the most selfless young men. Here he is, he was
sixth man of the year. Last year, he was averaging over 30-some minutes a
game. And we have a different look. We've got a freshman who's terrific, Cam
Krutwig, and they've been back and forth, different games, different nights.
But it gives us a different look.  
  
You come in with Krutwig, who is this true, big center, and then you come in
and we're small, but Dre is a mismatch guy. He's quick. He's a different look.
And that's been something -- he's really efficient. Again tonight, he had 16
points on seven shots. I said it up here the other night or one of the press
conferences people asked me about Aundre, and I said, I love guys that are
efficient. That translates from junior college to here, 16 points on seven
shots.  
  
I hugged him so hard on the floor. I said, man, hometown, going to the Sweet
16, family and friends here. God is good. And he just said, absolutely, and
just hugged me. I was really happy for him because we've trying to get him
back in Texas scheduling games, and for him to get a game back in Texas, two
like this and to do this, special for him.  
  
Q. What kind of shape was the program in when you took over, and how did
you manage to get it here?  
PORTER MOSER: It was tough. It was tough. I mean, you know, it's been a grass-
roots rebuild. Everything from a couple hundred people at games to during
games you could walk through -- I remember my family members said they would
walk through the student union, and there were more people in the student
union than in the arena.  
  
It was at the bottom of the Horizon League, which is a good league, and then
we moved to the Missouri Valley, and it just -- it's been a grass-roots
rebuild. And I'm blessed, so blessed that Loyola University, the
administrators, the fan bases, they were steadfast on how I was saying I was
going to do it with good kids, good people. We weren't going to bend on the
academic reputation.  
  
All our kids graduate. We've got high-character kids, and it was a credit to
them. And in this day and age -- because I know fan bases all over want it so
fast, they want it so fast. And it's hard. It's hard to have a rebuild because
you've got to get your kids in there that you recruit. And you're not going to
hit on the first recruiting class. Everyone was like, well, the second year
they'd better win. Well, the first recruiting class is freshman.  
  
So it takes time to get those kids where your recruiting class comes in, and
the older kids are like, this is how our culture is. And I'm blessed that the
University was -- had the same vision, and this is the vision. I said it so
many different places I spoke. I go, can you imagine getting to the NCAA
Tournament, advancing, can you imagine our University, Chicago, and I'm from
the Chicago area, and I just kept on pounding that vision.  
  
And I've had a great coaching staff. My coaching staff is an extension of
everything we're doing, and it isn't just one person. It isn't just me. It is
an absolute wide stretch of people at Loyola that has had that vision to do it
the right way with a good foundation of great kids, great student-athletes.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 69, Florida - 66  
  
CHRIS BEARD: I want to congratulate Florida on another great season. A lot of
respect for their team. Their coach at Louisiana Tech when I was at Little
Rock, I kind of looked up to guys like that who have won wherever they've been
and always got an opportunity. So he's been somebody I've always respected.
And then to compete against him tonight, it was as good as advertised.  
  
Definitely one of the toughest offensive teams we played against all year.
They had us so spread out. We were forced to kind of go small ball. Two of our
better players, Norense and Tommy, just kind of made a coaching decision. And
when you make those decisions, you hope and pray it works out because regret
is pretty tough to handle.  
  
It went our way tonight, a little bit of destiny out there. And Florida got
three great looks. We were just really, really fortunate.  
  
I think you've got to give our guys a lot of credit. We held them under 70
points. We had three guys in double figures. We had a lot of balance. Our two
young guys, Culver and Z, were big-time tonight, especially rebounding the
ball when we were forced to go small ball. So just really pleased to coach
these guys and to advance.  
  
We look at this kind of like a four-team tournament. We knew we had to win two
games to get to the regional, so now we've got a chance at another four-team
tournament to ultimately get to the biggest stage. But again, a lot of respect
to Florida, congratulations to them on a great season. And I'm really proud of
our guys for advancing.  
  
Q. I want to ask I guess Keenan, the fact that y'all have made this
journey together, y'all came in at the same time, new coaching staff, just
your feeling to be going to the Sweet 16 now.  
KEENAN EVANS: It's amazing. I feel like words can't really describe this
journey with these guys. And Coach Beard came in and said he was going to win.
And after last season, it was a disappointment, he told us we were going to
get to this tournament next year. We were going to make a run, and he kept his
word, and here we are.  
  
Q. Keenan, you've talked before about how every night is senior night.
How does that motivate you late in games?  
KEENAN EVANS: It's everything. As that clock runs down, kind of look at it
like, man, I don't want my season to be over. And these guys are the same way,
so we're just taking it into account that it's senior night.  
  
Q. Zach, late in the game you got matched up with one of your guards who
kind of had you on the perimeter, but you were able to get that block. Can you
take us through that play?  
ZACH SMITH: We were switching the whole game trying to stay in front, and I
knew I couldn't give up a three. And when he drove, just tried to make a play
on the ball, and I was able to make the play.  
  
Q. Keenan, I wonder if you can explain what happened on the alley-oop in
the last minute, how it got set up.  
KEENAN EVANS: Coach drew up a pick-and-roll play for me. Zach came out. The
guy kind of came out too hard, and I saw an opening, so I kind of split it.
And Zhaire, Coach told him to be waiting right there. I was hoping he would
make a 360 dunk again, but that didn't work out. I saw him right there, and I
threw it up, and he went up and finished it.  
  
Q. Keenan, besides yourself, Zhaire really seemed to take over the game
at times. What in the heck is this guy's upside as just a freshman?  
KEENAN EVANS: Man, it's -- he has no ceiling. Even after the season when he
works and he works even this week, he's going to be putting in more work, and
he's one of the most hardworking guys, and it's just shown all season.  
  
Q. Justin, Florida comes out and scores 23 in the first ten minutes, and
then in the second ten minutes, you hold them to only ten points. What changed
there?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Just being the more aggressive and disciplined team. That's what
Coach Beard preaches to us. Just making plays on defense and making them make
tough shots. If they make tough shots, then we'll live with it. But trying to
take away those easy shots, open threes, transition threes. I feel like we did
a great job with that.  
  
Q. Keenan and Justin, on a scale of 1 to 10, where was Coach Beard's
intensity tonight?  
KEENAN EVANS: Like any other game, he's one of the most energized people in
life. He told us y'all do y'all thing, and I'll get the crowd ready. And
that's exactly what he did. Every time we scored, you saw him on the sideline
going like this and getting the crowd into the game. So definitely thank you
to all of our fans for being there and supporting us because they were a big
help.  
  
JUSTIN GRAY: Yeah, just like Keenan said, his intensity is always great at
every game. He gets us going, and I think the most impressive thing he's doing
all that on still a torn ACL. I don't know how he does that, but it's
impressive to me.  
  
Q. Norense, y'all come out and go on an 8 and 2 run, and I think that
was the most excited I've ever seen Coach Beard. How was that feeling to get
the lead coming into the second half?  
NORENSE ODIASE: You always want to start off fast. When we took the lead like
that, it was special. They got it back, but we know it's a game of runs, so we
just stayed the course, and it ended up working out for us.  
  
Q. Keenan, your knack for hitting big shots in big moments, how has that
developed over time?  
KEENAN EVANS: Just my teammates and coaching instilling confidence in me to
take and make those big shots. Just putting in the work and staying confident
in it and knowing my team needs me to do that.  
  
Q. Justin, there were so many fouls in the second half. It was a very
clean first half. Then it seemed like there was a foul every possession. Did
that upset anybody's rhythm or getting in and out of your offense? It just
seemed like there were so many whistles?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Not really. You're talking about on the offensive end for us? We
were trying to be aggressive. We knew we were in double bonus early, so we
tried to make that statement in the time-outs to tell everybody get
aggressive, drive. We made a lot of great drives. And once they collapsed, we
pitched it to an open cutter or an open person on the perimeter. There was a
lot of things that went into it, but it didn't really disrupt us at all.  
  
Q. Keenan, Coach described getting to coach y'all seniors in the day
like getting the best enchiladas is the best feeling in the world. How does it
feel like getting another few practices with Coach?  
KEENAN EVANS: These four years flown by. Once you get to this point, it's just
like, man, I'm not ready for it to end. And here we are getting another week
to prepare and play the game we love.  
  
Q. Keenan, I know Texas Tech as a three seed is hardly a Cinderella, but
first Sweet 16 in 13 years. So what do you think the impact is on this program
moving forward?  
KEENAN EVANS: I think it's a great impact. It sets the path for many, many
more years. And with Coach Beard being here and his staff, just that sets up
success in the near future.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how important it is to get a game so
close to campus, being in Dallas?  
NORENSE ODIASE: It's special. We all have family from out here. Most of us are
from this area. It was special. It was like a home game for us, so that
definitely helped us tonight, and we used it to our advantage.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: My middle daughter Ella is the one that did it, too. She knows I
only have like two suits. It's one thing if it's like in the celebration, no
problem, but literally she just came over to me and dumped it. I'll talk to
her later about that.  
  
Q. Is this like a double patty, double cheese night?  
CHRIS BEARD: Man, are we going to keep going with this, guys?  
  
Q. How does this -- is this a program-altering win and what you're doing
at Tech in your second year?  
CHRIS BEARD: I don't think so. I understand, I respect the question, but we've
got a great University. And we've got big-time facilities. And we've got the
best fans in college basketball in my opinion.  
  
We're playing in one of the best conferences. This is what we should be doing.
A good season should be a good seed and making a run. Every year should be
NCAA Tournament.  
  
A lot of work went into this, but we're just getting started. I told the guys
before this ever started last Sunday, I guess it was, after the selection
show, I was like, look, there's 68 teams in the tournament. A lot of the teams
will just show up to be a part of it, and it'll overwhelm them. A select few,
the Kansases, the Michigan States, the Dukes, the Carolinas, these type people
will go to win the tournament.  
  
I was like, let's be one of those. Whether we're going to win it or not, a lot
of things have to happen, but let's be a team that embraces trying to win it.
We're not here just to have a good time. We're here to advance. So this was a
four-team tournament for us, two games, played against two really good teams,
so now we've got to get better and try to do the same thing next weekend.  
  
Q. When you guys played Koulechov when he was with Rice last year, he
dropped 25 on you, he had just 12 tonight. Can you talk about how well you
guys played with your perimeter defense tonight?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, number one, we were really fortunate. Basketball in a lot
of ways is a game of making shots. And all this stuff goes into it, the hours,
the work, but at the end of the day, also sometimes you just get fortunate.  
  
I thought he played great, and he got some good looks on us. The ball just
didn't go in for him. But I think you've got to give our guys credit because
we challenged shots. I think we spun them up a little bit and got aggressive.
That would be up to their coach to talk about, but we knew if this game got in
the 80s, no chance, start the bus. I guess at this level, start the jet.  
  
So we wanted to control the game with our offense, tempo-wise. So with the
game in the 60s and even at halftime, even though we were down one point, we
felt comfortable with the pace. We weren't going to beat Florida in the 80s or
90s, but we could play with them at this tempo game.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about the commitment you made to your
players that you were going to get the crowd ready. And two, I just look at
the tape of you tearing your ACL. What were you thinking and how has it
impacted you since then?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I'm not good at these double questions, man. I've got like
ADD. The last one was about the ACL. That's just embarrassing, set a flair
screen in practice the night before Iowa State. Then I had it all wrapped up
during the game and told myself I was just going to fake it, and then we had a
play, me and Niem Stevenson disagreed on something that was going on on the
court and I lost my mind. So it was really embarrassing. But I always want to
thank the people from Iowa because they didn't make that deal about it, great
basketball people in Iowa.  
  
What was the first part of the question?  
  
Q. Your players said you made a commitment to getting the crowd ready.
What did you do to make that happen?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I mean, way out of my comfort zone, really I'd much prefer
to sit there like a Coach Self or Coach Smith or Coach K, but ultimately I
think the job of any coach, if it was just a one-sentence answer in the
dictionary, you do everything you can to help your players win, win in life,
win on the court and off.  
  
So tonight I felt like we worked so hard to get this seed and play in Dallas,
so I got a little out of my comfort zone and kind of turned cheerleader a
little bit. But I want to thank everybody for responding. I know I must have
looked like an idiot a lot doing that, but anything to help our guys. I would
do anything to help our team, so maybe tonight in some small way, I helped get
the crowd going. I'll take it.  
  
Q. Midway through the second half when Chiozza picked up his fourth
foul, putting you in the double bonus, how did you take advantage of that
throughout the rest of the game?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, that was a part of our game plan. We always try to attack
the other team's best players. To me, he's the driver of their machine. He's a
special point guard. His speed is unmatched. We've seen a couple guys in the
Big 12 that parallel that, but nobody quicker. And he's a great passer, and
he's unselfish, and he can hit big shots, too.  
  
We made an emphasis to try to attack him on offense. Shot selection is one of
our core values and principles, but I told the guys tonight, you've got a
chance to be aggressive on their best players and maybe kind of will a shot up
there. I won't get on you like normal.  
  
But then I said, well, if I do, just remind me I said that. But no, we were
fortunate tonight that we got him in foul trouble and was able to play five or
six minutes without him on the floor. It just helped us because, simply
stated, he's one of their best players.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said that you were approaching this game as you had to
play your best game in order to get the win. Do you feel like mission
accomplished in that regard?  
CHRIS BEARD: In some ways, yes. I think they were superior to this game. I
just thought my naked eye 40-minute, we probably played 22-23 minutes as well
as we can play. Offensively, especially in the second half, we got the motion
going pretty good. We were getting back cuts and lay-ups. We were getting
fouls.  
  
I was really proud of our guys executing our motion offense in the second
half. And then defensively, we were just trying to hold on. It wasn't pretty,
but to hold Florida to 66 points, we had to do something right. So yeah, I
thought it was one of our better games.  
  
I just want to coach these guys another day. That's the bottom line, just
having so much fun with this group. Just want to have one more practice and
one more film session and one more travel, and then I'm sure when we get to
the next destination, we'll get greedy and want to do it again. But this is
all about just surviving and advance. It really is. And I'm proud to be these
guys' coach. I'm just glad we get to live another day.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Admiral Schofield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32856)

### [Grant Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34924)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola Chicago - 63, Tennessee - 62  
  
RICK BARNES: You know, it's always a tough way to lose a basketball game, the
buzzer beaters, but you know, we had the ball with a chance to tie it or go
up. We did. They had the ball with a chance to win it, and they did it.  
  
But I can -- again, congratulations to Loyola. Got a really nice basketball
team. But I am proud of our guys. They kept fighting today, found a way to
stay in it, and put themselves in a position to have a chance to win it, and
obviously a tough way to lose it, but again, congratulations to Loyola, and
we've got a lot to build on going forward.  
  
Q. Obviously a 15-6 start, they called a time-out, and the game really
seemed to flip from there. What did they do to adjust and change things at
that point?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: They started making shots.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We just didn't continue to play on the defensive end. We were
playing hard, but we weren't really playing smart. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Admiral, after you picked up the second foul and went to the bench,
how hard was it to get back in the groove? 11 points in the first four
minutes. Did you feel like you kind of cooled off?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: No, I wouldn't say I cooled off. It was just hard to play
physical like I do on the floor. That's just sometimes how the game goes. The
refs got to control the game a certain way, but credit to them. They got in
position, and the refs called what they saw.  
  
Q. Grant, what did you notice about not having Kyle out there? How was
the game different, and was it mostly on defense where you feel like that
showed up?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Yeah. He's a talented defender. He's our rim protector. We
missed him, but we had a lot of guys that could step up and fill that role,
but it's hard to win a game when you allow a team to shoot 50 percent from the
field. It's hard. Hard to win.  
  
Q. It's tough right now, but can you look at this season and still put
in perspective what you guys have done for this program?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, we've worked really hard, and the biggest thing is
we've brought some excitement around the basketball program again. Tough loss,
big shot. And for us, it doesn't define who we are. It doesn't define our
season. We did a lot of great things this year, but it's motivation. It's
something that we needed to happen, especially for our group.  
  
We've still got guys that are going to be returning. And for us, all we can do
is build on it. We got here. We got a little bit of taste of what it's like to
be here. And if we want to go further, we've got to work a little harder.  
  
Not to say that we didn't work hard, but we worked very hard, and just the
little things what goes into winning, we've got to correct and we've got to be
more consistent in that. And I think with this experience, it'll really help.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Yeah, what Admiral said. We did a good job this year when it
comes to putting kind of Tennessee back on the map, but it's really about just
coming back next year and being stronger because this team, we have almost
everyone returning. That's all.  
  
Q. When did you know Kyle wouldn't be able to go? I know it's impossible
to say exactly how it impacted the game, but how much did you miss him?  
RICK BARNES: Well, we weren't sure. We were going to wait right before the
game to see if he could do anything. It's not that we did a lot to get ready.
We did walk-throughs and what we normally do, just a shorter version of
everything. He couldn't do any of that, but he still tried to stretch. He
warmed up and couldn't do it. He's a difference maker. We can't replace him,
what he does at the rim for us. We can't.  
  
And I'm not -- again, I'm not taking anything away from Loyola Chicago because
they won the game. But you've watched us play all year. He's been a big part
of what we've done. We had these clips before the game showing the guys our
defense.  
  
And to be honest with you, when we walked out of the room, I said, maybe we
shouldn't have shown that because Kyle was involved in all of them. And he
does, and he's crushed because he wanted to be able to go, but he just
couldn't do it.  
  
Q. How tough was it down the stretch without any time-outs? How did that
affect your strategy?  
RICK BARNES: It was, but -- it was tough, but we had to use some a couple
times to try to -- again, Grant had to play a lot of minutes today and Admiral
getting in foul trouble early. The start of the game, we came out emotional,
playing hard, but our offense -- a question was asked earlier about what did
they do different. We took bad shots. We were making them play long
possessions on defense, and we would go down and jack up a quick three after
three or four seconds and come back and play defense again. So we didn't
really give ourselves a chance. Again, we were too emotionally charged up
there.  
  
But you know, I like saving time-outs, especially with teams. I do. I like to
do that. But I did tell them if they score, what I like to see us do, and to
be quite frank, we didn't do it, and I wanted to let the ball roll and set up
a play that we have. But again, they're young and emotional and those things
happen.  
  
As much as you talk about it and hope that you prep for it -- because Bone can
get the ball. He can cover some distance pretty quickly, but we didn't really
get a chance to do it the way we'd have liked to have done it, but he still
got it down there. But again, it's the emotional part of it because we guarded
it, and then they made a tough shot. But that's part of the game, guys.
There's players capable of making those kind of shots.  
  
Q. In the second half it seemed like they were really emphasizing not
letting Grant get the ball. I assume you wanted him to have it more than he
got it in the second half?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, but we felt -- at sometime or other, we didn't want
to just stand around and force feed it to him. He gets a lot of attention, but
we needed some other guys to step up and make some plays, as well.  
  
He played a lot of minutes, and we want to get it to him, but Grant did a
great job passing the ball. We knew they were going to double-team him. A
couple times they didn't, and he made a terrific play there to put us up there
at the end. But he was working to get it because then they weren't making it
easy for him. But I just felt like our guards early in the game, they were
holding the ball too long. They weren't moving the ball. They weren't moving
themselves. We wanted to drive for. You look at it. We kept talking about
drive the ball, drive the ball, drive the ball, and we didn't get enough of
that out of our guards.  
  
Like I said early, we took six or seven straight threes where that's just not
what we do, and it's emotion. I think it's emotion more than anything and
being, like I said, too, being a little too charged up.  
  
Q. What was your message to the team after the game?  
RICK BARNES: You know, they're crushed. We all are. But -- and I told them, I
said, hey -- one, I'm glad it hurts a little bit because sometimes I've had
some teams you wonder if it hurt deep enough. I told them once we step back
and decompress from all of it, we've done a lot, a lot more than certainly
what other people thought.  
  
But as a group, these guys felt they could win, and they're going to look back
on it in a couple weeks and realize that it was a special year, but it also
puts us in a different position. We won't be picked to finish 13th next year
in the league or 14th. I think we've been picked there three years in a row,
either 13th or 14th. So now that presents another challenge that we'll get
into later on, but right now -- and I told them, they've got to be proud for
-- and you know as much as anybody that the University of Tennessee needed
something good to happen to it, especially in the athletic department.  
  
I think those guys have created that going forward, and we've got some
wonderful student-athletes at Tennessee, some great programs going on, but I
think it was a great year for the University with its basketball team because
-- it was good, and I told those guys that. The way our fans got behind us was
special, and the fact that they shared an SEC title and came within a couple
seconds of getting to the Sweet 16. But like I told them, they've got to want
more. I told them -- we talked about what -- they know what our goals are, and
one of them will be to try to be in this tournament every year, something you
don't take for granted.  
  
I told them coming in here, trying to explain to them because they had never
been part of the NCAA Tournament. None of them had ever participated in it. I
said to them when the pairings come out, we didn't put up the board or any of
that stuff. We just talked about who was right in front of us. And I said,
I've seen, I think, everything you can see in terms of this tournament except
one thing, and that's a 16 beating a one. And I said, I don't know it'll
happen in my lifetime, but it's going to happen in yours. First thing they
said to me this morning, they said, well, Coach, I guess you've seen it all,
which I don't think I have, but I've seen a lot of these kind of games, buzzer
beaters, and it hurts.  
  
But one team hurts. The other team feels good and gets to go on. This team,
like Admiral said, we've got a lot of guys coming back, all but one, and they
can use it as a catalyst to want to get back here and try to go deeper and
further. It can be a good thing.  
  
Q. Just the free throws, you mentioned the guards weren't driving the
basketball like you wanted them to. Is that the main problem?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, we wanted to -- going inside is not just throwing
the ball to Grant Williams. I felt like the only time we really drove it hard
was the last play of the first half. Again, I told the guys when we were up, I
was telling the coaches, hey, everybody going into the game like they had to
get a shot off, and so we -- and we wanted to drive the ball. We knew they
were going to switch. They didn't really do anything that we didn't expect
them to do.  
  
But we just didn't -- we settled, and they would have let us do that all night
long if we'd have wanted to do that. But at the end -- but our guys, I'm proud
of them. They hung in there. We had to fight through it. We had to fight
through Admiral not playing well, Kyle obviously not being in it.  
  
But again, we came back, and that's what we told them, if we can just get the
ball back and make some plays on the other end, get the lead, put a little
pressure back on them, and Grant made a terrific move there, almost came up
with a great turnover, would have been a great turnover. But then they made a
pretty tough shot. They really did. And the ball hit and bounced and goes in.
But that's basketball.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Kevarrius Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33121)

### [Chris Chiozza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33167)

### [Jalen Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28465)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Chris and Kevarrius, your memories of Brandone Francis, do you have a
-- just going up against him, what did you think of him as a teammate, and how
ironic is it for him to be on the other bench when you guys are going to play
to go to the Sweet 16?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I didn't really know him that long. When I first got here, he
seemed like very energetic. He was always excited. Whether he was on the court
or not, he seemed like a very good team player. I'm excited to see how well we
do matching up against him.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, like he said, he always had a lot of energy. He's one of
those guys that always had something different to him. He was always amped up.
You could tell, he loved the game, and it meant a lot to him, and he was
always excited to be out there on the court, and he wanted to do whatever he
could as a teammate to help us and better himself, as well.  
  
Q. Chris, not sure how much you've gotten to see of Texas Tech or how
much you saw of the game last night, but how are you excited for the
opportunity to go against Keenan Evans?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I mean, he's another great point guard and a great player, so
any time you get to go up against a great player, it helps you elevate your
game. But you know, I'm not going to make too much out of that, play like any
other game, just go out there, run the team, do what coaches ask me to do, and
just make sure that everybody is focused and doing what they've got to do.  
  
Q. Chris, you being a senior, the point guard, and it sort of being,
quote-unquote, your team, how much like responsibility and maybe angst have
you had when it's been so much of a roller coaster, when the team has had
periods of struggling? How much did you feel like it was kind of up to you to
maybe get things back on course?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: With this team, we don't have just one person that's the guy,
you would say. We try to collectively come together as a team and lead each
other.  
  
But being the older guy, when we do have those times, I do feel like I have a
little bit more responsibility, you know, to try to figure out what's going on
and keep guys focused and get our focus back when we lose it. But like I said,
it's on everybody. We try to hold each other accountable. It's not just one
person.  
  
Q. Kevarrius or Chris, obviously you're in Texas, there are going to be
a lot of Red Raider fans here. They kind of filled up the arena last night.
Just the challenge of going through a road environment, and how much can you
draw from maybe some of your experiences in the SEC beating Kentucky at Rupp
Arena in terms of dealing with that?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I feel like we've played better in our away games. We come
together knowing it's all of us on the court, the coaches, and everybody else
on the staff. So it's going to feel like pretty comfortable playing against a
crowd that has their fans backing them. It's going to be a good game for us. I
feel like it's going to be.  
  
Q. Jalen, kind of a similar question to what I asked Chris, which he
didn't want to answer that much about, it being about him, how much have you
seen him be kind of the leader of the team? He kind of deflected that, but is
he kind of the guy that keeps everybody together and your chance to play with
him this year, what's that been like for you, and if you answer nicely, he'll
probably give you a lot of passes tomorrow?  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah, definitely. He's definitely been one of our leaders. Like
he mentioned, it's been a lot of us leading. I feel like he does a lot of
leading by example, bringing his own energy, playing defense, picking up full
court, making extra pass, things like that, know what I mean? So yeah, he's
definitely been very helpful for us, a big part of our success.  
  
Q. Back to the question about the crowd. A lot of Red Raider fans there
yesterday. Did you get to see the crowd before you guys got in there before
your game at all, and what are your thoughts on this basically being a home
game for them because they've got six guys on their team from Dallas?  
JALEN HUDSON: I didn't really get a chance to see the crowd. I could
definitely hear it. It seems like they'll have a lot of people there. The fans
really can't do anything for them on the court. We'll have to bring our own
energy. I still feel really good about it.  
  
We played some really good, tough teams at their place and were able to come
out with a W. So I feel really good about it. Like I said before, I don't
think their fans can do anything to help them on the floor, so I think we'll
be fine.  
  
Q. Chris, Texas Tech sort of all season has been slowing the other team
down, getting them fatigued and crashing at the end and finishing the game
off. How do you guys not let them set the tempo and play your transition
offense that you like to play? What's your strategy in setting the place early
four your team?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: We've played teams like that before that want to slow us down.
We're just going to start on the defensive end and get our offense going and
get some stops and get out in transition. That's the main thing, just we're
not really worried about the offense too much, just we're focused on the
defensive end, and that's where it's going to get us baskets on the other end.  
  
Q. Any one of you can answer this if you want. The SEC is off to a
pretty good start in the tournament. You did very well yesterday. You've got
you and Tennessee both here. I wonder if you could give your thoughts about
the league, maybe its national reputation, how much you think it improved this
season, any other thoughts that you have? Let's start with Jalen.  
JALEN HUDSON: Yeah, the SEC is really tough. I don't really think they get a
lot of credit. It's a very physical league, and the way they've been calling
the games have been very physical, and I don't think a lot of teams in their
conference have even been used to it. That's one thing I noticed coming from
the ACC. It was like a completely different game, and I think the SEC teams
were more adjusted to it.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, like he said, the SEC is a very tough league. It's shown
that the last couple years. Every year has gotten better, and they put more
and more teams in the tournament and more and more teams are going deeper and
made longer runs than they've done in the past. It just goes to show you how
good that conference is from top to bottom.  
  
A lot of it has to do with the physicality and the athleticism and a lot of
that goes with the coaches that are in the league. They don't get a lot of
credit, as much credit as they should, as good a job as they do with the teams
that they have.  
  
Q. Do you take a little pride in that, with what's happening right
now?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, I mean, a little bit. Just a little bit.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Anxious to get after it a little bit, and first and foremost, get
a good long stretch, have our guys feeling a little bit better about their
bodies. Competitive game last night, of course. Anxious to move on. It's an
honor to be here. It's an unbelievable tournament. It's a great experience for
our guys. Really pleased with the way that we played last night for about 36
minutes, and not necessarily the way that we finished, but beat a good team,
and we've got a huge test in front of us against a Texas Tech team that's had
a great, great year.  
  
Q. Mike, in addition to dealing with all their talent and their guards,
they're going to have a sea of red in here, probably 14,000, 15,000. You've
dealt with road environments before in the SEC, but kind of the challenge of
that and having to deal with the crowd, and how do you think you can respond
to that and draw from what you went through in the SEC?  
MIKE WHITE: Well, definitely there's no advantage to it for us, obviously. But
we've just got to deal with it, and we've done it before. I don't think any
team in the country is more battle-tested than we are over the last two years,
considering what we had to go through last year with the renovations to
Exactech Arena. We've played a ton of games away from home. We've played a ton
of neutral site games, of course, and in this one I thought Chris Chiozza made
a good point last night, this will be comparable to the Gonzaga game, which we
didn't get any computer favorability for, unfortunately, but that was a road
game, and tomorrow will be a road game, as well.  
  
It will be a great environment. It will be a great environment. But I'm more
concerned with defending them and finding a way to score against the third-
ranked defense in the country.  
  
Q. It's not like a Florida and Texas Tech have any recent history. The
last time they played, Bill Koss was actually a freshman --  
MIKE WHITE: Wow, a couple years ago.  
  
Q. What was your immediate impression of Texas Tech's backcourt from the
film you saw?  
MIKE WHITE: It's funny, I hadn't had a chance to see them play. You follow
scores, and of course you know Coach Beard has a role in it. Of course, they
have had a great year. I just hadn't seen them live a bunch during the season.  
  
If I'm not watching an SEC game, I'm probably tuned in to the Blue Devils and
a couple other teams. More than anything, Keenan Evans is terrific. Their
freshmen, where do they come from? My goodness, the years that they've had,
their freshman class is big-time. They've got a good mix of those guys, along
with Keenan and some older guys, some good seniors. Athletically, they've got
good pieces of some big, physical guys, some good guards, some length,
athleticism.  
  
I think their team speed is as good as we've played all year, which helps them
in transition offense and defense. The way they changed ends of the floor is
top-notch. And then overall, as I mentioned, figuring out a way to score
against these guys could be our biggest test, third ranked in Kenpom.com. They
don't have any deficiencies defensively. They're good offensively. They're
going to be hard to guard. But man, do they lock you up. Chris has got these
guys really defending and playing really, really hard.  
  
Q. How have you seen Chris evolve since obviously he was there when you
got there? This year with the team sort of being up and down, do you think
he's felt more responsibility when things were struggling? He mentioned that
he thinks there's a lot of leaders on this team, but is he really kind of the
key guy, and do you think he's felt the burden maybe of trying to get things
right when things were not going right?  
MIKE WHITE: I think to a certain extent. Chris is a quiet leader. He's a
leader by example, and we have a few of those guys. Our most demonstrative
guy, our biggest communicator, is Kevarrius Hayes. We just have a bunch of
really introverted, quiet guys. Kev and Jay have heard it all year, and they
know it. It's a unique group in that regard.  
  
We've got really, really good guys just -- we've lacked that overall edge. And
Chris has been challenged by myself and our staff all year, and he's been
challenged by his teammates, as well. He's become a little bit more vocal.
He's trying to get out of his comfort zone a little bit. He's just not a big
extroverted guy.  
  
That said, though, when he says something, our guys lock in, and they continue
to challenge him to step up and be more and more vocal because they want it
and they've expressed that to him in team meetings. What he says goes a long
way, especially with our younger guys.  
  
Q. As far as this team, this was kind of a team in transition with the
lineup, I guess, some new guys kind of getting mixed in. How much was Chris
kind of involved with trying to make everything fit together?  
MIKE WHITE: He's been great in that regard. I mean, it's such a luxury to have
a point guard, like last night, he gets 11 assists and zero turnovers. He's
our best defender. He's on the all-SEC defensive team. He's held it all
together. And I would say if he is 1, 1A would be Egor Koulechov. Those guys
have been constants for us, and Chris has helped it all come together to a
certain extent. And we were -- we added a couple pieces, of course, in Egor
and Jalen and some freshmen, and then we were without a few pieces that we
thought we'd have.  
  
And to be able to count on Chris night in and night out has been given us a
chance on most occasions, of course. I know the narrative with us is that
we've been up and down, and I've been open and honest about that all year.
We're not hiding from that.  
  
We've been -- we've looked like a top ten team at times, and we've looked like
an NIT team at times. But Chris also has -- the year he's had has allowed this
team to -- despite the inconsistencies, to do a lot of really good things,
too. I beat these guys up all year, but at the end of the day, Chris and his
teammates led the country in top 25 wins with six. I think we finished sixth
in the quad one runs. And here we are in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament again.  
  
I'm really proud of Chris. I'm so happy he's my point guard. He's had a great
career, and I'm most excited that his legacy will forever be that he had a
good career, and he had a really good senior year in addition to the shot. It
wasn't just about the one shot.  
  
Q. The SEC started 5-0 in the NCAA Tournament this year. There's been a
lot of talk about how the conference has improved, but what does it mean to
prove it in the tournament, too?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I just think it -- I just think it proves it a little bit
more. Hopefully it sinks in nationally what this league is capable of, how
this league has grown from top to bottom. And there's teams that aren't in
this tournament that are really good.  
  
It's a talented league. It's a deep league. A bunch of really good players, a
bunch of really proud fan bases, and I think it'll only continue to grow. I'm
anxious to see how we finish with this tournament. I think that the league
night in and night out in this tournament is going to continue to show people
how good we are.  
  
Q. You discussed their defense; what in particular stands out about
Texas Tech's defense that makes them hard to score on?  
MIKE WHITE: Team speed, length, athleticism, and we've played a lot of teams
this year that you watch on film, and you say, guys, in talking to your team,
this guy is really athletic. They've got like five of those guys, and they've
got veteran guards. They play really hard. Again, their team speed -- and
their interchangeability, they've got versatile defenders that they move
really well, and so they do more switching in their man-to-man probably than
any team we've seen this year, and they're able to not only get away with it,
but they're able to flourish in it, making teams stagnant at times, taking
teams out of their actions at times, because they've got front court guys that
can lock up guards, and they've got guards that can defend in the post.  
  
And they wreak some havoc, too, with getting in passing lanes and having
active hands and turning it over, and that's where they're incredibly
dangerous is those pick sixes, getting out in transition offense off of
turnovers.  
  
Q. Texas Tech try and slow you down, wear you out and kill you at the
end. How do you keep it from getting into one of those half-court games?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, and transition offense. We'd like to get quick, open shots
or late open shots. We want open shots, but we want them to -- we don't want
them to be out on transition offense, either. That transition game, we'd like
to win. I don't know that we can plan on definitely winning it because of the
team speed factor. That's where they're really, really good.  
  
But our floor balance has got to be great. We've got to set our half-court
defense to have a chance, and they grind you out offensively, too, à la
Arkansas and Tennessee and South Carolina, where they're in constant movement,
and some of their defensive numbers probably are helped by the fact that they
wear you out a little bit with the ball in their hands. They've got five guys
cutting, and they can all pass, dribble, shoot, and they're all screening, so
they're going to test our discipline defensively, as well.  
  
And if we can get stops, hopefully we can get out in transition. And if we've
got something early, we'd like to take it, but again, we've been there before.
Loyola Chicago did it to us to start, and it seemed like a bunch of people
figured that out. We don't want to play defense for 80 percent of the game.
We'd like early quick ones, but we've got to be choosey. We've got to make
good decisions in transition offense, as well.  
  
Q. Keith yesterday nine, eight rebounds, three blocks. He was obviously
the premier scorer last year, but how has he developed into being a tougher
player that you kind of need inside?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I agree with you. I think he's gotten a little tougher. He's
still really young with understanding how big and strong he is. I'm hopeful
that a couple more off-seasons you'll see a finished product where he can be
more of a balance inside out guy, or outside in or however you want to term
it.  
  
But 90 percent of his game right now is facing up. But he's got such a gifted
body in strength, and I liked him attacking the rim a little bit last night,
of course. It was a little bit different matchup, a little bit less length in
there, and he was able to have a little bit of success. So he's still growing
in that regard.  
  
Q. We talked about how this is kind of a quiet group of guys, but you
have Kevarrius Hayes who's very outgoing. How valuable is that to the locker
room culture? What's he bring to the team in that element?  
MIKE WHITE: You know, when I talk about us being so quiet, I'm more so talking
about in-between the lines. Kevarrius might be our most extroverted guy in the
locker room and at the apartment or what have you, social settings, team
dinners. We have four or five guys other than him that'll cut it up a little
bit, too. Our guys got strong personalities, and they're fun to be around.  
  
He, though, more so than anybody else has become the guy that challenges
others. When his team loses a drill in practice, we try to make everything
competitive, of course, every day in practice. And he's the one guy that has
learned to hate losing, and he makes it known, and he'll call a guy out, hey,
that's not acceptable.  
  
Even when he maybe has messed a play up or he hasn't played to his ability,
he's our most competitive guy on a daily basis, and that I think overall has
made us a little bit more competitive. Again, we're not the most competitive
team. We're not the toughest team. But this team has really grown in those
regards. I've talked a lot about that, how much better we are defensively
today than we were four months ago and on the glass and how much grittier we
are, and without Kevarrius bringing that presence, I don't think we grow
nearly as much in that area.  
  
Q. Staying with Kevarrius, in the half-court defensive set, they like to
penetrate, 36 points in the paint last night, what kind of challenge does that
present for Kevarrius?  
MIKE WHITE: A lot, a lot, Kevarrius, Dontay Bassett and Gorjok Gak, Keith
Stone and Egor Koulechov, there's going to be a lot of pressure on those guys
to defend without fouling. Texas Tech lives at the foul line, lives at the
rim, not only with penetration and with post touches, but they're one of the
best cutting teams that we've played this year. Good passing team, to be able
to facilitate to those cuts, I think the speed and quickness allow them to be
a good cutting team, as well.  
  
So our anchors on the interior have got to be good. Positionally we've got to
be really sound, and then we've got to play physical, but legal at the same
time. I know our guards got to help them by trying to do the best they can, by
not getting face cut, back cut, and then of course containing penetration.  
  
Q. I know you were telling Deaundrae not to dunk at the end of the game
last night, but what's the value of the experience of the freshmen getting in
the games at this stage?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I talked to Drae today, and he had no idea. He hadn't been
told that before. He hadn't been in that situation. He told me that he had
seen a clip that somebody maybe had Tweeted where I was going crazy when he
was about to dunk it, but I say, hey, I'm not mad at you, you're a freshman,
you'll figure that out, but in terms of sportsmanship, we don't need that one.
But he said the dunk felt good. Happy that he got his name on the scoreboard.  
  
But it's a great experience. It's great experience. I thought he provided some
decent minutes. I thought Mike Okauru was really good, really good. He made
some timely baskets for us, and I thought he was really good defensively, as
well. We're not playing as many freshmen as Texas Tech, but I think any of
these type experiences, especially NCAA Tournament experiences, for your
younger guys can only help continue to grow your culture as a program.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Clayton, you mentioned last night the three-pointer. I think a little
bit tongue in cheek, said this is just because Ben always knows where I am or
something like that. But I'm just curious, you guys have obviously gone back
through your childhood, but what is the chemistry you have, and are there some
moments where you do feel like there's some connection out there that you
can't explain?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, I mean, we've talked about it a lot. We joke about it in
the room. A lot of times when I come off pick-and-rolls and stuff, I won't
really be able to see him because there are people between us and stuff, but I
know he is back there somewhere. So I will throw it over my head over the
defenders to him and stuff, and it's just situations like that. I think we do
such a good job of feeding off each other.  
  
I think it's kind of -- people feed off our energy when we're playing well
together, sharing the ball. It's kind of -- everybody kind of starts doing the
same thing, and we're able to get the ball moving, spacing it, one-mores, and
people feed off that energy. Me and Ben have been doing that for our whole
lives.  
  
Q. Clayton, does Coach have like a 24-hour rule or whatever as far as
after a game to say, okay, if you win, celebrate for 24 and then forget about
it? And I assume maybe now it's more like 12. And what's it been like since
the end of the game? Did you look at the shot a lot? Is it something that it's
been kind of hard to not spend a lot of time looking at it or getting away
from it?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, Coach does a really good job of keeping us focused. So
last night he wanted us to enjoy it. He wanted us to enjoy the moment because
he knows that that's something that we all have looked forward to our whole
lives for a moment like that.  
  
But last night, we sat down, we got in the film room and we were watching some
film, just so that we could kind of stop thinking about the past and kind of
move forward towards Tennessee. And then now that we woke up today, I mean, I
think we're kind of done celebrating yesterday. We've moved on, and now we're
ready to go to try to beat Tennessee tomorrow.  
  
Q. Clayton and Aundre, I think you guys might be able to help me with
this: Have you studied the history of Loyola enough to consider whether the
1963 championship team was maybe the first Cinderella that the NCAA ever
had?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, the 1963 team did a lot more than -- they transcended
the game. They were the first team to start four African-American players, and
Glory Road gets a lot of the movie, the Texas Western team, gets a lot of the
popularity or whatever that everybody knows about that, but a lot of people
don't know about the 1963 team.  
  
So I mean, I guess in a way it was a Cinderella, but that team was really
talented. They had a lot of really good players. But aside from that, I think
it was amazing that Coach Ireland recruited all those guys and brought them
all to Rogers Park, and that team is an inspiration to us.  
  
And we definitely know about the history of Loyola basketball. We've spent
time with the 1963 team. They come to our games. They were at our last home
game this year, and they've told us all the stories from back when they
played.  
  
So I mean, they're a really good team, and they're an inspiration to us for
sure.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: He covered it all.  
  
Q. Aundre and Clayton, as older guys who were recruited after your first
stop coming out of high school, how would you describe Porter as far as a
recruiter and his pitch to you, and what stood out about him in the way that
he kind of presented it to you?  
AUNDRE JACKSON: I'd say his vision. He kept on preaching culture, kept on
preaching family, just the direction that the program was going. He's an
honest person, so he never told me that I would have a cookie cutter. He
always told me I had to work for what I'm going to get and work for my spots.
So just that honesty and the culture aspect and just the family preaching has
just helped me get here.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, like what Dre said, I don't know, just his passion and
his energy is the first thing that you notice with Coach Moser. He always
brings it every single day, and even when he first -- the first time I ever
actually talked to him in person, he actually came out to Ames after I decided
to transfer from Iowa State, and I got to eat lunch with him.  
  
You could just see it in his eyes how much he really cares about this program
and how much he really wants to be great. And that was the first thing that
stuck out to me. He's definitely a really -- like you can see it, I think
that's why he's been able to get a lot of good players into this program. He's
a really good recruiter because you can just see how much he really cares
about it.  
  
And then also -- I don't know, the culture part is a big part. You want to be
around good guys. You know he's going to recruit character guys. You know it's
going to be a program where you're going to fit in and feel comfortable.  
  
Q. Clayton and whoever else wants to answer, whether you win by 26 like
Tennessee did or you hit a buzzer beater, does any of that matter come
tomorrow night, or does it?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, I don't think it matters now. I mean, we both got a W.
And now we're moving on to the next one. I think we can play better than we
played yesterday, so I think that's a good thing. We kind of got that first
game under our belt now, and now we feel a little bit more comfortable. Just
playing on the court, the feel of the ball, all that stuff. I think we'll feel
more comfortable out there shooting and everything.  
  
I don't think it matters how much we won by. I think we're going to get on the
scouting report and do whatever we can to try to get a win tomorrow.  
  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Yeah, I don't think it really matters obviously. They won by
a large margin of victory. And we won on a last-second shot. But we're just
going into tomorrow playing like we played against Miami, obviously. We know
we're not going to lay down for them. We're not going to be shocked because
they play in a better conference or they're a high major or anything like
that.  
  
We respect them, and hopefully they respect us, too. And we're just going to
go out there and play like we normally play. And once that ball gets tipped
up, we're just going to play hard and set the tone with them.  
  
Q. After Tennessee's game, I talked to one of the Wright State players
about Tennessee's defense, and he said they've got a lot of long, quick, big
guys, which a lot of teams have, but they really get after it defensively.
That's what he said, that that's what kind of sets them apart. They're one of
the best defensive teams in the country according to Ken Pom.  
Is that something you can really see from film, or until you guys get on the
floor tomorrow, is that going to be something that you may have to kind of
adjust to during the game depending on how they come after y'all?  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: We're used to playing against size, but we was watching film
earlier, and they try to block shots, so just a lot of pump fakes, a lot of
eyes to the rim, and we will get them out of stance and out of position, and
then it'll be easier for us to score.  
  
Q. Clay and Aundre, you guys have been here a couple years and you've
played in front of Gentile crowds that there weren't that many people, but I'm
sure you saw the video of Damen yesterday, so what's it like seeing the buzz
around your team grow on campus?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, that's when the cool -- one of the really cool parts
about being a part of this team this year is that we've kind of created that
buzz around the University and around campus and around all the whole
community.  
  
They've started to come out and support us, especially towards the end of the
year where we started to get big crowds at Gentile, and to see those videos of
'63 and Damen and Schreiber downtown and the Bulldog, everybody was in there
and they were going crazy when we won.  
  
I think everybody -- a part of every college experience, everybody wants to be
a part of that. It's something cool. It's something that we've seen growing
up. They pan to the University and everybody is going crazy on campus. We got
to experience that yesterday, and it was really cool.  
  
AUNDRE JACKSON: It's a great feeling. After we beat Florida, we got a little
bit of buzz, but as we kept on winning and winning our conference, winning the
conference tournament, the fan base increased, and then winning the game
yesterday was amazing. It was a lot of videos on Twitter about people that
wasn't even in Chicago, like Las Vegas people that was watching the game and
everybody just screaming and yelling after the great shot. So yeah, it's just
nice to have a good fan base.  
  
Q. Clayton, could you just kind of reflect on your path from growing up,
Kansas household, outside Kansas City in Overland Park, to that year at Iowa
State, and then finding your way to Loyola, how did all that unfold?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah. So I grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, and I played with
Ben. We went to Blue Valley Northwest. And I started to get recruited in high
school, and it was mainly like by a few Big 12 schools.  
  
I ended up deciding to go to Iowa State at the beginning of my junior year.
And then when I ended up getting there, I enjoyed the experience a lot. It was
fun being there, and I'm glad I spent that year there. It was a good
experience for me.  
  
But I mean, it just didn't work out. And that's kind of how sometimes this
works in this business and stuff like that. I have no hard feelings towards
them at all. It just wasn't the right situation for me, so I decided to make
the move.  
  
When I decided to transfer, it's obviously kind of a scary situation because
you don't know what your options are going to be and who's going to give you
another opportunity. Coach Moser and Coach Gordon were two of the first
coaches to call me right when I got my release, and that meant a lot to me,
that they were really serious about giving me another opportunity.  
  
Like I said, Coach Moser came out to Ames actually to eat lunch with me, which
was awesome. And he actually went to see my family, too, in Overland Park.
That was right off the bat, like I kind of knew that me and Coach Moser were
going to have a good relationship. And then also, add in having my best friend
from high school on the team, as well, and having the opportunity to play with
him again in college, not a lot of best friends get to play Division I
basketball together. I thought it was too good of an opportunity to pass up.  
  
Q. Cameron and Lucas, as younger guys, what was your first impression of
Coach Moser's style, hands-on style and how aggressively he does coach all the
time?  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: Well, when I first got here, the first thing that I really
noticed was his energy and his passion. The way that he coaches is something
that I'm kind of used to coming from Chicago and the way -- the style that we
play in Chicago.  
  
So it wasn't really hard to get accustomed. It was just the speed and how
everything -- he wanted everything to be so detailed. I think that's really
helped me throughout the year.  
  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Well, one of the main things that lured me to Loyola was just
when I came down for visits and things like that, just kind of the family that
he preached and all these guys just being great friends. You know, that
culture that we always talk about, he just kind of introduced me to it. And in
high school, I came from a program like that where we had a lot of culture and
we did things the right way, and at Loyola obviously we do things the right
way.  
  
And Coach was always telling me that he had a vision for me and that if I came
to Loyola, we could do some big things. With these guys, we've got a lot of
pieces, and I just like the guys a lot, and Coach's vision, and obviously it
all worked out.  
  
Q. Lucas, how has your state championship experience helped in these big
moments as a freshman?  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: I think just that path, that whole state championship like
run has really helped because of I kind of got used to, okay, win a game, put
it in the bank, focus on the next opponent, and that like next opponent, next
game mentality is something that we've really bought into all year, and
especially postseason, and Arch Madness and March Madness.  
  
PORTER MOSER: You know, our thoughts have been Tennessee and how big and
physical they are, how much -- how balanced they are. They've got side.
They've got speed. They've got shooters, and they're well-coached. The guys
really enjoyed the moment last night. It was great here. Leaving the arena, we
got back, we kind of just decompressed with a team meal with each other, and
then our coaches went to work. We let them get some rest, and we went to work
and got our minds focused on Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, in that situation, are you one of those coaches with kind of
a 24-hour rule after victory where you say, hey, give them 24 until the next
game, and obviously this is a different situation with a different game. Was
there any kind of a different approach to try to make sure that they kind of,
like you said, enjoyed the moment, but then kind of start resetting to play
Tennessee?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, like if it was a regular season game where you know you're
not playing the next day, we have a 24-hour -- you let them. But last week at
Arch Madness and the thing, you have to get moving. You play the next day.  
  
For this, it's kind of the same thing. You can't prepare yourself, especially
at Loyola, for the national scope of what happened last night. These guys are
back in their hotel room watching themselves all night. The social media was
berserk.  
  
I'm one of those guys where I wanted them to enjoy the moment. I mean, this is
how hard they've worked for it, and I can do that, because I said this
yesterday or two days ago, it's a mature group.  
  
Then we went back talking about Tennessee's personnel. This morning we had
some meetings, some film, and every time that it's time to do business and do
that, this group is completely locked in.  
  
You know, we decompressed at the hotel a little bit with a team meal last
night. And our coaches, we went right at it. We went right back and moved
forward, put it in the bank, and now our thoughts are to Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, so this moment and everything that comes with winning a NCAA
game the way that you did and just winning it, period, when you were a
31-year-old head coach, Division I program in Arkansas, Little Rock, did you
think it would be easier or come sooner, and do you look back at that guy at
that time and think, boy, you've come a long way, or how do you reflect on
that?  
PORTER MOSER: You know, I haven't really thought about that, that long of a
journey. I've just thought about the -- I've taken over rebuilds, complete
rebuilds. This rebuild at Loyola has been a grass-roots rebuild.  
  
I really haven't reflected on that. I've just reflected on how far and how
great it is for the University, what kind of group I have, and I'm listening
to the press conference with Donte Ingram, and I know this because I know how
good a guys these are. But he makes a comment about any one of those guys in
the locker room could have hit that shot. I was just fortunate enough to be
the one Marques passed to. What a humble, great thing to say for a 21, 22-year
old in that moment right there.  
  
That's who they are. They share the ball. They're humble. They're high quality
kids. We've got an unbelievable parental support system. Our parents of these
young men are first-class. And I was reflecting on -- I'm blessed to go
through this journey with the guys in our locker room. And I said that early
-- like first week of the season, and now we're here, and that's what I was
reflecting on.  
  
Q. Are you still the official darlings of the NCAA Tournament, or did
Buffalo steal your Thunder?  
PORTER MOSER: No. Damn Nate Oats and Buffalo. I said that this morning, gosh
darn it. I was happy for them. But it is truly -- you don't try to think about
that. You don't. I mean, it's fun to joke with it. But I heard Lucas say the
term -- I love when players regurgitate what you tell them. We've been talking
about put it in the bank, put it in the bank, because we've been doing that
for a while now because we've had to, especially when we were on that
proverbial bubble, which we weren't really in the bubble. Put it in the bank,
and that's what our guys said last night. We got that one, now we've got to
move on. They're looking at it like we're still chasing. We're really chasing
for another one.  
  
Q. But do you believe in destiny?  
PORTER MOSER: Sure. Why not? Why not believe in it? We've all watched the
tournament. Crazy stuff happens, March Madness. But it just doesn't happen by
daydreaming about it. You're not going to compete against Tennessee just
daydreaming about it.  
  
I mean, you're going to have to play physical. You're going to have to box out
every possession. You're going to have to guard the post because they have
some of the best duck-in players in the country. We've got our hands full on
things we've got to prepare for yourself.  
  
I think people that just think and daydream about destiny and all this, it
becomes fantasizing. There's a lot of things we've got to get ready into this
game plan and then produce and do in this game to compete with Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, Clayton talked about when he had decided to transfer from
Iowa State, you visiting him, having lunch, that sort of thing. He hadn't
played a whole lot that freshman year, but what did you see in him, and did
you envision the kind of upside that he's displayed at Loyola?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, 100 percent. I'd seen him in high school when I recruited
Ben Richardson, and just -- I loved their program, where they come from. They
won two state championships together. I saw how character -- so I saw him play
and the program he came from and win, as we had signed Ben.  
  
And then when he became available, I remember right away, we got his release,
and it was game on. There was -- I don't know if I've ever -- it was the foot
on the gas pedal. We envisioned him having this kind of impact on us. That's
the kind of player that I saw in high school and I saw with Ben, and it's been
really cool to watch those two. Like he said, you don't get to really have
your best friend play this level with him, and it's really cool.  
  
Q. Porter, I talked with Grant Benzinger, the leading score for Wright
State after they lost to Tennessee. He talked about the fact that they're so
long, they're quick, they've got all the physical attributes, and a lot of
teams have that. But defensively they just get after it, and a lot of teams
don't do that.  
From watching them on film, what do you think of them defensively, and will
it be something that you can really tell from film or until the guys get out
there and realize how strong and physical and quick these guys are, is that
going to be maybe a bit of an adjustment?  
  
PORTER MOSER: Well, we've -- they do get after it. Tennessee does. They
contest every shot. They really do. They do not want you to get easy shots.
They really -- they're long. Their guards are put together. I mean, they're
really a physical team.  
  
You know, we've played big teams in Florida and Miami, so the size -- these
guys have -- Donte and Ben have had three years of Wichita State, which is a
ton of size. So they've seen it, but you make a great observation. They've
been really at a high level on both ends. They're efficient. They don't beat
themselves. They're efficient on both ends. There's a reason why they're that
good.  
  
But you really -- I think the thing that really impresses me is how
fundamental Williams is posting up. I mean, he is the best duck-in guy in the
country. You show me a better guy that ducks in, and in the words of Rick
Majerus makes and maintains contact. He makes and maintains contact when he
ducks in. I've just been really impressed with his fundamental in ducking in
and posting up.  
  
Q. With Clayton and Ben, what is it like coaching guys that have played
together since third grade? Do you have to say anything to them sometimes? Can
they communicate without speaking?  
PORTER MOSER: They've been -- you can get on them. You know when -- they just
get it. But I'll share with you when you asked me what it's like to coach
them. I'm going to tell you a story that happened last week at the Missouri
Valley Tournament. We won the game, the final game, so we're going to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
We had an hour-long celebration on the court. Then we had to go to the locker
room. We had five minutes to adjust our team. We said a prayer, talked, and
then we had to go to the press conference. So we're walking to the press
conference, and I'm walking behind them, and it was the coolest moment. They
both had their hats on, Valley Championships, they had nets coming out of the
side, and they're just walking next to each other and he goes, man, can you
believe this, we've won since we were in third grade. They're just hitting
each other back and forth like, can you believe this, we won a state
championship, now we're going to the tournament. It was the most genuine
little-kid moment of two grown guys just sharing it like, man, we've been
winning our whole lives. I'm just walking behind them like, man, I'm blessed
to coach these two. They're winners on and off the floor, and it's been cool
to coach them.  
  
Q. What are you going to need out of Krutwig and Aundre tomorrow to go
up against Tennessee's big men?  
PORTER MOSER: 15 rebounds apiece. That's what I'm asking. They're rebounding
-- we don't see it from four out of the five -- like they crash four guys. We
were pushing the pause button. They box out on the offensive side. They box
out to get the offensive rebound.  
  
So we're going to need a tremendous effort on the glass. We're going to have
to have a tremendous effort post defensive wise. They pound it inside. They
duck you in. You've got to do your work early in the post. You just can't sit
there and let them just post you up. So we're going to have to have the best
rebounding and post defensive effort of the year tomorrow.  
  
Q. Before Rick Majerus, who were your greatest coaching influences, and
have you ever had to temper your hands-on style either during a game or
practice to regather your poise?  
PORTER MOSER: Another one of my biggest mentors in my life is my college coach
and who brought me into this profession is Tony Barone, Chicago guy. He was my
college coach at Creighton. I coached with him six years at Texas A&M. He was
high energy, as you can get, passionate. And I spent ten years with him.  
  
He left me a message. He was at our game when we clinched -- when we won the
Missouri Valley championship at home, when we got presented the trophy. He
lives right near Loyola campus, still a huge influence in my life. But no
question Tony Barone was a huge mentor of mine.  
  
Q. Have you studied history enough to have an opinion on whether Loyola
was the first Cinderella in the 1963 championship season?  
PORTER MOSER: The first Cinderella? I've studied history to know about all --
the game of change and the four African-American starters, but the first -- I
would have to guess no, if you're asking me, because there must be another
Cinderella out there. Was there?  
  
Q. I would argue they might have been. If you look at the list, you
might be able to make the argument. I don't know. It's an interesting
question.  
PORTER MOSER: It is, because I -- you look at all the programs that won
National Championships. There's not -- I don't think there's more than 40, if
someone knows the exact number. But Loyola Chicago sticks out. Like Loyola
Chicago won one? So that year, that year was such a monumental breakthrough
for so many things. I guess I've always looked at that as so much more of a
breaking segregation, the game of change, that I really haven't thought about
them being a Cinderella because it was Loyola Chicago, so it was interesting
to think like that. But that team is -- obviously means a lot to us and to
what it was all about back then and the game of change.  
  
Q. Very quickly, another thing I wonder about is if the term Cinderella
based on the social implications just kind of cheapens the whole thing because
of what we think of Cinderella today?  
PORTER MOSER: Yep. Yep, I agree.  
  
Q. Can you kind of trace your recruiting of Aundre Jackson? Is he just a
guy that slipped through the cracks for other Power Five schools?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, you know what, I love guys that are efficient and get it
done. He's a get-it-done guy. It doesn't bother -- he's an undersized guy.
I've had a lot of -- I've had like three all-league players that are
undersized. I had Montel James. Christian Thomas was 6'5". Now Aundre Jackson
is 6'5".  
  
I think sometimes coaches get into that mode where they hear the voices from
outside, whether it's fan bases and recruiting services, and God, we need a
big, we need a big. He's a two-star. He's a three-star. None of that matters.
There's a lot of guys that'll take -- well, we need this 6'9" guy and the 6'9"
guy can't do anything.  
  
Aundre was second in the nation in field goal percentage. That's a stat that
translates, your field goal percentage. He shot like 64 percent at junior
college on a team that went to Hutchinson, Kansas. I watched him play there a
couple games against a team that had like four or five high-major guys, and he
had 26 points. He had a knack to scoring the ball against bigger guys. And
when we signed him last year, he was top three in the country in Division I in
field goal percentage. It translated right to Division I, that field goal
percentage.  
  
So I love get-it-done guys, and we watched him. So 6'5" post player scared a
lot of people off. It doesn't bother me. I like get-it-done guys, and he's one
of them.  
  
Q. Who did you have to beat for him?  
PORTER MOSER: A lot of schools that were at our level. There wasn't a high
major school on him. It was a lot of schools at our level recruiting him.  
  
Q. Years ago when I was at Marquette, I had the good fortune to
interview Rick Majerus. He was nice enough to give me time to help me with a
journalism project I had, and I'll never forget him telling me one of the
biggest challenges when it came to recruiting was keeping kids, whether it was
kids from Milwaukee or wherever, keeping kids from the city in the city or
getting them to come to Marquette, a city campus. How tough is it getting kids
from Chicago to stay in Chicago?  
PORTER MOSER: When I got the job seven years ago, we're Loyola of Chicago, we
had one Illinois player on the roster. And we had not one Chicago public
league player in a 10 or 12-year window. That's amazing to me. Think about
that.  
  
Probably David Bailey was the last. It was like 11 or 12 years, and we
convinced Milton Doyle, who was a highly ranked player from Chicago to come,
and everybody knew Milton in the city, outstanding first-team all-state
player. And I think people are like -- and if you asked Donte, he'd say the
same thing, Milton went there, I'll check it out.  
  
And we had to grass-roots recruit coaches, parents to come to our campus. Our
campus is absolutely gorgeous on the lake, and they've put so much money in
redoing it, and we had so many people from Chicago, myself included, that when
we got in and walked our campus, they said, I had no idea this was here,
tucked up on the north side. So we started it just grass-roots bringing
people. Then we got Donte, then we got Lucas Williamson, and it started with
Milt.  
  
Young people, it wasn't cool to go to Loyola. They hadn't been winning. They
hadn't been on campus to see it. The people that advised them hadn't been on
campus to see it, so we had to really grass-roots the whole thing. And I think
people are saying now, hey, you know what, Milton Doyle graduated and got a
great degree, and his friends and family saw him play a ton.  
  
You look at Donte Ingram, he's going to graduate in a couple months with a
great degree from Loyola of Chicago. Donte has an entourage at all the games,
all the games. And I think it's becoming something where -- I think staying
home now and playing in front of family and friends, because at times people
will say, man, I want to get away. I want to get away.  
  
We're in a great part of -- we're right on the lake tucked in. We've got 6,000
students live on our campus. It's a great setup. It's a setup I think we can
really snowball into bigger and better things, and I think more and more kids
in Chicago are looking at Milton Doyle, Donte Ingram, Lucas Williamson and
looking at, you know what, I can stay home, get a great degree, have friends
and family see us. And now they can add the piece we're in a great conference
and we have the ability to win that conference.  
  
Q. Porter, for years you've been going to freshman orientations and
begging students to come to games. What's it like seeing the celebrations in
Damen and the student centers and the bars around Chicago and seeing all that
work pay off?  
PORTER MOSER: Absolutely awesome. To watch -- what he's referring to is the
freshmen have an orientation, and they break it off into six groups throughout
the summer, and I'd run between basketball to speak to all the friends and
family and beg them to come to games. I've been doing that for years.  
  
To see that aerial view of Damen student center last night gave me chills. It
was just nuts. They had a celebration at the business school, at the student
center, at Ireland's, all around. They had student-athletes. I saw the
softball team. I saw the track team all having watch parties. That's what you
want. That's what up want in a student body. I told them it can help their
experience getting behind it.  
  
It meant so much because of the efforts I've put in to connect with the
students and to get them to buy in, to see their excitement over our run meant
a lot.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Keenan, I was hoping you could talk about your journey over these
four years, how important it is to be here and how special it would be to
advance.  
KEENAN EVANS: This journey has meant everything to me. Like I say in every
interview, just being at the bottom of Tech basketball and now it being at one
of the highest points and being part of a team that can pretty much make
history is unbelievable.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, how do you feel like just getting through the
first game, just kind of feeling through your emotions and getting that first
one, how important is that so when you get the first one you say, all right,
now we can just kind of roll through it?  
TOMMY HAMILTON: That first one felt good, man. That was my first tournament
game, and it was my first taste of it to see what it's like. It was ugly, but
we got it done. I think that we're aware that most of the games like this
tournament is going to be like that, so we're preparing to come out and play
our best game tomorrow, and I think we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Jarrett and Norense, when you see Keenan, obviously he has nights
like last night, 0 for four in the first half and then he comes back in the
second half. Talk about how you know he's going to come through, and what was
it like those few games you were without him this year?  
JARRETT CULVER: We just trust Keenan a lot. So we put the ball in his hand at
the end and he came through this season, so just trusting him at the end to do
what he does. He's proven to us that he can be trusted. Two games without him,
we knew we were going to have to play hard, and we just did our best to try to
win those games.  
  
NORENSE ODIASE: Just like he says, we trust him, put the ball in his hands, he
makes plays all year long. Those games without him, obviously we struggled,
but just glad to have him 100 percent now.  
  
Q. How much more intense was that game last night than the stuff that
you normally play in the Big 12, if any, or was it about the same? What was it
like?  
JARRETT CULVER: I feel like it was very intense because if you lose, then your
season is over. So we wanted to keep going, and the first game is really
tough, so we just played our hardest. And we knew if we lost, our season was
going to be over, and we didn't want that.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: Just being in a conference like the Big 12 kind of prepares you
for those types of nights. Tournament is kind of a different atmosphere, but
being in the Big 12 prepared us, so we've been working at that and we've been
talking about finishing, and that's one of the big parts of that game last
night was finishing at the end.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON: Yeah, like Keenan says, playing in the Big 12 prepared us for
games like last night. And I think also it was just a part of our identity
that showed. We've been down big at half in games and came back and won and
been down with a minute to go, came back and won, so it was something that
we've been doing.  
  
NORENSE ODIASE: Like they all said, the  
  
Big 12 sets you up pretty well to be able to play in these games. Just like
Jarrett said, there's a little bit of added intensity because it could
potentially be our last game, so we just brought that to the table, and we
wanted to play hard.  
  
Q. Keenan, just reflect on coming out of Richardson because you weren't
the typical four or five-star recruit that everybody was after, but about the
path that led you to Texas Tech, and when did you first realize that I've got
a pretty high ceiling and I can make a lot of things happen out here?  
KEENAN EVANS: Just in high school, just putting in all the work, not being
really touted as a four- or five star motivates you every day, and I feel like
that's how this team is just with our name. We're not Kentucky or Kansas
across our chest, and we have to go take everything we want, so that's just
been my motto all my life, got to go take it instead of -- can't let it be
handed to me, I've just got to go get it.  
  
Q. Guys, just each one of you, kind of talk about how important it is to
get off to a quick start against a Florida team that has a lot of depth to it,
very tenacious on the defensive side, and to not kind of find yourselves down
three points going into the half.  
JARRETT CULVER: Starting off the game is very important, just starting off
strong and attacking and trying not to get down is very important for us, so
it really sets the tone.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: Yeah, last night we didn't get off to a good start, so this game
will be big for us to get off to a great start. We're kind of flinging the
ball everywhere and not doing what we practiced, so getting off to a great
start is very important in this game.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON: It's not about how you start. It's about how you finish.
That's all I've got.  
  
NORENSE ODIASE: It's huge. Whenever you can get through the first game, I
guess some jitters are gone. We know what we're used to. We're back in the
tournament. We can kind of not relax, but kind of settle down into it, see
what we did last game, what went wrong to start that game, and just watch the
film and see how we can get better for this game.  
  
Q. Keenan, take us through when you hurt your toe. Talk about what that
felt like and just how difficult was it for you to try to push through it, and
then where are you at right now with that? Are you 100 percent, or is it
adrenaline or what?  
KEENAN EVANS: It was tough to overcome just because I felt like I was letting
my team down in a way, but I felt like it wasn't my fault, and also it's just
not 100 percent, and I still battle with it every night. Just the support and
confidence given from my teammates helped me make it through every night, and
the trainers staying up late and working throughout the day to just help me
feel better is greatly appreciated. I'm definitely still working on getting to
100 percent.  
  
Q. Have you ever had anything like that before?  
KEENAN EVANS: Not really, not this bad.  
  
Q. Jarrett and Keenan specifically, with the way that Florida just --
they kind of volume shoot threes, several of those guys do, I know you guys
have played good three-point defense all year long, but how about maybe in
this game specifically is it so much more important to keep your rotations up
and be on everybody that's on the line outside?  
JARRETT CULVER: They're a great team. They're a great shooting team, as well,
so we just try to focus on trying to take that part away in a way, so just
focusing on that and our defense turns into offense, so just making sure we
take that away.  
  
KEENAN EVANS: In the tournament, they always talk about threes is what beats
you, so we've just got to be more urgent getting out to that three-point line
and not fouling them on three-point shots and just try to take away what they
do best.  
  
Q. Keenan, can you describe the mindset of maybe taking over a game like
you really have in the second half, and part of that, I don't know if you
watch the NCAA Tournament, if you looked at other players that took over their
team and had great runs in the tournament?  
KEENAN EVANS: It's just, in my mind every night is a senior night for me, so I
don't want to lose, I don't want to go home yet. And as time ticks down, it
just putting more pressure on yourself. If we lose, I feel like it's all on
me, so I just try to do what I can.  
  
I saw some highlights, I think with the Houston game, the guy took over and
just kind of amazing to see other players do it, too, and you're like, I want
to be that guy for my team, whether it's just on the defensive end or the
offensive end.  
  
Q. Jarrett, just kind of talk about how surreal this experience has been
for you because this time last year you were finishing up with the Coronado
Mustangs and now you're sitting up there on the stage. How exciting has this
been for you?  
JARRETT CULVER: It's a blessing to be here most definitely. I am glad to be
here with my team. We set a goal from day one since we started. So just glad
to be here, made March Madness, and we're just trying to do something in it.  
  
Q. For Keenan or any of the guys, the feeling of the crowd last night,
because it was packed with just two Texas teams and just the crowd was
cheering for both, and what are you expecting tomorrow as you guys get back at
it again here?  
KEENAN EVANS: I'm expecting even more fans tomorrow, just because it's a
Saturday, and it's at a pretty good time. Just Raider Nation, I'm hoping they
show up and show out and help us come out with a win.  
  
TOMMY HAMILTON: Same as Keenan said. It was a great atmosphere. It was fun to
be a part of, and we kind of knew there was going to be a lot of people here
since we were not that far from school, and the alumni base is huge in Dallas.
We hope to see you guys even more tomorrow.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Just pleased to advance. You know, really proud of our players.
You work so hard, and these games are so hard to win. They really don't define
a season. A lot of really good basketball teams, championship basketball
teams, will leave this tournament at some point, but for us, it's just a deal
where we want to try to live another day as a team that enjoys being around
each other in practice and games, so we just feel fortunate to advance to the
second round.  
  
Our respect for Florida and their program and their coach couldn't be any
higher. This is one of the best offensive teams in college basketball, the
three-point shooting. They're a really good defensive team that gets a lot of
steals and turns you over. And a coach that's one of the best coaches in
college basketball. His teams play hard. They don't beat themselves.  
  
I think they've been to the Elite 8 like the last four or five times they've
been in this tournament. They have our full respect and full attention.  
  
From our standpoint, we think we're going to have to play the best game of the
season tomorrow. That's our approach, and that's our objective.  
  
Q. Could you just speak more to Florida and the way they volume shoot it
with several of those guys from behind three? I know you guys have been good
with three-point defense all year, but how this game might be one of the most
important as far as three-point defense?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, every team in this tournament has a different offensive
identity. And I think it would be safe to say that one of the big parts of
Florida's offense is the three-point shot, both in transition and in the half
court.  
  
So that's going to be a lot of work for us. You've got to kind of pick your
poison. If you try to take away the three-point line, you open yourself up for
drives or inside play. But if you sag back, they're certainly a team that can
beat you with that one weapon. That's something we've got to figure out. I
don't have the answer right now, but I've just got to have to by tomorrow
evening.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Davide's game last night, and
considering the pressure of the situation and the size of the stage, did it
look to you like maybe he's beginning to come of age?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, we really like Moro in our program. We think he's going to
be a great player, highly recruited guy, took some visits to other BCS
schools. I think when our team, Jarrett Culver and Zhaire Smith have gotten a
lot of attention this year for having outstanding freshmen years, which they
should. Culver is a great young talent as well as Z. But I'd put Moro in that
same class. He is just a guy that is kind of waiting his opportunity. Coming
from Italy and being an international player, he played for his national team
this summer, which did not allow him to come to Lubbock for off-season
workouts in the summer and conditioning. The first day that he played was
basically the first day of school. He took a huge adjustment to get used to
the athleticism and physicality of college basketball versus international, so
he's just been trying to keep up.  
  
We have always had a lot of confidence in his talent, his game and his
basketball IQ. He has made some big plays for us this year. He's won four or
five Big 12 games himself with key plays he made down the stretch. It was nice
to see yesterday all his hard work and all the confidence that we have in him
within our program help us win a tournament game yesterday. But I think Moro
is going to be a special player.  
  
Q. When you got to Texas Tech, you had a point guard in Keenan who was
going into your junior year. Can you kind of explain how he's developed his
game and developed as a player to become the guy that you guys kind of look
for to close out games?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, absolutely. I think the first thing you've got to recognize
is Coach Tubby Smith and his staff recruiting Keenan, investing time in him as
a freshman when they didn't have the best of records, but Tubby had a plan,
and Justin and Zach and Norense and Keenan were getting playing time. As a
sophomore, Keenan is the starting point guard on an NCAA Tournament team, the
first tournament team at Texas Tech in over a decade since Coach Knight was
the coach and I was there with him.  
  
And then I think you've got to give our staff some credit for putting him in
some situations offensively where it built up confidence in him, allowed him
to do things, expanded his game a little bit. Thirdly and above all, not even
close, you've got to give Keenan all the credit. The Keenan Evans story is not
me or Tubby. It is Keenan Evans. This guy self-made himself into one of the
best players in college basketball, and I can tell you how he's done it. He's
done it with a lot of work. He's in the gym every day. He's in the film room a
lot. He's a guy that's changed his body in the weight room.  
  
To me, he's everything good about basketball college when you think about
four-year players staying and grinding. I think Keenan will play in the NBA.
The courage he's shown here in the last month with his toe issue to still play
at this level in the kind of pain he's in, I've never coached in the NBA, but
I know those guys look for the intangibles, and that guy's middle name is
intangible. I've never coached a tougher guy than Keenan Evans.  
  
Q. From a baseball analogy, is he kind of like Mariano Rivera for you
guys as far as at the end of a close game, you put the ball in his hands, he
finds a way to either get fouled or finish at the basket? Those finishes he
makes look easy, but those aren't easy plays he's making, right?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, he's a special player. You know, we kind of take what the
game brings to us in terms of finishing. There's different ways we can go, but
certainly Keenan is our point guard, our leader. He has courage to make those
plays in those moments. He wants the ball late. He's earned the right to be in
those moments throughout his career, the ups and downs. So certainly, yeah,
he's one of our better players, and we absolutely want him involved late in
games.  
  
Q. Two quick questions about Keenan. The first one, just how different
was this team during that stretch, though, when he was really hurt? When he
hurt the toe at Baylor and the next two games he really wasn't himself and
then the third game he didn't play?  
CHRIS BEARD: In my personal opinion, a little bit too much has been made of
that. We're playing in the Big 12 Conference, and we're on the road at West
Virginia and at Baylor, and then we've got Kansas. Y'all might have heard of
them. We got them at home.  
  
So I think the relationship between Keenan being out for a little bit and
resting a little bit and us dropping a couple games, obviously that's a
factor, but you also got to consider the other factors.  
  
That stretch also allowed us to learn some things about our team. Other
players were given more minutes and opportunity, and I think that will only
pay dividends -- it paid dividends yesterday, seeing Moro and Niem and
Brandone Francis make big plays down the stretch. So there's no question
that's affected our team.  
  
But everybody in this tournament is affected by something. There's not one
healthy team in this tournament completely. There's not one team in this
tournament that's not overcoming some type of adversity. We've chosen not to
make this an excuse and just keep writing our book and see what happens.  
  
Q. Quite often he has a big second half, and you've seen it time and
time again this year. Is there anything you say to him at halftime, you just
kind of know he's capable of doing that, and I don't have to say much?  
CHRIS BEARD: No. I mean, at this point I listen to Keenan a lot more than I
talk to him. Certainly he's a more aggressive player, the bigger the moment,
but he also does a great job at the point guard role trying to get people
involved early.  
  
I grew up, to me the greatest player ever was Michael Jordan. I grew up in
that generation, no cable TV, but you could watch his game on WGN. He would
always get aggressive as the game goes on, too. Keenan is a floor general.
He's a guy that can play the point guard no doubt, but he can score, which we
need him to do.  
  
Q. Chris, Rick Barnes was in here talking about recruiting and
developing players and stuff. He said, I want to get old and stay old,
speaking about his players. How hard is it trying to balance that, trying to
recruit four, five a lot of repick guys but four-year and three-year guys and
try to have a great team?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, it's definitely a challenge, but I think each program has a
philosophy. Each program has a way they go about it. We are looking forward to
being in the neighborhood of one-and-dones and consistently being able to
recruit top 25, top 30 players. That's where our program is heading. We want
to coach the best players. We have a University and a program that I think
will attract those kinds of guys.  
  
But we also want to balance with developing players. Back in my day, it was
Ronald Ross and Jay Jackson. Now you're seeing it firsthand with Keenan Evans
and Zach and Justin. Coach Smith and those guys started it. We've tried to do
the best we can finishing it. I think there's definitely a balance between
developing players within your program, but also trying to recruit the best
talent you can.  
  
Q. Your high school coach, Mike Kunstadt, was in the stands last night
supporting you. What's your relationship like with him?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I've been very fortunate in my ride as a player and coach,
and something I'm really proud of is I played for two Hall of Fame high school
coaches, Mike Kunstadt at Irving High School right here in the Metroplex, and
Terry Priest, who was also in the stands last night, from McCullough High
School in North Houston Woodlands. My relationship with those two guys is as
important to me as any.  
  
I'm always associated with Coach Knight and Pat and those guys, and I'm very
proud of that, but I'm also very proud of my relationship with my two high
school coaches. Coach Kunstadt taught me about discipline at a young age. He
taught me the pyramid of success with John Wooden, taught me how to put my
socks on without getting blisters, taught me how to play basketball without
dribbling the ball. And then certainly Coach Priest was a guy that believed in
defense and discipline and team basketball. So some of the things that you see
in our teams today are a direct reflection of those guys, Mike Kunstadt and
Terry Priest.  
  
Q. Mike talked a lot about your defense and how proud he is of that
because he feels like he maybe instilled a little bit of that in you. Would
you agree with that?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, that was the only way I had a chance getting on the floor.
Growing up in Irving, I wasn't the most athletic guy. So I learned early on,
you take a charge that makes Coach K happy and you stay in the game. I would
take a lot of charges. But no, that's something I learned from those guys. I
think a lot of programs around the country, they talk about defense, but they
don't live it.  
  
I've said before you go to a high school or junior college practices and you
see the backup people shorts, defense, and then you watch a two-hour practice
and they don't work on defense at all. With us, we talk about it and believe
it. In our 90-minute practice today, we just went over for 70 of the 90
minutes. That was something that started long ago with Coach Kunstadt and
Coach Priest.  
  
Certainly on our staff, Mark Adams, one of our coaches does a great job.
Simply stated, Coach Adams is the best defensive coach I've ever seen. And
that is no disrespect to Coach Knight or Coach Kaspar or all the coaches I've
been around. Mark Adams has a way about defense, and it's been a big part of
our team, our identity, is the work that Coach Adams has done on our staff.  
  
Q. Seems like Zach Smith has really worked his way back from injury and
had a really good game last night. What has he brought to the team?  
CHRIS BEARD: Just like with Keenan, Zach is probably the story nobody is
talking about, and I will because I'm proud to represent Zach and his family,
and be his coach. Zach has been voted to be a preseason all Big 12 player, one
of the top five players in the Big 12, and that's why the coaches in this
league -- and I couldn't vote on my own player. So the other nine coaches in
this league thought Zach was one of the best top five players in this league,
so that says it all.  
  
Zach gets hurt early in our Big 12 season and basically is not a part of our
season really until senior night. So for him to play the way he has in the Big
12 tournament and the way he has in the NCAA Tournament yesterday, I don't
know if I've ever seen a more courageous effort. He obviously doesn't have his
legs and he's trying to get used to the basketball side with the shooting and
the skill, but he's just playing on pure heart right now. But his rebounding
and defensive rim protection last night, he made a big three in our opening
win, I think it was against Texas, in our first-round game. So Zach is just
playing on pure, like, heart and courage right now.  
  
But he, too, is a guy that's got a great future in pro basketball because of
his talent and skill and work ethic, and for us to overcome his injury this
year and be sitting here right now as one of the last 32 teams speaks a lot
for our other guys. For Zach to come back and be able to contribute at this
high of a level just speaks for him and his heart.  
  
Q. Quick question on Brandone Francis. I know he was only at Florida for
a year, but did he give you any insight into anything Florida does offensively
and defensively behind the scenes?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, of course, this happens in coaching from time to time. We
were going over personnel this morning, and we just asked B, do you think
we're right here. And so, yeah, of course, that's kind of a thing that happens
sometimes. Another thing in this game is we played against their power forward
who played at Rice last year. Rice gave us all we could handle. We know how
good he is. He's actually one of my favorite players watching play and stuff.
Yeah, we still talk about his shot fake today. We call it the Rice shot fake.
Now we'll call it the Florida shot fake. But they've got some great players on
this team.  
  
Some of the things that we've seen them do are some of the things that we
believe in in basketball, so we look for a great game tomorrow against a team
that we have nothing but respect for.  
  
Q. Coach, how many teams do you think commit to defense the same way you
do, and why don't more?  
CHRIS BEARD: I don't know. I can't speak for other people. I just know my
coaching journey starting with Coach Kunstadt and Coach Priest all the way up
to my first college job with Danny Kaspar when I was in college with Tom
Penders played defense, pressed, caused turnovers. There's different ways to
play this game. But I learned a lot about competitiveness from Coach Penders
and guarding. Those Texas teams guarded. And if you thought otherwise, then
you just weren't on the inside.  
  
And certainly with Coach Knight, the basis of everything we did was man-to-man
defense. Our Little Rock team was a great defensive team ranked nationally in
the top ten all season long. And that's certainly been what we've tried to get
done this year at Texas Tech.  
  
Playing in our conference with this talent and coaching, it's hard to stay up
in those rankings, but we do stay focused on defense, but I can't speak for
what other people do. I can only speak for what we do. And in our opinion, we
think defense is the key to championship runs.  
  
Q. I know you probably took a lot from Bobby Knight when you were
working for him. Was there one quality more than any other you took from him,
and you don't do the facial expression thing he did, do you?  
CHRIS BEARD: No, I don't have that whip he had. Yeah. I never get tired about
answering these questions. One thing was preparation. Everyone in college
basketball, especially in this tournament, wants to win. Every player, every
coach, we want to win. But it's the people that will do anything to prepare to
win. With coaching, it's just a different level of preparation.  
  
I mean, in this tournament, I saw coach watch practice tape from the day
before. This was his commitment to preparation and watching study, studying
film. I think a lot of people want to win, but coach wanted to prepare to win.  
  
I also think just the commitment to graduating players, Coach was always
talking about so proud of the former players and his graduation rate, what his
guys were doing. I'm really proud of that, too. We had five seniors last year.
All of them graduated. And these guys we're watching right now, Justin, Zach,
Niem, Tommy, Keenan, they're all going to graduate in May. Really proud of
that.  
  
Some of them are already working towards their graduate degree. I learned so
much from Coach Knight, but probably the commitment to academics, and it
wasn't just an APR deal there on paper or something you put in an article. It
was real. Coach wanted everybody who played for us to graduate. He cared about
that, and that's something that's really important to me that I hope in some
way we're emulating.  
  
Q. I've heard you mention your love of Whataburger several times. When
you go, what do you get, and if you don't go to Whataburger, where else do you
go for a burger?  
CHRIS BEARD: That's the only thing, on this Whataburger ride we're on, there's
a lot of other places, too. But Whataburger is a great place. I think
breakfast, we go taquito. If my girlfriend is not with me or my daughters,
I'll go extra cheese. During the day, I'm pretty easy, it's just a one,
mustard, pickle cheese only. I'll go with the milk shake. Another thing I
learned from Coach Knight, a root beer milk shake. I almost got this at Sonic
one time with Coach. The lady is like so you want a milk shake with root beer
in it? No. I want a root beer milk shake. You want the root beer to substitute
the milk? No, I want a root beer milk shake. That is when Coach Knight and I
were on I-20 going to I think to Rockwall High School on that one.  
  
But no, back to Whataburger, I do enjoy a milk shake, but I never substitute
that as my drink. Even in the days where I didn't have much money, and I'm
very fortunate now, I'm blessed, I would never be the guy that substituted it.
I would go ahead, man, I've got to get the unsweet tea, and then I get the
milk shake, too.  
  
Another great thing about Whataburger, too, have you ever been to Whataburger
at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning? Don't go through the drive through. Go in next
time, and just get a corner booth and just watch America. Just watch it.
You'll see so many cool things at Whataburger. You will see a guy pick up a
tab for somebody else. You'll see somebody clean up a plate that wasn't his.
You'll see some of the bad things in America, too, at a Whataburger late, but
I love people watching, and that's one of the many things I do.  
  
Q. I want to ask a Whataburger follow-up about Keenan Evans. What would
Keenan Evans be on the Whataburger menu, if you can figure out what that is?  
CHRIS BEARD: That's a tough one.  
  
Q. I know it's a tough one.  
CHRIS BEARD: Back in the day, you could say stuff like this and your players
would never see it. But today, they see it before I see it. You've got to be
careful. Yeah, I don't know. We've got Moro on our team this year. Moro coming
from Italy, he loves pasta and cheesecake. We try to incorporate that into
every pregame meal.  
  
Classic Moro style, he had been in Lubbock for about 4 or 5 days and he came
to my office, he is a quiet guy, Coach, can I talk to you. He said, Coach, you
don't like those. Normally something is going on. You don't like those. I
said, Moro, come in. He's like, Coach, everything is good, apartment, coaching
staff, language, no problem, academics, I got it, but the fuel the body part,
Coach, because that's what we call the nutrition, fuel our body in the
process, too much chicken strips. Do we eat chicken strips every meal? Is this
America? So we've tried to get away from the chicken strips a little bit this
year and go with pasta and cheesecake for Moro.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Q. Admiral and Grant, I don't know if you guys spent much time looking
at stuff last night, but obviously Loyola had a last-second victory. Did you
guys see any online video of the shot and what did you think about it?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, I was actually at Shake Shack watching the shot. It
was a big shot, and Ingram, who hit it, actually played against him in high
school. He went to Simeon downtown. It was a big shot for him, but really for
their program.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'd say the same thing. It was a terrific shot. Got a
good look, and they're a talented team. They move the ball well, and it was a
competitive game, so I was actually watching it with a couple of teammates in
the hotel room. It was kind of exciting because March Madness, and you kind of
get hyped up for it. It was a good shot.  
  
Q. So he didn't invite you to Shake Shack?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Shake Shack isn't my thing.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, he don't need that. We're going to keep Grant away
from Shake Shack.  
  
Q. If you weren't playing Loyola, would this be a team you might be
rooting for in this tournament?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I'd say so. You like teams like these, the ones that fight all
odds and compete, and that's something that you love. Like we're a type of
team like that. Not many people chose us. We're fighting for the same thing
they are. If we weren't playing them, you'd kind of get excited and you kind
of enjoy March and the madness side of it. But really, we've just got to focus
on the game and play our game.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah. Like he said, most of the times in March Madness, a
lot of people pick the underdogs. They want the underdogs to pick the bigger
schools, just like Buffalo and Arizona last night, teams like that. The
biggest thing about March Madness is anybody can go on a run, and it's about
chemistry and executing and really what goes into winning, people playing
unselfishly and sacrificing for the team and for the greater good. The biggest
thing for us is continue to play hard. We don't have as much talent as other
schools, but we have people that work hard and are willing to go out and do
their jobs consistently. For us, we've just got to continue to do that.  
  
Q. Kyle, Grant sort of brought it up a little bit, but you guys have
been the underdogs all year long. We've asked you about being picked 13th for
months now, and tomorrow you're going to be the bully against a team that is
the underdog. How does that mindset work for you?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I mean, yeah. So you know, like when you've been the underdog
the whole year, you kind of carry a little bit of a chip on your shoulder, and
it's kind of a little bit of a motivation for your team to kind of just do
what you've been working on all off-season and all season.  
  
But just like yesterday's game and just like any other game in the season,
it's just a regular game that we have to go out and we have to work on keeping
our identity and being who we are and playing our Tennessee defense and just
going and playing our basketball. We can't look at it any other way, you know.  
  
Q. Admiral, you touched on this just a little bit just now, but do you
think parity is changing, the definition of a Cinderella, and what is your
definition of a Cinderella?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, the biggest thing is in a Cinderella story, it's
teams that people don't expect to come out and compete against the big dogs. I
mean, I don't believe in a Cinderella story. I believe anybody can be beat. It
just makes a buy-in from a collective unit, and like for us, I would say we
were picked 13th, and the biggest thing for us was we didn't think we were
13th.  
  
When you have that collective group believing in something bigger than
themselves, you can do anything, especially when you put the work in. And when
you put the work in, eventually you'll reap the blessing of it.  
  
So for us, I would say that -- I mean, me personally, I don't believe in
Cinderella story, it's just who wants it more in that aspect.  
  
Q. For the two Jordans, do you guys expect it to be like a road game,
kind of the arena against you guys tomorrow with Texas Tech and Florida fans
cheering for the underdog and trying to get Loyola?  
JORDAN BONE: Yes, I would imagine that the atmosphere would be leaning towards
Loyola. Like Kyle mentioned, simply because they would be considered the
underdog in this, and during this time of the season, that's who people often
root for. I mean, I would imagine that the atmosphere would be like that. It's
kind of been like that the entire season for us, though. I mean, our backs
have been against the wall. We're just ready. We're ready to play tomorrow.  
  
JORDAN BOWDEN: Yeah, like Bone said, Loyola has a lot of fans out there and a
lot of people going against us, but we've just got to go out focused and be
ready for them for tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Admiral, growing up in Zion near Chicago, I was just curious what
were your perceptions of Loyola? Were they ever on your radar screen as a
possible destination?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Yeah, they were. They recruited me out of high school, and
in the summers, we would play a lot of Summer Leagues up there, so I would be
in the gym a lot. It's a really nice school downtown, but the biggest thing
for me was I wanted to get out of the cold and snow. I got tired of shoveling
every winter and all that, so I wanted to get out. But I love going home, love
the deep dish pizza, love being downtown and going to Millennium and all that.  
  
It's pretty cool to be able to play against a school like that growing up,
them being right 20 minutes away from the house. But at the same time, I'm
really focusing on playing hard for Tennessee, going out and giving my all for
Tennessee.  
  
Q. Admiral and Grant, I don't know if you saw this, but Loyola has a
98-year-old nun praying for them. How can you guys compete against that?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I don't know. I feel like she's aggressive. You know, she
pushes the ball up the court. (Laughter). But she's super nice. I saw her on
TV. We respect that, and we just -- to have that around is something special,
and you just love it at this time of the year.  
  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, for us, that's hard to compete with, a 98-year-old --
but we have our traditions, as well, but we're just going to go out and
compete.  
  
Q. Kyle, you mentioned a phrase we have to be Tennessee, not let outside
stuff affect us, play our game. How much better have you guys gotten at doing
that this year, just focusing on yourselves and not worrying about the
opponent?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I think a lot better because we were relatively young, you
know, last year, and we got some experience. This year, we've never been a
team that when we went places, we sold out stadiums and stuff like that. We've
been through a lot. We've experienced a lot this year, and I think this team
has matured a lot in the sense of learning how to shut out all the outside
noise and all that stuff and really focus on our game plan, our scouting
report and what we do. I think that we've gotten a lot better at that this
year, and I think that we can continue to get better at that.  
  
Q. Kyle and Grant, after looking at Loyola, what kind of challenges will
they present to you guys defensively, and I guess what did you think about the
way they executed, as well, late game yesterday?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: As I said, they're talented offensive team. They move the ball
really well. They have a lot of motion, and they're just aggressive. And on
defense, depending on the lineup, they might switch everything. You've got to
prepare and execute your game plan. Coaches do a good job preparing us, so
we've just got to go out there, find the shooters, and consistently get those
rebounds, as well.  
  
KYLE ALEXANDER: He got it. He covered it.  
  
Q. They remind you of anyone you guys played this year?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: They run similar offense to Vandy, but the biggest thing is
we've seen pretty much everything you can possibly see offensively. It's just
about going and competing like I said earlier, and being on edge and knowing
what they're going to run and trying to pressure them out of it, just
understanding they're going to do the same thing on the other end.  
  
They're going to switch like Grant said and try to put pressure on us, as
well, but we've got to be aggressive on the boards and be really physical and
be really strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Admiral and Kyle, you guys obviously won a lot of SEC awards after
the regular season, but you guys didn't have anybody on the all-SEC defensive
team. What goes into being such a good defensive team without having any
stand-out individuals?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I was actually surprised that Kyle didn't make it. Actually
that was one of my goals, to be on the defensive team. I didn't really care
about all-SEC to be honest. No disrespect to our league, but I really wanted
to be on the defensive team more than anything. I really thought Kyle would
have made it. But I think it's ironic, us being one of the top five teams in
the country as far as defensive percentages and ratings and all that stuff,
and no one is on the list.  
  
But at the end of the day, most of the time, it's a pain to focus on
statistics. For us, we're going to keep competing and we are going to keep
going out and doing what we do. We're not worried about getting awards or
accolades. We're really just trying to win championships and really make our
University proud, our families proud, and our coaching staff proud.  
  
Q. Admiral, you mentioned playing against Donte; what was the game, and
what were your impressions of him?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, I played against him on the AAU circuit more than
anything. But he's very athletic, very shifty with the ball. I mean, he's a
city kid. He plays city ball, and very tough, tough-nosed guy. But the biggest
thing is a lot of us coming up in that area, that's how we play ball. We're
very tough.  
  
We pride ourselves in being able to get to the rim, being able to shoot the
outside shot and having somewhat of a mid-range guy, guys that can do
everything, and he can do that. He can pose problems for a lot of teams. And
for us, we've just got to be ready to guard that.  
  
Q. Kyle, Loyola really likes to space the floor offensively and do a lot
of driving and kicking and that sort of stuff, and Miami was able to help at
the rim on a lot of their penetration. The way they play, what's the challenge
defensively for you guys? Obviously you guys are a really good defensive team,
but when a team is trying to space you out, what are the challenges for the
team in general?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I'd say the main thing is kind of like our white-line
presence, and that's kind of just loading up in the middle of the paint.
You're not -- when your man is not guarding the ball and somebody on the other
side of the court has the ball, we're loading up on the white line and just
making sure that you're providing help for your teammates because like he
mentioned, defense is really a team thing. You can't just rely on one person
for it. I think that's why our team does so well is because we really play a
lot of help defense. We really help our teammates out.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you update your health? I saw you had an ice pack on your
hip yesterday.  
KYLE ALEXANDER: It was good. I had a little bit of a bone bruise on my hip,
and I've been with the trainers all day, and I will continue to be with them,
see how it goes.  
  
RICK BARNES: Again, you get into this tournament, you realize that everybody
that's playing, they're here for a reason, and you look at Loyola, you realize
they haven't -- they've lost one game since January. You win 29 games. You
shoot 50 percent as a group. Five guys in double figures, it's just a team
that, one, looking at them and watching them play, you enjoy watching them,
the way they share the ball, the way they move the ball, and the way I think
they really understand how to play together.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys looked like they had been here before yesterday.
Were you surprised at the poise that they showed, or what did you expect?  
RICK BARNES: You know, I'm not sure about what to expect, actually. We thought
they would come out a little bit jittery, which they did. We missed some shots
there, but I did feel like looking back on it, they were locked in
defensively. And we had actually told them that coming out of the tournament
in St. Louis that we had really had one really good game where we played for
40 minutes the way we needed to. What team is going to show up here? So they
came out yesterday, and I thought they were really locked in on the defensive
end. Then we did get things going offensively. But to be honest, I wasn't sure
what to really expect.  
  
Q. Rick, these days, is a team in the seed range of Loyola still a
Cinderella, quote-unquote, and if not, what's your definition of a Cinderella
these days?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I think with college basketball now, the parity, and once
years ago when we went back to 13 scholarships and the fact that players
transfer now, we know that there's been an epidemic in college basketball.
Every team has good players. I think you realize that when you start playing
early in the year and you even get into your non-league schedule.  
  
You realize that maybe your players don't see it at first, but I think over
time they really do have a great respect at how many guys in the country can
play.  
  
And so when you talk about a team that -- if you want to say Cinderella,
whatever, it's probably a team that's doing the unexpected. But that could
probably -- that label could be probably said about a lot of people in some
ways. But all I can tell you today in college basketball, there's a lot of
guys that can play, and with the rules where guys can transfer and sit out and
another year of sitting out makes a big difference, and teams that get older,
and most of those guys end up getting older, and teams I think that stay
together.  
  
One thing we wanted to do with our program is get our team old, and we knew we
were going to start young, but we want to get old, and we want to stay old if
we possibly can.  
  
Q. A lot of your players were asked about the 98-year-old nun as the
sixth man for Loyola. I wonder if you worry about that karma, and are you
going to bring in a priest or Chaplin to counter that tomorrow?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I can tell you one of the best things that we've done all
year is we've had a power talk that we have Scott Jackson, who's actually my
pastor and local minister in Knoxville, and Chris Walker, who's with
Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Of all the things that we've done on the
court, my biggest thrill has been to see what's happening with our team within
our program. That's been the biggest thing.  
  
I do believe that God is sovereign. I believe he's in charge and controls
everything. I'm not sure I believe in karma, but I do believe in God and that
he's in control.  
  
But I can tell you, like I just said, what's gone on with our players off the
court has been as big a win for us as winning the games.  
  
Q. You mentioned you want to grow old and stay old. Seniors can kind of
be a lost commodity in college basketball. Will we ever see that change and
maybe the NBA change their one-and-done rule? Could we maybe see more juniors
and seniors in college?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, I do think it will happen. I think the rule is close to
being here. I don't think it'll be a year or so away, maybe even could come in
quicker than that, that high school prospects will have a chance to enter that
league if they want to. I think that's going to happen.  
  
But you look around, there's some teams that have been that way for quite some
time. I mean, Virginia is a team that's shown that. I think of other teams, I
think of Gonzaga has been a team that's done a lot of that, too, Wichita
State, I think of that -- I'm not sure on those, but when I think of that, I
think of guys that have guys that stayed in their program for periods of time
and have had success with it. And I'm sure there's other ones.  
  
I'm not up on all of it, but again, I do think that it'll all trend. I just
think it's just around the corner before the NBA drops that rule and gets guys
come right out of high school.  
  
Q. Rick, you've coached teams that had one-and-done guys and five-star
guys. Now you've got guys who are maybe a little under the recruiting radar.
Is there a difference in groups when you have guys who maybe weren't given all
the notoriety or aren't looking at going to the NBA after one year?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I think there's -- I don't know if there's any one specific
thing. I can tell you, every one-and-done guy that I coached, I really enjoyed
coaching, and the best players that we had at Texas were our hardest working
guys. And I will tell you, whether people believe it or not, they did not come
in with that idea they were one-and-done. If they were, so be it, but they
came in and they put both feet in.  
  
I think where the problem occurs is when they're not putting both feet in, and
they come in like, hey, I'm only going to be here for 8 or 9 months. I've
always thought it was really tough if you sign a terrific player, and the
first thing he says is that he's leaving before he even gets on campus. I
think that's a -- we talked to Gavin about it. We talked to LaMarcus and TJ
and all of those guys to make sure they realized that they were going to have
to come in and be part of a team. And they didn't want to separate themselves
right off the bat.  
  
So I do think it's the way it's handled, but I think we all know that you want
talent and you want to recruit the most talented players you can recruit. But
sometimes in recruiting, those five-star guys are over-recruited, and
sometimes those three-star guys are overrated, and the three-star guys are
underrated.  
  
We ourselves don't put a lot into what other people rate them. We've always
said we're going to go out and rate ourselves and get the guys that we want
and that will fit with what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Rick, in your history in the NCAA Tournament, have you encountered a
double-digit seed like this with the story that people are running around, the
building is getting behind them, they hit a shot like they did yesterday, and
if so, does that stuff matter once the ball is tipped off?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah. I mean, like I said earlier, I remember when we were at
Clemson, I don't remember what the seed was, but I remember playing I think it
was Western Michigan that had five fifth-year players on their team and had
one of those great years. We were banged up a little bit, but still, they beat
us. But you expect that in the tournament. You expect -- there's three sets of
crowds normally at the game. They have their fans. We have our fans. And then
the neutral crowds have always -- most of the time when you think about it,
they go for the underdog or the team wearing the darker jersey. They're not
necessarily the underdog, but they're normally the team that's wearing the
darker jersey.  
  
You expect that, and it can be like a road game if that's what you want to
call it. But you've got to play the game. You've got to get in there, and
you've just got to execute what you've talked about, understand the ups and
downs of a game, and just fight the game and understand it's 40 minutes or
longer sometimes that you've just got to stay focused and locked in and
understand how hard you've got to compete to get the job done.  
  
Q. I want to ask you about Chris Chiozza, the guard for Florida. His
numbers aren't really eye-popping, and this is really his first year being the
full-time point guard, but how have you seen him kind of evolve kind of from
your side of the court as far as him becoming a player who's kind of, I guess,
the key to Florida maybe?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you love him. When you coach against him, he's the kind of
player that he's got tremendous speed and quickness. And when he gets going
downhill and he's a guy that really wants to pass the ball, I think Mike has
done a terrific job with him. He's improved a lot from a year ago, where I
think he's much more under control, a guy that really looks to play the
position the way coaches want it played.  
  
But when he really -- and they're obviously a heavy ball screen team, and when
he gets going downhill, he can really create havoc for your defense. So he's a
guy that going into the game that you have to give a lot of attention to
because if you don't get him contained and under control, he will set up a lot
of guys, and he can get to the basket and finish, as well. He can shoot the
ball. But again, his biggest improvement I think has been the way he has
really learned to get his teammates involved.  
  
Q. Back to the 98-year-old nun and God for a second, what kind of
control do you think God will have on the outcome of the game, and can you
tell us a little bit more about the power talks?  
RICK BARNES: Again, I think -- all I can tell you is I think God is sovereign,
and that means I think he's in charge of everything. He's the only guy that
knows the future because he's made the future.  
  
Our power talks, what we wanted to do was Chris Walker came in, and since we
have been there, we've had fellowship of Christian Athletes, Athletes in
Action, both were on campus. But when Chris Walker played for  
  
Coach Fulmer, and when he came back, I met him, and I knew a year ago he was
going to move back to Knoxville and be -- leave that chapter on campus. And I
just -- and he's one of the finest people I've ever been around. I just said,
I'd like to be someone that's going to really be invested in our program and
be around.  
  
I look back on my time as a head coach, there's a lot of things I wished I
could go back and do different. And one of them would be I wish I would have
done what we've done this year a long time ago. And it's something that during
those power talks, he's going to share the gospel. He's a former player that
understands athletics, but he is a very transparent person. He along with
Scott Jackson. It's real, and we talk about it because we know just in the
last really two and a half, three weeks, people that I know have passed, and
you realize the brevity of life and how quickly it goes.  
  
One of our former players, the first player that we signed at Texas, Chris
Owens, came by this morning to the hotel and had breakfast with us, and one of
the neat things has been to watch -- I've coached so many guys that have grown
up to become wonderful fathers and very successful in what they do.  
  
But what we've done with this team, like I said, with our power talks and what
those guys have done has been just really something I'm most -- probably as
proud of as anything we've done this year.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Loyola's big Cameron Krutwig, and how do you
plan on stopping him from getting down and scoring a lot from the post
tomorrow?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, you love their balance as a team. Five guys in
double figures, you're obviously going to look at each player and see what you
can do with as many tendencies as they have.  
  
But he's a terrific player. We've always said, we don't think we can stop
anybody one-on-one. Our whole defense is set up on being a sound defensive
team as a team. And we expect our players to be on edge and understand
whatever coverage we're in with ball screens, whatever we're doing when the
ball goes into the post, understanding the scouting reports, and if we feel
like we want to help off of and who we don't want to help off of. So it goes
back to our game plan in terms of each individual guy, how we're going to try
to play him to -- really try to get as much done as we can on the defensive
end.  
  
Q. I know you're a big fan of Bob McKillop at Davidson. I was curious in
the evolution of your offense, maybe how much the Davidson offense influenced
that in any way?  
RICK BARNES: Oh, yeah, Bob and I were together at Davidson. And truly a man
that I -- a great friend, and as a man I admire as much as anybody I've been
in the business with. Just, again, a great basketball coach. And yeah, I've
learned from Bob. There's no doubt I've learned from him. But we've taken some
of the things that he does along with some things I've learned from Gary
Williams and Wimp Sanderson that we're using this year -- back, again, some
things from Alabama, some things that -- so we put it all together, and we
will continue to do that, along with some of the things that my current
coaching staff, that we think fits our team.  
  
We've always believed that we're going to change the system for the players to
help them as opposed to trying to always force feed them into something they
can't do, and we're not a heavy ball screen team. We have it as part of our
package, but that's not what we do. But we can. We like the movement. We want
to be different. We want to play inside-out, and everybody knows that, so
there's no secrets with that.  
  
I've been very blessed and been around a lot of terrific coaches and
assistants and guys I've worked for that we've used a little bit of all of it
that I've learned through the years.  
  
Q. What's gone into Derrick Walker kind of cycling out of the rotation a
little bit?  
RICK BARNES: It's nothing -- Derrick hasn't done anything. It's just Fulke has
been a guy that's continued to improve, and Derrick is the same way. We look
at both of those guys based on match-ups. That's what we base it on. But
Derrick hasn't done anything. He's ready to play. Fulke is a guy that's given
us good minutes the last couple games, and we're going to need them all
tomorrow. And we know that, but Derrick is getting better, but he hasn't done
anything, it's just a matter of the match-ups that we've seen.  
  
Q. I don't know how much you're aware of this, but the SEC has gotten
off to a pretty quick start in the tournament, I think winning their first
five games. What does that say about the league, not only getting a lot of
teams in, but making the most of that opportunity?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you know, as a league, we talked about how good we think
our league has been, and it was a good league. I've said every year, I think
every league is good, you know, but who's the better league, that can be
debated all the time.  
  
But I can only tell you from experience, this year, it was as tough a league
as I've ever been a part of from top to bottom. It was amazing. And then I'm
excited because I like to be -- every year I tell people all the time, when
this season is over with in another two weeks, people are going to start
projecting next year how many teams the ACC is going to get in. Somebody is
going to throw out eight or nine or ten. Somebody is going to throw out the
Big 12 getting in seven or eight.  
  
I want the SEC to be a team that people know from the beginning. They're going
to get seven, eight teams in. And on a bad year, it's going to be seven. And
on a great year, it can be eight or nine as opposed to people might say --
most people have said four or five since I've been here in the three years.
And hopefully to do that -- and probably in the past, that's probably what
they were doing. I'm not saying they won't do it anymore, but change in
perception is a hard thing to do, but it started a year ago.  
  
So the start of this tournament, I was with our commissioner who has done a
terrific job. And he said, you know, I was so excited when it came out with
the number of teams we got in, but now I'm as nervous as I've ever been
because we need to do well, and we know that.  
  
Hopefully we can continue to do well. We've got some terrific coaches in our
league and guys that know what they're doing, and recruiting has been great in
our league. We've got good teams. We really do. And there's some other teams
that were right there that probably had a chance, but you end up beating up on
each other.  
  
Q. Your kids talk a lot about the team defense concept that you just
mentioned and seem to take a lot of pride in that. Can you talk about tweaking
your defense, your basic defensive philosophy from year to year, and how you
adjust things to the personnel you have?  
RICK BARNES: Well, for three years at Tennessee, we haven't been very good on
defense. One of the hardest things to do as a coach is when you know you're
going to struggle on offense if certain guys go out of the game. When we first
got there, we knew we had two seniors that had to play 35, 36 minutes a game
in Armani Moore and Kevin Punter, we had to basically tell those guys, you
guys can't get in foul trouble.  
  
So you basically -- not that they would -- both of those guys were really big
competitors, but we couldn't extend our defense. We couldn't pressure the way
we wanted to. And at the end, we were only playing six or seven guys. Last
year, we had a lot of these guys back -- these guys come in and they were
young and had no idea how hard you have to play at this level to be a good
defensive team. They had no idea.  
  
But we knew that after last year, the biggest way we could improve would be on
the defensive end. If you go back and look at numbers, you'd be surprised if
you rebound the ball three more times a game how you can go from being in a
team that's in over 200 to the top 25. If you turn the ball over three times,
the same numbers show up.  
  
So we talked about how we've got to improve on -- we really talked about four
or five possessions, that we've got to get better at defensive rebounding. We
need to do a better job on the offensive boards, got to get consecutive stops
more. So our personnel and the one thing with this year's team by having the
depth, we told our guys if they're not going to play hard on defense, they're
not going to play, and I think they know that.  
  
Hopefully we can -- and we think we can be better, and going forward, we hope
that we can be a better defensive team because we think we can be.

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Chris Chiozza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33167)

### [Egor Koulechov](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35004)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Florida - 77, St. Bonaventure - 62  
  
MIKE WHITE: Just very pleased with the overall performance, of course. Beat a
really good St. Bonaventure team who's obviously been playing really, really
well. Like to congratulate St. Bonaventure and Mark Schmidt and his players.
They had a great run, an amazing year. They play as hard in my opinion as any
team in college basketball, have a terrific backcourt, share it, really defend
at a really high level.  
  
We've had some quality wins this year. We've had some big wins, and this was
certainly one of them.  
  
Q. How much do you think the defense, particularly early in the second
half, kind of set the tone for you guys?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: That's what got us going. We got stops early in the second
half, and we got out running and got some easy baskets in transition, and we
just kind of built the momentum from there, and we was able to maintain it for
most of the second half.  
  
Q. It seemed like the game plan was to shoot over their zone and
eventually guys started hitting shots. You guys went through some droughts,
but how much did sticking with it kind of help, or did you feel like you could
have attacked it better at times?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Maybe at times we could have attacked it better, but I felt
like even in the first half when we went through that drought, we felt like we
were getting really good shots, and we felt like if we keep getting those, we
were going to be okay. We had a good game plan coming in. They changed the
pace of the game with that zone, but eventually we figured it out. Shots
started falling, and we defended at a high level. Like you said, the first
four minutes especially, that was our main emphasis coming out of halftime.  
  
Q. Chris, you guys held Mobley and Adams to only 21 points. Did you feel
like coming into the game if you were able to limit them effectively you'd be
on the right step to victory?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Those are two great guards, and we had to focus in on them
along with Stockard. Those are their three main guys that score. We just
wanted to make it tough for them to score, not give them any open looks early,
get it going.  
  
They hit a couple tough ones, but when you're playing good players, and we did
a good job of not getting that let to our confidence, and we played hard the
whole game and was able to keep them from doing what they normally do.  
  
Q. Chris, 11 more assists tonight, the ability to kind of find your
teammates, particularly when you went through some stretches against the zone,
how key was that, and how key was the ball movement at times?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I mean, guys were knocking down shots. We did a good job of
moving the ball. We didn't really rush anything. We found open guys. Guys did
a good job of moving around the zone. When I penetrated, they would relocate,
and I was able to just find them, and they had confidence.  
  
I'd just tell them every time they're open, shoot it. If it's an open look,
we're never going to get mad if they miss them.  
  
Q. Egor, I see a scratch on your shoulder. Was that kind of just the
kind of game it was in terms of the physicality and the desperation --  
EGOR KOULECHOV: No. That's actually courtesy of Kevarrius Hayes a couple days
ago. He actually scratched my other shoulder, as well. I don't know how that
happens, but yeah, it just kind of happened. It's not a big deal, honestly.  
  
Q. The play Jalen Hudson made with the put-back dunk, what went through
your mind when that happened?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: I don't know. I was just like -- I was kind of shocked. I
couldn't believe he made it. He got up over his own teammates, the other team.
I think his head was over the rim.  
  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah. I had a good look at it from the corner, so I kind of
saw the whole play develop, and the first thing I just kind of said, like wow,
he looked like he literally like climbed a ladder to get that. And then I
heard the foul, too. It was a great play. Jalen is a top athlete, scorer,
whatever. He can make those plays.  
  
Q. Thoughts on going into next round and potentially playing against
what's going to be a pretty hostile environment here?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: Yeah. Yeah. We've kind of got to settle, move on from this
victory. Tomorrow obviously we're going to watch some film. We've got to be
prepared for a hostile environment, obviously. We're in Texas. We saw they
have a lot of crowd here. But we're going to do our best, treat it as every
other game this year, lock in on our end, try to defend at a high level, get a
good scouting report in. Yeah.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Yeah, we know it's going to be hostile, a lot like we've played
in neutral site games, a lot of those have been like road games to us,
especially early in the season when we played Gonzaga in Portland.  
  
We're just going to come out and focus on our game plan, focus on us, and
whatever the coaches tell us, they're going to have us prepared as well as we
can be. They take pride in that, and that's why they're such good coaches.
We're going to come out and do whatever they say, play hard, and just be ready
for a fight.  
  
Q. Egor, how much does this kind of much better NCAA memory for you than
your freshman year?  
EGOR KOULECHOV: A lot better, a lot better. I was hoping not to have another
bad one. This is like four years later. I mean, that's what I wanted when I
came here. We're obviously not done, still hopefully a lot of basketball to be
played, but this team, the coaching staff, they've been awesome. It's just the
whole experience, just even not from the NCAA Tournament, just the whole year,
it's been amazing.  
  
Q. Chris, this has been such a roller coaster season, and you have a
national analyst that's picking against you again after leaving the SEC
tournament early. What does it say about this group that it kind of took that
to heart and bounced back tonight and showed the kind of effort that it
showed?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It's always, you know, a chip on your shoulder when you're
picked to lose in the first round as a higher seed for the second year in a
row. You know, it just gives you a little bit more fuel just to go out there
and prove people wrong, but again, you try not to make too much out of it, go
out there and try to treat it like any other game. You don't want to get too
excited for it because people are talking about you, but of course it gives
you a little bit more -- a little more spunk to your game.  
  
Q. Last year you faced the Bonnies in Florida. Mobley and Adams dropped
a combined 48 against you guys. How much did seeing them just a year ago and
rewatching film from that game help you prepare for tonight's matchup?  
MIKE WHITE: I think it was definitely to our advantage to understand how good
they are individually and obviously as a team, to have experienced it
firsthand. I think that if this was the first time we had played them, we
definitely wouldn't have been as prepared. I have the utmost respect for the
job, again, that Coach Schmidt and St. Bonaventure have done and the program
that they've rebuilt here as of late.  
  
Obviously for their backcourt, those guys, they went nuts on us last year in
Lakeland late in the game. I want to say we were up 15-17 and it was tied with
about a minute, minute and a half if I'm not mistaken. They're a handful to
guard, and our guys know -- they were very familiar, especially our veteran
guys lead by Chris Chiozza and KeVaughn Allen, I thought both did a terrific
job tonight. They know that when Adams and Mobley cross half court, they're in
range, and they can score off the bounce. They can score off the bounce. They
score off down screens, off staggers, off hand-offs. We went under one early
on Mobley where he made us pay, of course, from really deep.  
  
But they're just really good guards, and they run good stuff. So obviously I'm
really pleased with our defensive effort.  
  
Q. What do you sort of tell your team at halftime, and what was the
attitude even though you guys were only up by five and the offense wasn't
great, the defense was still there?  
MIKE WHITE: Stay the course offensively. I liked our ball movement in the
first half. We missed a couple more right at the rim. We'll continue to
address. I thought we had decent looks from three against a really good zone
because we're a really good passing team, especially certain lineups that we
play, of course, and Keith Stone and Egor playing in the middle of zones and
playing in the corners and short corners, they have an ability to find guys.
And then we've got multiple guys that can make shots. So we try to spread
zones out as much as possible. Try to do the same thing against man.  
  
And I thought we had some decent looks, so I was actually pleased. We just
talked about staying the course, focusing on getting a great shot, not the
result. Whether it goes in or not, next possession, let's get a great shot.
And more than anything, first four minutes of the second half, getting back to
that same edge defensively, making sure that we came out, because we've had
struggled. A lot of teams have struggles first four minutes of the second
half, regaining that defensive edge and energy that we played with in the
first 20.  
  
Q. Mike Okauru went down with what looked like a head injury, looked
like he took a shot to the head there at the end. How is he doing, and will he
be able to go on Saturday?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I anticipate he'll be fine. I asked him how he was feeling
and he said great. He just bumped his head. I think we had a few guys bump
their heads tonight by the Bonnies and by each other.  
  
Q. How big was it for Jalen and Egor to both kind of give you
production, especially coming off the game against Arkansas?  
MIKE WHITE: It was great. I mean, it's crucial for us to get balanced scoring.
It's who we are. It's allows us to spread the floor. It promotes that movement
of the basketball. Jalen, it took him a little while and he finally got going.
He had a huge play, of course. Egor was great offensively for the better part
of the game, of course.  
  
We were led by Chris Chiozza, 11 assists, zero turnovers. My goodness, it's a
luxury to have as a head coach. When the ball is in his hands, good things
happen. He drew fouls, as well, got guys shots, and he probably could have had
15 assists if we shot it at a really high clip.  
  
In addition, he chased Mobley around for 40 minutes whenever he was in the
game. However many minutes he played, he was chasing him around. Looks like
31. And I thought KeVaughn Allen in addition, he didn't get it going
offensively for us. I thought he was terrific on Jaylen Adams.  
  
It was a good overall team defensive effort, again, led by Chris Chiozza and
KeVaughn Allen. Those guys really dug in and stepped up knowing how important
it was to slow those terrific guards down.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Scott Nagy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23525)

### [Loudon Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34983)

### [Everett Winchester](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35057)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Tennessee - 73, Wright State - 47.  
  
SCOTT NAGY: Well, I think it's kind of the obvious. You just can't play as
poorly as we did offensively and win an NCAA game, not against a game like
Tennessee. We talked about this, that we were going to have to play great on
both ends. And we struggled offensively this year.  
  
We haven't been a great offensive team. We've had some ups and downs. We've
been in some games like this where we've played this poor offensively and won,
but when you're playing Tennessee, that just isn't going to happen.  
  
Pleased with the kids, how hard they played. We got good shots. We did
everything we needed to do. And then it just puts so much pressure on your
defense. I thought defensively we were really good. Now, we didn't rebound the
ball as well as we should have. And when you miss as many shots as we did,
you're going to get beat on the glass.  
  
I've got nothing to complain about with how hard our players played.  
  
Q. Loudon, you're only ten minutes in the first half, how frustrating
was that sitting there, you waited all this time to play in a game like this,
and to have to watch it from the bench?  
LOUDON LOVE: It's tough from a personal standpoint, not just because I'm
sitting there, because I can't contribute for the team for at least those ten
minutes. And it really stopped me from going in the first half with those
fouls. You've got to be smarter. We knew that. We knew they were physical, and
you just can't make stupid fouls, but definitely difficult.  
  
Q. Did you feel they were coming at you, or was that just kind of in the
flow of the offense?  
LOUDON LOVE: I think it was in the flow. The first one was not ideal for me
when I wait for it, just catch and post at 15 feet. There's no reason to push
him down. And I think it was just in the flow of the offense, not getting
through screens and such.  
  
Q. Everett, you were really the only offense that they had there in the
first half. It looked like the stage wasn't too big for you. What did that
feel like getting out there and attack being early on?  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: For me, it felt good, of course, because if it wasn't for
my teammates and my coaches believing in me, none of that would have happened.
I don't know. It's just hard because I know we have some great offensive
pieces, and shots didn't fall for us. I made some shots that I just wish we
all as a team would have made shots together.  
  
Q. Tennessee defensively, did they do anything that gave you particular
trouble today?  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: Tennessee, they're really physical on defense. They're in
the lanes. They attack the ball. And they just pressure a lot. I think we have
some pretty good looks out there. We just couldn't knock down the shots.
That's just how I feel.  
  
LOUDON LOVE: Yeah, like Everett said, they're definitely a physical group, but
I found myself out of control and stuff due to own pace, and it was tough
getting gauged at the beginning of the game to what it was like, and them
being physical like they are and athletic, it just made it more difficult.  
  
Q. How unsettling was it for you guys to see Grant struggle like that? I
know he kind of gives you guys a spark, and he couldn't buy a basket.  
LOUDON LOVE: I mean, whether it was emotionally shooting the ball or whatever,
he carried this team almost all year. Both the seniors, him and Trey, even
Trey on practice squad. It's hard to see him play his last college career game
like that. You wish both of them would drop, but we know he was trying to make
each one, so we can't blame him for anything.  
  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: Although he wasn't hitting shots, he was the first one,
the main one out there with a smile on his face still. I know he missed one,
and he said, the next one has to fall, with a smile on his face. He's a very
important piece to this time. Without him, we're not here. It was hard seeing
him miss shots, but it kept us motivated.  
  
Q. Just how would you kind of sum up your NCAA Tournament experience?  
LOUDON LOVE: It was neat. Shorter than I would have liked.  
  
EVERETT WINCHESTER: I agree with Loudon. It was really a great experience, but
of course, we wish we could have advanced.  
  
Q. How tough was that to have Loudon on the bench with foul trouble
almost the whole first half?  
RICK BARNES: You know, it was more frustrating than anything. His third foul
was his fault, just because he was standing straight up and got screened. And
he's obviously an important part of our offense.  
  
But you know, I don't think it impacted us that much. You know, I think when
we go back and look at this, two things: Tennessee has been good defensively
all year, and so it's to be expected a little bit. And we got some great
shots. We flat-out got great shots, particularly in the second half, we got
great shots and just didn't make them.  
  
You know, you're not going to be able to play with Tennessee if you don't play
well offensively, and we didn't. And too, honestly, the first two fouls Loudon
got were not good fouls for him. He just wasn't -- early in the game, he just
wasn't in a good spot.  
  
Q. Just a little bit on Benzinger's struggles today and also I think he
banged himself up diving on the floor?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, I mean, you're going to have games like that. You are.
Grant has had people sticking to him all year, and so I don't think that was
any different for him. I mean, he's had the kind of defensive players that
Tennessee has guarding him all year, and so I don't think -- I'm not knocking
Tennessee. I'm just saying I don't think that necessarily was the impact, and
Grant has had some tough offensive games.  
  
Sometimes he takes some tough shots, but we've asked him to do that because he
can make tough shots, and he's put the time in, so we live with it. It's just
-- I don't know what to tell you. He just had a tough game offensively. You
know, then when he dove on the floor there, he's had basically a hole in his
hip. When I went down and looked at it, it was probably two inches wide, and
I'm sure they're going to have to stitch him up before we go home, but I mean,
he's had a hole in his hip because he dives on the floor like that all the
time, and he reopened it when he dove on the floor.  
  
Q. 2 of 15, 5 minutes left in a blowout and he's diving on the floor,
does that kind of sum up his career?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, it wouldn't matter what the score is, that's the way he
plays. That's the way he plays in practice. I've said that several times, I've
had to ask him to stop doing stuff like that in practice because we have to
keep him healthy. But it isn't going to matter to him what the score is. He's
been -- he has been the heartbeat of our team all year.  
  
Q. What was the message in the locker room afterwards, to kind of look
at the broad picture as opposed to today?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, and it's hard. I've had to give that speech 23 times now
because I've ended every one of my seasons with a loss. It's hard for the kids
to hear it right there. Doesn't matter what you say to try to make them feel
better. They don't feel better at that point. I think as time goes on, they'll
be able to look back and see what a special season this was. But one thing I
told them, I haven't enjoyed every team that I've coached. I wish I could say
that I have, but I have really enjoyed these guys. This team has been a joy to
coach, and for as thin as we were and as young as we are, having accomplished
so much. And the key now is to make it a habit. And it's hard. It's hard for
teams at our level to get back here. But if you can get in here and have
players that have been to it two or three times, then these kind of things
change.  
  
Q. I know everything starts at 0-0 next year, but what kind of carryover
can there be for like a freshman like Everett, the way he came out and
attacked early?  
RICK BARNES: I mean, for everybody, the expectations for our whole team should
change in terms of how we prepare for next year and what they think. We
primarily lose one guy that has played for us, and we're adding six, six good
players. So our depth is going to change a lot. It's going to be very
competitive. But the guys that are coming back understand what it takes, they
understand the culture that's needed, and they'll be able to teach the new
guys, and so we're obviously very excited about the future. Just it's hard to
think about those things today.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola - 64, Miami - 62  
  
PORTER MOSER: You know, first of all, God is good. He blessed this group. We
give the glory to him. He blessed our University, this group. He blessed me
being able to coach resilient kids.  
  
The second thing with these young guys, we're in the huddle. Even when we were
down seven, it was just about keep fighting, keep fighting. There's no quit in
these guys. They believe. They share the ball. We had 19 assists. And a great
example is that last pass to Donte with Marques to find it.  
  
They made big shots. Clay made a big shot on an action we run in the corner.  
  
Very, very blessed that we have kids that do not quit, that are resilient.  
  
Q. Donte, just describe the shot and just the feeling when that goes
in?  
DONTE INGRAM: I mean, it was a great feeling. I thank Marques for making that
pass. Any one of us could have hit that shot, but I was just fortunate enough
to be in the position. And when I seen the shot and I had space, I was
confident, and it went in, luckily.  
  
Q. Before that happened, before the time-out, what was the discussion
like in terms of what the plan was if you missed, and how close did what
happened was it to what you wanted, what was planned?  
DONTE INGRAM: Well, if our five man would have got the rebound, we would have
called a time-out. Since a guard got it, you know, Coach just had faith in us
and said let's go. We're under attack. At that point, it is just up to us to
make a play, and luckily we came through with a play.  
  
Q. Clay, you had that game-tying shot. Can you just talk about that pass
from Ben and what went on with that play?  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, that's another example of Ben knowing where I'm going
to be before anybody else knows where I'm going to be. No, it's a credit to
Coach. I mean, we work on situations like that in the last four minutes every
day in practice.  
  
We try to be the best team at executing down the stretch. And I mean, we've
worked on that action a hundred times. We felt comfortable running it, and we
executed it perfectly. And it was lucky enough to make the shot.  
  
Q. For all of you, you guys were picked as an upset pick, and there's
some pressure on you, highlight game. Just how did you kind of keep -- in such
a tight situation in the game, your coach mentions the time-out, keeping cool.
How did you manage to keep your cool through all of this?  
MARQUES TOWNES: I mean, we go through those situations all the time. Nothing
has changed. We talk about in the huddle the last four minutes, just give it
everything you've got and don't break, don't break on defense, just stay and
execute our plays.  
  
Yeah. We just talk about just never give up. And he just talked about in the
huddle, Coach always emphasizes, don't break, don't break. These last four
minutes, don't break.  
  
DONTE INGRAM: I mean, we just all have confidence in each other. Like Marques
said, we go through those situations in practice all the time. So we know it's
a full 40 minutes to play, and we all want to stay together, stay connected.
And if we do that and leave it all out there, we have a chance to win.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: I mean, I don't know. Coach does a great job of making sure we
keep our blinders on. In a situation like the NCAA Tournament, there's so many
distractions around us and cameras following us around everywhere.  
  
He closed the doors on everybody and just told us like it's time to play, it's
time to focus. And I don't feel like we had pressure on us to win. I mean,
we're in the situation where we can go out there and play free and play the
way we've been playing all year. And I think we're a scary team if we're
playing free and like we have nothing to lose. I think that's a big part of
what we've been doing.  
  
Q. For each of the three players, as you guys left the court, you all
stopped and greeted Sister Jean. Can you talk about what she means to the team
and if you have any stories that illustrate what type of person she is?  
DONTE INGRAM: Sister Jean, she has meant so much to me personally and
obviously the team. She is there before every game. She's saying a prayer
before every game. After the game, she sends a general email to the team. And
then at the end of the email, it'll be individualized, hey, Donte, you did
this, you rebounded well tonight. Even though they were out there to get you,
you still came through for the team. She's just so special, her spirit. She's
just so bright, and she means so much to the city of Chicago and Loyola
obviously and the team.  
  
MARQUES TOWNES: Yeah, she gives us great, great scouting reports. But no,
Sister Jean, she's just a wonderful person. Just to have her around and her
presence and her aura, when you see her, it's just like the world is just
great because just her spirit and her faith in us and Loyola basketball and
just her being around, she's the biggest Loyola fan I've ever met in my entire
life. And just having her and her giving us our pregame prayers, just having
her here is just a real blessing.  
  
CLAYTON CUSTER: Yeah, I mean, Sister Jean is like when you talk to her when
she's in the same room as you, it warms your heart. She just has such a
positive energy around her. I mean, she's obviously just amazing. For her to
be doing what she's doing at her age, it's amazing, and it's inspiring, and I
think -- I mean, I think her prayers definitely mean a little bit extra when
she prays for us. She's huge for us, and she's huge for our success.  
  
Q. It's an overused statement, but defense wins ballgames, and it took a
defensive play to set up the winning basket. I know you practice offensive
plays, but how much of a high emphasis do you put on defense in your game
plan?  
MARQUES TOWNES: I would say defense is at the top, the top, top, top with us
because defense wins championships. I mean, offense can win us a couple games
here and there, but we really take pride in our defense. You know, we set game
goals for our defense. We want to keep them at a certain percentage, limit
them to a certain amount of offensive rebounds on the glass. And you know, I
don't think we got our field goal percentage today, but that just shows that
we don't ever quit. I've never seen these guys quit all year, and we're just
looking forward to this next game.  
  
Q. Donte, back to the shot, this is the kind of thing that this month is
all about. You've seen it before, growing up and everything, hitting the game-
winning shot against the higher-ranked team. Does it really set in for you
yet?  
DONTE INGRAM: I mean, man, I've been saying all the last week when people have
been asking me how does it feel to get to the tournament, and I've been
saying, this is -- as a kid, this is what you grow up seeing, hoping that you
can be in that moment. For me to be in this position with these guys, with
this coaching staff, I wouldn't want it any other way, and I'm just obviously
blessed to hit that shot, and I'm happy that we can get on and advance to
Tennessee.  
  
Q. Porter, how discouraging was it at times, and you talked about that
resilience, did you sense that your team maintained its confidence, or did you
see any kind of -- any signs that they wouldn't be able to come back?  
PORTER MOSER: The only negative sign I saw was the first couple minutes
defensively in the second half, and then we had a media, and we kind of got
after them a little bit, and then we were guarding the way we were guarding.  
  
But like we were down seven at a time-out. I think I called a time-out, and it
was all about us regrouping, moving forward. We'd been in that position many
times where we've gotten down, and we don't quit. These guys understand that
there's a lot of possessions left. They understand that we can have great
possessions on both ends. And that's what it was about. It was about great
possessions, getting the defense, getting our -- and we always talk about
this, and I think you've heard me say this, our defense has got to dictate our
offense.  
  
I think we came out of that time-out, and then Ben Richardson got a great
steal and then kicked it up, and we got a lay-up. That's one of those
intangible plays we talk about. Our defense created it. We needed a play like
that bad.  
  
It shows you the intangibles with Ben. You look at Ben, Ben didn't score
tonight, he was unbelievable. He had some really good plays defensively, and
he had eight assists, one turnover, one block. I mean, that's got to be a
career. One steal, five rebounds. I mean, the kid does anything he needs to do
to win, and he is just a winner.  
  
Those are things that guys like Ben, Marques, we're in the huddle, and it
wasn't any panic. It was about getting back, grinding defense, sharing the
ball.  
  
Q. This hot streak that you guys have been on, how much confidence is
that giving to your team as you enter this tournament, and also, have you
mentioned to them it's been 55 years since Loyola Chicago won the National
Championship?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, they're well aware of the National Championship, the guys
on the team. In terms of where we're at, a lot of people talk about the
conference tournament is a new season, NCAA Tournament is a new season. We've
never viewed it that way. We wanted to continue on what we were doing.  
  
The thing about this hot streak, we didn't talk -- I don't even know if the
guys -- we've even talked about how many we've won out of -- in a row. It's
all about this mentality of get better. We said before the -- we said before
the conference tournament, those four or five practices we had, we said, we've
got to get better this week. So then we had some time off, and there was a lot
of questions about how's your team going to handle 11 days off. And it's the
same mentality we've had all year. We can't control that. What can we control?
We did situations all week. We worked on that play that Clay hit all week, all
right, and that's what you do. You control things you can control.  
  
These guys believe, and we got better this week. We got better, and that's why
we're not dwelling on the past. These guys really got a good mentality because
of their culture and because of their togetherness.  
  
Q. Clayton was talking about how you keep blinders on them and that
allows them to play free. Can you just talk about your philosophy and what you
do to handle all the extra stuff?  
PORTER MOSER: Yeah, what we've talked about is this: I was asked a question
yesterday: Are you guys letting the guys enjoy the moment? 100 percent I've
been letting them enjoy the moment. It's been great for them. They come down,
and heck, we got a police escort to the arena. These guys, we went around
Chicago, Chicago is buzzing like crazy. I want them to enjoy that. They've
worked so hard to get here.  
  
What our blinders is, as we talk about, is when it's time to be in a film
session, when it's time to be in a practice, it is blinders with a focus. And
it's a credit to them. They've bought into that.  
  
So we got off the bus, and there was TV cameras everywhere, and then we went
in, I wouldn't allow anybody in from that point on. That's what he meant. We
closed the door, and we all just had blinders now. We got our blinders on, and
it's all about the next two hours.  
  
And these guys have -- you've got to be mature to do that, but I want them to
enjoy the moment. These guys are unbelievable. I'm so blessed. We're having
this journey with unbelievable guys. I want them to enjoy this, and I'm able
to do that -- if I thought we had an immature group that wouldn't focus, I
probably would have been a little bit more this, but we've really just been
talking about the blinders when we get in the film, when we get into practice,
and they've been practicing their butt off. Our walk-through this morning was
just absolutely laser, right on, what we were trying to do.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Lonnie Walker IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34997)

### [Ja'Quan Newton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33217)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Loyola - 64, Miami - 62  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, it's pretty simple to know why we call it March Madness.
Unbelievable great game, both teams played very hard. We did some very good
things and shot the ball over 50 percent, 44 percent from three, out-rebounded
them. But was one big play after another, and it was a close contest
throughout, and they made the last big play. They hit that three that
basically won the game for them.  
  
Hats off to them, and congratulations to the Loyola basketball program.  
  
Q. JaQuon, can you kind of run us through that last play?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Lonnie was at the line. He had missed the shot, and he had an
opportunity when they got the rebound to run, and I couldn't really see what
happened because I wanted to go find my man. I just seen the ball go in the
net.  
  
Q. You guys obviously see these kind of things happen and you never
think it'll happen to you. You dream about you being the one that makes the
big shot. Lonnie, how about you from that perspective, what's the feeling out
there?  
LONNIE WALKER IV: After they made the shot, I mean, it's definitely a dagger
to the heart. It for surely hurts because your teammates, such as JaQuon who's
a senior, you come to the realization it's your last game with them. It
definitely hurts seeing a shot like that go in, but I'm proud of my team and
how we fought and how we played. Hats off to them, and hope they do well in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, we asked you a little bit the other day about the 6-11 seed.
Now you're on the other side of that. Can you kind of describe that for us?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, as I said the other day, I don't think the seeds mean
that much. Teams that make this tournament are really good, and whether you're
a high seed or a low seed, it really depends on how you play. I thought we
played well enough to win this game. We had our chances. We put ourselves in
position to win, but so did Loyola. They did a good job. We pulled ahead of
them in the second half, and they fought back, but I thought we made some very
good plays.  
  
I thought the defensive stop that we got with the two-point lead with under
ten seconds to go, I believe, I thought that was going to seal the victory for
us. But something that happens quite often in this tournament, someone steps
up and makes a huge shot, and I think it was Donte Ingram was trailing the
play -- when Lonnie missed the free throw, Sam Waardenburg had the chance to
get the offensive rebound. There was a battle, it went loose, and they came up
with it. So it made it like a scramble getting back defensively. And I thought
we guarded the first couple of guys correctly, and they were not able to
shoot, but Ingram trailed the play, and they kicked it back to him.  
  
I thought the biggest statistic that separated us is they had 19 assists. We
only had 11. They found the open man a little bit more than we did, despite
the fact that we shot 51 percent from the field, better than their 47, and 44
percent from three better than their 38. And neither one of us shot well from
the foul line. We shot 61 percent. They shot 44 percent.  
  
When I look at those numbers, I think to myself, we probably would have won
the game, but we didn't. They made the last big play.  
  
Q. You talked about the 19 assists; was it a matter of their persistence
offensively that allowed them to get free there once in a while?  
JIM LARRANAGA: No. What I thought they did very well was they set a lot of
screens in the middle of the court and rolled the man to the basket, and
sometimes our help defense was there and very good, but other times we were
worried so much about them making threes that the help defender left early so
he could cover a three-point shooter. They didn't throw it to the three-point
shooter. They threw it to the roll man, and he ended up making the lay-up. We
tried making adjustments in the first half, did a little bit better job in the
second half, but not quite well enough to come out on top.  
  
Q. This is obviously the second straight early exit. This one obviously
more competitive than the last one against Michigan State, but how do you view
just the state of the program going forward and some of the pieces that you're
going to have back and some of the pieces that might be going?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, the first thing is I thought these guys did a great job
this year. When we started the season, we had five freshmen and four
sophomores, only one senior. It was a very young group. Just to make it to the
big dance I thought was a tremendous accomplishment.  
  
Secondly, we lost perhaps our best player in Bruce Brown midway through the
ACC race, which made it even more challenging to finish as high as we did in
the ACC and make the big dance.  
  
In today's college game, there's no way to predict at this early stage how
you're going to look next year with the number of kids that transfer, guys
that go pro, injuries, recruiting. What you see now would be great if we had
everybody back next year. If we did, I'd feel very, very strongly that we'd
have a great team.  
  
One of the things my staff and I have wanted to do and haven't been able to do
is stay older, have a more experienced team. I think that plays very well into
postseason. I think the older guys who have been through it normally play
well. I think younger guys have it a little more challenging.  
  
Right now, we only have one scholarship senior. We have two guys sitting out.
So if everybody would return, that would be like 11 guys. We still have two
scholarships to give. But in today's game, I have no idea.  
  
I look around our league, and I can't tell you what's going to happen at those
places, either, because guys are going pro, guys are transferring who don't
play much, guys get injured and they're out, could be out for the season. We
saw a lot of that this year with Bruce Brown and Donte Grantham and now
De'Andre Hunter is hurt and missing the tournament. So it's very, very hard to
predict this far in advance.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Kyle Keller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35007)

### [Ivan Canete](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35010)

### [Shannon Bogues](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35088)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 70, Stephen F. Austin - 60  
  
KYLE KELLER: I wish we could have ended the game at halftime, obviously, but
the game is 40 minutes. I give Texas Tech a tremendous amount of credit. Their
Coach Chris Beard, his team embodies his spirit and toughness. And they
imposed their will obviously the last 10 minutes or so of the game, and my
guys tried. They always try, but we just didn't have enough tonight. We just
-- it wasn't our night.  
  
Q. Shannon, obviously we saw you go out with an injury briefly in the
second half. Can you just talk a little bit about that and how that affected
you offensively for the rest of the game?  
SHANNON BOGUES: I just started cramping a little bit, and then after that, I
couldn't really get back in the groove, but it was just a cramp really.  
  
Q. Ivan, in the first half, you really got them going offensively,
making some big shots. Can you just kind of explain, you being a senior and
being out there, taking that leadership role and leading them offensively, how
you were able to get the momentum going in the first half?  
IVAN CANETE: I was trying to find open spots for my guys. Being a senior, I
just wanted to go out there and give it all I got and play as hard as I could.
If I see someone open, I am going to pass them the ball. A guy like Shannon
over here can just score however he wants, so yeah.  
  
Q. Ivan, second half you guys came out and scored three quick threes.
What was the feeling at that point as far as the momentum, and then talk a
little bit about the last five minutes, kind of what was going on during those
five minutes.  
IVAN CANETE: Yeah, when we were hitting those threes, I mean, we seen them
before this year, I felt like we were about to start pulling away. They looked
kind of defeated, but every time we made a run, they just responded and made a
run back. That's credit to them. They're a tough team, and then in the last
five minutes, we just were having a tough time scoring, and some things just
didn't go our way.  
  
Q. The foul trouble the team seemed to be in, not trouble until late in
the game, but just a lot of fouls seemed to be accumulating for you guys. Did
that affect what you were trying to do offensively through the better part of
the second half?  
SHANNON BOGUES: You said the foul? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Just the foul trouble, the foul situation the team was in. Did that
affect what you guys wanted to do?  
IVAN CANETE: Yeah, I mean, it definitely affected what we do on offense. When
you're used to certain guys playing a lot of minutes and being in certain
spots and then you don't have them on the court out there when it matters,
it's kind of hard. You've got to figure it out on the fly. So it was
different. But we just tried to get through it, and that was obviously tough
not having those guys out there with us.  
  
Q. Coach Keller, I noticed the disparity in points in the paint, Tech
versus SFA was not in your favor. Could you address that?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, that's been our strength all season, and obviously we
wanted to score points in the paint. They make it really hard the way they
play defense to get it in there. I thought we did a good job at times of
getting it in there. We weren't very successful at scoring in it. They clog it
up on the weak side. And to their credit, they make you throw it out and shoot
perimeter shots, and they put bodies in front of you.  
  
You know, they blocked a bunch of -- I don't know how many shots they blocked
tonight, but it seemed like every time we went and got to the rim, at least in
the second half, they were really challenged. But that's how we've won games
this year is scoring points in the paint. And our inability to score points in
the paint to me, that and not scoring points off our steals and turnovers
tonight is the reason why we didn't win the game.  
  
Q. You had said earlier you wish the game could have ended at halftime.
You guys were pretty much dominant through the majority of the game until the
last couple of minutes there. Can you talk about the difference in those last
few minutes, what you guys did the first 30 some minutes of the game?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, Evans, obviously, senior point guard dominated the second
half. He made it four points at half and gets 19 the second half. I've got Ty
Charles as an assistant coach in his last game over there with me. We guarded
him a lot of the night. We had to switch him off because of what you guys just
said, some foul trouble. So I needed him on the court because he is our senior
leader and dominates a lot of different things for us offensively, makes
things run. Even though he didn't score many points tonight, he makes things
smooth for us. He started the game guarding. And Evans is a reason why he's
all Big 12. There's a reason why he's on a lot of draft picks. He's a heck of
a player.  
  
I think it's a six-point game maybe, and he goes right through Aaron Augustin.
And TJ Hoyfield just splits a ball screen and imposed his will and got through
it when the game was on the line. That's what pros do. That's what seniors do.
We didn't have that happen for us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach Beard said you guys were one of the best teams in the country,
said you definitely weren't a 14 seed --  
KYLE KELLER: He's being nice.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like you really were able -- Texas Tech is a 3 seed.
You were really able to play with them and maybe were under seeded?  
KYLE KELLER: I don't know. There's 68 teams in the tournament seeding that to
me doesn't have anything to do with it. I coached the No. 1 seed in the
tournament. We didn't make the Final Four. So to me seeds don't matter.  
  
When the game starts, the game starts. And that's what we try to convince our
kids. Our kids didn't -- they got to play against some dudes they knew. Ty
knew some guys on their team. And the millenials today, they don't even watch
college basketball. A lot of our guys didn't even know who those cats were
because they don't watch the game. They're on their phone and doing that kind
of stuff. I hate to say it, but as much as you or I or anybody in here watches
the games, they don't. Or the NBA. They might watch the slam-dunk contest in
February on TNT or whatever, but that's about the extent of it.  
  
Q. Obviously it wasn't the outcome that you wanted, but just looking
back on the season, what do you take away from this particular team, and as
you do walk away and reflect on it, what stands out to you about this squad?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, you know, it's a hard time to really collect my thoughts. I
thought we had three great seniors who came together. A lot of tears in the
locker room after the game because of how much invested they had in our
University. The thing I think that they did was we've been living off
everybody else that had been before us, the players and coaches that had come
before us.  
  
I think my staff and the current players on our team kind of created our own
-- a little bit of our own legacy, and so I'm proud that we're -- I look at a
lot of championship trophies and nets in my office that other people have won,
and it's great for recruiting, and I love that. But to be honest with you, I'm
glad we get to have one of our own in there finally, and I'm glad our guys get
to -- were able to see this. This is about probably -- I never have counted,
between 30 and 40 NCAA Tournament games I've been a part of, and I'm glad they
got to experience that for a lot of these kids.  
  
Q. How do you know about millenial behavior, and how might that behavior
impact college basketball?  
KYLE KELLER: Well, I think it does a lot. If you are going to be around kids
today, you better read it. You better study it. I've got an eight year old and
11 year old, and I've got the greatest wife and kids I could ever imagine. I'm
the most blessed dude you've ever met, trust me. I shouldn't be here today.
But if I don't read it and study it and learn and try to figure these kids
out, I have no chance to coach it because the way I was taught as a child was,
hey, you are going to eat what is on your plate, if not, you're going to sit
here. I had to sit at the kitchen table one Saturday afternoon because I
didn't want to eat green beans or salmon patties. So we have a lot of green
beans on our team meals, and I tell that story to our guys. But you have to
adjust. You'd better learn to give and some take with these kids, I think. But
you have to be stubborn enough to impose your will on them to get them to come
together as a team and give them a lot of love, I think. Sometimes it's not
very much fun. They don't like me very much sometimes.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Texas Tech - 70, Stephen F. Austin - 60  
  
CHRIS BEARD: First of all, I just want to congratulate Stephen F. Austin for a
great season. They were everything we thought they would be and more. Kyle
Keller is a great coach. They've got good players. They've got a program is
what they have. You go back to Danny Kaspar and certainly Brad Underwood, and
now Kyle has taken it to another level. They just forced us into so many
things and took away things, but I just wanted to congratulate them on a good
season, and I know Kyle is just getting started building the program there.  
  
For our guys, we knew we were going to have to play great to win this game
because we knew how good Stephen F. Austin was. I'm really pleased for our
players that we advanced to the second round, beating a team that we had
nothing but respect for.  
  
Q. Keenan, on the alley oop that you threw to Zhaire in the first half,
the 360, it looked like you almost changed your mind before you threw it to
him. Can you take us through what you saw from him?  
KEENAN EVANS: I actually was about to throw it to Zach at first, and then the
defender went to Zach, and then Zhaire had back cut, so I just threw it to
him, and he did his thing.  
  
Q. Keenan, I know you had a lot of emotion after that game. What was it
like just to finally get that first NCAA Tournament win and just kind of
really -- cement a legacy here as a senior?  
KEENAN EVANS: It felt great. Last time we were here, we didn't get the job
done. And for us to get the first one out of the way is a really good feeling,
and I feel like all we can do is improve the rest of the way.  
  
Q. Zhaire, on that dunk, on that 360 alley oop, what was going through
your mind?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: I was about to catch it, and I just 360'd. And I surprised
myself.  
  
Q. Keenan, just talk a little bit about first half versus second half.
It seems to have been a trend all season long. It seems like either you catch
your second wind or just kind of the difference between those two halves for
you?  
KEENAN EVANS: I honestly don't know. I guess I just get aggressive later in
the game, and it's something that I have to do for my team. I've got to get to
the line, make plays, and just try to bring us to a win. Yeah, as the time
winds down, I've got to get more aggressive and more aggressive.  
  
Q. You guys took 10 threes in the first half, but only six in the second
half. How did you feel like you adjusted as started driving on them?  
KEENAN EVANS: We had to go to man to five, and we had to be aggressive. That's
one of the things. We got probably not even 10 free throws in the first half.
And one of our big deals is get to the free-throw line, and not only were we
jacking up threes in the first half, we were missing threes when we were
shooting them. So it was an adjustment to drive the ball more.  
  
Q. Keenan, was it about as intense and frenetic a game as you've played
in, and how physically and mentally exhausting was that?  
KEENAN EVANS: Definitely. I wasn't ready for it to end. And like Coach said,
they were everything we saw in film and watching them play. It was very
intense, very emotional, and I'm just glad we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Zhaire, what was it like playing in front of essentially a home crowd
while playing in the NCAA Tournament?  
ZHAIRE SMITH: It was a blessing to play here. I got the fans behind us, and
that motivated me and gave me energy to play harder.  
  
Q. Talk about they came out in the second half, really started -- I
think they hit their first six shots in the second half. What defensive
adjustments did y'all make at that point to cut them down the rest of the
way?  
NIEM STEVENSON: Just being aggressive. That's our motto right there, just
being aggressive on both ends of the floor. We had to play better one-on-one
defense, and that's how we got it done.  
  
Q. Niem, just obviously it was a game of runs, especially at the end of
that one. Keenan had a nice little run there, but you had a nice, little steal
that allowed him to get that fourth point and really kind of propelled you.
Just the defense that you played, what did you feel you did differently or the
whole team did differently to kind of get you guys on that run and sustain
possessions?  
NIEM STEVENSON: Just being aggressive, and I'm not going to lie, I was trying
to get it back. I just missed the lay-up. I was like, yeah, let me get that
back. So you know, just heart. So that's what we all had.  
  
Q. Chris, how much do you think it changed the complexion of the game
when Bogues got his leg cramps and Hoyfield got four fouls? Do you think that
changed them at all?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I'm sure from Kyle's perspective when you lose one of your
better players and he was playing so aggressive, absolutely. I think foul
trouble in the first half kind of put us in the same situation, but yeah, I
would think that Kyle would tell you that affected them because he's a really
good player that was playing so aggressive. We were game planning for him
every time-out.  
  
Q. Coach, you were running the high horn set a lot in the second half.
What were you trying to get out of that?  
CHRIS BEARD: A basket. (Laughter).  
  
No, Stephen F. Austin plays pressure defense. We put it in the same category
as West Virginia in our conference or South Carolina in our non-conference
schedule, so it's important to get the ball into play. You can do that
individually, a guy V-cutting or in and out or back cutting, but then
sometimes you've got to get some X's and O's involved to just make the first
pass, and the horn set was good to us in the second half.  
  
Q. You've already talked about the respect that you had for SFA, but
when you look at these seedings, they're definitely not a 14 seed, are they?  
CHRIS BEARD: No, they're a really good team. Look, they passed the eye test.
Make sure I get this right, I've watched so much film, but they beat LSU. They
lose to Missouri by one point. They've won true road games at places like
Louisiana Tech. They had a great run in their conference, which to me being a
Texas guy, I understand how good the Southland Conference is and how good the
coaching is. It's probably the most underrated conference, good basketball,
good coaches. They do what's to me the toughest thing to do in all of sports,
and that's to win your conference tournament after you've had a great season.  
  
I think it's more pressure filled in Game 7 of the NBA Finals or the Super
Bowl. I've never participated in those, but when I was at Little Rock, we had
a special season, and it gets down to that championship game of your
conference tournament, and you have to win it to advance. And it's a different
level of pressure and stress.  
  
So just the fact that Stephen F. Austin did that, that's all I needed to know
personally about how tough this team was. So I think they're a really good
basketball team, and we're just pleased to win the game. I've got a lot of
respect for their players and their coach.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned this to be a game of runs. You guys had that run
at the end with the defensive stop and then Zhaire had that nice little V cut
in there to get the dunk. What did you see from your team knowing that they
had to kind of grit your way to a grind-it-out victory?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah. I was really proud of that ending. That's something we've
been working on for two years. Finish was our motto. Last year when our season
ended sooner than any of us would have wanted, we regrouped, and we just
decided that the thing has got to be finished because we were so close last
year. So finishing doesn't just mean close games. It means finishing the
semester academically or finishing in the weight room your last couple reps or
finishing individual workouts, basically just a mindset to finish.  
  
Like in football, the whole fourth quarter deal, we wanted to finish. And
tonight on the biggest stage, the biggest game of the season, I thought we did
a great job finishing the game late. We had different players do it. Keenan
Evans is a great player. And everything he gets, he deserves, but we're a
team. And tonight when it's the Justin Gray pass or the Brandone Francis
corner three or the Zach Smith block, it's just great to see our plan, a team
win, where everybody embraces the idea of finishing. I thought we were a
confident team late, and I thought our coaching staff did a great job keeping
it positive, as well.  
  
Q. You guys didn't take your first lead of the second half until around
three minutes left, and obviously you busted it open the last few minutes. Can
you just explain what SFA was doing that was so efficient defensively
throughout the whole second half, and what was just so, I guess, an annoyance
just hanging around and being able to be productive?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yes, sir. I think I can answer that. They're one of the best
defensive teams in college basketball. They really are. Their turnover margin
I think is No. 1. I know we were telling our guys all week long, they cause
more turnovers or the differentials more than West Virginia. That got our
guys' attention. I can step up there and talk all night, and I don't know if
they'd listen or not, but when I say, hey, these guys make you turn it over
like West Virginia, they listen.  
  
So yeah, I just think it was them playing their game. They've been doing that
all year, whether it be their non-conference win, their successful run through
the Southland Conference, winning a championship in a conference tournament.
They are just a good defensive team. They do it in different ways. They'll
trap. They'll deny. They press. And above all, it's just discipline. It's a
Kyle Keller team. They're not going to make mistakes. They're hard. They're
tough. We're pleased to get this win. I would agree with the first question,
that's not a 14 seed. That's one of the best teams I think in college
basketball this year.  
  
Q. Brandone hadn't hit a couple threes in the last game, hitting some
open shots. That three he hit tonight, how big was that not just for him but
for the momentum?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, first I think we've got to talk about the pass. They
trapped the ball out of Keenan's hands. I think we made the extra. Then we
made the extra. The spacing was good. I was really pleased tonight. I think we
had 25 baskets, and we had 14 assists, so 14 assists on 25 baskets on 14
passes. That's the way we want to play. That's balanced. That's a little bit
of motion, but more importantly just spacing.  
  
And then Brandone has worked hard to earn the right to make that shot.
Brandone is a guy in our 300 club. He makes 300 every day, seven days a week.
I think you've got to give our student managers and the assistants, the guys
that put in the long hours following rebound on the ball. But that's a team
thing when a guy makes a shot like that, but I was proud of Brandone Francis.  
  
Q. As long as Keenan has been around here in college and suffering
through turf toe and ankle sprains, how much do you feel like he kind of
epitomizes college basketball?  
CHRIS BEARD: I think he's definitely a part of it, and I would put Carter from
West Virginia and Graham from Kansas. That's no disrespect to Graham. He's a
great player. But I think Keenan would have been the Big 12 Player of the
Year. I believe that. If I didn't believe that, then I shouldn't be coaching
at Texas Tech. But this guy is a special player, and I think his story is he's
not a McDonald's All-American. He's not even a top 100 guy, and he just gets
to school, and he gets to working.  
  
I think you've got to give Tubby Smith and his staff and Joe and Vince and
Pooh and those guys credit too. They laid the foundation. I have to give our
staff some credit. And then above all, you've got to give Keenan Evans credit.
This guy has willed himself into one of the best players in college
basketball.  
  
I think the one and done and the great players, that is a part of college
basketball. Those guys deserve it because they are so talented, but I think
the Keenan Evans story, the Jevon Carter story, the Devonte' Graham story,
these guys are just special. These are guys that just continue to get better.
I just love coaching him. I just don't want it to end. I want to coach that
guy another day. It is like when you go to a good movie and you know it's
getting towards the end, but you are loving the movie so much, you want it to
go a little bit farther. Or you've got a good plate of enchiladas and you're
looking at it, and you only have two bites left, but it's so good, you turn it
into three bites.  
  
I want it to keep lasting. I'm so glad we get to go back to the hotel, and I
get to coach these guys another day. I can't wait until tomorrow to prepare
and certain Saturday a chance to play again. But guys like Keenan make this
job great, and this is all about the players. And we've got good players.  
  
Q. What did you think about the beginning of the game and your team's
mindset and mentality in the early portion of the game?  
CHRIS BEARD: I thought our young guys looked a little bit star struck on this
stage. That's understandable. I thought our veterans did a good job kind of
calming them down. We had good productive time-outs. Patience is not one of my
strengths, pretty emotional guy. But I thought that the coaching staff did a
great job with me to kind of prepare me, long game, long game, let's hang in
there.  
  
So it wasn't our best of starts, but you've got to give Stephen F. Austin
credit. I hate the guy that sits up here and talks about we didn't play well
and never talks about the opponent. We didn't start the game well because
Stephen F. Austin is a really good team, and they took some things away from
us. But we did calm down. To be in the game at halftime, that is all you ask
for in this tournament. It's a long game.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Tennessee - 73, Wright State - 47  
  
RICK BARNES: Obviously we're happy with the win and the fact that we felt
coming in that Wright State would be as difficult a team that we've played all
year in terms of the way they move without the ball. They're really a team
that, you watching them on tape, you could tell they were just a terrific
team. They understood each other. They've had one of those special years, a
lot like we have.  
  
So from that point, defensively we were really pretty good today against a
team that's not a very easy team to guard.  
  
Offensively once we settled in, we settled in, and we missed some easy ones
early, but we settled in and got our offense going.  
  
Q. Admiral or Grant, how important was it do you think to get one under
your belt and kind of settle in to being in the tournament?  
ADAM SILVER: It's always important because if you lose, you don't get to play
again. But the biggest thing is we came out and did what we said we were going
to do, try to run them out of their offense, and against a great team, like
Coach Barnes said, a very special team that can shoot the ball. They're great
with movement away from the ball, and we guarded pretty well. But towards the
end of the game, we didn't do our job. We kind of let up on defense. So we've
got to tighten down in that aspect, but we're going to get a day off and
really recoup our bodies and our minds and get ready for whoever our next
opponent is.  
  
Q. How difficult of a prep was this the way they move on offense and why
were you guys so successful on that end of the floor today?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Well, we've prepared for an entire year for something like
this. We've played teams that are similar, that played similar basketball as
they do. With basketball, it's a lot of constant motion, and you just have to
understand these concepts. Really just going on the film and executing the
scouting report that the coaches lay out for us because they do an amazing job
with it. We trust them, and we go out on the court well prepared, and we just
do our jobs.  
  
ADAM SILVER: Like Grant said, our coaches do a great job of scheduling teams
that play different styles like this early in the year, and our strength of
schedule is important, and we get great teams like Lipscomb and different
other schools that run different schemes.  
  
We usually prepare early in the year, but at this time of year, you've got to
be ready because any team can get hot, especially in a tournament like this.
Everybody has a special year. Everyone is in good position at this time of
year. The biggest thing for us is, like Grant said, executing the scouting
report to a tee, just being able to go out and compete at a high level and
also give a good effort on defense, which is our identity, and offensively
just let things flow.  
  
Q. Grant, I think 20 rebounds in the last two games on a pretty big
stage. I know your coach -- it's a favorite topic for him. What's kind of been
the key to you improving in that area?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Really I've just been pursuing the ball more. Normally I try
and box guys out and make sure to keep them off the glass and allow other guys
to get it because that's just how I used to do it. But recently I've been
being more aggressive and being more pursuant of the ball. And just on the
other end, it all flows and comes kind of easily, so just got to put an
emphasis on one thing and harp on it.  
  
Q. He's not in here, but can you guys talk about Kyle and what he's
turning into on defense, how much is that a result of having a big guy in the
middle that's playing like Kyle is?  
ADAM SILVER: Well, Kyle is a game changer. He's very athletic, and when he's
locked in and ready to go, he can really affect the game defensively and
offensively, you know, getting us extra possessions on the glass and also
protecting the rim. And when he does that, he makes us a lot better on both
ends. He's really our anchor, really our X factor. But when he's really locked
in, he changes the game for us in a big way.  
  
Q. Grant, it looked like y'all were intentional about getting the ball
to you early to start the second half. And then maybe some outside shots
flowed out of that. Was that something y'all talked about in the locker room
or maybe how did that work?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Not really. We just run our offense, and we get good looks out
of it. We didn't harp on getting me the ball or nothing like that because I
don't really have to score the ball with this team. It's a team where we have
a lot of guys that can put the ball in the basket. Really just coming out and
executing what Coach calls, and we did a good job of that. We were moving the
ball well, and it led to open looks. It was important to just be aggressive
and do what we do.  
  
Q. Rick, it looked like you still had quite a bit of fire there on the
bench, even with under eight minutes left. You guys had a comfortable lead.
Were there some things that you wished y'all could have cleaned up a little
more in the second half there?  
RICK BARNES: Yeah, I think this time of year, you're looking for perfection. I
thought when we got the lead, even in the first half, I didn't think we
defended well in the last five minutes of the first half. I thought they
looked up, and I think the score was 23-8, 21-8, something like that, and I
just felt like we let down a little bit defensively.  
  
You know, it's a game of momentum, but when they started pressing, they went
with five guards -- you know, a big key, too, was Love getting in foul
trouble, and they were playing five guards a lot and just really going
downhill hard with the ball. We adjusted to that okay, but I thought, again,
with five guards at the end, you know they're going to trap and press. And we
were a little bit sloppy, just weren't on edge the way I want us to be. I just
think it's a game of habits. I want them to play every possession like it
matters.  
  
Q. Coach, the first five minutes of the second half are usually
typically pretty important, and up 11 anything can happen. How happy were you
with the way you guys opened the second half?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you know, we've tried to talk to these guys about a lot of
different things with this tournament, and actually one thing I forgot to tell
them is the longer halftime, and we were back there longer than normal. But
you watched us all year. We've been really good out at halftime. We've had ten
points lead where we've come out and let teams score four, five straight
possessions, and we just keep talking about -- I told them, we're not waiting
one possession. You'd better be locked in, because we had the ball, so you'd
better be locked in on the defensive end the first time we go down, and we
were. So that gets us started.  
  
I mean, we're better when we're locked in on the defensive end, and then
obviously Love was in the game. All we talked about was maybe at the end of
shot clocks putting him in ball screens if we needed to do that, but otherwise
we were just going to execute our offense.  
  
Q. Rick, how would you describe your Tennessee basketball team, and is
it not a team that can just out-talent other clubs?  
RICK BARNES: You're saying can we out-talent clubs? No, we've never looked at
that because one thing we've told our players, and we say it all the time,
everybody can play. I mean, I was really impressed with our team tonight
because we looked at this team, and they play hard. They do a lot of good
things. And we probably have better players that people want to give us credit
for, but I do know we've got -- I do think hard work is a talent. I don't
think that's a given. There's not everyone that works hard.  
  
Overall we've got a group of guys that have embraced that talent of working
hard, and they've -- we've tried to create our own standard, our own identity
in terms of how hard we think we can play on defense and on offense when we
stay together and execute -- I mean, we missed some shots at the beginning of
the game that we need to knock down, but that's part of the game, and you
expect some of that, especially in the opening game of this tournament. But we
settled in, and again, I think our players are probably a little bit better
certainly than people thought at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. What specifically did you like defensively in the first half as you
built that lead?  
RICK BARNES: Well, you know, we knew that they knew that we were a pressure
team, and we knew they would counter with back cuts, and they did a couple,
but we had pretty good ball pressure that they weren't able to really get that
pass. And they cut really hard. They do a good job of that.  
  
Our post defense was important. You know, with Love, he does such a great job
of creating angles. And if you let him catch it with a foot in the lane, it's
hard to guard. Our ball pressure was good early, but overall in our help line
was there, and we rebounded. We thought we had to rebound, and we thought we
could get to the offensive boards.  
  
Someone had told me they made a comment they wanted to play a little bit
faster to keep us off the offensive boards, but we felt we could get there,
and that probably got us going as much as anything, what we were able to do on
those second shots during the start of the game. And our ball screen defense
-- because they're very good at coming down in transition with drag screens.  
  
If you're not up there to touch, they can shoot the ball, and we just did not
want them coming off ball screens looking to raise up and shoot threes.  
  
Q. This is a little off topic, but former Texas baseball Coach Augie
Garrido passed away yesterday. I was wondering if you have a comment on his
passing.  
RICK BARNES: Sad day. Just many fond memories of Augie. I can remember seasons
would be going, and when things weren't going well, he was one of those guys
like Yoda. He always had a little something he could tell you. I remember we
were playing and struggling a little bit, and he came over and told a story
about -- they had won the National Championship at Fullerton. And next year,
he put so much pressure on his team, and he said he was with his mom one day,
and she had a picture, and she said, you notice when your guys won the
championship, you're holding the trophy. Why don't you let the kids hold it.
He said, I realized that day that it really is not about me. And he told me,
he said, the key to this, what you're doing, is can you get your guys to play
like little boys that love the game.  
  
But we had many, many -- I loved being around him. Sad day. I just hate it
when I heard the news the other day. But my time at Texas with he and Mack and
Deloss, there were so many memories, and we lost truly a beautiful
personality, and his baseball record and all that. But I loved him more as a
man than I did as a baseball coach.  
  
Tennessee - 73, Wright State - 47.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jaylen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32871)

### [Matt Mobley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32870)

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Florida - 77, St. Bonaventure - 62  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, all the credit goes to Florida. I thought they had a great
game plan coming in. They did a really good job on us defensively. You know,
especially on Jay and Matt. They just seemed like they were quicker than us.
They were longer than us. At times they dominated us on the ball.  
  
I thought our defense in the first half, we didn't play very well offensively
in the first half, but I thought being down by five going into the locker room
was a moral victory. I thought we were right there. We had the ball coming out
in the second half, and we always talk about -- talk to the team about the
first five minutes of the second half, the first ten possessions were going to
be critical, and they jumped on us. The first four minutes of the second half,
it went from five to 14 or whatever, and then we were fighting an uphill
battle from there.  
  
I'm proud of what we've accomplished. I'm proud of these two guys, along with
Idris, the three seniors, the things that we've done, that they've done, not
only this year, but through their career. It was disappointing the way it
ended, but I was proud the kids kept on fighting. We just lost to a better
team today.  
  
Q. The three-point shot was something that you really could rest on all
season, and lately it kind of went away, especially today, missing, I think,
it was just 3 of 18 or 19. Can you just talk about what happened to the shot
and how bad that was for it not to be falling versus a team this good?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: Credit Florida's defense. They were long and they were active
early, forced us into some tough shots. I think we played a lot of one-on-one
early and really moved the ball, took some bad shots, and it kind of affected
the rhythm. From there, we couldn't really stick any after that, so it's going
to be rough to win the game without the three.  
  
Q. Guys, four games in the last six days, travel to Dayton, travel from
D.C. and then fly all the way to Dallas. How much was fatigue a factor in this
loss?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I mean, I'm not one to make excuses, but it's one of those
things. We were a little gassed, you could tell. We weren't used to that many
games in that many days. But I think you have to credit more Florida's defense
than anything. Give all the credit to Florida.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, definitely Florida's defense was the credit for us losing
energy. That's about it. Not really any excuse to be tired. We've played a lot
of minutes before, we've played a lot of games before, but yeah, just credit
to Florida. They did a great job today.  
  
Q. Matt, you really led the charge during that comeback late in the
first half. Momentum seemed to be swinging in you guys' favor, you had a big
three, started at the free-throw line, then that dunk in transition. What
happened to start the second half? Obviously Florida's defense came out great,
but where did that momentum go?  
MATT MOBLEY: They came out, punched us in the mouth, and we couldn't really
get over the hump after that. So that's about it.  
  
Q. Best season this program has had since 1970. It's hard to think about
it right now, but can you guys talk about what this year and this run meant?
You guys are forever going to be remembered by that fan base that has showed
up for you guys all year.  
JAYLEN ADAMS: It's kind of hard to look at it right now. Historic season. I
couldn't be prouder of my teammates for the way we fought all year, from
losing that first game to that 2-4 start in conference, the way we battled
back and we fought to get here. I couldn't be prouder, like I said, of my
teammates and the seniors just for battling all year. It's not something that
we could think about, obviously, right now. It's a tough way to go out. But
like I said, I'm proud of my guys.  
  
MATT MOBLEY: I mean, yeah, can't really reflect on it right now. Maybe in a
couple days it'll really sink in how great we played this year. But just sad
that it had to end like this. But it is what it is. I mean, we had a great
year. Proud of my guys, like he said, and there's no one else I'd rather be
able to do it with than these guys, so I'm just thankful that we were able to
have a great year.  
  
Q. Mark, do you think that ultimately it just kind of caught up to you
guys in the end? Like Jay, four years, he's had such a leadership position, he
had done so much this year, Matt, also, that it just looked like they were
emotionally wiped out?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I don't know if emotionally. I think it's hard sometimes when
you get down, and we got down to Florida, especially in the second half. But I
thought today was the first day that our guys looked fatigued, both Jay and
Matt looked fatigued, and I don't know if that was because we had just played
48 hours ago or -- and some of it from a mental standpoint, when you play --
when Florida plays the defense that they played and it made it difficult for
them, it's hard sometimes to show emotion. You're just trying to fight to stay
alive.  
  
But Florida was ready. They did a really good job, and kudos go out to them.
They did a really good job of -- their game plan was good, and they executed
it and have great athletes. They played well.  
  
Q. Speaking to Jay just a few minutes ago, he said that he felt like it
started to catch up to him late in the season. If you watch your team close
enough, I think that's probably accurate.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, you know, I don't know. They've played a lot of minutes.
Jay played a lot of minutes, him and Matt played a lot of minutes over their
whole career.  
  
I think it might be -- we knew when we were 2-4 that every game -- when we
talked about the seventh game mentality, that every game we had to win if we
were going to get to this point. So there was a lot of pressure. And those
guys worked.  
  
People don't realize, it's just not practice. It's getting into the weight
room. It's individuals. It's a grind. You know, and when we were 2-4, to win
13 games, and we won some close games, and those guys worked. Jay --
particularly Jay, he has the ball in his hands all the time, so it is
draining. But I don't know if it was -- I don't know when it started to affect
him. You could tell today that he was a little bit fatigued.  
  
Even, I think, in the conference quarterfinals against Richmond, he asked to
come out early in the first half, and usually -- even if I want to take him
out, he doesn't want to come out. So there was some fatigue. But that's not an
excuse, like I said. Florida, they deserved the win. They were the better team
tonight.  
  
Q. What about the emotions, the range of emotions over the past week
where there's the uncertainty coming out of D.C., then you get in, and it's
like a short trip to Dayton, then you beat UCLA, you were emotional yourself,
and then you have to come down here. To get back up again, it's like a --  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, but this is a dream of a lifetime, for our players, for
the coaching staff. This doesn't happen every day. You know, so if this was
something that went on for two or three weeks, then it would be -- that
wouldn't be good. But we were on a high, and I think you can fight through for
a couple days, just through adrenaline. But I think when you get down by 15,
that adrenaline rush that you have is out the window, you know. And like I
said, give Florida credit; they got us down, and it was hard to fight through
it.  
  
Q. He wasn't out here with Jay and Matt, but can you talk about what
Idris has meant to this team over the last four years?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, I've been doing this a long time, and he's one of the top
five most unselfish players that I've ever coached. We don't run anything for
him. He never complains. He plays the hardest guy offensively. You look at him
tonight, and he had 13 rebounds. That sucker wasn't going to quit. He doesn't
have great skill, but he epitomizes the toughness that we try to play with and
the grit and the blue-collar approach. He's just a great teammate, someone
that -- winning is the most important thing. He could care less if he got one
point or 21 points. He wants to win, and it's been a pleasure coaching him.
He's come a really long way. But he's the glue of our team.  
  
Mat and Jay get a lot of the credit, and deservedly so, but without Idris in
that -- he brings us together. He's the glue. He makes all the big plays.  
  
People that don't know basketball don't appreciate it, but people that really
know the game really appreciate a guy like that, and for me, being a head
coach, he's -- I'm lucky to have the opportunity to coach him because there's
not a lot of guys, especially in today's world, where they would sacrifice
that much for their teammates and not shoot, and they'd be complaining about,
Coach, run a play, I'm not getting enough shots. He's all about winning, and
that's going to -- he's going to have a lot of success in his career because
of that.  
  
Q. You talked about the defense, their defense, a little bit in your
opening statement, but it seemed like every time you guys would get it back to
nine, ten, 11, they came up with a turnover, got an easy transition bucket.
Can you speak more specifically about what the Gators did that it seemed like
they were able to clamp down a little bit every time you got almost there?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, when a team is more athletic, longer and stronger -- I was
telling my SID, that's a bad trifecta, and Florida was longer, more athletic
and longer. So in a game like this, every -- it was hard to get open looks.
But when you do get open looks, you've got to knock them down, and we didn't
do that. When we got open looks for the most part, we missed, and they sped us
up. They were long. They did a good job getting to our shooters, knocking them
off the long. Then when we drove, their length really affected us in the
passing lanes. They did a really good job getting to our shooters, getting
into the gaps. They averaged 16 points off of turnovers, and one of the keys
going into the game was try to not allow them to get more than 16, and they
got 25, so we lost that battle. I'm a big guy on the columns in the right-hand
corner. That tells a lot about the game. And we lost every one of them. That's
a credit to Florida.  
  
Q. Mark, if you can, put the season in perspective. 26 wins, obviously
the 48 seasons, and what a year really.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, it's hard as a coach or as a player to -- losing stings,
and if it doesn't stings, you're not a competitor. But just thinking about
what we've done. Bonaventure has great tradition, way back to the Stith
brothers, and for us, for this team to break the record of the most wins
speaks volumes about our season, because the seasons before and the tradition
that we have, we've had great teams that have never done that.  
  
For us to win an NCAA game for the first time in 48 years is just -- it's
unbelievable, and I've said this -- and I told the seniors in the locker room,
you know, we're proud of what they've accomplished. When they got here, we
were building this program, and they are going to be known for it, not just
sustaining it, but making it more of a national program. And that's what I'm
proud of.  
  
You know, the wins are great, but we got the respect of the country now, and
it's taken a while to get that, but I'm just proud of what we accomplished.
You know, it's hard to put into words sometimes, especially now when we're
just coming off a loss. But we did some incredible things that -- the guys are
going to look back on years -- days, years from now and look like, wow. This
team is going to be remembered forever for what they've done. We can't allow
this one game here to jeopardize or to affect what we've done throughout this
year.  
  
So it's disappointing, but only one team ends -- or two teams, I guess, the
NIT, ends in a win. I'm happy that we were able to get this far, and I'm happy
for the seniors to be able to experience something that they've dreamed of.
