# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 19, 2018

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Robbi Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34723)

### [Kianna Ibis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34725)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 85, Arizona State - 65  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, obviously, we didn't have the game that we wanted
to have this evening. But I could not be more proud of this team and
everything that they accomplished this year.  
  
I guess I'll just start by thanking everybody here in Austin for the
hospitality. We have had, minus this particular game, a wonderful experience.
Thank the NCAA for hosting the championship and everything they do to make it
a first class experience. We really appreciate that.  
  
Then, obviously not the way we wanted to go out. We just didn't have it
working on all cylinders on either end of the floor, which is kind of rare for
us. But credit Texas, they played really well.  
  
We're a little bit undersized, so the physicality of the game kind of caught
up with us a little bit. I thought our team down to the last possession kept
their character, just kept playing hard. I'll take that over anything in the
country, so I'm really proud of them.  
  
Q. Robbi, in the first half of the game (Indiscernible)?  
ROBBI RYAN: Like Coach said, we're undersized, but we just need to play better
on team defense, and we didn't have our posts back. They got a lot of points
in transition, and we needed to pick it up. We were inconsistent throughout
the game with that, and they took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Kianna, it's a two-point game early in the third. You guys came out
fast in the third and that's when Texas took over. What was the biggest
difference after you guys had cut it to two to when they took over?  
KIANNA IBIS: I would say the biggest difference is rebounding. They just took
advantage of their size and they just kept on taking it to us when we weren't
ready. They just took advantage of it. Yeah, they just took advantage of the
mismatches, and we didn't have help side today. We didn't have great defense
today. We didn't play our best defense today, so they really took advantage of
that.  
  
Q. Kianna, you had 19 at the half, and you didn't take many shots in the
second half. I don't know if you were sitting a long time or what, but why did
you not take as many shots in the second half?  
KIANNA IBIS: I was just saying we were looking for different people to keep on
scoring. When they key in on me, anybody else on my team can score. So we just
looked at different options.  
  
Q. Did you like the tempo you all played at?  
ROBBI RYAN: Did I like it?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
ROBBI RYAN: I don't think we played fast enough throughout the whole game.
Just like I said before, Texas took advantage of that, especially in
transition offense. We didn't play fast enough to get back. We could have
pushed the ball better also.  
  
Q. How would you describe Texas' guards?  
ROBBI RYAN: They're very athletic. They're good players. They were on the
better end of the stick today.  
  
Q. Do you have a description of them?  
KIANNA IBIS: I would say they're really fast, and their senior guards really
took over today and they're really crafty players.  
  
Q. You guys have no seniors, but how far do you think -- a year away is
a long time, but how much will this experience help all the players that are
coming back?  
ROBBI RYAN: It will help tremendously. We're going to be the same team plus
adding a few new players. So all this experience will really help us. Each
year we're getting better and better, so even though this sucks right now, I'm
excited for next year.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you all kept Brooke McCarty in check until she went
off in the third quarter there with like ten points?  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah, I mean, we let different players kind of get hot. We just
were inconsistent. When the play gets hot, we've got to key on them and we
didn't. It's just one of the things that didn't work out for us today.  
  
Q. Why they faster than you expected?  
ROBBI RYAN: I didn't know what to expect.  
  
Q. You had talked about the need to try to slow down McCarty off the
long rebounds and in transition. She got ten boards tonight. How do you try to
stop that and why didn't it work tonight?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we didn't have a safety. We didn't have one in the
half, and we really had none back. We just didn't execute at all tonight,
nothing. Our whole game plan was don't give them points in the paint. I mean
we wanted to overhelp. We knew from the first minute of the game, their whole
game plan was just to rip and go on us. And we have to rely on help side; we
don't rely on, hey, I got you, don't worry about it.  
  
We play team defense, and we weren't in sync tonight. We weren't there for
each other. We let them iso us. We let them get to the point too easily. We
weren't tough enough and consistent enough on our boxing out. Yeah, we really
wanted -- our game plan was normally we'll come down and be very aggressive
and take the first good luck. We saw early that wasn't going to play well, and
we said no. We've got to be a little more patient, you know, and work the
ball, get to the other side.  
  
And they're good at defending your first and maybe your second action. After
that, we knew we'd get a great look. But it's a young team. So they get all
happy out there, and we didn't stick with the game plan as well as we could.
We just missed.  
  
I mean, we were on fire in the shootaround, on fire in warm-ups, and it's so
funny because as Coach says, it doesn't mean anything. The game starts and
you're hot, and we had some really good looks that we didn't hit. But more
importantly, we just didn't defend. We just don't give up this many points.
This has to be the most we've given up all year. We just weren't in sync
defensively.  
  
Obviously, I said it before we played this team, McCarty-Atkins is just a
great combo. Playing with a sense of urgency. Obviously we gave them way too
many looks. It didn't help us that our starting center had two fouls before we
could blink. They really never let -- I mean, that's the key to shut down
(Indiscernible), okay, and she was standing on the play. So she didn't get to
play.  
  
That hurt us, that hurt us a lot. That hurt our rotation, and our interior
defense, and she's one of our best help side defenders. They called it, so it
is what it was, but obviously that affected us.  
  
Q. Did you think communication on defense was what you wanted it to
be?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, definitely not. And they said that at halftime. They
have to talk better. We were just out of position, you know? It was kind of
like we were in the Nebraska game. We didn't have our help side in the
Nebraska game, and we said, you guys we cannot worry about the three point
shots. We are in. We know they're going to drive a lot. You know, we just
didn't quite lock in.  
  
Q. Were you surprised Texas went small in the first half? They went with
12 guys.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, they've been doing it quite a bit. We anticipated
that. We figured Kianna's a tough match-up for anybody. When they went small,
put her inside. They went big, and we put her on her shots. It's hard to know
how to guard her really.  
  
It's hard because we need three people going, and we only had her going today.
We didn't get our other scorers going, and that was tough.  
  
Q. Yet, Coach, you were within two points early in the third and
something broke loose. Was there a turning point, a play, something specific
that happened that went the other way?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I think that's the difference between a senior-
junior team, and a sophomore-junior team. We're right there, and then all of a
sudden we go back to a quick shot, safety lay-up. Then we carried that over
and would let it bother us and we'd get a silly foul.  
  
It was, to me, just that level of experience and maturity where even though
we've been that team that's done it to other teams, obviously Texas is a
little better at it than us. We needed to respond a little bit quicker. Next
year's going to be very exciting. We just didn't have any depth this year too.  
  
We see our guards. We just got tired. Everybody wants to talk about us
subbing. Texas is the one subbing a ton of people. I'm like why are you having
me sub? I don't have depth. I don't have one guard in the rotation. And then a
freshman who did a mice job for us. We have two, but we were pretty limited
this year.  
  
That's why I'm just so proud of this too. We just toughed it out. That team as
physical, fast, explosive as they are, coming, coming, coming, you would have
loved to have two more players to keep up with them. Because I thought we were
down a little bit, and we overplayed Kianna a little bit too.  
  
Q. You guys lose Sabrina early on and still find a way to finish
impressively in conference play. What is the outlook looking for this program
for next year?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think we're very excited to be back up to like a Top
10 level next year. We're going to be the senior-junior team next year. The
kids that we have coming in are really, really good. Really good. It's going
to be exciting to have the depth and experience. We're going to look a lot
more like the teams that are still playing right now, with just that great
depth and more scoring.  
  
But, again, these guys, you've got to love them. They battled and fought
through. If we had one more guard, if we had Sabrina, I know that obviously
that would have made a huge difference in terms of being able to sustain like
Texas sustained because that's the difference. The top teams, the elite teams
just sustain it.  
  
Q. How do you see the Texas match over UCLA?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, they're both great transition teams. I think it's
going to be a fantastic game. I think Texas probably has a little more depth.
I think both have really good seniors.  
  
So I think UCLA's challenge might be the inside game a little bit, but they've
handled that with Oregon and Stanford and other teams in our conference. But
it's going to be a track meet. It's going to be a really fun game.  
  
Q. Did you do anything special for Brooke McCarty early with screens
because she's so small?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we were just trying to get up over her, you know,
chase her over and we just got soft. We played soft on a couple possessions,
and then I think one she might have gotten on the kickout. I can't quite
remember. But Robbi was on her, Robbi had been guarding Atkins, and Robbi's
not ready for the refusal, so it was just a tough night.  
  
Q. Tough night to guard?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, yeah. No excuses. Hat's off to Texas. Karen's done
an unbelievable job with that program. We played like Mississippi State. We
played everybody in our conference. There are three Top 10 teams right there,
maybe four, and Texas is as good as any of them. So I'm sure they'll -- it
will be interesting.  
  
I got to back the Pac so, go Bruins, but, I do think Karen's done a great job
and they have a great team.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 85, Arizona State - 65  
  
KAREN ASTON: I'm just incredibly proud of our basketball team. Just the effort
that the entire team put forth tonight, in particular in the second half. The
energy and enthusiasm that they're playing the game with right now, and then
just the fact that this is our fourth year in a row to go to the Sweet
Sixteen.  
  
You can almost tell that -- I don't want to say they're getting used to it,
because we told them not to ever take it for granted, but you can tell that
they expect this. I know they want bigger and better things, but this is a
great accomplishment for these particular seniors. Just because all four years
they were able to do this.  
  
But, again, there's a few upsets came about today, and I told them in the
locker room not to ever take this for granted, or not to appreciate how great
of a season and in particular these two how great their careers have been.
Really, really proud of our team.  
  
Q. Brooke, you weren't having the greatest game ever, by your standards.
In the third quarter you erupted and took over. What was your mindset when you
went on that 12-point quarter?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: I just went out there and played, and whatever was open, I
took it. My teammates did a great job finding me. They did a great job with
box being out and stuff like that. So I just tried to help them as best I
could.  
  
Q. Were you disappointed in yourself before that point?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: I think every player's disappointed if they don't think
they're playing up to their standards. But right now it's not about being
disappointed. My team was playing great. So it's not anything that's on my
mind. I'm more focused on our team winning.  
  
Q. Ariel, all that said, they're looking at you like you were just kind
of showing off in the third quarter because you were so dominant? Did it seem
like she was show being off because she was so good in the third quarter?  
ARIEL ATKINS: It was Brooke. I started smiling halfway through because I just
realized this kid was going off. It was really fun to be playing with her and
seeing her smiling. Just seeing her being Brooke again, free flowing. She was
having fun playing the game.  
  
Q. Ariel, 42 was a problem for you guys in the first half, getting to
the line, making shots. What did you all do to take her away in the second
half?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we did a better job of guarding her as a team, and not
leaving whoever is guarding her individually on an island.  
  
Q. LaShann, you had a hot first quarter. What did you see out there and
what was going well for you?  
LASHANN HIGGS: Well, I realized that at the ball reversal there were lots of
driving lanes. So I tried to take advantage of it. Just tried to be aggressive
for my team and these two ladies right here next to me.  
  
Q. You guys shot 61% two games in a row now. Is the offense just
clicking better right now than it did during the season? If so, why?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I would say that it's having more discipline on the offensive
end. The discipline to reverse the ball. The discipline to make the right
pass. I would just say it's becoming more of a team effort. So I think that's
the reason why.  
  
Q. Brooke, could you describe the sense of urgency y'all played with
tonight?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: I think it was just the excitement of being here for the last
time. I mean, Arizona State's a great team, and our fans were incredible
tonight. So we just fed off of their energy and we fed off of each other. We
knew this would be the last time we'd be able to play in front of our fans
this year, especially on our homecourt. So we decided to go out there and give
it our all.  
  
Q. How did you not cry when you came out of the game? Neither one of you
cried.  
BROOKE MCCARTY: Oh, you know, I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you address getting back to the Sweet Sixteen for a fourth time.
What kind of standard of excellence do you feel like the senior class is
having?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: Well, I think it goes back to our coaches. Their body of work
is amazing. When you follow something like that, you have no choice but to be
great. So I think it just goes out to them and how hard they work. Everybody's
just following suit. Everybody's buying into the process. Everybody's buying
into the program.  
  
So I think this is what Texas should be every single year, but like Coach
said, we can't take it for granted.  
  
Q. Ariel, it seems like we've been talking about this for weeks now. But
it is your last game now. Your emotions, your thoughts about playing in it,
especially playing at your best when it was your last game?  
ARIEL ATKINS: You trying to get me emotional? Yeah, it is hard. Coming into
this program I was honestly blessed by God and for him to carry me all the way
through this. Just to be a part of it and see it grow from the ground up. It's
been a journey, and I'm really thankful and blessed to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Brooke, you've got ten rebounds tonight, game high ten. When you're
getting at it, and turning and moving, what is the first thing in your line of
vision is you're heading back to the court in transition?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: I think our guards run really hard in transition, and Coach
has been preaching that we need a rim runner, and I'm just looking up to see
whoever is open at the time.  
  
As far as rebounds, we just go back to how hard our posts work. They boxed out
really hard tonight, and they had their hands full with the two posts on the
other team. I just tried to clean up anything we could, because especially for
the guards to get into the rebounding game.  
  
Q. Ariel, do you think you guys are playing your best ball of the season
right now?  
ARIEL ATKINS: There are definitely some things that we can clean up, but I
think we have progressively gotten better over the year.  
  
Q. When you were almost subbed out by Coach, you both sort of stood on
the logo and looked up. What did that feel like and what did you say to each
other?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I don't think we said anything. I actually realized that that
was it. You know, you look up and there's a minute left on the clock, probably
not getting back in.  
  
Q. Did you want to go back in?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think our younger players were doing a good job. I think
they're learning. I think when somebody's number is called, they're showing
up. So whatever Coach puts on the floor, I feel like we can produce.  
  
Back to the last part subbing out, I just kind of looked around and looked at
Brooke and I was like, wow, it was kind of moments like we're actually done
here. So, yeah.  
  
BROOKE MCCARTY: I think she said it all. Yeah, I think at that moment we just
realized it was our last time playing in front of our fans. Playing here at
the Erwin Center. Just can't put it into words.  
  
Q. Mide was amazing tonight. Your thoughts on her having this breakout
game when you really needed that inside force?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Mide's been working hard all year. If you guys followed her
closely, she's honestly probably one of our most improved players over her
time here. So for her to go out and allow herself to be awarded for her work
tonight was just so amazing. I'm so proud of her for her game tonight.  
  
BROOKE MCCARTY: Her number was called and she was ready. I think that
everybody's saying this is a breakout game, but this is where Olamide shows us
every day in practice. And just to see her have fun with it and go out there
and really just want to fill her role and be the best that she can. Especially
with her smile. I don't know if you saw her smile, but I'm just really proud
of her, like Ariel said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: LaShann anything else?  
  
LASHANN HIGGS: They said it all.  
  
Q. Ariel, how much do you know about UCLA?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I actually do know some of them that play on that team. They
have a good point guard, and they can rebound the ball very well.  
  
Q. Is there any sense of relief getting past? You expected to win. You
played two games at home, but you said you can't take it for granted.  
KAREN ASTON: I wouldn't call it relief in the sense of, well, yeah, we made it
from an expectation standpoint. It's more I'm glad we're rewarded. So when you
start to think, today, all day long, it was a long day. My thoughts were more
towards them getting rewarded for the work.  
  
I mean, I know you have to go out there and play, nobody's going to hand it to
you. But sometimes as a coach, you have teams and it's like they win and maybe
they didn't deserve it. But this is a team that I think they earned it, and I
wanted them to perform at their best, and I thought they were pretty close to
that in these two games. You put the two games together, and they've been
pretty ready. I'm proud of that.  
  
Q. The luxury of having senior guards who can take over a game that was
not as crisp as you had wanted, could you tell us a little bit about what your
thought processes were in the third quarter as you watched your seniors show
their experience and took over that game?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I've had a lot of trust in them all year long, and there's
been a lot of games that I've had the privilege of watching them take over.
Today was -- I mean, I was really proud that Brooke decided to take shots. I
mean, sometimes that's what it boils down to for Brooke.  
  
She's really embraced the point guard role this year, and it's crazy to say
because she's obviously been the point guard for the last two years solidly.
But this year there's been sometimes where she hasn't taken shots in games
where we maybe necessarily needed her to, because we do have a lot of options.
I thought she let the game come to her today.  
  
She could have forced some stuff in the first half, but I think she could
recognize that LaShann was sort of rolling in the first half. But I thought
that -- and I think that's the great thing about our guard play is that once
one gets going, I think people forget about the other ones, and I think that
may be a little bit of what happened in the second half and some stuff opened
up for her that wasn't there. But what she's grown into as a point guard is
one that doesn't force the issue.  
  
I thought she just -- I thought maybe it was the excitement and the nerves
maybe the first half. But I thought she got us into flow better in the second
half also. It wasn't just about the scoring. I thought she was a better floor
general in the second half.  
  
The first half she seemed a little -- we seemed, not just she, but we all
seemed a little rattled maybe because of the early foul trouble, and we threw
some combinations in there that weren't normal. But I just thought that she
was in a much better flow and pace in the second half, terrific half.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on these two playing their last game at the Erwin
Center and what that means to you?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, it's a great feeling to know that -- I mean I think any
senior, when it's all said and done, what they want to look back on, I mean,
you just want to always say I did the best I could. I think I maxxed out.
Whether it be -- the greatest feeling of all is to win a championship and be
done, because there are no regrets from there, but that hasn't happened but to
one team every year.  
  
So the rest of them have to finish up and say, okay, did I do my best? Did I
absolutely max out with my career and those two can sleep well. I mean, that,
as a coach, you're really happy for players that know that they're ready to
move on at some point, and they've gotten the most out of their careers. And I
think those two have.  
  
Q. How nice has it been to see this team really take care of business
and have -- I don't want to say they were easy games, but relatively stress
free coming down the stretch. So whatever you've seen today and yesterday, a
handful of upsets of higher seeded teams losing at home, and teams really
having to -- and other teams really having to sweat it out at the end of
games?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think that it just goes back to their preparation and the
fact that you can tell that they're not ready for this to be over.  
  
I've experienced teams that leapt into postseason play, and you might have a
few that just give you this vision that I'm ready to go do something else for
a few months or this team has never given me the impression of that. I mean,
even when we've had failures, they've come back the next day ready to go, and
their preparation was really good for this tournament.  
  
I thought we were ready to play against Maine. I thought we were ready to play
today. I think they're showing that. So it's good to see that they're still
climbing. They're hungry. I don't think they're satisfied with anything, and
that's fun to coach.  
  
Q. During shootaround today, did you have the players visualize the
Sweet Sixteen banners? Is that the legacy of at least the two seniors?  
KAREN ASTON: I think that's one of their legacies. I know they're striving for
more. But we definitely looked up and noticed that. I think 1990 was the last
year that there was a run of Sweet Sixteen appearances. I think I was actually
fortunate enough to be here in the three in a row, and the 2000s, and then the
three in a row that we were on until today.  
  
So just, you know, wanted to let them visualize that and see that they could
make a little bit of history or do something that hasn't been done in quite
some time.  
  
We've kind of lost the numbers game since Imani graduated. So every once in a
while LaShann has to tell me something to remind them, because Imani did that
for everybody. She did all the numbers homework. But LaShann is the one that
made me aware of that. I mean, we're just living in the moment. I didn't even
think about it. But, yeah, that's a great legacy for players.  
  
Again, their look in the locker room was pretty relaxed. I mean, that's a big
deal.  
  
Q. There wasn't a wild celebration?  
KAREN ASTON: Not at all. Not at all. I think they were more worried about
where was the food. Half of them had pretzel they were already eating. Yeah, I
think they have bigger goals for sure.  
  
Q. Talk about the challenge UCLA presents to you?  
KAREN ASTON: Yeah, they're really good. Seeing them a lot, just randomly
watching Pac-12 games in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, then
we've got to look at them, not purposely, but in prepping for Arizona State.  
  
We're very familiar with them. We've played them. We've scrimmaged them. We're
very familiar and they're a really, really good basketball team, but I thought
Arizona State was. I thought we did a great job on the boards tonight.  
  
I'm so proud of our team just in a sense of how good Arizona State has been on
the boards at times this year. Looking here and they have five offensive
rebounds. I think they had five at half. So I'm not sure if that's right, but
I'm pretty sure it is. So really great job.  
  
Q. Mide had 7 boards in 11 minutes and she seemed to be an inspiration
to the other players. Could you talk about what she was doing that inspired
the others?  
KAREN ASTON: She was defending. I mean, let's start right there because we
were having some trouble with our post players in the first half. She decided
to kind of get up the line and kind of keep them from catching the ball a
little bit. She got on help side and made that block. She did some really
simple stuff tonight that made the difference in winning and losing, really
simple.  
  
Q. The farther you go in this tournament, the bigger the teams get.
Post-wise she could be a factor. What's her mindset that told you she was
ready to answer the bell and you called her number?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, the thing that I noticed about Mide this year as we've gone
a long is that she's put in the work, Ariel's absolutely right, and her
improvement has been quite dramatic. What's been holding her back is letting
go and performing in a game the way she performs in practice. So I think this
was a breakthrough.  
  
And she's had a few other moments where it's been encouraging for me to feel
like she would do the things that we need her to do. But this was definitely a
breakthrough in a big moment, which should give her an enormous amount of
confidence as we move on.  
  
I mean, she definitely has done the work. It's just been transferring that
into the games.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Obviously, excited to be continuing to prepare. With
Texas, it's hard to find any chinks in their armor. They're an incredibly
talented team, they play fast, great transition team, great rebounding, good
depth, obviously led by their senior back court. It's very, very formidable.  
  
But we're excited. It's a fun challenge. We've played this level of
competition day-in and day-out in the Pac-12, so it should be fun.  
  
Q. I'd like to put a question to each of you. You were in a similar
situation last season. You were in Columbia, South Carolina. You took the
National Championship team to the brink. You were within one minute of that
upset. What did that feel like walking off the court to lose that that day,
and what did you take from that experience into tomorrow now night?  
KIARA RUSSELL: It was an amazing feeling that we just emptied out and played
with each other. It obviously came down to one possession, with the missed box
out. But we just came back, we grouped, and we're here again.  
  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: Yeah, kind of like she said, it came down to one
possession, so we just took that. You've got to pay attention to all the
little things. You've got to do every little thing right and you have to go
hard every possession.  
  
REILI RICHARDSON: I think it was an awesome atmosphere to play in, and just
the little things are really important, and we're here again, and we have
another chance.  
  
Q. May I ask the same type of question for all three. Texas talks about
the advantages of sleeping in their own bed through the tournament. They're at
home. They get the comfort of home fans. You guys as opponents, how much more
difficult is it to be an opponent in a situation like this rather than playing
at home?  
KIARA RUSSELL: Yeah, Texas fans are going to be crazy and all that. But we
just have to focus on each other, focus on the game. Can't focus on anything,
it's about the little things and we'll be fine.  
  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: Yeah, we have to stay connected with each other. We
have to make sure we have eye contact, make sure we're talking. Make sure team
touches and make sure we're all on the same page so we can't let the
atmosphere bother us.  
  
REILI RICHARDSON: I think it's awesome to play in games like this, and it
comes down to just being connected with each other.  
  
Q. Reili, as a point guard, how will you control the tempo of the game?
Is how important will it shall for you as a guard to get back on defense?  
REILI RICHARDSON: We've played really good transition teams before, so we have
experience.  
  
Q. Charnea, you guys were a fantastic rebounding team yesterday,
especially on the offensive boards. Texas has a very good defensive rebounding
team too. What's it going to take to offset their strengths, which appears to
be a strength of yours too?  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: Just stepping to them first and boxing them out. Like
a lot of teams can just jump, go straight up and then it's a 50-50 chance who
is going to come down with it. But if you hit them first, you'll have the
advance. So we're going to focus on stepping to them and not stepping in and
hitting them before they hit us.  
  
Q. I kind of wondered, as a player, there is a lot made about homecourt
advantage. But I'm kind of wondering as a player in a tournament like this, if
it doesn't in some way give you an advantage because you've kind of approached
this thing as a unit. You're staying in the same hotel. You're not kind of
spread out all over the city. Is there anything that playing on the road is
maybe even better than playing in front of your home crowd tournament time?  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: I mean, I guess it depends on who the team is or the
opponent. It's always a challenge playing on the road. But like I said, just
being connected and playing for each other and playing for a bigger purpose
than ourselves, it's always going to be fun.  
  
KIARA RUSSELL: Yeah, I feel like a home game or an away game, as long as
you're connected and you're focused on the little things you have to do and
your goals, you'll be good.  
  
Q. Do you guys get energized by the crowds even when the crowd is
pulling for the other team?  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: I do, personally.  
  
Q. Why is that?  
KIARA RUSSELL: It's kind of fun to like shut up the crowd. I don't know.
That's just me.  
  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: It's a lot of energy. Because a lot of times the
crowd is like the other team does something and they're still making noise.
Like I can't really hear specifically what they're saying, but the fact that
they're making noise is in my head like, oh, they're cheering for us now.  
  
REILI RICHARDSON: I think just shutting up the crowd, like Kiara said, and
just pushing back.  
  
Q. Yesterday y'all didn't shoot that well from three points in the first
half. Tomorrow night might you be hesitant to shoot a lot of three pointers
because they can get lead to long rebounds and that could contribute to upping
the tempo?  
KIARA RUSSELL: I'm just going to say that we're playing with confidence.
Everybody's going to have times where they're going to take their shots.
They're also going to look inside and out. So we'll have each other's back by
rebounding.  
  
Q. Charli, about that close loss last year, this round, I guess how much
did it hurt that team to have that opportunity slip away, and how much do you
think they carried that experience into tomorrow night?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, Robbi made a good comment yesterday. She's like it
just made us hungry. Each player is a little different on how they think about
it and remember it. We had some really good seniors in that game, and we don't
have anymore.  
  
But that's the incredible part of this team. We don't have one person in our
starting lineup that was a full-time starter last year. So for them to be in
this position right now is just, you know, a super credit to them and how hard
they've worked.  
  
But Arizona State basketball, we're about winning, we're about championships,
we're about making deep runs. We didn't want to be knocked out. We knew it was
more us than them. I think that's what they knew. We had an untimely turnover,
we had a missed box out, and that's what they keep saying things like, we had
it and we didn't take it, and they know that.  
  
So I think what it does in a nutshell, it gives them confidence that they
absolutely can win this game, you know? And we have these types of
environments in our conference, and we talk all the time about mastering the
environment. You know, just master the environment and you're going to be
fine.  
  
So the things that they're saying, the things that we talk about in that
regard, so I think -- again, unless the biggest thing that happens is people
start playing as individuals. So you hear them echoing to stay connected, stay
connected, and that will be huge for us tomorrow.  
  
Then we have to execute and hit shots and play good basketball as well.  
  
Q. Reili mentioned the tempo before this season. Do you do anything
different? Instead of sending one guard back, you send two guards back?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We kind of do that. We play a three and a half, we have
a safety and a ball stopper. With this game sometimes we'll say, hey, just two
safeties. Our ball stopper has been fairly ineffective this year. She's been
too tired. We're not getting to the ball the way we normally do.  
  
We had a pretty good discussion on that this morning leading into practice. We
don't have a scout team. We're not practicing. We're not getting to practice
our transition defense. But it is one of the biggest things we worked on after
the Pac-12 tournament to now.  
  
So I'm confident that we'll be solid in it. I do think it's one of the biggest
keys is our rebounding to win this game. So your question is right on point,
and long shots, long rebounds, long rebounds lead to quick transitions. You
know, we just shot too many threes in the first half last night. That's just
not us. But I think we're going to start with ball stopper safety, and try to
get our ball stopper to actually get to the ball, which we haven't been doing.
We didn't do that great last night.  
  
But we're athletic. We can get back with them. I think we're plenty fast
enough. We just have to get a jump. I thought we had too many soft possessions
in transition last night for sure, and we've got to clean that up for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Because Texas is such a good defensive team, if you're not able to
control the tempo the way you like it, how will you go about your half court
offense to try to create?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, and we had 15 points in transition, so we got
going a little bit yesterday. We'll definitely try, obviously, to get their
defense because it is so good.  
  
We just, really for us, Texas has pressure. Sometimes they just don't guard
people. We're not exactly sure how they're going to play us, but we've seen it
all. I think it's probably -- obviously it's going to be a lot harder to get
that many second shots. So we have to be more efficient, and we have to finish
our plays better. Get the ball to our top scorers better, get more touches for
them. Just execute better overall because it's very unlikely that we're going
-- however many offensive rebounds we had last night, they're probably going
to be a lot stingier about it.  
  
Q. After the game yesterday Coach mentioned you guys were forcing your
shots too much. What is going to be key for tomorrow to get back on track?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Kind of what I just said. Not forcing, executing.
Getting to the next action when they take away an action. Also just sometimes,
obviously purposely our plays are designed to get the person the shot at the
end of the action, after four possible looks because you get to this point,
defense is so good and people take things away.  
  
So we just have to be patient. We have to wait on the screens. We have to
read. They're going to be chasing us over screens and not switching like
Nebraska did. So, I actually think some of the less -- switching of the
screens might make it a little bit -- I don't know if it will be easier, but
it will be something that we've probably played against a little bit more.  
  
But, yeah, this is something we worked on a lot in the break too. Just better
execution. We're out there and we're half speed, and we're not waiting on
screens, not cutting hard, we're bad. That was us in the first half against
Nebraska. I thought we cleaned it up a little bit in the second half, and we
just have to build on that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I believe it's been four years now that the NCAA went to the format
where top four seeds are playing at home. One, do you favor that because it
generates more fans to venues, or do you think it's unfair that three teams
have natural road games where one team has the comforts?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, obviously big
picture-wise we want our tournament to draw. We want people in the stands. We
want it to be an atmosphere for the student-athletes, for everybody, for
television. We want to be good television. So I get it. I understand.  
  
Obviously as coaches, being a very old coach, we fought for the neutral site.
Then when we had the neutral sites and we couldn't draw in them.  
  
Obviously, from a competitive equity standpoint you like neutral sites. But
you've got to take all the parts into consideration and all the parts are, you
know what, you need -- we want television to want us. We want atmosphere and
stuff. I think it's hard.  
  
We'd love to get back to the point where we have neutral sites and we have
full stands and big crowds. But we are just not there right now.  
  
Q. Because you sub a lot or very quickly, defenses don't get used to the
personnel on the floor because you might be subbing every three to four
minutes. How might that play an advantage for you tomorrow?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I mean, Nebraska had a lot more depth than us, and
Texas has a lot more depth than us, and they're both playing more people than
we play.  
  
We're just playing hard and get tired. I don't think three to four minute
rotations are that short. But it's going to be really important that our bench
steps up. I thought they did yesterday big time. Sophia and Jamie, and
obviously Kiki, and I thought Junior, Bre Sanders, gave us some quality
minutes off the bench, and that's going to be huge again.  
  
We had such a short rotation I have to sub some people quickly, because I kind
of have a four-guard rotation. If they all get exhausted at the same time, I
can't sub them all. So that's part of our guard rotation.  
  
And the post just kind of feeling the game out. We got in foul trouble a
little bit too, and that didn't help us yesterday with our rotation.  
  
Q. I don't want you to give out your game plan right now.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Don't worry, I won't.  
  
Q. When you think of trapping Brooke out of a pick-and-roll or the
guards out of a pick-and-roll to have more pressure especially on the half
court?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I guess you'll just have to see, huh?  
  
Q. Does Texas remind you of any team you've played this year?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Just off the top of my head last night I kind of likened
them to Oregon in our conference, because Oregon is big, very big inside.
They're a great transition team, and they have a great back court. Pick-and-
roll, Peck and roll, on-ball screen, action, every possession. That's a
comparison, so. We held Oregon in our second game. We just didn't score. Yeah,
we had about 20, 25 points below their average.  
  
Q. In tournaments?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, it was the last home weekend of conference. But
obviously they're different, but that's probably the best comparison. The
difference is everybody gets in the last weekend of conference and everybody's
tired. Then everybody gets fresh. The transition game is back going and that's
what Texas has. Then we have to be ready for that.  
  
Q. Very competitive (Indiscernible) some tall post players, how is it
going to be facing a team like Texas?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I think with Oregon State, with Stanford, we've
definitely played teams with good, effective bigs. I think early in the season
we struggled with it, and as the season went on, we got a lot better at
handling the bigs, because we're obviously not a very big team. So I think we
feel confident that we can be solid and get some.  
  
Q. Are you concerned because they are such a big team that sometimes
guards who dig and help bigs out?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You keep wanting me to tell you how we're going to
defend them. Yeah, you've got to pick your poison, huh?  
  
Q. Do you ever talk with Tara about anything?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, never. No, I'm just kidding. I'm joking. I played
for Tara at Stanford. You know, you like Xs and Os and even strategy or?  
  
Q. Or even friendship. I don't know.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Usually when we see each other. We always text each
other, and what she says is the best. Obviously as my college coach, I have
great respect for her. I probably once or twice over the years I have maybe
called and asked her a question or something. I don't think she's called and
asked me a question.  
  
But we share scouts during this time of year, and mainly just best wishes and
stuff, birthday wishes and things like that.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

### [Jatarie White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34773)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
KAREN ASTON: Super excited to be able to play in front of our fans one more
time this year. I think that it's been a terrific season for our team and to
be able to get on center court one more time will be special for us. I think
this is going to be a very challenging match-up for our team.  
  
I have a lot, a lot of respect for Charli and the way she coaches. I've known
her for a long time. Her teams have some tendencies about them that are always
the same. They're extremely competitive, play defense as good as anybody. And
this particular team has been very impressive on the board. So I think it's
going to be a real challenge for our team, so we're excited to play and
looking forward to tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jatarie, can you talk about the match-up you're going to have under
the basket? They were very physical against you?  
JATARIE WHITE: Yeah, we saw them a little bit in the third quarter yesterday.
I thought they were very physical offensively in the post and also defensively
playing the other team's big girl. I saw them make a lot of turn around
jumpshots and mid-rain not shots, also post moves to the basket. So we
definitely have to play post defense and respect them inside.  
  
Q. Ariel, I know you want to approach every game exactly the same, but
is it a different feeling when the Sweet Sixteen is on the line and it's a
major conference opponent, versus just opening up a tournament against a
smaller school like Maine?  
ARIEL ATKINS: You've got to be focused. We're really going to have to put our
preparation into play and do what our coaches ask us to do.  
  
Q. Ariel, I think you were a freshman, went to Cal. Can you describe the
difference between the challenge of playing at Cal and the comforts of playing
at home the last three years?  
ARIEL ATKINS: That was definitely a challenge, just as far as time. You don't
think that you notice it, but once you get to playing, you know you have to
get to sleep and wake up the next day, it's definitely a challenge. It's
definitely a blessing to be able to play at home our first round.  
  
Q. As one of the bigger guards, how important will rebounding be, not
just from the post perspective, but the guard perspective as well?  
ARIEL ATKINS: It will be extremely important. It's important for our team,
period, to help our post rebound more. I think we need to rebound more as a
team versus depending on ourselves all the time.  
  
Q. The nerves for you guys as a team, there's got to be a certain set of
nerves when you're just starting the tournament in that first game versus this
game where you feel like there's so much on the line. There is so much to be
said about making the second week and making the Sweet Sixteen. What is the
difference in starting the tournament and trying to advance as a team?  
JATARIE WHITE: I think it's kind of the same all the way through. The first
game you just kind of for the freshmen, the younger players getting out there
and getting their feet wet and stuff like that. But it's survive and advance,
so we have to treat every game like it will be our last game. So every game
has to be -- we have to come out our hardest and our strongest every day.  
  
Q. Yesterday Arizona State didn't shoot very well from three in the
first half, I think they shot three for 13. Three pointers can lead to a long
rebounds from a guard perspective. Are you going to be looking to get those
rebounds and push the ball if they're long rebounds?  
ARIEL ATKINS: We would like to push the ball, but we have to start off with
rebounds.  
  
Q. How much more difficult is it to prepare at this point in the season
when you're not as familiar with the next team than it was when you were
playing Big 12 teams that you're familiar with?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Definitely have to be more focused. In the film room you have to
have a more keen focus on personnel. Because as an older player, when you play
the Big 12, we kind of go through the years play against these players and we
know the tendencies as a team. So you have to focus in on what the coaches are
saying. They're up all night watching film, so it's important that we focus on
the personal tendencies.  
  
JATARIE WHITE: Yeah, I agree, when Coach gets us out in practice, we have to
make sure we know exactly what the team is doing offensively as well as making
sure that we understand what they're trying to do to us on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Does Arizona State remind you of anybody you may have played in the
Big 12, and if so, what areas?  
JATARIE WHITE: I can't think of anybody right now. This is my first year
playing in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Ariel, do they remind you of anybody?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Honestly, I can't think of anybody right now. We haven't gotten
film and we haven't gotten to watch them completely through. We've only been
able to watch them for the third quarter so far right now, so I'm excited to
get in the film room.  
  
Q. Ariel, when you look at your career, if you guys win tomorrow, that's
four straight years of at least making the Sweet Sixteen. How big is that for
you individually, for the program, especially where it was when Coach Aston
came in?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think it's huge. I think it's a testament to coach, honestly.
Every year she's come here we've gotten better and better on the court. I feel
like the product we put on the floor has gotten better every year. So I think
that's a testament to her, and her diligence, and focus and passion for the
program.  
  
Q. What's it mean to you to have a run like that individually? Everybody
survives and advances. That's what this month is all about, and you've been
able to do that so much in your career here.  
ARIEL ATKINS: It means a lot. I'm thankful to have the teammates I've had
throughout the years and the coach that's we've had that have pushed us to not
settle for anything, to always push forward and want to do greater, want to do
better, want to do bigger things.  
  
Q. Arizona State tends to sub a lot especially in short bursts. Does
that present any specific challenges or different challenge because they go to
their bench quite often?  
KAREN ASTON: I think it does present a challenge. Just your focus has to come
into play, and the fact that we're not as familiar with their personnel and
there is no way to be, as you would be in conference play. I mean, every
player's going to have a little bit of a different tendency, and the things
that they're looking for out of certain players are probably different. The
fact that they sub very frequently will be a challenge for us, most
definitely.  
  
Our coaches will have to help a little bit more than maybe they would have to
against some teams because of the frequency of the subbing.  
  
Q. You've obviously talked about sleeping in your own bed kind of thing.
Is that a carrot in front of the team during the season knowing that no matter
what happens, if you're in the top 16, you're going to play at home? I asked
Ariel about playing at Cal and it was rough, still won, but it was rough. Here
it's different.  
KAREN ASTON: I think it is a carrot is a good word for it. I definitely think
it's a motivation to -- well, there are several things that motivate you for
that. One is our administration and the guys, Angelo that does our schedule,
and everyone that is a part of our scheduling feels very strongly about
playing a great non-conference schedule, and I think that goes into play.  
  
If you get down to the difference between you and maybe another team that is
going to host and you similarly finish in conference play, then your non-
conference schedule and your strength of schedule is going to come into play.
So it motivates us to play a tough non-conference schedule.  
  
Then I think once you get into conference play, if you happen to have some
setbacks like we did this year, it keeps you motivated to not -- I mean,
obviously we're motivated to try to win the conference, but I also think it
comes into play when you're starting to think do you want to let one loss turn
into two, and how do you finish your last ten games? All of those things I
think our team and our program understands the importance.  
  
Then the last, and I wouldn't say it's last as far as importance, but just for
the players to be able to play in front of their family and friends, the
potential of two more times, is, I think, very motivating for them.  
  
Q. Not that this team you would worry about them overlooking anybody,
but could you point to last year's second round game and how much of a sweat
it really was? Just a friendly reminder this time of year not to overlook
anyone?  
KAREN ASTON: Yeah, I don't think that they'll do that. I think that most of
them would remember last year's game against North Carolina State and then, I
mean, we were at home, but obviously that was a very challenging game for us.  
  
I also think they're paying attention. As I mentioned last night, there were
three or four upsets yesterday. I mean, when I went into the second round,
well, now we're in the second round, so I think our players are aware and very
honed in on the fact that this is one game, and you're not going anywhere
unless you win the game.  
  
So I think they'll be very locked in. They know Arizona State's good. We've
scrimmaged them the last couple of years, close scrimmages. So we're somewhat
familiar with playing them.  
  
Q. How much familiarity do you have with them? Because we just kind of
talked about the idea in the tournament format you get to play teams that you
don't always meet. But here you have a situation where you have matched up
personnel, and how do you feel about that match?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, they're a little different, and they've graduated several
people. So they are, I think, fairly young in some positions. I mean, it's the
first game of the year. Not really a game. It's a closed scrimmage, so I'm not
sure that any of our players actually remember. They might remember their
style.  
  
I don't think they'll remember the players until they get possibly in the film
room. The coaches may have a little more familiarity with personnel. But that
first game of the year, I don't think anybody remembers much of anything.
They're just trying to see what they have. But you remember their
competitiveness. There is no way to get around that.  
  
Q. Will you be looking for Brooke to have around seven rebounds like she
had yesterday or a little more?  
KAREN ASTON: I'm going to look for everybody to rebound tomorrow. If they
don't, then it's going to be a long night for us.  
  
Q. Do you think they can match you on that speed in transition with
Brooke and LaShann or is that something you really want to press?  
KAREN ASTON: It goes back to rebounding, as I said last night. Knowing that
Maine was going to try to control the tempo of the game in the same sense, I
mean, rebounding plays into transition for us, so I think that's why this is
going to be such a challenging game is that they're really good on the boards
in a lot of areas.  
  
I think the other channeling thing for us is their guards rebound really well.
I think Robbi is one of their second or third leading rebounders. So I think
when you look at that, that's going to be challenging for us.  
  
Q. Ariel said the right things where you have to have the right mindset
with every game, but is it a different -- do you sense something different
from your players when they're playing a big-game school like Arizona State
and a berth in the Sweet Sixteen is on the line?  
KAREN ASTON: In your facts, maybe so. But I thought we were pretty ready to
play last night. I didn't think we looked like we were playing a name or a
conference or anything else. I thought we were pretty focused.  
  
Again, we may have lost a little bit at halftime, but that was worth it. But I
did think that we looked like a team that was pretty serious about playing. I
think that we'll be ready to play tomorrow. I don't think there will be any
type of different mentality for us.  
  
Q. What do you need from Joyner?  
KAREN ASTON: She's going to have to be very detailed defensively. Their post
players are really good, and they challenge you in a different way. I think
Rick asked the players, and the players didn't know the answer to this because
they haven't seen the bulk of the film, which we'll go into it in a few
minutes, but if I had to compare them to someone in our league, it's probably
the best team that comes to my mind might be West Virginia. I say that only
because of the physicality of their defense and the fact that they have a
forward that can shoot threes really well.  
  
So I think that's the challenging thing for our forwards in general is that
they can stretch the floor, and sometimes that becomes an issue for us. So
when you say Joyner, I think that's not just a challenge for Joyner. I think
it's going to be a challenge for our forwards and post players is that they
can stretch it.  
  
Q. Might you play in zone if you can (Indiscernible)?  
KAREN ASTON: I don't know that we would get too far away from what we've been
doing all year long. I mean, I've seen them zoned in conference play a little
bit, but I also think they can shoot the ball.  
  
The thing about a zone is that that's even harder to rebound in the zone. They
crash so well, you better figure out a way to get a body on each one of them.
Their guards rebound well.  
  
Q. The fact that you're on this run with the last few years and at least
making the second weekend, what's allowed this team to be able to do that,
this program to be able to do that? What's it mean to you personally to be
having so much success in this tournament?  
KAREN ASTON: I think what's allowed it has been the players' buy-in. They buy
in in the recruiting process. So you're looking at some seniors that four
years ago bought into the fact that they wanted to come here and make an
impression on this campus and an impression on this program, and they
absolutely have done that.  
  
And that goes back to the first class that we had in here that hung around.
Some didn't, some did. But the ones that hung around made an impression on our
program. I think it's just the buy-in of our culture. I mean, it's a goal and
one that should be a realistic goal for this program every year.  
  
I'm not disrespecting our opponent, because it's going to be a very tough game
tomorrow night, but that's the goal that should be a realistic one every year
for Texas.  
  
Q. I think it's been four years now the NCAA went to the top 16 playing
host for the first two rounds. Is that good for basketball in that you're
going to get fans, or is it unfair in basketball that the other three have to
be visitors, true visitors every time?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think it's a reward for, again, the body of work. For
people that were willing to schedule tough, non-conference games and then
played consistently all year long. Because I think that's the combination of
the things that gets you the ability to host. You not only played well in your
conference games, but you also probably played somebody in non-conference play
and boasted your strength of schedule.  
  
We tried it the other way, and I would say that it's been beneficial to have
-- I mean, this is about student-athlete experience. It always has been, and
it always will be. For the student-athletes I think that they enjoy. I think
if you asked most of the players, regardless of whether they're at home or
not, they would say that they would rather play in a packed gym.  
  
When we tried it the other way, the gyms, unless it was lucky enough to have
the city that won the hosting was lucky enough to have someone local, then
there were not as many people in the stands, so it didn't make for a great
experience for any of the student-athletes. I think this is better.  
  
I think everyone would tell you they'd rather play in front of a crowd. My
wish is this is a packed gym tomorrow night. I think we're the only show in
town Monday night. I hope. Unless there is a band playing somewhere, and
they're probably playing the next night too.  
  
So I just want to encourage everybody in the city to come out and see a
really, really good basketball game. I'm assuming it will be. I know that it
will be extremely competitive. And anybody that missed a second round game
last year missed the show.  
  
So I'm anticipating that same level of competition between the two teams, and
I would just encourage anybody that wants to come to the game, I hope that our
student body hears about it by the time they get back on campus tomorrow for
the first day of classes. It's 8:00 tomorrow night. Everybody has gotten off
work. The crowd, the traffic should be died down, and the students should be
looking for something to do. Probably don't have a lot of homework after the
first day of class.  
  
So this is a perfect storm, I guess to say, for us to have an unbelievable
crowd, and we should have that. This team deserves that.  
  
Q. You talk about Arizona State can rebound and they're physical. Where
do you feel like your team has an edge?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think that both teams are going to mirror each other
quite a bit defensively. I do think that if we can rebound and we do an
admirable job on the boards, I think we can get out in transition and play
some early offense.  
  
I do think we're very similar. It's hard to say that we have an edge in a lot
of positions. I think we're similar teams. We have some bigs that can score.
We have some guards that can shoot the ball. So this is going to boil down to
some real intangibles. Who does the dirty things? Who gets the loose balls?
Who boxes out? Free throws will probably come into play. I would expect this
will be a game that the 50-50 stuff comes into play.  
  
They remind me a little bit of Oklahoma too, where every time I talk about
playing an Oklahoma or West Virginia team like that in our league, it's always
about the 50-50 plays. It's rugged, a little bit ugly, but you're going to see
some kids flying around tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You mentioned the seniors who have bought into the program and the
culture, how much have you seen that rub off on the younger players?  
KAREN ASTON: It can't help but rub off. I mean, you look at just Chasity
Patterson this year, and I know she's not gotten the minutes that maybe she
wanted or thought she would get here, but it was fun to watch her last night
get in her first NCAA Tournament game and actually look like she belonged.
Even though the minutes haven't transpired for her, she's really improved a
lot, and I would say more than anything her mentality has changed a little
bit, and that's because the older players are rubbing off.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Amy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32621)

### [Janay Morton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34774)

### [Hannah Whitish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32623)

### [Taylor Kissinger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35143)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Arizona State - 73, Nebraska - 62  
  
AMY WILLIAMS: We were very excited to be a part of the field, and disappointed
that we weren't able to play a little bit better in this first round game. We
knew though it was going to take a very special rebounding effort on our part,
and we just didn't take care of that. We got outrebounded by 22 rebounds
you're not going to win very many games, particularly not in the NCAA
Tournament if you can't handle that area of the game.  
  
Q. Janay, Coach talked about the rebounding really was a huge
difference. How tough was it? What were they like to play against in terms of
just chasing down the ball?  
JANAY MORTON: Yeah, I think they just relentlessly pursued the ball on every
shot, whether it was defensively or offensively, so we just struggled with
that.  
  
Q. You guys were starting to -- you had those back-to-back threes and
you guys were up three at that point. They just started making things more
difficult for you on offense, what changed there at that point in the game and
why weren't the shots working for you guys?  
JANAY MORTON: I think our shots just weren't falling. We had our looks. They
didn't fall, and I think that was the turn around there.  
  
Q. Did they do anything differently on that run?  
JANAY MORTON: They were aggressive the entire game. So I think they just
stepped that up a little bit. But like I said, we had our looks.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the rebounding there, but you guys were right in
it at halftime. Did you feel like the rebounding eventually just caught up to
you? It seemed like you were able to overcome that for a while?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, we were a little disappointed at halftime of how
many rebounds that we'd given up, but to still be in the ballgame at that
point was a positive thing. We had executed pretty well offensively up to that
point, but we knew that if we were not going to find a way to turn that around
that it was going to be a struggle, and we just didn't.  
  
In the second half we gave up ten more offensive rebounds, and even after
making that a huge focal point, really all week in preparation, and that just
says something for their relentless pursuit for the basketball. Just what we
need to work on to be a little bit more disciplined with our rebounding
efforts.  
  
Q. Going through the emotions from yesterday, you tripled your season
from a year ago. Can you go back and assess the season?  
HANNAH WHITISH: Yeah, this season was something special, especially with the
season we had last year. Starting the season off, everybody had a different
mindset. Which I knew this season was going to be different from last year
just because everybody came in and worked a lot harder than they had, just
everything was more intense.  
  
Q. How about you, Taylor?  
TAYLOR KISSINGER: Coming in as a freshman, it was cool to see because I
watched them last year, and they struggled because of the coaching change and
everything. But I came in and I was surprised to see the hard work, effort and
everything with everyone. It was really awesome. It lifted me up to work hard
too, and everyone else just raised their level.  
  
JANAY MORTON: Yeah, just as a red-shirt, sitting on the bench all last year,
having to watch the team, I think it was a chance for me to be able to see
what we needed as far as the following year. Then when I was finally able to
play with my teammates, you know, just to make those types of things happen
and being vocal, whether it be in practice or games and I think that helped a
lot with this turnaround. But everyone on the team stepped up this year as
well to make that happen too.  
  
Q. The way this game was played, not to put the blame on the players,
but Maddie for example, had given you ten points a game this season. But she
had early foul trouble. What was some of the frustration that you felt with
your team with their defense and how the flow of the game was?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I really felt like Maddie was going to be a key for
today's game. We really felt like that. We challenged Maddie. We talked to her
yesterday in practice, today at shootaround we said we need you to strive to
come away with ten rebounds in this ballgame. Unfortunately, Maddie was
saddled with foul trouble the whole game and not only did she not come away
with ten, but she had the goose egg in the rebounding category.  
  
Maddie's one of our best rebounders. She's one of our most athletic players.
She can go out of her area to secure rebounds. So having her on the bench in
foul trouble was really critical for our team. I didn't think we adjusted or
handled that very well.  
  
Q. Did you get a sense that that kind of affected how players were on
the court, if they were missing her or going this isn't work?  
AMY WILLIAMS: You know, it's not the first time this season that we've had to
adjust or had a player in foul trouble. But I do think that it did cause a few
shifts for us. We played Jasmine Cincore who is kind of starts as a guard for
us. Then we played her several minutes in that forward position to try to take
some of Maddie's minutes. Jasmine's nice, strong, great athlete, just a little
undersized in there, and kind of I think that affected some things just with
our ability to come away with rebounds. Certainly I thought our players,
they've been there before. They played in sync. They knew what to expect. They
adjusted offensively just fine. It was more just our ability to rebound, I
think was affected with that foul trouble.  
  
Q. Something going on with Maddie that you kind of lost focus and the
fouls and just really didn't get anything done?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I don't think there was anything going on with Maddie. I
think Maddie's a tremendous player. She's had a great season, and she's a huge
piece of why we were able to have the type of season and why we were even
playing in the NCAA Tournament. But it's just a very difficult thing when you
are -- as soon as you go back in the game and, Boom, you get called for an
offensive foul, and Boom you have to come sit down again. It's just very
difficult to get into a rhythm and play the way that she's capable of playing
when she was just very sporadic with her time out there.  
  
Q. You touched on it yesterday, but the season finally coming to a
close, again, you went seven wins last year, 21 wins, you get to the NCAA
Tournament. How do you look back now moments after the loss? Put the season in
a capsule for us?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's very difficult to do that. I told our players in the
locker room that you can let this sting for a little while, but permanently we
are going to hold our heads up high and we're not going to have this be the
final taste in our mouth. We're going to walk away being very, very proud of
the progress that was made for our program. Our seniors, we are grateful to
for notching our program. We've talked about finding ways to raise the bar. I
feel like those three seniors poured their heart into this program, and they
raised the bar a couple of notches for us. Now, you know, the girls all talk
about how hard they worked in the off-season because they didn't want another
season like last year. Now the expectations have risen. That bar has been
raised, and now we have to find ways to continue to raise it higher. I just
feel like we're going to walk away feeling very proud of the way this season
went, and thankful to our seniors for all they poured into it and excited and
eager to correct some things that caused us problems in the Big Ten tournament
and in the NCAA Tournament. Areas that we feel like we can correct moving
forward as a program.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Amy Vachon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35112)

### [Parise Rossignol](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35149)

### [Julie Brosseau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35150)

### [Tanesha Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35114)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 83, Maine - 54  
  
AMY VACHON: Credit to Texas, that's a really, really good basketball team, and
they shot the ball really well. And when they missed, they got their offensive
rebounds there in the first quarter, first half, so credit to them. I hope
they go really, really far in this tournament. A class staff and a class team.  
  
As far as our team, I'm really proud of them, proud of our season. Not the way
we wanted to end it, but just I take these 13 kids any day, so really just
proud of how hard they compete, and how much they grew this year.  
  
Q. Tanesha, what were those first seven minutes like? You couldn't get a
rebound, grabbing everything and putting it back up. Was it just an
overwhelming start there?  
TANESHA SUTTON: I guess we all had to get a feel for it. We weren't getting
the rebounds. We just weren't really putting enough effort in the first half.  
  
Q. Why do you think that was? What was it about the start? Was it a big
moment that the team maybe wasn't ready for?  
TANESHA SUTTON: I think we were ready for it. We just weren't really boxing
out.  
  
Q. Parise, can you talk about being on the floor and as a Mainer and
having so much support from home and people watching?  
PARISE ROSSIGNOL: Yeah, it's pretty special. Any player growing up, this is a
stage you want to be able to play on. So to be able to represent my home state
at this kind of game is really surreal. It's hard to put into words, but I'm
very thankful.  
  
Q. Julie, I know you all have stepped out and played some Power Five
conference teams. How did Texas match-up? Did they just maybe bring a little
more athleticism and size than you guys have really seen?  
JULIE BROSSEAU: Yeah, they are very big. Like we're not used to play that type
of athleticism in our conference. So that's why I think maybe it took us
several minutes to adjust.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how this experience will prepare your younger
players for the future?  
AMY VACHON: Yeah, absolutely, I hope it does. I think we learned a lot this
year. We are very young. I mean, we start three sophomores, a freshman and a
junior. We're going against a team in Texas who their starting point guards
played over 100 and, I don't know, maybe 30 games, I may be wrong on that, but
a lot of games.  
  
So the experience that we gained this year and hopefully today, I'm hoping
will help us. Now we know what it feels like to be in the NCAA Tournament.
These kids have never felt that way before. So it's a feeling that once you
get, you want to keep and you want to have again.  
  
So the work in the off-season and those games in the preseason that we may
have let slip by we got to really focus in and get those.  
  
Q. For the players, can you talk about being here and making it to the
NCAA Tournament?  
TANESHA SUTTON: Every basketball player dreams to go D-1, go D-1, go to the
championship, win a championship, go to the NCAA Tournament. This whole moment
is so surreal. You can't really picture how your emotions, how it really feels
until you get here. It's quite a feeling. I'm really proud of my team.  
  
JULIE BROSSEAU: Yeah, it's very amazing to play in the NCAA Tournament. It's
like a dream. To play here at Texas was very nice, so that's a great
experience for us.  
  
PARISE ROSSIGNOL: For me, it's just cool. I come from a school where I
graduated with 24 other kids, so to be on this stage where my entire town's
going to watch me on ESPN2 is pretty surreal. So, yeah, it's just amazing.  
  
Q. When they face a loss like that at the start, how do you regroup?
What do you say? How do you try to fight that?  
AMY VACHON: I mean, our kids always fight, so I never question if they're
going to compete or their effort or their energy. They give that all the time.
I think we gave them some shots to Texas, but they hit some tough shots too.
They just hit a lot of shots today. Credit to them. I mean, they're a great
team.  
  
But, yeah, it's frustrating when you have a good possession and you played
good defense and then they finally miss the shot and they get the offensive
rebound and put it in. And that seemed to be the story of that first half.  
  
But I'm proud of us. We came back in the second half and played them
relatively even. I know that they were subbing a lot and that sort of thing.
But whether they're starter for subs or Texas, they're phenomenal basketball
players. So for our kids to just keep fighting, we have to learn from this
experience. Our kids never gave up.  
  
Q. Amy, Blanca had been effective all year, but not today. Was it they
focused in on her more?  
AMY VACHON: I think it was maybe a little bit of both. But all teams all year
focused in on her, so that wasn't any different. The level of athlete guarding
her was a little bit different here, but she missed some shots she normally
hit to be honest with you. But she kept fighting and she kept shooting. I
wouldn't trade her for anyone.  
  
Q. For a Mainer who played in this tournament, can you talk about
watching Parise and Maddy and Sierra on the floor and what that means to the
state?  
AMY VACHON: Yeah, I know to the state and I know to the Mainers they love it.
I know to see their own playing for the University and playing on a national
stage. For Parise to be able to really earn a role and get good minutes this
year has been great.  
  
Then Maddy, I told her, she's going to make me look bad because she went in in
four minutes and scored five points. But I was happy for her. She played
really hard. Yeah, all three of them are just so special to our team, so,
yeah, I was really happy for them.  
  
Q. I know you want to win, obviously, but what was the best part of
being here the last three days?  
AMY VACHON: Yeah, I just think for our kids it's something that they watch on
television. For our University we haven't been here since 2004. So we talk a
lot about it, and it's easy to talk about it. But until you experience it, you
don't really know what to expect.  
  
For me, to see the kids just light up every time they got the patches on their
uniform or they got Gatorade, I mean, just little things that a lot of people
take for granted. So now they know it and they've gotten a taste of it. So for
me I'm really hoping that it motivates them.  
  
We don't want to be a 15 seed. Being a 15 seed is really hard, and that's on
us. We have to win the games in the preseason that we didn't win. We have to
beat the Tulanes, we have to beat the Toledos, we have to beat the Miamis, we
have to beat those teams. So our kids know that now, and they knew it, but now
they see the results when you don't beat those teams.  
  
So, yeah, just the experience has been great, and hopefully we can learn from
it.

### [Robbi Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34723)

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Arizona State - 73, Nebraska - 62  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, first of all, Nebraska's a really tough team,
well-coached team. It was a hard-fought game. The two-week break between the
conference tournament and now, you love it and you hate it, because you love
to get the extra rest and the extra practice, but it's a really long time to
go without playing the game. I thought that showed for us.  
  
I thought we were very rusty. Just, good, solid defense the first half and
really good second half offensively. But I'm excited. Excited that they get to
keep playing. And I always tell them that the first game is the hardest
because you just have the first-game jitters a little bit too. But really
proud of this team to settle down, got the offense going and credit Nebraska
for not really ever going away, but credit the Sun Devils for stepping up and
staying with things.  
  
You know, we were definitely rusty, so excited to be still alive.  
  
Q. Kianna, why were you so dominant rebounding tonight against Nebraska
as a team?  
KIANNA IBIS: I would just say --  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You can tell them the real answer.  
  
KIANNA IBIS: I would just say we wanted it more, I guess. I would say that. We
just wanted to stay aggressive on offense, offensive rebounds, and we just
went at them. We don't want to be boxed out, so we just went around them and
got the ball.  
  
Q. Jamie, what changed with in the third quarter there? It seemed like
defense picked up in the last five minutes into the fourth, what changed?  
JAMIE RUDEN: I think for us we have a big focus on just finishing strong. So I
think I don't know just a fire kind of went under our butts and we decided we
needed to ramp up the pressure defensively and ramp up the energy, crashing
the boards and boxing out. Rebounding was a big focus coming into these games,
so that was huge.  
  
Q. Robbi, in the first half you had trouble kind of scoring. Y'all did a
good job defensively. What was the trouble in the first half? Were shots just
not falling?  
ROBBI RYAN: I was probably forcing it a little too much, as CC told me.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You don't get that award by yourself. You can just say
collectively.  
  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah, we were just -- we weren't poised. As the game went on we
settled down. We got better looks and played better together, and I think that
was the difference.  
  
Q. Jamie, you said a second ago, the fire went under our butts. Did you
put it there?  
JAMIE RUDEN: I think it's a big credit to our coaches. They were on us that we
needed to really lock in. But also we put that pressure on ourselves too, so,
yeah.  
  
Q. How did you escape from Omaha?  
KIANNA IBIS: How did I escape? I would say that I just loved Charli and the
coaching staff, and it felt like a family. Also my mom, growing up when she
went to college her mom kind of wanted her to stay close to home and then she
didn't want me to go through that. Not go through it, but she just wanted me
to get out there and do something I wanted to do. And I wanted to go out more
west coast, and ASU was a great program.  
  
Q. Charli, tell us the real reason on the rebounding? What is the real
reason on the rebounding?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we held ourselves accountable. They held
themselves accountable on the break. So if anybody didn't hit a rebounding
spot or missed a box out, the entire team did five push-ups, and we did a lot
of push-ups this last week and a half. They were just amazing with it.  
  
I actually joked in the locker room, like, hey, if you miss a box out don't
get down on the floor and start doing push-ups during the game. I said just go
get the ball. You might miss a box out. So we kind of joked about it.  
  
But certainly it's always a focus in our program, and obviously when you
control the board, you control the game. You know, we needed every rebound in
this game given our shooting percentages.  
  
Q. You're a good rebounding team, but you say you were not satisfied
before this?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, I felt like we could be better. Yeah, and I think it
was just fatigue, fatigue. We're not a deep team, and you need to get down --
we're not practicing, so we didn't have an opportunity to work on a lot. So
when we had a chance to work on things, that was the number one thing we were
working on. That and transition defense, which we will need on Monday.  
  
Q. Were you pleased with the shots you were getting in the first half?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yes and no. We missed some shots that we would normally
make, but we also caught and dribbled a ton and forced things. They played
from the inside out, they're overhelpers and we were just going right into
them instead of getting to two feet, making the extra pass, finding our own
teammates.  
  
So, no, we were not happy with our half-court offense, but we had also gotten
some solid shots that we just missed too.  
  
Q. What was your view of the last five minutes of the third quarter?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think we just combined some really good defense with
hitting shots. Obviously Jamie is instant offense, and Sophia Elenga probably
should have been up here. Just so productive tonight in the minutes that she
had, rebounding and scoring. Our bench really stepped up today, I thought.  
  
Because at halftime, I mean, really, I don't think any of our starters would
say, oh, I played well. So it's like when you don't have one of your starters
really playing the way they can play, you're like, oh. You figure, okay,
they've got to get better. At the same time we were a little worried, and I
thought our bench was huge for us today.  
  
Q. A lot of benches as the rotations get shorter in the NCAA Tournament
--  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Ours is short period.  
  
Q. Well, you played everybody.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, not Eva. Eva Rubin didn't get in, but we have nine
Bre’Yanna Sanders, call her Junior. We have too many Brees. She really did a
nice job. She doesn't usually play necessarily that much. But she really
spotted our guards well, because it's tough if we have to go with a four-guard
rotation. And she's been practicing well, so that helps us.  
  
I mean, we have depth at post. We do. We have four posts. And we have Eva as a
fifth post, so she's a really big body, so she could definitely possibly help
us against Texas.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to Texas, just the way you saw the team rebound today,
do you feel like you can crash with the No. 4 rebounding team in the
country?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Is that what they are?  
  
Q. I think so.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we're going to have to. That and transition
defense. I kind of look one game at a time, but from what I know of Texas, the
little bit I watched this past week, are probably the two biggest keys.
Obviously they're a very defensive team as well. I'm hoping we can get this
game under our belt and we'll be a little more efficient offensively one day.  
  
Q. Going back to the post play. Sophia's really come into her own this
season. She won 4 of 5 tonight, 21 minutes. She's been earning more minutes
this season. What did you think of her play tonight and over the course of the
season?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I mean, she's been -- I've had a lot of media people
say, "She's your x-factor, Charli. She's your x-factor," and I don't disagree
with that. Obviously, she's a first-year player, junior college, big stage. We
thought she would be an impact player and she is. But she's just continued --
she's the most lovely, beautiful person, and she just is so coachable. She
gets in the gym extra.  
  
So all the credit it is to her. She wants to be good, and she's worked really
hard. It does not come easy for her to learn the playbook. A lot of this stuff
does not come easy for her. She just keeps staying committed. So, yeah, really
proud of her.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about your past experiences here.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I was joking about some of them.  
  
Q. Yeah, how much better does this feel?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, haven't played UT yet, but...  
  
Q. That's right.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, obviously, this was fun. This was great. I mean,
we don't usually (Indiscernible), so it was a little bit frustrating. We
didn't enjoy this game quite as much as we normally do because that is like
our pet peeve, and we don't do it. We thought, I mean, we fouled and we don't
do that. So that's one of the things I'm talking about the rust and stuff.  
  
So, I mean, that was -- again, we should have been enjoying it a little bit
more, but it was like, really? You know, slip out, slip out, slip out. But,
yeah, this is a great venue. I obviously want to create a few more good
memories here. But, obviously, fun place to play. This town supports women's
basketball, has for a long time.  
  
Q. The team struggled from beyond the arc tonight, shooting 21%. How
much of a factor is that in the second round match-up against Texas?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we shot 13 in the first half. Like we don't do
that. That's not us and that's what we talked about at halftime. I thought we
adjusted and we didn't shoot as many in the second half. We like being like 6
for 13 or somewhere in there.  
  
So I mean, we like the three, and I think we have good shooters. Again, I
thought we were just rusty. So I think our shooting will get going. But we
also, you know, everybody's very scouted right now. Our best shooters are not
getting great looks and that's part of it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Lashann Higgs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30859)

### [Ariel Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28410)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 83, Maine - 54  
  
KAREN ASTON: I was really pleased with how we started the game and really how
we played the entire first half. I thought that our team was very locked in.
Paid attention to detail, shot the ball well, did a lot of things really,
really sharp in the first half.  
  
Had a conservative lead at halftime and may have let our guard down a little
bit. That's just me nitpicking, but I was pleased that we were able to play
everyone.  
  
I thought that it's good as you go along. You just don't ever know when your
number's going to get called in NCAA Tournament play, so I think it was very
good for everyone to get some playing time and get their feet wet with the
NCAA Tournament. So good win for us.  
  
Q. Ariel, did you get a sense that you could come out and overwhelm them
in the beginning the way you guys did?  
ARIEL ATKINS: We definitely knew we needed to be focused. We knew what they
were capable of doing, and I think it was important for us in the first five
minutes of the game to be really focused.  
  
Q. How good is it to get this game out of the way, you advance,
everybody's able to play. How much confidence does that give you and the
team?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think it gives us a good amount of confidence. I think the
confidence comes from knowing what we did. We focused on their tendencies and
what they did well. And I think we actually used our preparation and listened
to our coaches and we stuck with the game plan. I think that's where the
confidence comes from.  
  
LASHANN HIGGS: Like Ariel said, that's where the confidence comes from. We
stressed in practice every day how important tendencies -- respecting their
tendencies are, and how we can't let our guard down because you never know
what might happen.  
  
Q. Ariel, Andrew Jones spoke to you guys at the half, what was that like
getting to see him again?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Oh, he brings good times. Getting to see him and talk to him and
just kind of being around him, he's just a good, fun person to be around. His
spirit and his joking and he's laughing with us, it just kind of felt like
hanging out with him. At halftime he gave us a few words. It was really good
to see him.  
  
Q. LaShann, do you think this team is playing better at this point right
now than you were at this point last year?  
LASHANN HIGGS: Good question. I would say that we definitely are playing more
as a team now, and there's a lot that we've been working on throughout the
season. We just try to focus on the things that we can control and not worry
about the things that we cannot control. So I would say that it's been a fun
year.  
  
Q. Did you realize that you didn't even let them have a rebound for the
first nearly eight minutes of the game? I mean, what's that speak to you about
that you were basically physically able to overwhelm them?  
LASHANN HIGGS: That was one of the things that we actually had on the board.
It was like rebound, with an exclamation mark, so we knew exactly what we
tried to do was rebound. But to answer your question, no, I don't think we
noticed that.  
  
Q. What's it like to go from that transition of having such an easy time
on the glass and then go against a team that has 20 offensive rebounds? How do
you lock back in when things were so easy tonight?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I would say that's definitely a mindset that we have to go into
the next game because every team that's won we definitly have to respect what
they do. So I would say it's a mentality that we have to go into the next game
with because they're definitely a physical team.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I would say they're a physical basketball team, and in order for
us to do what we want to do, we're going to have to rebound.  
  
Q. Ariel, new T-shirt. Was it somebody's idea, and what is the meaning
behind it?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Well, honestly, I think every team has this shirt. I just think
they all have their own slogan on it, or our mantra for the year, and ours is
"family." The source is to focus in on picking each other up and focusing on
one day at a time. I think that's what a family consists of. Just making sure
everybody's at their best. When somebody's not at their best, be there to pick
them up, and that helps us a lot throughout the year.  
  
Q. This will be one of your last games as a Longhorn. Has that hit you
yet?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Well, you just said that, but, yeah, I have not thought about
that. Wow. I don't know what to say.  
  
Q. Any thoughts on your time here in front of the fans specifically?  
ARIEL ATKINS: They have been the best fans I've been around. They support us
through absolutely everything. And to be able to play in front of them for the
last time, I can't put that in words.  
  
I'm just so thankful for this program and everything it's done for me. Our
fans, I can't put that into words.  
  
Q. What do you feel the team did well offensively? You both had double
digit points tonight.  
LASHANN HIGGS: I would say that we definitely executed better this game, and
we went through with the game plan and we tried to be as patient as possible.
There were times that we got a little sloppy and let our guard down, but we
discussed it in the timeouts that we need to pick it back up and continue to
do what we were doing that worked.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: She hit it on the nose.  
  
Q. You said you were pleased to see your team locked in. It would have
been easy today to come out and kick the ball around a little bit. What's that
say to you in terms of the team's mindset coming into this tournament with a
couple of seniors gunning for more?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think you hit it on the head in the sense of senior
leadership. I really didn't think that we would not be focused, but because I
based everything on practice, and I thought yesterday's preparation was
really, really good.  
  
So you always feel good as a coach. I mean, sometimes it doesn't work out the
way you want it to. But if you feel like you're prepared, then that's about
all you can do but throw the ball up and see what happens. I thought our team
was pretty locked in yesterday in practice, and they really have been since
we've returned from the little break we took.  
  
Didn't surprise me that we were ready to play, but I did think we were pretty
sharp the first half.  
  
Q. Andrew told me you asked him to speak on the team. What put that on
your heart to do that?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I happened to be walking down here and the men's team had
just arrived back from Nashville. Rob hollered at me and said did you know
Andrew was back in the locker room? He was with the men. So I walked back that
way, and ran into Shaka, and I said, "Can I say hello?" And Shaka took me back
in the locker room with the guys, and I just walked back there and he said I
want to come to the game. I said if you're going to come to the game, why
don't you say hi to the girls.  
  
Didn't catch him before the game. I was really hoping he would come in before
the game. So Chris brought him back at half. Just some things are bigger than
basketball. For him to be able to come in and a lot of these girls are really
good friends with Andrew and they care deeply about him and his experience
that he's having.  
  
Sometimes you just have to say whatever. It was a good chance for them to
share some moments. I don't know. I kind of went back into the coach's locker
room and talked to the coaches and said, hey, you can have them for a few
minutes. I could hear a lot of laughing and good times. I think they took a
team picture with him.  
  
It was good. It was good for the girls, and it was good to have him back
around. He looks great.  
  
Q. Was that one of the more unique halftimes considering it's an NCAA
Tournament?  
KAREN ASTON: Absolutely, absolutely. I tell you what, it's good to be home. I
can tell you that. Because last year I believe Mack Brown came in and gave
quite an inspirational speech before we played. I don't remember whether -- I
think it may have been the second game. But that's the great thing about being
at home is that you get to see people one more time and experience things that
you probably wouldn't experience on the road.  
  
Q. You said you felt like they were ready to play and you were pleased
with how they came out in the first half. Did anything surprise you about how
well you handled Maine today?  
KAREN ASTON: I think I said this in the press conference before the game. It
is a little bit refreshing to get away from league play. Three out of the four
of our league teams have won their first round games.  
  
Our league is tough, and I don't think we give it the credit that it deserves
because it is so tough. That double round robin sometimes can just beat you in
the head, and I think when you get away from it you are able to take a breath.
Our team looked refreshed that they were playing someone that didn't
necessarily know every move that they were going to make.  
  
So to answer your question, it surprised me a little bit that they didn't
execute some things that I had seen them execute against other people.  
  
I think Maine is a good team, they're well-coached and they execute really
well. The way we played defensively in the first half was very pleasing to all
of us.  
  
Q. Is the strength of schedule -- you mentioned the Big 12 strength, you
played Baylor three times, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma, West Virginia, is it safe
to say you're not going to be overwhelmed by opposition because you've already
season top-level opposition, unlike Maine who had not seen much of this?  
KAREN ASTON: I think just the level of preparation that it takes, it doesn't
seem abnormal to, as I said, to lock in because you have to do that for a lot
of games in a row just to be competitive in our league and you have to bring
it every night. So I think just the fact that our team has gotten used to that
and they're getting better. Every year we've gotten much better at just trying
to treat every game the same.  
  
I know you get tired of hearing that from our players, but they really have
tried to live that this year, and I think it's helped them in the good times
and the bad.  
  
Q. Brooke had 7 rebounds tonight in 24 minutes. Do you notice a
difference with her in that area? If so, what's that like having your point
guard rebound for you?  
KAREN ASTON: I love point guards that rebound. I would have to say that's not
what I recruited Brooke to do. But I love point guards that rebound. That's
something I actually look at in the recruiting process. But, again, not with
Brooke. She's discovered ways to maneuver and pick up the loose ones when
people box out.  
  
But I do love point guards that rebound, because we like to transition and it
obviously starts your transition game if your point guard already has the ball
in her hands.  
  
Q. One of the players said you or somebody wrote "Rebound" in the locker
room or with an exclamation point. Was that a big emphasis going into the
game? I'm going to guess they passed that test?  
KAREN ASTON: I thought they passed it for most of the game. Just because I
thought Maine would try to control the tempo, and if we can get stops and get
rebounds and get outlets and get out quicker, we can try to get some buckets
that are a little bit easier than having to go against their set defense,
which is kind of what happened. So that's why.  
  
Obviously, rebounding is an emphasis every game, but we wanted to try to get
out in transition against them.  
  
Q. You got a team that's going to be able to muscle up with you in the
second round. What is the message on the white board going to be now?  
KAREN ASTON: Rebound (laughing). I will say, you always look at something
differently when you see them in person, and that was the thing that kind of
jumped out at me watching Arizona State right off the bat is that Nebraska
didn't seem to be able to get a rebound. That was a big determining factor in
that game.  
  
I mean, it was close for a long time, and they absolutely controlled the
boards from the tip. So, yeah, we have our hands full, no question.  
  
Q. As one of the favorites to make a run in this tournament, a 2 seed,
did you at all talk about what happened last night in the men's tournament
with your girls?  
KAREN ASTON: No, we talked about what happened in the women's game today.
Three mid-majors won.  
  
Q. What you say?  
KAREN ASTON: Before the game we discussed it, and I just said you don't want
that to happen in your house. Let's be ready to play. But the game is getting
better. I don't think that's a terrible thing.  
  
Obviously, it would have been for us tonight, but more parity. I was a mid-
major coach. I guess that's what you would have called Charlotte. We laced up
our shoes just like everybody else did. So I think you have to be ready to
play when it's tournament time. But I will say those games were fun to watch
last night.  
  
Q. Depends on who you ask.  
KAREN ASTON: True, true. But my favorite so far has been watching Buffalo
play. That town has to be going crazy right now. Their men and women both won.
The women had an upset.  
  
Q. With this quick turnaround, how do you prepare for a team that, like
you said, you're not quite as familiar with because they're not in your
conference?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think we've experienced this quite often just because we
have these turnarounds in conference play quite a bit. We're fortunate enough
to play on ESPN sometimes on Mondays, and we've had some quick turnarounds
like this that we always talk about in that moment, which is this is what this
is going to feel like in the NCAA Tournament. So I think our team is somewhat
used to that. That they've had to one day in between, so I don't think that
will be a surprise to them at all.  
  
They do have to go back to school on Monday. They did ask me that. I said,
yes, you do. But other than that, I think this will be a normal routine for
them.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Amy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32621)

### [Jasmine Cincore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34753)

### [Maddie Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35092)

### [Hannah Whitish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32623)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd like to begin with an opening statement.  
  
AMY WILLIAMS: We are extremely excited to be a part of the 2018 NCAA
tournament. Our team, it's been a little while since we've played a basketball
game it feels like, so we are very, very eager. We've been talking all week
about having a sense of urgency with this incredible opportunity that's in
front of us. We're just excited to get out and have a good practice today and
to be a part of this tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hannah, looking at the stats, it looks like there's no superstars,
it's more of an all-for-one mentality. Tell me about the makeup of your
team.  
HANNAH WHITISH: We talked about at the beginning of the year our team motto we
were going to go with is 'family'. I think the way this team has played
offensively and defensively this year has definitely followed that up.  
  
Yeah, there really isn't one person that kind of takes over. Everybody plays a
role. We all do it very well.  
  
Q. Who among you said at the beginning of the season you're going to
make the NCAA tournaments after last year? And why did you feel that way?  
JASMINE CINCORE: We were still transitioning from a new staff. We had a lot of
new players come in. We were very young. I just saw something great within
this team. We've made a huge turnaround, as you can see.  
  
Q. Jazz, you've been to the NCAA tournament before as a freshman. Does
it mean more now as a senior?  
JASMINE CINCORE: I would say yes, it does mean more. Freshman year, a lot of
things are happening. This time, after having some seasons under my belt,
going through four completely different seasons to this one, means a lot more.  
  
Q. Maddie, the Big Ten, how did that prepare you for bigger games that
you're going to start playing tomorrow?  
MADDIE SIMON: I think the Big Ten is an amazing conference with tough teams we
play every single game. You can't take a night off, and every game is going to
be a challenge. There's going to be a lot of girls that are athletic, that can
guard, that can score. I think the Big Ten has really prepared us for whoever
we're going to face.  
  
We talk about Arizona State being a tough defensive team, a tough rebounding
team. I think that's what we've saw every game in the Big Ten, so I think
we're ready for that.  
  
Q. Do they remind you of any one team that you played?  
MADDIE SIMON: We talked about how they actually remind us of ourselves.
They're balanced. They like to do some of the same things we do. We see that
as a good matchup for us, being similar to us.  
  
Q. Jasmine, what has been the single biggest difference between last
season and this one?  
JASMINE CINCORE: I'd go back to what Hannah said. This time we came up with
the word 'family' and everyone is pretty committed to it. You saw the
determination on everyone's face in the pre-season for us, to be determined
not to have a season like we did before. That's the biggest difference.  
  
Q. Hannah, what would it mean to the program to move forward to the
Sweet 16?  
HANNAH WHITISH: I think we're just going to take this one game at a time and
do everything we can to control every game we can.  
  
Q. Let's say, for example, you do win these next two games, what would
it mean to go that far?  
HANNAH WHITISH: I think it would mean a lot to everybody on this team,
especially with the season we had last year. It would mean so much.  
  
Q. Hannah, what kind of goals did your coach set out for the team? Where
was this team's ceiling?  
HANNAH WHITISH: At the beginning of this year, she wanted us, and we all
bought into it, every game we wanted to be the hardest working team on the
floor. As long as we did that, we were going to like the outcome.  
  
Q. Maddie, you're from Lincoln. Your mom was an athlete at the
University of Nebraska. How much does this mean to you now?  
MADDIE SIMON: This means a lot to me just watching this Husker program be
successful, when I was a little girl watching. It means a lot to be able to be
a part of that with some amazing girls.  
  
Q. What is your background as far as your mother played sports here?  
MADDIE SIMON: My mom ran track and field in the '80s. Being from Lincoln, I've
just been around the program for a while.  
  
Q. This is a big weekend for the city of Austin, biggest music festival
in the country. Do you plan to stay out till 1 or 2 in the morning listening
to music?  
MADDIE SIMON: Maybe if we advance to the Sweet 16. Until then I think we're
going to get some sleep and try to prepare for the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What did you see as the ceiling for this team? What did you think was
possible this year?  
AMY WILLIAMS: To be quite honest with you, we had a meeting in the summer. A
couple of the girls were kind of leading part of that meeting. They were
talking about what we have to do to get to 20 wins, 20 wins, 20 wins.  
  
To be quite honest with you, inside I was really thinking that might be fairly
lofty goals with everything considered.  
  
As I watched them, their work ethic, the number one most asked question I've
received this year was, What was the key to your turnaround, what was it, how
did you go from seven wins to 21 wins. Honestly, I watched them work extremely
hard from the time that our final buzzer went off one year ago, all post-
season.  
  
The commitment was really made mostly in strength and conditioning. They spent
a lot of time working hard with a new strength and conditioning coach who
pushed them beyond what they thought they were capable of. Because of that, it
built confidence.  
  
That confidence started to show up in some early games on the road at Kansas.
In the second half we came together, held them to 12 second-half points. They
started to kind of see that confidence that they were having. Some of those
things paid off with some road wins that kind of just made them start to
believe.  
  
It's truly been like a snowball effect of just that confidence in each other
and that chemistry and commitment. Nobody really having egos. A selfless team,
a team that puts each other first. They're genuinely excited for each other's
successes. It's really led to an outstanding conference season for us and a
great turnaround for the expectations.  
  
Q. The student-athletes mentioned when they see Arizona State on film,
it reminds them of themselves. Is there another team in the Big Ten that plays
the way Arizona State plays on both ends of the floor?  
AMY WILLIAMS: I haven't really thought of any of our Big Ten opponents that
really remind us as much. One thing we have a ton of respect for is obviously
them being the No. 1 scoring defense in the Pac-12 conference. That's
something that we wanted to really pride ourselves in, as well.  
  
I think they maybe apply a little bit more pressure than we do. Right now they
are exactly rebounding-wise where we would strive to be, so... We like to kind
of think we mirror them, but I think they're a slightly better rebounding team
than we've proven to be all season, and we know that rebounding will be key in
tomorrow night's game.  
  
Q. Is there any significance in coaching against Charli Turner Thorne?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Other than the fact I've looked up to her in this profession for
a very long time. I can remember my first Division I coaching jobs. I was one
year at the University of Texas San Antonio, then I became the recruiting
coordinator at Oklahoma State University. I've just watched her teams for so
long, really admired everything she's been able to do, her stability in a very
unstable profession.  
  
To me, the first time I made the NCAA tournament as a head coach, the other
bench was Tara VanDerveer. Now I'll be going up with Charli Turner Thorne,
another iconic coach in our profession. It's rewarding, it's fun. Really
excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. You played at Nebraska for four years. Now you're coaching there. Do
you have any connections with the Longhorns or the city of Austin, this
building, that you remember?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Other than the fact that when I coached at UT San Antonio --
well, when I played at Nebraska, this will date me a little, I played two
years in the Big 8, two years in the Big 12. Only two times. The one time we
came to Austin during my playing career, I had just blown my knee out and I
didn't make the trip, so I was home. I never played here as a player.  
  
Definitely as a coach when I was at Oklahoma State, we came to Texas on a
couple of occasions. I was here many times to recruit at the high school state
tournament.  
  
Other than some recruiting ties and in my one short year that I spent at UTSA,
we enjoyed coming to Austin quite a bit. But no other real ties.  
  
Q. You were a walk-on at Nebraska. Dad is a coaching legend in South
Dakota. Did you ever imagine you would take Nebraska as a head coach to the
NCAA tournament?  
AMY WILLIAMS: I feel absolutely just amazing. To be honest with you, I kind of
pinch myself almost every day when I walk into work. Incredibly honored and
humbled to be the head coach of the university I played for and represented
and poured blood, sweat and tears into the program. Just incredibly honored to
be a part of it.  
  
So happy especially for our seniors, but really for every one of these young
women to have this opportunity to be playing in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. The talent level of the high school girls basketball in this state,
how would you describe it here?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Incredible. Texas is absolutely loaded with talent. There's lots
of very quality college programs for them to pick from right in the borders of
their own state. I know my previous head coaches, when I played at Nebraska,
had a lot of success recruiting in the state of Texas.  
  
Since we moved to the Big Ten, we're still working hard to convince those
Texas kids that Nebraska is not that cold, not as cold as they think.  
  
Incredibly talented state here. A ton of respect for the high school
basketball coaches, the level of play, the talent that's down in this area. It
continues to amaze me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Amy Vachon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35112)

### [Blanca Millan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35113)

### [Tanesha Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35114)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd like to begin with an opening statement.  
  
AMY VACHON: We're really excited to be here. It's been 14 years since the
University of Maine has made it to the NCAA tournament. These kids worked
really hard this year. We played a really tough non-conference schedule. It
was ranked 13th in the country. Played Mississippi State, Duke, Ohio State,
Miami. They played tough teams.  
  
They've just done a really good job, so we're really excited to be here. We
know how good Texas is. We've watched film on them. We've watched them play.
But we're excited. We're excited to compete. We're excited to really show what
Maine basketball is all about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Blanca, Texas is a lot taller than you guys, flat out. Your tallest
starter is about 6-1and then you’ve got 6-4, 6-3. How do you combat that part
of the game?  
BLANCA MILLAN: We know we have to focus boxing out, basically work really hard
under the basket. We know they are athletic, so we got to work with that.  
  
TANESHA SUTTON: Basically, like Blanca said, just boxing out, rebounding,
really emphasizing that. Just go out there and do what we do, attack the
basket, take open shots.  
  
Q. Blanca, how does a kid from Spain end up in Maine and how’s the NCAA
Women’s Tournament playing back home?  
BLANCA MILLAN: I mean, I always knew I wanted to play college basketball here.
After, like, a long process of recruiting, Maine was the best thing for me. So
I just came here. Now it's like living a dream.  
  
Last year we lost the championship game so we couldn't come, so right now it's
very exciting to be here. Everybody follows college basketball, and even more
March Madness, so...  
  
Q. Tanesha, Amy just had the interim tag knocked off three or four weeks
ago. Can you talk about her role in bringing this team from last year to this
year, to the point that you’re on right now?  
TANESHA SUTTON: Coach Amy has done, like, a tremendous job with us over the
past few years. She's just been working to get us to where we are now. Even
with new people added to our team, we just went out there this year with the
same, what should I say, motto.  
  
She did a tremendous job. We love playing for her. She really trusts in us,
too. We trust in her, too.  
  
Q. For the players, when you stepped out of your league, you played
Mississippi State, Ohio State, some of these Power Five conferences. How do
you feel like you guys matched up physically, speed-wise with the programs
that are supposed to have those kind of athletes?  
BLANCA MILLAN: We know they are really athletic team. We just focus on our
game plan and try, like, to run our things so we can stay with them. Work
really, really hard, that's it.  
  
TANESHA SUTTON: I mean, basically like what Blanca said. Just go out there
with a game plan, work really hard. A lot of teams during the non-conference
had a lot of height advantage and stuff over us, but we still went out there
and worked hard.  
  
Q. Blanca, what are the biggest challenges that Texas gives you from a
player standpoint?  
BLANCA MILLAN: I mean, I think basically they are really athletic team. We
know that they play really hard basketball. It's going to be a tough game. But
we also know we worked really hard, so we are ready to go out there.  
  
Q. For both players, can you talk a little bit about the euphoria of
last Friday? Winning the America East championship and now, kind of, having
this whole week to process that, put that behind you, and play here in the
NCAAs?  
TANESHA SUTTON: We won the American East Conference championship, it was quite
a day for us. All the hard work paid off. Right after that, we had to get
ready for the NCAA tournament, start working on game plans, preparing for
Texas.  
  
BLANCA MILLAN: I mean, what she basically say. We had, like, three days to
enjoy the wins and everything, then get back to work, so...  
  
Q. One of the things I know about this team is that you guys are really
a closely knit group. I mean, it is one of the truly close families I’ve seen
in the year’s that I’ve been doing Maine basketball. Talk about how you guys
get along so well and it really is that team unit.  
BLANCA MILLAN: I mean, we do basically everything together. Like the freshmen
that they came this year, they were so close to us. Like the first weeks, it
seemed like we were at least one year together. We did a lot of, like, bonding
from pre-season.  
  
With that, it really help us on the court. Now we are, like, everything
together. I think is one of the best things we have.  
  
TANESHA SUTTON: Yeah, I think it really shows when we play on the court, too,
as well.  
  
Q. Blanca, do you guys feel like an international team? You guys have
got four starters from outside the country.  
BLANCA MILLAN: Yeah, I mean, it's a completely different basketball, but when
you are there, like almost all of us is the second year here. I don't know, it
feels like we are from here basically.  
  
It's different, maybe because language and all that. But basketball-wise, once
you know how everything works, it's basically the same.  
  
Q. Blanca, you said at the very beginning, you said, “I always knew that
I wanted to play basketball here.” But when you were in Spain, what drew you
to thinking that you wanted to play college basketball in the United States
and how old were you at the time?  
BLANCA MILLAN: I didn't know. I was really young. I had an idea of what I
wanted to do, but I really didn't know until I came here and saw how
everything works.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes and continue with questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Amy, how does a program like Maine put together such an international
flavor to its roster? How does that even develop?  
AMY VACHON: Well, it goes back when we first got here, Coach Barron was the
head coach. In the springtime, we were in need of players. We had lost a lot
of players to not playing any more, transferring down.  
  
In April, March, in the United States, you're not going to find a lot of
Division I players still available. We really worked hard. Coach Barron went
on an international (indiscernible), per se, and we signed six kids that
spring. They were all international.  
  
Since then, that class graduated in 2016, and that pipeline has remained. The
kids have a great experience at Maine. Maine is a really special place. They
are family. They're supported. We get great crowds. It's a great academic
school.  
  
It's hard. When their parents send them halfway across the world, they know
their kids are going to be taken care of. That's really important. So the
experiences that the former players have had help. We've been very fortunate
to continue that pipeline.  
  
Q. It’s one thing when you’re trying to put together, to mesh a roster,
that’s put together with different parts of one state or form multiple states.
But when. You’re doing it from across borders and countries, is there anything
in particular that stands out that’s a challenge for that?  
AMY VACHON: I mean, I think Blanca said it. At first, maybe language. They all
speak English. People ask that a lot. They all speak English, they all
understand English very well. But sometimes using slang terms or that kind of
thing can be lost.  
  
But basketball is basketball. No matter where you are in the world, that round
ball can unite a lot of different people from a lot of different places. For
us, it really has. I mean, you forget that they're all from all around the
world. It's just that they're all from Maine, and it's pretty cool.  
  
Q. How do you combat the size advantage Texas has?  
AMY VACHON: I mean, it's tough. I'm hoping that the experience we had playing
against the bigger teams in non-conference will help us. But you got to mix it
up. Like the girls said, you have to box them out. They're going to get
rebounds. They're going to get lobs. They're a lot bigger than us, so they're
going to get some of those shots.  
  
We want to try to make them take the shots that they're not comfortable
taking. We understand they're bigger than us. We're not going to go down and
post Nesha up against their big kids. But we'll try and do some different
things, so...  
  
Q. If you can define how it’s been for you from a personal standpoint
since last January to this March, having done such a great job and them
finally taking the interim tag off.  
AMY VACHON: It's really surreal. I honestly get kind of emotional thinking
about it. The last, I don't know, 14, 15 months have just been a rollercoaster
ride. I never would have thought that this was even possible.  
  
But I give credit, complete credit, to those 13 kids in that locker room. They
said it. They trusted me and they trusted our staff completely. That's not
easy. You're coming with a head coach that had never been a head coach before
last January, and they completely trusted us.  
  
It is, it's surreal, it's been an amazing experience.  
  
Q. For those who don’t know, can you talk about why the transition was
made? Did something happen with the former coach, or did something happen to
him late, or maybe he’s back into coaching?  
AMY VACHON: Coach Barron, Richard Barron, has been the head coach since 2011,
I believe. Did a fantastic job. He hired me on as an assistant maybe a week
after, so I've been with him from the beginning. Just tremendous, turned this
program right around.  
  
Then in January of 2017, in the fall he was feeling really ill, but it got to
a point in January he had to step away because he was really not feeling well.  
  
Long story short, they found out what was wrong. He had a craniotomy done in
July at UCLA. They were able to really cure him. He lost his hearing in one of
his ears, but he's doing fantastic.  
  
He took a year. With all that uncertainty, the decision was made to have a
year off for him so he could kind of take care of himself. He could leave the
program in capable hands while he got better. Since then he's made a complete
recovery.  
  
There was a coaching change on the men's side in our school a couple weeks
ago, and he was named the men's coach. I guess it's a week, two weeks ago now.
He's now our men's coach and I'm the women's coach. Works out for me.  
  
He's down the hall. He's been a great mentor to me. He's healthy and back
coaching. That's the story.  
  
Q. Did he want his old job back?  
AMY VACHON: You know what, I mean, I don't know. I'll say this about Coach
Barron. He's my biggest supporter. He really is. He has always said, even when
he first hired me, one of the first things he said to me was, Amy, I want this
to be your job when I leave.  
  
I played at Maine. I'm from Maine. When I played, we went to the NCAA
tournament every year. We beat Stanford in the first round. There's a lot of
history there.  
  
The first thing he ever said to me. I kind of looked at him like, You're
crazy, no way. At that point I didn't even know if I wanted to be an assistant
coach. I was pretty content with me life as a middle school guidance
counselor.  
  
I tried it because I wanted to see what it was like. He would always say that
to me. So while this wasn't at all how either of us expected it to happen,
when he saw how well the girls were doing, how well this program was doing
that he built, I think he kind of said, You know what, it's in really good
hands and I'm good with that.  
  
Again, he's been my biggest supporter. I wouldn't be here without him.  
  
Q. Any words of wisdom for your team regarding to how to pull an upset
in the tournament? You were there for one.  
AMY VACHON: I was. It was a little different. We were a 10 seed (laughter).  
  
That being said, what I've been telling the girls all week is, first of all,
to enjoy it. There are a lot of kids who never have that opportunity. So to
enjoy the experience of being in the NCAA tournament. Then once you enjoy it,
compete, compete like heck.  
  
We have a game plan. I know these kids well. We've said it every game we
played. We don't know what's going to happen, if we're going to win or we're
going to lose. I know if they compete and leave everything on the floor, they
have nothing to hang their head about. Those are the two things that I tell
them.  
  
You never know. Stranger things have happened. I really like our team. As hard
as it will be for us to guard them, they have to guard us, too. We have some
really, really talented players on our team. So I'm really happy for them to
be able to showcase their individual skills and our team as well, so...  
  
Q. Do you have any history with either the Texas basketball team or the
city of Austin?  
AMY VACHON: I do not. Our assistant coach, Jhasmin player, played at Baylor,
is from Bay City. She played actually for Karen Aston for a year. Karen was an
assistant at Baylor. So she has a lot of history with Texas. She has a ton of
family coming.  
  
But personally, I do not.  
  
Q. Baylor is like a fan-favorite around here.  
AMY VACHON: I bet they are. It's like a curse word to say (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'll open with an opening statement, then we'll
take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Sure.  
  
We're obviously really happy to be here. It's always an honor to compete for
the national championship. We don't take that for granted. We're very
appreciative of the NCAA Selection Committee and love Austin, Texas.  
  
Really proud of this team. We've had our share of adversity this year. With
those seniors on our roster, people are like, Oh, kind of a transition year.
It's been so much more. This group has continued to break records this year
for our program, really represent our program in every way.  
  
We just announced yesterday that every eligible player on our team, eight of
them, made the all conference, all academic team. We're really proud of that.  
  
But we're happy to be here. Nebraska is a formidable foe. Very similar, I
think, tough defensive team. A lot more depth than us, but really can score
the basketball. Obviously they just keep getting better and better and better
as the season has gone on.  
  
We're excited. That's the way it should be in March. Every game's going to be
a fun challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Robbi, the Pac-12, very tough conference. How has the conference play
driven you towards going forward in the NCAA tournament?  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah, our conference is tough. Every game can go either way.
Depends who shows up that day. It's been great for us, a great learning
experience. It just prepares us for any game we have this season, especially
now in March. Every game we've had this season has been a tough one. We've had
to earn every win.  
  
Q. Courtney, after you lost Haines early in the season to the injury,
how did the team have to change, or did it change, to make up for her loss?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I think any time a team loses a player, it's something that
you have to adjust to. We always talk about the importance of evaluating and
adjusting.  
  
I think we just had to pull together, and everyone just had to step up a
little bit more. It actually could help us because we knew we were missing a
good player. I think that really pushed us all to be better.  
  
Q. Kianna, what is it going to take to beat Nebraska?  
KIANNA IBIS: I would just say it's going to take a lot of hard work and effort
from each and every one of us. Everybody has to step up. But it's usually not
about the other team, it's always about us, what we can control.  
  
Q. Kianna, you spent some time with Maddie Simon. What do you have as
far as stories?  
KIANNA IBIS: I haven't gotten to hang out with her a lot. I just know a little
bit about her. She's really friendly, really cool. That's all. That's all I
really know.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you led the Pac-12 in scoring defense. How
would you describe the mindset to your defensive approach? What do you think
you do best in limiting what teams can do offensively?  
ROBBI RYAN: We kind of play a pressure-style defense, really try to bother
their team, not let them do what they want to do. I think that is a very key
aspect to our defense, what makes other teams struggle.  
  
KIANNA IBIS: Like she said, we really emphasize on making teams uncomfortable
with our defense.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I think they pretty much covered it. Definitely focus on it a
lot.  
  
Q. Courtney, what would it mean for you guys to leave here Monday night
with a victory and go to the Sweet 16 for your school?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Well, I think we're just taking it one game at a time. We're
focused on our first game first. Obviously looking forward to making a run.
That would be awesome.  
  
It's a great time of the year. Anything can happen. We're playing well, so
we're excited.  
  
Q. Robbi or Kianna, how does the experience of going through last year,
taking South Carolina basically to the last minute, help you in preparation
for this year?  
KIANNA IBIS: I would just say it shows no matter what ranking somebody is, we
know if we can control, we can control, we can hang with any team out there.  
  
ROBBI RYAN: I think it makes us even hungrier this year. We were so close last
year. I think we're just coming back, really trying to focus, just finish it
out, finish strong.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will dismiss our student-athletes. Thank you for your time.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. You lose your point guard, and you have the number one and two
players in the Pac-12 in assist-to-turnover ratio. How does that happen?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Sabrina was more of a combo guard for us, but she did
play the point.  
  
The sophomore class for us is pretty special, pretty beyond their years. They
got complete baptism by fire. Like Robbi said so eloquently, a possession away
from knocking off South Carolina.  
  
They've really been asked that a lot this year. I think it's just their
maturity, all their experience they got their freshman year to come back, be
decision makers, and be more consistent.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't get to see you play a whole lot, can you
describe the defensive effort you put forth.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We've been a little different. It's funny listening to
these guys. We're not pressuring that much this year. We played a lot of zone.
You don't know what we're going to do this year because we don't have the
depth, so we've had to be more strategic.  
  
We've done a lot of different things this year with the same results, which
I'm really pleased and proud of. We've traditionally been one of the top two
or three teams in the Pac-12 for defense.  
  
This year, we shoot a little bit better. We've scored a little bit better than
in some years. Our defense has stayed steady. I think it just depends on our
matchup. Obviously Nebraska, it's hard. It's not like just Gulich, like Oregon
State, one or two players. They really can score at all the positions.  
  
But we pride ourselves on great position defense without fouling. Much like
Nebraska, just working hard, not allowing people to play to their strengths.  
  
But I do think it's funny. We're kind of known for that. Really this year,
it's been a little bit different. The team has adjusted game to game really
well. If we say, Hey, we're doing this this game, they just bought in, went
with it. It's really helped us this year.  
  
Q. A question about Nebraska. They're tied I think for the biggest
turnaround in the country. What does that tell you about the mentality of your
opponent?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, they're confident. Yeah, I mean, obviously anybody
getting their seed, having the success they did in a BCS conference, is a team
that's playing well together, that knows who they are.  
  
They have a very good level of toughness. You see that. You see it not just in
their record, but obviously in this day and age you get every game that people
have played except their closed scrimmage. There's nothing you don't know
about an opponent.  
  
It's funny because we had a couple common opponents, Buffalo. I saw them, I
watched that game, they were a different team. Even Washington State, they're
a different team. Now watching them, whew. They have improved immensely and
really have come together.  
  
Q. I think it was Robbi who talked about how close you got last year to
get to the Sweet 16, how it hurt. How does that experience shape your team
coming into this?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I'm glad you asked them. I'm glad she said, We're
hungry. Obviously as a coach, it's really their mindset and their passion that
is going to drive the team from this day forward.  
  
They're a fun group. They have both. They have the tough mindset. My 14-year-
old son is like a basketball savant junky and kind of a math whizz. He's done
the analytics of everything.  
  
Mom, you've played the most top 25 teams, tied for third in the country, blah,
blah, blah, this, that and the other thing.  
  
Really, there's nothing this team hasn't seen. They do believe in themselves.
They know they obviously have to play well and stuff. We've had a lot of tough
environments, a lot of tough teams this year. This is another opportunity for
them.  
  
Q. Kind of a local question, but do you have any history of playing in
Austin or against Texas, period?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah. When I was a GA at Washington, I remember we
played here. Actually, when I was a senior at Stanford, we lost here in the
Sweet 16. I think back in the day, it was Tara against Jodie. As a G at
Washington, we came here. I just remember we needed trash cans at the corner
of the court because we had two kids with the stomach flu. I remember Amy
Mickelson having to go to the trash can during the game and throw up.  
  
We played early in my career here a couple times, we've done a home and home.
We've done a home and home scrimmage. That's the most recent experience we've
had with UT is closed scrimmages, to be honest. Ironically we're trying to get
one set up for next year. Ironically we're trying to get one set up with
Nebraska next year, so go figure.  
  
Yeah, I mean, a great environment. Great basketball town. Great place to play.
Obviously hostile environment, but a fun one. Karen has just done an
unbelievable job here getting this program back to really where they've been
in the past, a national championship-caliber program.  
  
Q. You come in with the SXSW music festival going around. Have your
players wanted to go downtown?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: The coaches might, but... No, no.  
  
Bad timing for us. We're kind of locked in right now. I think we'll just kind
of use our playlist on our iPhones and go with that this weekend.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'll begin with an opening statement.  
  
KAREN ASTON: Just really excited to get the tournament started. You're always
anxious as you lead up to game day. I think tomorrow will probably feel like a
long day. But I'm excited to get back on the floor, and super excited to host
in front of our fans. I'm proud that we've been able to put a schedule
together and a body of work together where we can host. I think that's great
for our program and great for our fans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. What does it mean that you get to start in your home with all of your
fans? What are you feeling like?  
BROOKE McCARTY: It's very exciting. I mean, I said all year, our fans are like
our sixth man out there. Just to be out there, playing in front of them, feel
their excitement, because I know they're probably more excited than us, it's
just really exciting. Really looking forward to it.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: Basically what Brooke said. It's definitely exciting. We get to
see them screaming and hollering and going crazy for us during the game.
They're just a support all season long. It means a lot to be able to play in
front of them again.  
  
Q. How are you approaching this last NCAA tournament and what is at
stake personally?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think I'm just kind of going day by day, approaching it
probably as just -- let's see.  
  
I don't really know. I'm just taking it day by day, having fun with it,
enjoying these last moments. Especially getting to play here for probably our
last time, it's just a lot of emotions that go into it. I'm taking it day by
day and going with the process.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: Absolutely taking it day by day. It's one of those things you
don't want it to end. I love this team, this culture. Being a part of it has
just been kind of a surreal feeling. I'm just thankful to be here, excited to
keep it going.  
  
Q. What are the challenges that Maine is going to bring?  
ARIEL ATKINS: They have shooters, people that can drive. Their guards are
pretty versatile. They can score basically at every level. That will present a
challenge for us.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: They stick to what they do and execute very well. We're going
to have to stay disciplined, kind of know personnel, follow the game plan.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the season was there a conversation of Final Four
or bust?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Not really. Of course, that's the common goal. I think we did
a really good job this year of taking it day by day, worrying about who we
have to play the next day.  
  
Of course, it's a goal. At the same time we have opponents in front of us who
on any given night can show you anything. We just have to kind of stay in the
moment.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: Definitely taking it day by day. I don't think honestly at this
point anything would be a (indiscernible) to our entire career. I think we
came here and have given Texas everything we have, although we still have more
to go. Like I said earlier, we're just thankful to be a part of this program.
At this point it's just fighting for the next day.  
  
Q. How do you compensate for two important players being injured?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think they definitely are important to our team. Audrey has
been out for a while now. I think we kind of tried to fill that role as best
as we can. Rellah, she brings a lot to the table, too. We have the people who
we have, so we have to play, go to the next day, keep rolling.  
  
Q. What are some advantages you feel like you have over Maine for the
game tomorrow?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I would think our length. Me personally, I'm kind of a long
guard. Our posts have a height advantage, I believe, with Jatarie being two to
three inches taller than their tallest post player. I think that will be part
of our advantage tomorrow.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: I would piggyback off what she said. I think we have a post
advantage. We kind of need to feed off of them tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is there more excitement knowing that this is your last time in the
NCAA tournament?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I'm extremely excited. You dream about this since you're a
little kid. For it to be my last time being in this tournament, I guess you
could say it's not nerve-wracking, but it is butterflies. This is my last
time, my last chance to be a part of this program that has continuously been
in this tournament. Just can't say enough about it.  
  
I think our coaches have done a really good job preparing for it every year,
making sure it's one of our main goals, to be in this tournament.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. I mean, I don't think it's necessarily hit me yet
that it's our last time playing in the NCAA tournament. I think it will
tomorrow maybe when we get to run out there in front of our fans again,
everything like that.  
  
I don't know. It's not hit me yet. It's just crazy to think this is our last
go around.  
  
Q. What does Coach Aston mean to you?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I'm very thankful for her. You can't really see it when you
first get here. You can't really see the light at the end of the tunnel. As I
look back, just kind of remember everything that has gone on here, she has
been a person that pushed me to my limits and past my limits. She's kind of
made me a better player and a better person at the same time. She's so
passionate about her job, you can't help but be passionate about playing for
her.  
  
When you look back on it, it's my last couple times playing for her. Nobody
has pushed me how she's pushed me these past four years. I'll be forever
grateful for that.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: Actually, I think 'passion' is one word you obviously hear when
you hear coach's name. Her passion, her belief in Texas when she first took
the job here, you couldn't explain it.  
  
When she relayed that to me when I was trying to come here, you could feel the
passion in her voice. You could hear how much she wanted to do for Texas.
That's something you just can't help but believe in.  
  
I believed in what she was trying to do here. She's just a great person,
somebody you really can't put into words what she's done for you here. I'm
extremely thankful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions
for coach.  
  
Q. What kind of relationship do you have with Brooke and Ariel?  
KAREN ASTON: It's really special. I've said this many times. I've been
fortunate to, in my career, have coached some really good point guards, which
one of them is my assistant coach. Brooke ranks up there with the best of
them.  
  
She reflects me. The words she just used were 'passion'. You don't see it
sometimes because he's not as emotional maybe, but Brooke is very passionate
about basketball and passionate about being the best she can be.  
  
I would say the same thing for Ariel. They reflect I think my feelings about
the game, and they reflect what they came here for, the same thing I came here
for. They're a mirror of me and how I feel about Texas. They're a mirror of
what our jobs are.  
  
My job when I got here was to do everything I could to make Texas better. When
I took the job, that's all it was about to me. When I recruited them, that's
all it was about to them. They wanted to impact our basketball program. I
mean, knocked it out of the park with that.  
  
That's all I have to say. They have been model student-athletes at Texas.
Their impact will be felt, you know, way past when we're all here just because
of what I think the fans think of them and what the people across the country
think of them.  
  
It's hard for me to think about. I've been with them so long, it's just really
hard. I think today is the first day it hit me when you guys started talking
to them that they're about to be done here.  
  
Q. How big of an advantage do you have hosting?  
KAREN ASTON: I think there's a comfort in being at home and sleeping in your
own bed, not having to get on the plane and travel. I don't know, I mean, if
you reflect back to last year, once we started to make the run against NC
State, the crowd definitely was a factor in that game because we started to
feed off them.  
  
I will say even through my experiences at Cal, once you get between the lines,
it's a basketball game, and everybody is here to win. Everybody has the same
goal and the same purpose. So I'm not sure the advantage is felt once the game
begins other than if it gets tight and your team can fuel.  
  
I do say from that experience, though, that where I think hosting comes into
play is possibly down the line if you do advance. We felt the pain of the
travel, needless to say, when we left the west coast and had to go east in the
regionals. I'll say I'm not sure it's as big of an advantage maybe in the
moment, other than the chance to play in front of your fans. But as you go
along, it probably does weigh in.  
  
Q. Do you see a difference between postseason last year vs this year?  
KAREN ASTON: I do. I do. I think because we have a mix of youth with our older
players. I mean, you have to be careful with these two because they're in the
gym all the time, so I have to limit their time and practice. We've tried to
be sharp and crisp, not spend a lot of time, because we do have experienced
guards.  
  
I think Jatarie has gotten so much experience playing, and four out of our
five starters are pretty seasoned. I think we've been able to be pretty sharp
and pretty precise with what we're looking for.  
  
I will be honest, that we had some time after the loss to reflect, take a few
days off maybe, even regroup and get our pep back again. That was a difficult
loss in a lot of ways. I think we needed the time to regroup. I mean, I gave
them a weekend off. Some of them got to go home. I think just seeing their
moms, having some home cooking, things like that, is really good for kids
sometimes.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you have an edge in length and height vs Maine?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I definitely would agree that we potentially could have an
advantage in the paint. I think what we have to be careful of is that we are a
pretty free-flowing team when we're good. Even though we have an advantage, I
think we need to be careful about thinking we're just going to pound the ball
inside. I would guess they'll have some answers for that in some ways.  
  
I think being aware of taking what the defense is giving you is really
important for tomorrow. Maine presents some different problems for us,
definitely for us on the defensive end. I think we just need to stay
aggressive. We need to stay in our style of play.  
  
Our guards have been our best scorers all year long. Even though I think we
have an advantage, we need to do what's available. If that means the guards
are open for shots, they need to take shots, because they're our main scorers.  
  
I think what we don't need to do is forget about the post players.  
  
Q. Is front court depth a worry for you?  
KAREN ASTON: No. She wasn't playing a lot of minutes. I think first of all,
when you get towards tournament play, I mean, we were able luckily in the Big
12 tournament to play a lot of people because we did have a lead in both games
where we were able to do that.  
  
I mean, the rotation trims in tournament play. I think that's a realistic
statement. I think the bigger key is just getting everybody prepared, even if
it's a minute or two. I feel very comfortable with Mide coming in and giving
us a few minutes of defense and rebounding. I feel very comfortable with
Khale. Even though she hasn't gotten the minutes, when I watch her in
practice, you can tell she's the most comfortable she's been all year. She
missed a large portion of the year with injury.  
  
I feel fine. I feel really good about where we are. I think we've got to
continue to get Joyner in the spaces she's comfortable. I think that's up to
the coaching staff, not Joyner.  
  
Q. How can Joyner get her footing right?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think one thing that I've had to remind myself repeatedly
is that Joyner missed -- I'm going to preface this with saying there's a
reason why you practice. There's a reason why the NCAA gave us opportunity to
work with our student-athletes in the summer. Because you wanted to work with
their skills, you wanted to have some time to work on offensive skill work,
footwork, timing, breakdowns of offense. All of those things, I'm assuming
that was the reason why the NCAA gave us leeway to work with them in the
summer.  
  
There's a huge advantage to that. That's all we work on in the summer, is
offensive skill work. If you're putting in an offensive scheme, then you get
to work on those schemes the summer and fall. Joyner missed all that.  
  
What has been the challenging part is that we have guards that are very free-
flowing, and the offense that we ran was probably predicated on what our
guards are capable of doing. Now we're implementing Joyner in that system that
she missed some time in. It's taken us some time sometimes to figure out where
is she the most comfortable and what offensive scheme does that work with.  
  
Against certain opponents there's certain things you have to look for. I think
that's the challenge of our staff. I don't even just mean Joyner. When you put
Jordan in, what offensive scheme works best with a certain lineup. I think
we've tinkered with some things over the break that I think will help. But she
needs to be in spaces where she's comfortable.  
  
Q. How much film have you watched on Maine?  
KAREN ASTON: A lot.  
  
Q. What do you think of Maine?  
KAREN ASTON: I think the players hit it on the head pretty good. At least
they're listening.  
  
They can shoot. They've got a lot of craftiness to them. They can pass the
basketball really well. They run offensive schemes that make you move a lot
defensively. They can shoot the three really well. They kind of test your
discipline.  
  
I thought Brooke hit that on the head, that they need to be a very disciplined
defensive team. I think there's some mismatch challenges for both teams. I
think that there's a chance we'll have to go with four guards tomorrow some.
I'm very comfortable with that if we do that.  
  
I think if anybody watched us sort of down the stretch, there were times in
Big 12 play we went to the four-guard lineup. It's actually a very effective
lineup for us. Won't shock me if we don't need to do that some tomorrow just
because of how they spread the floor and their capabilities at their forward
position.  
  
Q. What pressure does four guards put on the other team?  
KAREN ASTON: I definitely think that's been part of why that lineup against
specific teams has been good for us. It enables us to sort of revert back to
the offense that we ran pretty consistently in the first semester. I think
that lineup gives everybody a little bit of a different look.  
  
Having Ariel at the forward position is a mismatch problem. Again, we have to
be able to match up defensively to be able to do that. So that's the challenge
sometimes. There's not too many teams we can't do that with, but there are a
few. That's not a reality for us. But I like it. I'm very comfortable with a
four-guard lineup.  
  
To answer your question, again, Maine can really spread it, and they can score
in a lot of different ways. We're going to have to be really good on defense.  
  
Q. Are you able to give any details on why Rellah won’t be available for
the tournament?  
KAREN ASTON: No.  
  
Q. How is your team going to adjust to a team they have never played
before?  
KAREN ASTON: I think that's the fun part about the NCAA tournament, is that
you can breathe a little bit. I would say every coach in the country, every
player in the country kind of feels that way. You get away from conference
play, in particular in the Big 12, because of the fact that we play the double
round-robin, by the time you get to the second one, everything has come to a
screeching halt because you know each other so well.  
  
It is a breath of fresh air for us. I think to be able to play someone that's
maybe not quite as familiar with the way we play or the tendencies of our
individual players. I mean, Maine would probably say the same thing.  
  
It's just a little bit of an adjustment period as you go along in the game to
get used to someone's style of play. I think it's a little bit of a breath. We
enjoy it. It's a new season. I think the players enjoy having that reset
button pushed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 90, Marquette - 72  
  
JEFF WALZ: First off, I'd just like to thank our crowd, everybody that helps
put on this event. I thought it's first-class. I think that's what we do here
at Louisville when we put on an NCAA Tournament. Everything is done the way
it's supposed to be, so I want to thank all of our volunteers, all of our
support staff, everyone that makes this possible because it's not easy. There
is a lot of people that volunteer their time. So we're fortunate enough to be
able to do something like this and host. So I'd like to start off thanking
them.  
  
And then I'd like to thank our crowd. What an absolutely -- just a wonderful,
wonderful crowd we had today, especially with our men playing here at 6:30.
You know, to get 8,000 to come out, and they were loud. They were into the
game. That speaks volumes for what we can do here at Louisville athletics. Not
just one sport because I'm excited to see what our men's crowd is tonight for
when our men play to be able to compare and go, hey, our men may have had
10,000 12,000, 13,000 and we get 8,000. That's a lot of people rolling through
in one day to watch two basketball games.  
  
And then I just have to congratulate Marquette and their team. I mean, it was
-- we knew going into the game that they can score with the best of them, and
Blockton just absolutely -- she put on a show tonight. To drop 34, five
assists, one turnover, I mean, we really didn't have an answer for her. We
tried to double her at times. We tried to do whatever we could. But she played
great.  
  
I thought we did do a very good job on Hiedeman. You know, she was one that I
was worried about, but we did a very nice job of contesting shots early and
making it difficult for her to score. And you know, it's a ballclub that's
very talented. They're very well-coached, and just want to wish them nothing
but the best next season.  
  
And then for our kids, you know, I was just -- I thought from top to bottom,
everybody gave us a lift. I thought off the bench, I thought Kylee came in in
the first half and played big minutes for us. I thought she was really good.
Dana came in and gave us big minutes, too. Bionca, although it's only seven,
they were seven important minutes. So I was just really proud of them.  
  
And then you look at Asia, you know, when she saw the ball go in, I know she
felt better. That was a great night for her, six assists, three turnovers.  
  
Jaz, I mean, six of nine, seven assists, one turnover.  
  
And I thought AC, only though she only scores two points, I thought she was a
calming influence on the floor for us. I thought she did a great job.  
  
And when you talk about Myisha and Sam, I challenged them both because we knew
that's where our advantage was going to be was in the post, and I thought they
both came out and really played aggressive and played hard, and that's kind of
what separated things for us.  
  
Q. What were you doing so well against Marquette in the first half?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We moved the ball really well. We got the ball inside,
like Coach Walz mentioned, our advantage was inside, and that's what we tried
to do. Once we got the defensive rebound we ran in transition, too, so we got
a lot of open lay-ups, open looks, and I mean, Asia was hitting really well.
So we'd get the ball to her -- and she's amazing. She was able to do a lot for
us.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing as Mya. I think our tempo was pretty
good. Like Coach Walz just said, we were trying to feed the ball inside the
post because Mya and Sam did a heck of a job tonight as they do every single
game, so I think we played hard, as well. We started off really, really,
really strong and we kept on going. We had a few breakdowns. I had a lot of
breakdowns. But I mean, we're going to watch this film and see what we can
take from the game.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: To go along with what Myisha said, our advantage was in the
post, so that's where we brought it.  
  
Q. 27 seven assists for 40 baskets. Was there an extra emphasis today on
moving the ball, making the extra pass?  
ASIA DURR: I mean, it's the same thing we've been talking about since the
first game. Coach Walz has been trying to tell us if we move the ball great,
we get great shots, and I think we did a good job of doing that tonight. We
try to get tempo going every day in practice. That's what we practice, pushing
the ball up the floor, and I think we do a good job of doing that.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: We find the open man. We're always moving. Well, sometimes. But
yeah, I mean, we found the open man. We passed the ball, reversed it. That's
how we scored.  
  
Q. Myisha and Sam. Myisha, I think you hit your first 10 shots; Sam, you
might have had a career high today. When you get into a mismatch like this
physically, does it change the way that you play? They want to feed the post,
but do you become more aggressive, do you become more aware that you have
opportunities to dominate inside?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No. I mean, last game for me personally, I couldn't -- the
ball just wasn't going in, and I was shooting lay-ups, so I made sure I was
focusing on that today, and I admit the first 10, I didn't know that. But that
works, and whatever works, that's what we do. It doesn't -- like we try to get
the ball inside. If Asia or AC or Jaz would say -- we try to get them the
ball. We don't want to force it inside if it's not working, but today it
worked and we got the ball inside.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: We try to play our game. Nothing changes for us personally, but
you're more aware of who's guarding you. When a 6'5" girl is guarding you, you
know, because either that's getting swatted, or yeah. But when a 5'11" girl is
guarding you, you still know, but you still go up strong in the same way.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing that they just said, yeah. I mean, we
have great post players, Mya and Sam.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: She's not welcomed in the post group yet.  
  
ASIA DURR: Can I answer the question? I would say that I have y'all's back.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: You can ask AC that question.  
  
Q. Myisha, you kissed the Cardinal bird. I think you hugged a bunch of
babies and kissed some people coming off. Talk about your emotions coming off
that floor and your last game.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Can we come back to that one when I'm good? I'm good. I
mean, it was my last game here. I wanted to go out with a win, and my
teammates got that for me. I'm just so thankful to just make it here this far
and have great teammates around me and wonderful fans that actually come out
to the games and know what they're watching and just support us, from my
freshman year all the way up until now. The fan support has been amazing. I
was hugging the kids because those are faces I see every single game. They
weren't new, so it was like, you feel a connection, like they're actually a
part of you. I mean, I consider everyone that I've met here my family, and I
hope that I made a good impression on them. I am just so thankful that
(tearing up) --  
  
Q. What did you say to the Marquette fans?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: During the game I got heated and I looked at one of the
fans, and I don't remember what I said, but I think I just pointed up to the
scoreboard, and that's not me. That's not who I was, so I was going over there
apologizing and just telling them, that's not me. They're awesome fans, and
they traveled this far to support their team. I mean, Marquette is a great
team, too. It was just not me that I did that, so I was just going to go
apologize.  
  
Q. Sam, Coach was saying that he was concerned about Hiedeman and really
shutting her down. You all rotated a bunch of coverages on her. I think there
were several times early on where you were fronting her. Was that something
you felt like you all had to do to really kind of confuse her and not let her
think that it was going to be a guard on her and maybe that kind of shook them
up in other ways?  
SAM FUEHRING: I don't think it was about confusing her, it was just about
making her she does not score because she had 32 last game, so that was our
main worry. We were trying to make other people beat us. But no, it wasn't to
confuse her. I mean, we just switched on to her, and then a big guy to guard
her. That's sometimes scary because you don't want to get crossed up or
anything. But yeah, it wasn't too bad.  
  
Q. Myisha, you mentioned the last few minutes before you left the court
there. Knowing this was your last time-out here, what did you want to make
sure you saw or took in before you left?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I was just worried about getting a win. It didn't matter
how I played. I just wanted to get a win. I could have played phenomenal, I
could have played crappy. As long as we got the win, that's what was most
important, what I was most satisfied in and looking forward to.  
  
Q. For all three of you, you guys the last couple games of the regular
season and in the ACC Tournament were kind of getting off to some slow starts.
Was it a relief today that you came out right away and were able to put some
distance between yourselves?  
ASIA DURR: I wouldn't say relief. I just think it's one game and done from
here on out, so we've just got to come out, stay on top, and just keep on
going forward, so that's what we were trying to do today. We knew we had a
great ball team in front of us, well-coached team. They have a great coach.
They have great players all across their team, so we knew we had to come out
strong, and that's what we did.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: It's not really a relief. It's like kind of just getting back to
where we started in the beginning of the year. Just knowing that it's still
there, that we didn't lose it. I wouldn't say it was much of a relief. We've
just got to stay that way because we ended bad today.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, like what they were saying.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Good answer.  
  
Q. You touched on this earlier about trying to get the ball inside. It's
not rocket science, obviously, when you have that kind of size differential.
Is that pretty standard, or is anything different about today versus other
games where you had a physical advantage?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I thought we were a lot more patient. It's not -- you go to
the Arizona men's game, they had significant advantage in the paint but had a
hard time throwing it in because they were collapsing in on their big guy. So
teams do different things. Even though you have size advantage, it doesn't
always make it easy throwing the ball in there.  
  
But I thought we did a great job of reversing it. Instead of trying to throw
it in off the first pass, we got the ball worked around, so then the defense
had to shift. And when you can get them to shift, then you've got a better
opportunity to do a little high-low and throw it in.  
  
And then Sam and Myisha finished, which is a big thing. I thought they
finished well. They finished over people. They finished with some contact, and
that's what you have to do at this time of the year. You've got to be able to
finish.  
  
Q. 24 points for Myisha Hines Allen. What was she doing to well this
game that set her apart?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, she was a lot more active. I mean, just some of the rebounds
that she went up and got, it's pretty darned impressive how strong she plays.
You know, she wanted the ball. Instead of just sticking her hip out and
calling for a little wrap-around pass, she actually gotten toes to the ball
and we like to say, and she was demanding it, and then she made some good
strong moves. And then for Myisha, you can normally tell how she's going to
play by the way she rebounds the basketball. When she starts to go after them
the way she did, then you know some good things are going to happen at the
offensive end, also.  
  
Q. I know you knew Asia could do it again at some point, but when that
first three went in, and she looked like she took a deep breath, what was your
thoughts?  
JEFF WALZ: I mean, there was no question. I just kept talking to her the past
two weeks. I mean, it's what you do; you play basketball. Stop worrying about
making every shot. I'm trying to get them all to understand that if you made
every shot, it would be a tie game, and then they wouldn't need coaches. So
like I appreciate when they miss a couple, because then it's called job
security. If you think about it, you made every single shot, why pay anybody
to coach? So like I told them, when you miss, I'm clapping. Just don't miss
too many of them.  
  
So I tried to make her -- you've got to laugh. It's a game of basketball. Now,
it's what we do. It's our livelihood, there's no question about it.  
  
But at the same time, you've got to be able to make it fun for the kids, and
that's what we try and do. Now, we work hard, but I'm as sarcastic as probably
any coach out there. I want them to be able to laugh. I think laughter is a
key to success. If you can't laugh at yourself, who can you laugh at?  
  
And I think it just calms them down, it gives them a little peace, and I was
just really, really pleased that she came out with the confidence that she did
today.  
  
Q. What did you think about your defensive pressure initially? I think
you got, I guess, the first basket came off a steal and turnover, and then
there were some other pokes away inside that really led to easy chances.
Obviously that was a focus for you, but how pleased were you with that
execution?  
JEFF WALZ: I was really pleased. I thought Jaz came out right there off the
get-go and disrupted a hand-off and got her hand in, and boom, then it goes
down for a lay-up. No, we only turned them over seven times, so we ended up
with nine points off turnovers, they had 10. But what I thought we did
defensively in the first half was we contested shots. We made it difficult.
There weren't easy looks for them, and that's what we had talked about. We had
to do everything we could to make it difficult for Hiedeman to score and
Blockton to score, and I thought we did that the first half. Now, Blockton put
on a clinic there in the second half. She was very, very impressive.  
  
Q. Improving and peaking at the right time at this time of year is
always of tantamount importance, but today four players in double figures,
five with three assists or more, you out-rebounded them 42-26, you shot 63
percent. What do you say at halftime or even at the end of the game to
continue the momentum on the uptick?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I challenged them at halftime because I knew Marquette would
not quit. This is a ballclub that's got too much fight in them. They came out
in the third quarter and showed that. We just did not come out defensively
with the same intensity. I think we gave up three straight lay-ups in
transition. Now, we scored, but that was not the goal, to just trade baskets.  
  
And I thought Kylee Shook with four blocks was big for us today. You know, we
challenged them especially after the game, I talked to them, and we have to
get in this gym here tomorrow and watch some film and just talk about our
passing. It was bad. We threw it to them quite often, which we just got
sloppy, and those are things that we have to address and take care of. So
whoever we play next, when they press, we're prepared for it, because when we
did make the right decision on a hard cut, we ended up with 21 fast break
points, and a lot of it came from attacking their press.  
  
Q. When these three especially who were up here are playing like they
did tonight, do you feel like you guys are kind of unbeatable?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I wouldn't say that. I think we're pretty good. If you want
to be -- I worked for Paul Sanderford for six years, a gentleman that should
be in our women's basketball Hall of Fame if we can figure things out from
that end of it. I mean, he only played in three Final Fours and one National
Championship game. But we can't -- hopefully we can get a little smarter and
get him in.  
  
But he always told me, if you want to be a good team, you have to have two
players. Every night you know what they're going to do. Like you don't even
have to look at the stat sheet, you know what you're going to do. You want to
be a really good team, you've got to have three of them. You want to be
special, you've got to have four. And if you want to be great, you've got to
have five.  
  
And right now, we're at a point, we played tonight where five of them showed
up. Even though on the stat sheet Arica Carter comes up with two points, but
she controlled the tempo. She did a great job for us. Jaz goes six of nine,
seven assists and one turnover. And our bench, I'm telling you, our bench came
in and did a good job.  
  
So we have to have -- you have to have five. If you want to win a National
Championship and compete at that level, you've got to have five show up. And
now I know Asia feels better after this ballgame tonight, just kind of a
weight lifted off of her. I know what Myisha can do. Sam is always -- the one
thing I'll say about Sam, that kid, she competes as hard as anybody I've ever
coached. She's on the ground more than anybody. Defensively the kid has taken
38 or 39 charges on the year. So it's going to take all of them. If we all
five show up and then our bench adds, then we have a chance to make a run.  
  
But from here on out, you're playing everybody good, just like tonight. If you
have a bad night, you're going home.  
  
Q. And then you said towards the end of your speech that you miss the
old Big East. Did this game bring back any memories of the conference?  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, I told the Marquette fans, I thanked them for coming down. They
have a great ballclub. You know, we're very blessed to be in the ACC, there's
no question about that. We have great games in and out. But when you had Terry
up there and just go through the entire old Big East, it was a battle. It was
a battle. It did remind me because we had great games up there, they had great
games when they came down here. You knew every fight it was going to be a
fight. I just commended Carolyn. I think she's done a remarkable job and has
that program right back on the verge.  
  
Q. And then where do you see this program probably a year from now,
pretty much all the players that they played were juniors?  
JEFF WALZ: I don't want to play them. I'll tell you that. I mean, not at all.
They're really, really good. They sure are.  
  
Q. Going forward, Jeff, you look at these two games, fairly decisive;
where do you feel like this team took a step forward in these two rounds, and
how much does that help you going into the regional?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we needed a game like this just to give a little confidence
back, I think, offensively, for Asia, for Jaz. We've been playing good
basketball. You know, to win the ACC Tournament is not easy. You know, I mean,
they're great teams. We figured out a way to win three games in three games by
a total of 10 points, and that's what prepares you for this.  
  
NC State is battling; Virginia Tech, I'm waiting to see how they continue on
in the NIT because it wouldn't surprise me if they win it. And then you've got
Notre Dame.  
  
So our league has prepared us for anybody we're going to play. There's no
question about that, because we have a lot of teams that can play different
styles of basketball. So no matter who we move on to and play next weekend,
we're going to be able to compare them to somebody that we have played.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 18, 2018

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 90, Marquette - 72  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: First of all, just want to congratulate Louisville. Obviously
they're a phenomenal basketball team. They share the ball so well. They have
numerous weapons in different positions, and obviously the atmosphere here is
top-notch. It says a lot about women's basketball and where it's come. I
commend the whole entire program and the whole city of Louisville for putting
on this event. You guys did a really good job.  
  
Q. Allazia, you've got matched up against Myisha a few times. There's a
big physical difference inside. How do you cope with that, and how much did
that have to do with her making her first 10 shots?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I think it's just relying on your teammates. Like obviously
she's bigger than me, so just trying to front, get around, and rely that my
team is going to be there for the help, and just in the first quarter we
didn't do a really good job of boxing her out. We got her to miss the first
shot, and shy just was a beast on the boards. So we've just got to do a better
job of that, knowing that we're smaller stature.  
  
Q. Allazia, really much different second half from first half. What did
they do that locked you up in the first half and what changed in the second
half for you to get freer and get better looks?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I think I had a lot of open shots in the first half, just
wasn't knocking them down. So in the second half I just came out and just was
being aggressive. I think I was aggressive the whole game. It's just about
believing in yourself, and I think I believed in myself the whole game, so
that's why I think there was a difference.  
  
Q. What did Louisville do initially that you didn't see in the scouting
report or see on film that they kind of shook you up at first?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: They really didn't do anything that we didn't see on the
scouting report. We just lacked focus in the first half, which led us to a bad
start in the game. But coming out of halftime, we talked about it, and we said
that we need to get our focus better, and I think going into the second half,
we picked up our focus and created more problems for them.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Yeah, I think we came out a little bit timid, probably saw
the crowd, got a little nervous, and against Louisville, a top team like that,
you can't come out flat, and I think that's what we did. In the second half,
we didn't see anything in the first half that they didn't do. They did
everything in the second half. It was just about us picking up our aggression,
our intensity.  
  
Q. Natisha, you went from 32 points on Friday to nine today; was it just
shots not falling, or was there something that Louisville did different?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, shots just weren't going in today. They have a great
defensive team, and they were just taking it away.  
  
Q. You knew that Louisville was going to do a lot in the fast break, but
still even with that, they really thrived. What did they do that made them so
tough to defend?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Their points in the paint. Obviously they had 60 points in the
paint, and when you allow a team to have 60 points in the paint, it's going to
be hard to win. Our game plan was to change up defenses and keep them out of
the paint, and obviously we didn't execute that very well.  
  
Q. In addition to the points in the paint differential, seemed like they
were maybe just a step faster on the fast break at times. Any comments on
that?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I don't know if they were a step faster to be honest. I mean,
I think it was our defensive coverage and their rebounding. I thought our
speed, we were able to keep up with them speed-wise, but size-wise and their
rebounding, so I think their advantage was they got rebounds on missed shots
and then were able to start their break faster, and when they're able to get
rebounds and long outlets, that's when you can run. For us, on the flipside of
that, they were scoring at such a high rate that we couldn't get our fast
break going because they made shots every time, so I would say that was the
advantage there.  
  
Q. What made Hines-Allen so difficult to defend?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean, her size. We don't have a physical presence like her
that we can just keep throwing bodies at her, and obviously that's something
that we want to get to as a program, where we have more size and more
physicality. But right now, they obviously had the size advantage, so for us,
we tried different schemes and tried to throw different stuff, but we're just
one too many big bodies short.  
  
Q. You've talked about the growth from being in this tournament. What
does your team kind of take away from a game like this going forward?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think the first thing we've got to look at is we've got to
look at Louisville as a team, and if we want to become a top-10 program or
keep evolving as a women's basketball program that gets in the top 25
annually, we've got to look at the best teams, and what do they do, and what
do they do on a consistent basis. So for us, I think it shows when we won that
second half, so for us to be able to come back with confidence and knowing if
we do our game plan right and we focus and play hard and we do the
intangibles, we can play with anyone. When we play with immaturity and when we
lack focus and we don't follow the game plan, well, then it's a story of the
first half.  
  
So for us I think we've got a lot of things to fix in the off-season, but I
think you'll see a Marquette team next year that people will not want to face
in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. How nice of a luxury is it to have pretty much all five starters
returning, most of the team starting, only losing Shantelle?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean, that's huge. It's the bulk of our team. We'll miss
Shantelle in so many ways. On the flipside of that, to have everybody
returning other than Shantelle, I think that just helps with your chemistry, I
think it helps with your experience. Even last year to this year, from the
Quinnipiac game to the Louisville game and the Dayton game, I think we've
grown up a lot, so you give us another summer, another off-season to improve
and get better, and I'm really excited to see what this group can do. I think
there's big things ahead.  
  
Q. You referenced it kind of off the top; how much did the crowd really
affect your team early in this game?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, I think the crowd -- one thing that has been our
achilles heel all season has been our communication, and that's where we need
to really need to evolve. We need max level, and I think when you throw that
and a crowd like this in, that's a recipe for disaster. I think that's what
you saw is a snowball effect in the first half, first quarter I should say.
The crowd was loud, the crowd was into it. Our team wasn't talking; they
couldn't hear each other. So like I said, a mixture of things, but definitely
when you have a women's basketball crowd like that, and the fans here are
fantastic, it's a huge advantage, and like I said before, I tip my hat to
everybody in the building today.  
  
Q. And then you mentioned doing things that a team like Louisville does.
What are some of the things that you've noted that they've done that maybe you
don't see Marquette doing quite yet?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, I would say obviously their physicality, their
toughness. If we can capture what they do on the boards and how physical they
play and how they handle adversity, I think we're going to be in great shape.
I have a lot of respect for Jeff and what he's been able to do here with this
program. I'll say their players compete, they compete for every rebound, they
compete for every loose ball, and I thought you saw our team play like that in
the second half; not so much in the first.  
  
So we've got to become more consistent, and obviously when you're 34-2, you're
a consistent basketball team. So that's where we've got to fix is we've got to
become more consistent. We've shown spurts of it, we've shown quarters of it,
we've shown games of it, but we've got to show an entire season of it, and 40
minutes every night.  
  
Q. And then I saw you kind of embrace Jeff at the beginning. Has he
given you any advice as you've built this program?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I just think we were just chatting before the game and both
have mutual respect for each other and what we've been able to do. I always
like to pick people's brains, but before a game you don't have much time.  
  
Q. You took both Tennessee and Notre Dame to overtime earlier in the
season. How would you compare Louisville to those two squads?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, I would say the thing about Louisville is their
depth. I would say that's the biggest difference, to be honest. Obviously
Notre Dame is injury-plagued right now, and Tennessee is young, but I would
say Louisville, when they sub, they come at you with the same intensity as
they had with their starters, and I think that speaks volumes for their
recruiting and what they've been able to do. Off the top of my head, that
would be the biggest thing.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

### [Sam Fuehring](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34733)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
ASIA DURR: They're a team that plays hard. They don't give up. They run the
floor well. They have scorers on their team. They have posts that can score,
as well. They're a team that is well-coached, so it's going to be a great
game. They're a great team.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: They're very fast paced. We have to run the floor with them.
Their posts are strong, and their guards can do everything, really.  
  
Q. Having seen what happened on the men's side last night with the 16
beating a 1, how important is it to not take any seed lightly when you're
playing in these early rounds?  
SAM FUEHRING: Being in the NCAA Tournament, you've got to expect that everyone
is good. You can't take anyone lightly because it's March Madness, too, so
anything can happen. Teams are at their best level, and they can compete with
anyone.  
  
Q. Sam, when you look back on your defensive effort yesterday, what did
you like, and what do you feel like you've got to really kind of turn up
against Marquette, considering they kind of pride a lot of their opportunities
on defense, as well?  
SAM FUEHRING: I liked our pressure yesterday. I feel like we have to turn that
over to Marquette because, I mean, we can probably force turnovers, and we
have to stay in front of them, as well. That's something that we struggled a
little bit against Boise State, but being in front of Marquette, because they
drive a lot, it's going to help us defensively.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing that Sam said. I think we did a good job
pressuring the ball against Boise State, but Marquette, they're a great team
that they drive really, really well. We have to do a better job of staying in
front of them and playing in the gap, as well.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up, when a player like Natisha has I think it was 32
points and that many threes, what's the challenge in really trying to face
guard her? Is it really like pressing her or just making sure that she's just
accounted for at all times?  
ASIA DURR: You have to stay very aggressive with her. You have to know where
she is at all times. I mean, it's the same thing that Coach Walz tells us all
the time. You've got to stay in front. You've got to make them take tough
shots, shoot over us.  
  
I think we'll be fine. We are truly excited about this game, so we just have
to play hard and have fun. I mean, no game is guaranteed, so this could be our
very last game, so we've just got to go out there and just play hard and have
fun.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: To add on to what Asia said, I feel like we do have to stay in
front. We can't bail them out when they do drive. We can't give them easy
buckets. If No. 5 goes for 32, good for her. We're going to try our best for
her not to do that.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SAM FUEHRING: That could be an advantage to them, but we also have a bench
that can do that for us. While they're out on the floor running, we have a
bench that's resting, so that can be an advantage to us.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing that Sam said. Yeah, they're a very
great team. They all can score. But it's just going to come down to who wants
it more. We've just got to be fun. At this time, it's just fun. Like he just
stated, Virginia lost their first-round game, which is crazy. But at this time
you're going to get every team's best shot, and we've got to take it as a
challenge and just have fun with that.  
  
Q. Do you all see similarities between yourselves and Marquette
defensively in terms of turning defense into offense?  
ASIA DURR: Yes, I would say yes. They both like to pressure the ball. They
play very fast. We try to play fast, as well. I would say yes, we do some
things kind of the same, but I mean, it's going to come down to, like I said,
who wants it more. Defense is, like Sam just said, who wants to get more stops
and things like that. It's going to be fun.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Watching them yesterday, I saw a similarity with transition,
too. I saw that they like to push the ball. Anyone can bring it up for them,
so yep.  
  
Q. Their coach said she thought you guys had a size advantage on them,
but they might have a quickness advantage on you at some positions. Is that
how you guys see it?  
SAM FUEHRING: I don't think height matters to be honest. It's all about heart,
if you want to work hard or if you don't. Whoever works hard will win the
game.  
  
ASIA DURR: It definitely comes down to who plays harder. They do have quick
guards, but so do we. We have good posts. They do, too. It's going to be a
great game, but we've got to stay with the game plan, follow what the coaching
staff gives us, and just play hard.  
  
Q. Asia, we've peppered your coach and teammates the last few days about
your shooting and scoring, that kind of thing. How have you kind of really
kept focused on the big picture and feel like the scoring will kind of fall
into place?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, scoring will always come into place for this team first. We
got the win. We've been playing great as a team, but we've been -- each game
we take the next step, which is huge, especially at this time of the year. I
mean, it's team first. We're getting ready for this next game tomorrow.  
  
Scoring will come as you play hard, so I'm not too concerned about that.  
  
Q. Scoring-wise, when you see the kind of looks that you got, is that
the kind of thing that encourages you to say, okay, at some point they're
going to start falling like they did before?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, I mean, I've spent a whole lot of time on my game my whole
life, so it's definitely going to come down to just staying confident,
trusting my teammates, trusting my coaching staff, as well. My shot will fall,
so I'm not concerned about that. Yeah, and just stay calm, stay with the game
plan. It's not so much about scoring, you've just got to stay with the game
plan, trust your teammates, and stay with the process.  
  
Q. Final opportunity to play in the Yum! Center in front of your fans.
How big of an advantage or how much do you feed off of having your home crowd
here?  
SAM FUEHRING: It's a big advantage. Last night's game we had 7,000 people,
over 7,000 people. They blew off the roof, and just having it here at the KFC
Yum! is a total advantage because they've got our backs, and the crowd does so
much for us when we play. It means a lot, and it's a big advantage.  
  
ASIA DURR: I feel like we have the best fans in the country. I've been saying
that throughout the whole year. I'm truly excited just because this is our
last game here, so I mean, I know our fans are going to be here. They're going
to be loud like they have been throughout the whole year. I mean, it's so much
fun playing in front of them and playing here because it gets so loud.
Tomorrow is going to be a great game, so they're definitely going to be loud.  
  
Q. Is it different as a player when you play in environments where
there's 800, 900, 1,200 people and then in front of 7,000, and does it affect
you guys?  
SAM FUEHRING: It does. I feel like having like 90 people versus 7,000, it's
quiet. Like you can hear your bench talking, and it's kind of like -- it's not
really fun. Playing with 7,000 you have people screaming your name. Like I
hear people when I inbound the ball, I hear people talking to me. So it just
gets us going.  
  
ASIA DURR: You can definitely tell the difference between a 90-fan game or a
7,000 or 8,000 game. Like as a player, you try to not -- stay as focused with
the fans and the crowd, you just try to stay tuned in with the game. I mean,
it's hard, too, yeah. We played at some places where there's not that many
fans there, but you've just got to stay with your team.  
  
Q. I'm not comparing Marquette to UMBC because they're a good team,
almost beat Notre Dame on the road, but you're a 1 seed. Did you watch
Virginia last night, and is that something you address with your team as a
target that you guys have?  
JEFF WALZ: I actually fell asleep at halftime, so I watched for the first
half. It was at 21-all, and then I was exhausted. I didn't realize until this
morning. I've said all along, the seeding is something they have to do to put
the teams in a bracket. But then after that, I'm just a big believer it's all
about momentum. It's not about seeding, it's momentum. You have to seize the
momentum when you get it, and you might get one opportunity, you might get
five, you might get six. But when you get momentum on your side, you've got to
run with it.  
  
You know, when you can turn a 4-0 run into a 10-0 run, a 12-0 run, that can
knock a team out. That's the part right now at this time of year that I think
separates who's going to finish with a win.  
  
So we just have really talked about that. Now, the kids talked about it at
breakfast, about the men's game and what went on, but I did not get a chance
to see it, so I'm looking forward to seeing some highlights.  
  
Q. How do you follow up yesterday's performance defensively? What things
do you feel like you can improve on, even the things that you liked yesterday
that you can improve on?  
JEFF WALZ: Sure. It's been a year where we've actually defended well the
entire season. We led the ACC in defensive points allowed during the
conference play. We've been pretty consistent game in and game out, and each
game presents a different scenario.  
  
Tomorrow, Marquette's ability to push the ball in transition is phenomenal,
not just -- I've really been impressed with how hard they play, how they play.
You know, you just look at their stats, and I don't have yesterday's included
in their stat sheet here, but you've got 89 assists, 91 assists, 124 assists,
114 assists, so you've got four of their starters that have probably now after
yesterday's game, 90 or more assists. That's pretty impressive. Normally as a
coach, if you can get two players to have 100 assists on the season, you feel
good about things. They're looking at possibly having four get to 100. I'd
like to see if any other programs have ever had that done.  
  
So we're going to have to do a good job picking the ball up. It's not go to
just be a point guard. A lot of traditional teams, they get it to the point
guard, you just find the point. Well, their 4 can bring it up, their 5 can
bring it up, so everybody is going to have to be dialed in. You've got to be
sprinting the floor, looking over your shoulder, matching up and knowing,
heck, if I'm the post player, I might have to go back and get the ball. So
it's going to present some different challenges to us, there's no question.  
  
They're very, very, very well-coached. I say it all the time, we take a lot of
pride in what we do here at Louisville, and when we sit down and watch film,
it's easy to see that they have a game plan. You can look at things and be
like, boy, they're prepared, and there's no question tomorrow they're going to
be prepared for us. I'm expecting a great basketball game.  
  
Q. Do you see any similarities between Marquette's program that they
have, their culture, kind of their quick rise, to say where your program was
five, ten years ago?  
JEFF WALZ: I mean, we're all -- Marquette has always had a really good
program. When we first got in the Big East, they had a great program. So it's
just fun to watch. You watched classes come in and go out, and their junior
class is as good as anybody's in the country. You know, they're starting five
juniors who are big-time players, and they play with a swag. So yeah, it's fun
to watch.  
  
I don't like comparing anybody to us because I think what they've done is
impressive. I don't want to say, oh, yeah, I compare it to us because what
they're doing is their own and it's great, so it's a compliment to them,
because I just think they play hard, and as I said, they're very well-coached.  
  
Q. It's been a few years since you faced them in the Big East, but are
you having any kind of a Big East flashback to thinking about how you played
them before or -- just to remind this crew that it was pretty tough back
then?  
JEFF WALZ: It's always been tough. That's the old Big East -- and I'll
probably get in trouble for it, but the old Big East is the best basketball
league I've ever been a part of in women's basketball. You throw West Virginia
in there, Rutgers, Marquette, DePaul, Villanova, UConn, Notre Dame, just go
through the list, and it's pretty impressive to see what's going on. The one
and two, the first- and second-place team in the Big East is Marquette and
DePaul. The winner and runner-up in the ACC are two teams that came from the
old Big East. UConn is winning the AAC. Last year West Virginia won the Big 12
tournament championship.  
  
So that's, I think, is what's helped prepare all of these programs that have
-- when the old Big East broke up. That's why I think everybody has had
success, because you're used to playing in it. It's like, man, it was a war
night in and night out. When we get the opportunity to play a team like
Marquette, I know how good they are. Our kids know how good they are. I make
sure of it. And it didn't take them long to watch about six minutes of
yesterday's game to be like, hey, they're good.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the final home game, quote-unquote, for your team
tomorrow?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what, it's been a remarkable year for us. Our fan base has
been fantastic. Really looking forward to seeing how Myisha comes out tomorrow
night for her last opportunity to play here in front of our fans. And I'm
hoping we get a big turnout. I thought our crowd yesterday for a noon game was
fantastic. I'm hoping the 6:30 tip of the men's game does not hurt us because
you may have some that wanted to come to our game, and now it's like, hey, we
want to go see the men; do they want to come and watch two ballgames.  
  
So I'm hoping that doesn't have a negative effect on us. If we could get
8,000, 9,000 in here being a Sunday noon tip instead of a Friday at noon, it
would be outstanding.  
  
Q. Are you still writing excuses for those who took off work
yesterday?  
JEFF WALZ: I told them, if they need to, I'd be happy to. I just told them to
try to take an extra long lunch break.  
  
Q. You were mentioning about how great of a coach Kieger is. What
specifically does she do that makes her so great?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think she has a plan. Like you can tell the kids play hard
for her. It's easy when you sit here and you watch on film and you watch in
person. When kids will play hard for you, when she talks to them, the eye
contact they make, you can see they're nodding their head like I've got you,
I've got you. That's what it's all about, and she's very good X's and O's. She
comes out of time-out, she draws up something they haven't run all year. She
mixes things up defensively, she'll mix things up within her press.  
  
Offensively I'd say I think you've got four of their five that have had at
least one game this year where they've had over 20 points, each kid, which is
really impressive, because it just shows the consistency and balance that they
have.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I wish we could do it. That's pretty damned impressive. I
mean, let's be honest. Now, have any of you taken the time to look at the
stats of the game? See, I think that's what everybody is going to miss and not
look at if you just look at the final score. St. Francis took 81 shots. I
mean, guys, that's getting up and down the floor. They took 57 threes.  
  
You know, UConn, if I told you they scored 140, how many threes do you think
they made? I'm asking a question. Come on. Eight. They hit eight threes. It
was just a track meet. Well, if your threes are going in, fantastic. If
they're not, it's not a great team to play a track meet with. UConn can score
the basketball. UConn took 91, 91 shots, shot 68 percent from the field. So
St. Francis, I don't blame them. They sat there and said, hey, if we're going
to have a chance to win, we're going to have to get in there and fire up shots
and see if we can't make a bunch of them. If they do, the game changes. Look
at what UMBC did last night. If you just go out there and play a traditional
game against somebody that you know is superior to you, you're probably not
going to win.  
  
We sat there -- and we own the record for the largest defeat in the National
Championship game. I think it's 33 points. We went into half I think down 16
in that game, and I told the kids flat-out, do you want to keep it close, or
do you want a chance to win, because it's one of two. If you want to keep it
close, we can do this, and we might get beat by 12, 14, 18. Or if you want a
chance to win, we're going to have to come out and start going up and down,
stretch it out, put some threes up, see if we can get a few to fall. Well,
they wanted a chance to win.  
  
I think we came out, we hit our first two, we cut it back to like 12, and then
we might have gone six minutes and we didn't score before we were getting our
ass kicked. But you want a chance to win, right? Who wants to show off and not
have a chance to win. So I give St. Francis and their coach credit. It's what
happened.  
  
This is a time of year, it is a really tough time of year, especially for
players, for coaches, because it is emotionally and physically draining,
because this is what everybody looks at. What did you do in March? What did
you do in the NCAA Tournament? You know, Virginia men, I feel like Coach
Bennett, I feel for the players. They won, I believe, the ACC regular season
and conference tournament. 20-1. Guys, that is not easy. That is not easy. But
what everybody is going to talk about is what you did in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So for them, it's like, man, can you believe that happened. For UMBC, who went
to Vermont and won the conference tournament, everybody was jumping up and
down doing cartwheels just for the fact they made the tournament. So for some
teams, you make the tournament, and it's off the chart. It's awesome. For
others, you're expected to win the whole thing. So it's one game. That's what
makes this time of year so exciting. Everybody loves March, because the best
team doesn't always win. It's the team that plays the best for two hours, and
it might not even be two hours. It could be a 15-minute stretch during the
game, but you extend a lead, and now all of a sudden you're up 15, especially
in that ballgame last night when I saw some highlights a little bit, if you
can get up 13 or 14 on Virginia with how they play, now you're really putting
pressure on them offensively to play a little out of how they like to play.
And before you know it, it's a loss.  
  
But if it's a best of five, I put my money on Virginia to win a best-of-five
series. Not that we gamble because we don't bet on things.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JEFF WALZ: They did. I mean, that's something as a coach we talk about. Like
guys, once you get to the tournament, the pressure is off. Let's just go play.
We're going to have a plan. It's not like we just roll the ball out here and
just say, hey, let's go have fun. I know Asia and Sam are saying, let's go
have fun. No, it's no fun when you get beat. I'll be the first to tell you
that. But we're not going to put the pressure on, like guys, the world is
coming to an end at 3:00 on Sunday if we don't win. That's not how it works. I
just keep telling them play for 40 minutes, don't worry about the scoreboard.
You give me your best for 40 minutes, and then the scoreboard will normally
take care of itself, and that's kind of how we talk. We don't talk about what
the score is. We're down 11 to Virginia Tech, I believe, in the ACC
Tournament, the first quarter, there was nothing about we're down 11. It was
like, okay, guys, you've got 30 more minutes to play, how hard do you want to
play. Do you want to execute and do what we've worked on, or do you just want
to go out there and do it your own way. So that's how we approach it. Because
if you do it the opposite way, I mean, that pressure can build and build and
build, and then before you know it, you're going to crumple.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. Natisha, have you had a chance to digest what happened yesterday and
just look at everything you've done and put it in some kind of context?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, last game, it was a great game. I'm just excited for
the next one, focused on the next game.  
  
Q. As competitors, did you guys watch the Virginia/UMBC game last night,
and do you have any reaction to it, and just your thoughts on playing
Louisville?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Yeah, it was pretty amazing what UMBC did last night and I
was kind of in awe because it's the first time it happened in history, but it
just shows how much heart they fought with.  
  
And my thoughts on playing Louisville, everyone knows Louisville is a great
team so I know it's going to be a great game. It's going to go down to the
wire, and at the end of the day it's going to be who wants it the most and who
follows the game plan the best.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, I was just going to say it's March, anything can
happen, so that win, like I said, like 'Zia said, it goes down in history, the
first time a 16 seed beat a No. 1 seed.  
  
And as far as Louisville, I'm excited for the game. I'm excited to play at
their home court. They have a great fan base, and it's going to be exciting
and a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. You call thrived on defense yesterday, got a lot of success out of
that. What do you have to do differently against Louisville? What kind of
challenge do they provide for you that you have to shut down?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Their team is very versatile, so we're just going into the
game with a game plan, and if we execute it, I think that we'll be able to
shut players down, and hopefully our defense can help us get our offense.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Just understanding what we want to get out of each defensive
coverage I think will be very important, so what we want to get out of
whatever defense we play in that particular moment of the game is going to be
key for us.  
  
Q. You're playing against another team that can really push the pace.
What challenges do you expect this time around?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Well, we like to push the pace, too, and they like to push
the pace, so I think it works perfect for us in that aspect because we're a
fast team, so it plays right into our hands, so we're excited for that.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I would say the faster the pace, the better for us. That's
been our game plan since day one, and if the tempo is in our hands, I think
we're going to come out with a good win hopefully.  
  
Q. Louisville is a program that's kind of gotten to top three pretty
quickly the last five or so years. Is this kind of what you guys are trying to
target, both you guys juniors, kind of seeing this rebuild happen, is this
kind of where the end goal is, somewhere like Louisville is in right now?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Like yesterday we were watching the game a little bit, and
just their fan base is incredible, and I hope in 10 years or whenever we come
back to Marquette, Marquette is like that. It started with us, so just
hopefully seeing that, it'll mean a lot.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Like Louisville has a great culture, and that's what we're
establishing here, and I'm glad that me and Natisha's class will be the first
ones to start this culture, so like she said, coming back 10 years from now
and seeing the stuff that we built will be amazing. So yeah, that's a goal of
ours.  
  
Q. Allazia, how do you like playing a team that kind of looks like you?
The match-up seems to be very similar. How much do you like playing that kind
of match-up?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: It's great because we just go out there and we think of it
like we're playing ourselves. They're athletic, they're versatile, we're
athletic and we're versatile. I think it'll be a great match-up, and we like
playing teams like that.  
  
Q. You hit eight threes yesterday. Were you just on or did you take
advantage of a hole in the defense? How do you explain your performance
yesterday?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I was just on, and my teammates were finding me the ball.
Those were just the shots that were given to me, so I was taking them. Yeah,
they was just going in.  
  
Q. Natisha, what kind of pressure do you expect to see from Louisville
to kind of shut you down? Do you feel like they're going to send a few players
at you, or how do you see that match-up?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: If that's the case, that'll be perfect because then if
they're going to do that, somebody else on the floor is going to be open.
Everybody on our team is capable of scoring. I mean, one night it could be me,
one night it could be Allazia, it could be Amani Wilborn, Erika Davenport,
literally anybody on our team, so they're going to have to be pretty strategic
and figure out who they're going to guard.  
  
Q. You're here at Louisville seeing a program that's developed rapidly.
Is this kind of your end target as you're trying to establish this culture?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean, absolutely, yes, to beat the best, to be the best, so
we know we're going to have to go through a No. 1 seed at some point. But I
think our program, our young ladies, our staff is really up for the challenge,
obviously in an atmosphere that's great for women's basketball. We're excited
for a packed house, for loud noise, and an awesome March atmosphere.  
  
Q. When you look back at yesterday's game, I guess after those first few
minutes, did it kind of unfold the way you thought in terms of what you wanted
from your team?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, after the first time-out, absolutely. I thought our team
did a phenomenal job responding and calming each other down. After that, I
thought we were back to ourselves, that we started to take a deep breath, and
you could tell they became a little bit less anxious and ready to play, and
obviously Natisha Hiedeman's performance, you ask her, she's always been a
primetime player. That's who she is. She loves playing under the lights. What
you guys saw yesterday we've seen several times in practice. We've seen it
several times in other games. She did the same thing to Oregon State last
year. She just explodes for points in a hurry. So for her, she loves this
moment. She loves the limelight, and you saw that perfectly yesterday.
Thankfully it happened in a big moment.  
  
Q. How similar do you see the match-ups between your team and
Louisville?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, I think we're similar in some aspects. We're very
different in others. They obviously have size on us. I think we have quickness
at some positions on them. I think I'm looking forward to a great game. I'm
looking forward to two teams that are probably going to scheme a lot and see
what they're going to throw at us, and hopefully we can throw some stuff at
them that they have to adjust to. Looking forward to the match-up, most
definitely.  
  
Q. You're not a 16 seed, you're obviously a quality team, but you're
playing a 1. Did you watch UMBC/Virginia and what were your reactions to it?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: No, I was all in Louisville last night, so I had no TV on. I
was focused on us. But I woke up this morning to the score, and couldn't
believe it. But yeah, awesome for men's basketball.  
  
On our side, we're hoping for more parity, as well. It would be great to come
in to a No. 1 seed and knock them off. Obviously we're going to have to play a
fantastic game, and we're all going to have to be sharp, our staff included,
and every single player on the entire roster.  
  
Q. In yesterday's game, Asia Durr had a really good game without scoring
necessarily. How dangerous is it to play against a star player like that that
can really make such a big contribution even when the ball isn't going into
the hoop?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, Asia Durr is an All-American, and she does so many
things for them. She contributes not only scoring-wise but just her energy.
She gets the team going. The crowd, they feed off her. So for us, we're going
to try different stuff, throw different people at her, and we've got to be
keyed in on her all game long, and hopefully she has an off-night.  
  
Q. You mentioned Hines-Allen a little bit yesterday. What challenges
does she pose, especially in the paint?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: She's very powerful, obviously very strong. Her rebounding
presence is phenomenal, so we're going to have to do a great job of keeping
her off the glass. I think on offense, we really want to make sure we take it
to her and try to slow her down a little bit and tire her out. But she's a
phenomenal player, and she's somebody that I actually recruited back when I
was at Miami, so I know her game pretty well, back in the day. But she does so
many great things for that team, and the way she passes, as well. She's a
nightmare match-up, I think, for any team in the country.  
  
Q. What's your opinion about Louisville's depth? I think yesterday they
used like 10 players, and around here we're kind of used to that, but is that
one of the things you feel like you have to really guard against because they
can send so many different players in?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, I think our team is going to have to be really locked
into personnel tomorrow. Like you said, they play several different players,
and each player is very different, so I think if our team can stay focused on
personnel and really play player tendencies, we'll be in good shape. And I
think for us, it's going to be a scheme game. We're used to a lot of motion
offensive teams in the Big East, and Louisville is a set-oriented team, so
we're going to have to really make sure our communication is at an all-time
high level and really talk through player tendencies and personnel.  
  
Q. You played Tennessee I think in Cancún and took them to overtime, you
played Notre Dame in South Bend, took them into overtime. Did you schedule the
season to have your team prepared for a March appearance?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Absolutely. You know, after we lost the Quinnipiac game last
year, I was focused on wanting to go farther than this program has ever been,
and like I said at the beginning of the press conference, if you want to be
the best, you've got to beat the best, and that's where our program wants to
head. We want to be a perennial powerhouse in the country, so in order to do
that, you can't do that until you knock down the people in front of you.  
  
So for us, I don't think we're scared to play anybody, and I think that's
going to be a big advantage for our kids going into this game. We went over
all Louisville's scores and every opponent that they've played and matched it
up to who we've played, similar opponents, and I think our team is really
excited for this opportunity.  
  
Q. Would you say they're comparable?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, likable opponents we've played, and I think for us,
we've shown success against similar teams to Louisville, so I think our kids
get excited about that and have a little bit of confidence going in there.
Obviously Louisville is a great team that we're going to have to play, but our
players and our program love these moments, and we love playing great match-
ups and great storied programs. So for us, I think this is a fantastic
opportunity, win or lose, to be honest.  
  
Q. And then having coached in the ACC for quite a while, do you see any
similarities between where Marquette is now and where Louisville was maybe
five, ten years ago?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, I hope so. I hope that's the direction we're going
because Jeff has done a phenomenal job with this program and where he's taken
them, and obviously when Angel came here and started out their tradition, I
played against her when we were in the Big East my last year. I've watched
Louisville from afar for a long time and seen the rise. So for us, if that's
the path that Marquette heads down, I'll be a very happy coach.  
  
You've got to chip away at it. It's one year at a time, and you've just got to
keep getting better every year, and that's what I'm proud of, us at Marquette,
is we've done that every year. We've advanced, we've gotten better, and the
plan is to keep climbing.  
  
Q. Granted it's been a few years since Louisville was in the Big East,
but do you see kind of a similar team from what you recall?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Absolutely. I mean, they were fast. They had dominant scores.
They had two or three scorers that dominated the game, similar to them right
now. They had All-Americans. They had pros. And they ran a lot of sets. So
very similar.  
  
Q. They had over 7,000 people here yesterday, probably be more tomorrow.
Just your thoughts on the atmosphere, and then secondly, do you have any sense
at all on how many of your people might come down, what kind of group you'll
have following you tomorrow?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I think it's fantastic for women's basketball. We need
atmospheres like this, and I think it sets a great example for the rest of the
country. I congratulate all the Louisville fans for coming out, especially on
a weekday and at the time that it was, and even a lot of them stayed for our
game, which was awesome to see.  
  
We welcome that atmosphere, and we embrace it, and I think that's what our
players deserve to play in. It's March, and you want to be playing in front of
a big crowd, and I think it speaks very highly for women's basketball and
where it is and where it's going.  
  
Q. Are there fans coming down tomorrow?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I hope so. I think we had a good crowd come down and drive
down. Haven't really heard yet if more buses are coming or not, but we hope.  
  
Q. Was yesterday kind of an emotional or maybe a mental breakthrough to
win that first game? It was the first one in like seven years, especially in
light of what happened last year, how much of a relief was that for your
team?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think it was a confidence booster. I think for us, you know,
not to sound too confident, but we expected to win that game. Nothing against
Dayton, but just speaking for Marquette, that's how confident we were for the
last year. We've been building for that moment, and I think our players did a
great job embracing that. So for us, you want to go into any game expecting
that you're going to win, whether you're playing a No. 1 seed or you're
playing a 9 seed. I think for us last year, we were a little bit more
tentative, and I don't think we necessarily expected to win. We were just more
excited to be in the NCAA Tournament. We're taking a different approach now
where we're saying, hey, this is where we deserve to be, and this is where we
want to be, and we're going to keep going through every round we possibly can.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a statement by Coach Walz.  
  
JEFF WALZ: I'd first like to congratulate Boise. You know, I had the
opportunity to get to know their staff yesterday, and just great people. I can
see why they're successful as they are great, great ball club. I thought they
competed. I thought they played hard. We just did a really good job
defensively on contesting a lot of shots.  
  
You know, it's a ten-point game at the half, and then we're able to come out
defensively in the second and kind of get things going. You know, it's the
first game in the NCAA tournament. There are always going to be jitters, some
excitement. We missed some shots we normally don't miss, but then we finally
started to get things going.  
  
So, you know, I was really, really pleased with the win, and then I thought
our crowd was fantastic. For a Friday noon, I mean, I thought it was
remarkable. I just want to make sure I say thank you to all of our fans out
there.  
  
This is not the norm. You know, I watched a few of the men's games last night
at a few locations that I'd be hard pressed to say that we didn't outdraw
them. So I think it speaks volumes for our city, for their excitement about
just sports in general, because I know as soon as Louisville FC starts up,
that place is going to be packed.  
  
So it's just, it's a wonderful place to be able to play, and I know our
players thoroughly enjoyed it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kylee, those two corner 3s, had you been practicing from that spot,
or why did you kind of pick that on back-to-back possessions?  
KYLEE SHOOK: I mean, I just tried to go to the open area, because Coach Walz
is always telling me make basketball cuts, make plays, and I just kind of
found the open spot.  
  
I do practice all the way around the 3-point line, but it was just open today
so that's where I popped.  
  
Q. Sam, what was the game plan in terms of pressuring them defensively
and could you tell that they were responding negatively to your defensive
pressure? It seems like you all had them rattled.  
SAM FUEHRING: Going into it, we knew that we had to stop 21. She's a really
good 3-point shooter. So we knew that we had to rattle them on defense because
then we would probably get steals or turnovers. So yeah.  
  
Q. Kylee, talk about your role coming in off the bench. You had a really
great game today in the first game of the tournament.  
KYLEE SHOOK: Thank you. Coach Walz is always telling me to be more aggressive
because at the beginning of the season, I was soft. I'm getting there. But he
says in order to play at this level because, I mean, we have Sam, Myisha,
great players I have to come in after so I have to pick up my role. I mean,
Myisha can get a rebound over anybody. Sam can score over anybody.  
  
So my role coming in, I have to make an impact when I come in. Otherwise,
there's no point for me to come in. So he always says just be aggressive.  
  
Q. For all three of the players, the big difference here was points in
the paint, 52 to 14. Was that something you were all were going to concentrate
on when you were practicing? Was it something you saw that you could take
advantage of? Just each one of you, how about that point in the paint
advantage?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: That's one of the things that we were focused on, trying
to get the ball inside and score inside because we have phenomenal post
players who can score and make moves. Yeah, you're seeing it. Pointing to you,
Mr. Ed.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
KYLEE SHOOK: Like Myisha said, we just have good players.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Same.  
  
Q. You're up ten at halftime. What was the mood? Was there concern, or
did you figure that you were going to get it going in the third quarter?  
SAM FUEHRING: We came out flat so we had to make a change somehow, whether
that was to push the ball, run harder, or execute plays. But, yeah, we had to
make a change because we were coming out flat.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, just like Sam said. We came out flat so once we
started playing our game and, like, actually doing things that we normally do,
that lead pushed.  
  
The bench did a great job. Me and Sam didn't start off well today. Kylee and
Bionca came off the bench and gave us a spark. That's when we went on the run.  
  
I mean, the bench did a phenomenal job today with finding the rim, because we
couldn't do it. Couldn't find the basket. So, I mean, everyone played a huge
part in it. Once we played our game, we were able to pull away.  
  
Q. Myisha, given the size disparity, the rebounding disparity, when
they're taking 30 3-pointers, do you think they're playing into your hand?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No. That's their game plan. That's what that team does is
shoot 3s. I mean, we did a great job putting the hand up every time they shot
the ball, trying to get out there and play them, make them put it on the
floor.  
  
So, I mean, that's their team, and that's what they do is shoot 3s so I
wouldn't think that they would do something differently. I think we just did a
great job guarding them.  
  
Q. For Sam and Myisha, how have you guys seen Kylee develop this season,
both on the offensive and defensive end of the floor?  
SAM FUEHRING: She's gotten the chance to watch and ask questions and learn.
She's always asking questions in practice. So with that, she learns.  
  
I mean, I watch Kylee in practice too so I'll give her little helping details.
So, I mean, overall, she's grown a lot.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: She was thrown in the fire last year and, I mean, she
responded well. But this year, she's gotten a chance to actually just watch
and learn the game. And it's showing right now that she's actually wanting to
learn and wanting to get better because the coaches challenge her, we
challenge her every day just to be not the strongest one out there, but just
try to go for a rebound, try to hold on to that rebound, or even try to alter
a shot.  
  
And Kylee's trying to get better at that, and I think that she is. Every day
in practice, she tries to block shots, and that's one thing that we need from
her is to, you know, alter a shot when a point guard -- well, a guard drives
in the middle.  
  
Just Kylee being there, her presence, I mean, I wish I had her height. Kylee's
doing a good job.  
  
Q. Coach Walz referenced it off the top. Big crowd out there today. How
nice was it playing in front of that crowd? Do you notice the crowd during the
game?  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, I looked up in the stands and, well, besides the sides,
there were no empty seats, really. So, I mean, the crowd was loud too. Really
loud.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I mean, Sam just hits it all in the middle. I mean, I
can't really say. I was going to give him a shout-out after media's done.  
  
I was going to give them a shout-out too because there was little kids there
that should be in school. So that's awesome parents. Awesome bosses that
allow, like, their employees to take a long lunch break just to stay and
support us.  
  
I mean, that crowd was there from the beginning to the end, so it wasn't like
they stayed 'til halftime and then they got out of there. They were there the
whole game cheering us on. So, I mean, that's impressive. I didn't know we
would have a big turnout because of the time.  
  
But Card Nation, you guys are the best. The best.  
  
KYLEE SHOOK: I just think that our crowd picks us up sometimes when we get in
like a little hole or we turn it over. I think that they do a good job of
helping, like both of them said. They're a big part of Louisville.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, I'm sure you've been asked this a lot about Asia. She struggled
a little bit today, but kind of talk about that and what's going on right now.
I know ever since she got that 47, she's kind of a marked girl out there.  
JEFF WALZ: I mean, you know, she had some good looks today that just did not
go in. I'm not concerned about it. I've told her to not be concerned about it.  
  
Shooters have to shoot. I mean, it's what she does. She's the first one in the
gym, the last one out of the gym. I'm kind of telling her to just take a
break. Sometimes, you can get out there and just mess with your mind so much,
keep practicing, keep practicing. Just take a break, you know, put your feet
up and don't worry about it.  
  
But overall, three assists and one turnover, I thought she actually took a few
tough shots and then passed down some ones that she normally takes. And that's
what I'll show her tonight is I can't have her turning down good looks,
especially at times she kind of had one or two in front of our bench that she
had good looks and then over penetrated, and it turns into a turnover, a tough
pass. Just take the good shot.  
  
I feel pretty confident that, you know, she'll get back. I'm not worried about
it.  
  
But that's what makes our team so good. You know, you've got Bionca Dunham
puts ten on the board; Kylee Shook, 14; Sam, 14. I mean, our two leading
scorers, Asia with 9 and Myisha with 4, and we still put up 74 against a
pretty good ball club.  
  
Q. Coach, that leads me right into the question I was going to ask you.
The first day of the tournament, having most of your production coming from
unlikelier places, does that give you a lot more confidence going forth in the
tournament, knowing that you can get production from all the way down the
bench?  
JEFF WALZ: Sure it does. You know, I tell them all the time, I told them
before the game started today, when I put you out there, you've got to do
something positive. Now, it doesn't mean you have to score, but you might get
a rebound, fox out, good deflection, but do something positive.  
  
Just taking up space is not going to count. And I thought everybody that came
out -- I thought Bionca and Kylee came in in that first half and really gave
us a huge spark, kind of got things going.  
  
Bionca runs the floor so hard, she gets a 3-point, you know, an and-1, and
then Kylee hits back-to-back 3s. They kind of gave us a little separation.  
  
And then we went stagnant in the second quarter. I don't think we scored for
about four minutes, but we defended. You know, I don't think they scored but
two points or three over those four minutes that we didn't score.  
  
So defensively, I was really proud of the group. I thought we did a really
nice job in the areas that we had talked about we have to do well in.  
  
But, you know, that's why you play the next game. We're fortunate enough to
move on. I'm not going to worry about what Asia did, what Myisha did. More so
show them areas of, you know, just go up strong.  
  
Myisha had the one in the first half where they pressed us, we threw a nice
pass like three quarter of the court, and she waited for the girl to come over
instead of just powering up through her for a lay-up.  
  
So we'll show things like that. But, no, I'm not concerned about her at all.  
  
Q. Jeff, you're up ten at halftime and outscored them 8-0 in the first
90 seconds, all of it at the rim. Did you tell your team to be more aggressive
and attack the rim in the third quarter?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah. We had just talked about we've got to get the ball in the
paint. Our posts weren't doing a great job of holding their seals.  
  
Finally, you know, we executed a few times to Jaz there on alley-oop plays
that she finishes up by the rim.  
  
But it's not a difficult game, and that's something that we really kept
talking to them about. Guys, keep it simple. When you go to our dribble
handoff, dive hard to the basket. Something good's going to happen.  
  
We started to do that, and we started to get some lay-ups and then started to
get some open jump shots. We executed perfect starting the second -- the third
quarter. You know, we had two plays drawn up, one for man, one for zone. They
came out man. Arica executes it perfectly and gets about a 12-foot pull-up
jump shot, which is what she makes. So I was really proud of them.  
  
Then we came up with some stops and got things going. I told them before the
game started, it's not about seedings. The men's side, it's the same thing.
It's all about momentum. You've got to take advantage of the momentum when you
get it.  
  
In the first half, we hit back-to-back 3s. We've got the momentum. And then we
turn it over two of the next three times. Like you can't do that. You gave it
back to them.  
  
Even there in the third quarter, I think we got it up to about 24, 25. We had
scored, they come down and get a turnover, and now we're coming down ready to
really knock it out. We get an illegal screen called on us, and then we fall
down at the elbow, the girl shoots a leg up. Then taking the ball out of
bounds, we turn it over. That killed momentum.  
  
And those are the things, that's all we preach about this time of the year.  
  
Q. What's been the biggest challenge of getting Kylee to kind of play up
to her full potential? Why do you think that she had that game against Air
Force a couple weeks ago, but usually it's when other people are down, she
steps up. It's not kind of all at once.  
JEFF WALZ: No. I tell her all the time, she has to stop tiptoeing through the
tulips. I mean, she's the sweetest little thing. She'll walk in, 6'4", really
dainty. I say, will you knock the -- out of somebody. You know, be aggressive.
When she starts to do that, good things happen for her.  
  
She's always been used to shooting the 3. It's what she did in high school.
When you're 6'4" in high school, there aren't many that you play against that
are 6'4". So for her, she could catch, turn around and score, or she stretched
it out and shot 3s. Well, now we're trying to work on her back-to-the-basket
game some. It's not her strong suit right now, and we know that so it's just
continuing to work with her.  
  
But she started a majority of our conference season last year, so it's not
like she hadn't played in games. She's very familiar with what she has to do.
I was proud of her tonight for getting ten boards.  
  
Q. It's not often that you have Kylee, Bionca, Sam, Myisha kind of all
on their game at the same time. Where does this rank among other games this
season in terms of your post play?  
JEFF WALZ: I thought our post play from the bench was the best that we've had.
Now, Myisha, rebounding-wise, she gets 14; but offensively, this was nowhere
close to what we're used to seeing.  
  
And that's the encouraging thing. I'm just telling you, for me, I don't look
at it as, man, we got problems. I'm excited to know we just scored 74 points.
Asia gets 9, Myisha gets 4, and we're able to extend the lead.  
  
That's what you have to have. You have to have depth. You've got to.
Somebody's going to have a bad night. If you rely on one person and they have
an off night, you've got problems.  
  
I'm really excited what they were able to do. I was excited with Dana. I
thought she came in and did some good things for us. You know, it's what we
need. We need contributions from everybody.  
  
I got to change your bedtime, Tim. You're making me yawn! I'm up at 5:15 every
morning. I can't figure it out.  
  
Q. They took, I think, 30 of their 59 shots from 3. Did you feel like
their only chance to beat you was take that many 3s and hope 12, 15 of them go
in?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we knew that's what they were going to probably lean towards
doing, because they do shoot the 3 well. Now, I was surprised that they took
30 of them. They got 30 off. But I thought we defended them pretty darn well
out there.  
  
You know, I think it's a smart game plan. They spread the floor. They were
trying to make us guard all over, and that's the one thing about our post
players. We don't have the traditional 6'5", big, low block, take up space.
All of ours can get out and guard.  
  
And I think that's what made it difficult for them to get the 3 off was, you
know, Sam, Myisha, Bionca, Kylee, even on a switch were out there causing them
problems.  
  
Q. You were talking about depth, and as the games get closer, are you
likely to go with a much shorter bench?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, here's what I'll do. I'll give them all a chance, but the
amount of time they're out there is going to depend on what they do. You know,
I've told them that. They all know. It's like, guys, there is no give me a few
minutes to play through a couple turnovers. No. That's not how it works at
this time of the year.  
  
And that's why I was so excited for them, because they came in and, all of a
sudden, they give us positive energy. So now, all of a sudden, if you turn it
over, it's not a bad thing because you've given us some positive productivity.  
  
It's like ACC championship game, I didn't play many. I didn't put the minutes
around that much. But at the same time, what's great about our team is Myisha
played really well in that ACC championship game. So after the game, I'd be
like now, B, would you want me to take her out and put you in? They're like
oh, no, no. She's doing great.  
  
So our kids know if somebody's doing well, they just don't want playing time.
They want to win. And that's what has separated our ball club this year, I
think from teams in the past. They all care about winning. It's all they want
to do.  
  
If somebody gets three minutes and we win, great. If they have to go in and
play 20, that's great too. So that's what separates them is they're genuinely
excited for each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

### [Shalen Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28503)

### [Marta Hermida](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32779)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Presnell.  
  
GORDY PRESNELL: Congratulations to Louisville. They are definitely a No. 1
seed, and I thought they played outstanding basketball in the third quarter,
and I thought we came out soft in the third quarter. I think we gave up nine
points in the first minute and a half or something, and that kind of created
too much of a gap.  
  
But proud of our team and proud of our seniors and proud of these kids sitting
next to me on the right.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shay, you guys were hanging tough on the board there for most of the
game until kind of midway through the third quarter. What let Louisville get
that advantage?  
SHALEN SHAW: I think we kind of weren't focused and focused in on what we
needed to do. I think we let it slip away. And if we would have been focused,
it would have been there.  
  
Q. For Marta, did Louisville do anything to force that number of 3-point
shots? Were they clogging the middle? What was Louisville's defense doing to
frustrate you?  
MARTA HERMIDA: I think that for this game, it was meant to be fear. And every
opportunity that we have to get a 3-point shot, we did. I think we tried our
best. We didn't make those 3s, so I hope next year we can do it better than
that.  
  
Q. For both of you, what was Kylee Shook doing out there today that was
so effective against your defense?  
SHALEN SHAW: She was picking and popping. We knew what she was going to do. It
goes back to that focus thing. We just weren't focused in, and she was just
hitting her shots and cutting and being where she needed to be, and we weren't
where we were supposed to be.  
  
MARTA HERMIDA: Yeah, same as Shay, what Shay said. Like she hurt us in the
pick and pop, and we didn't hurt them in that way.  
  
Q. For both of you, this has been a great, incredible season for you
before this game. Just talk about the accomplishments that you did get done
this year.  
MARTA HERMIDA: I think it was a really, really good season. This is why we
were really surprised when we were a 16 seed. But we played together. I am
proud of every single one of my teammates and my coaches. That's all, I think.
We tried our best in every single game that we played.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, I think that the beginning of the season, it was a little
rough. We took a while to find ourselves. But when we did, we were really
gelling together and really playing together.  
  
Like Marta said, I'm really proud of our team.  
  
Q. Going back to Kylee Shook, had you guys identified her as a 3-point
threat? She only two 3s for the entire game, but they were both from that
corner in a really short span of time.  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, we knew she was more of a pick and pop post player. And
then when she did get on the block, she was more of an additional post player.
So she was a little bit of both, and we knew she was going to pick and pop.  
  
When she was on the block, she was cutting and finding the open spot, which we
weren't in the right spot to defend it. So yeah.  
  
MARTA HERMIDA: What she said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned your team had come out soft there in the third quarter.
They had four lay-ups in the first 90 seconds. Were they being more aggressive
to attack the rim, or did you guys ease off the defensive pressure?  
GORDY PRESNELL: We went in at halftime thinking that they were getting in
trouble, and we knew that they would up the intensity, up their level of
performance, and would we be able to go up there with them.  
  
And that first -- it must have been a minute and a half when I called time-
out. And all of a sudden, the game's gotten away from us.  
  
So that's them. I mean, there's a reason they're a No. 1 seed, and they just
did a great job, and their pressure, the way they defended Riley was terrific.  
  
You know, your question about the big kid, Shook. They put Shook and Durr in a
pick and roll, and you've got to be able to stop. You've got to give up
something. So we decided we'd give up the pick and pop and try to take away
Durr. I mean, Ohio State gave up 47 not doubling her on the pick and roll. So
that's what we did. She got free a few times.  
  
Q. Did you want to take as many 3-pointers as you ended up doing? Is
that a concession because of size?  
GORDY PRESNELL: Right. There's a big difference and size, and they were -- we
knew if we got Riley in a pick and roll, they were going to double her. So we
thought pick and pops were always going to be open and os that was the shot
that they gave us. We probably took too many, but that's the shot that we had
we thought we could score on.  
  
We haven't had a post presence since our all conference post player ECL'd in
early December. And so that's just kind of the way it is. We've been a very
consistent 3-point shooting team through the course of the year, but we
haven't played, you know, No. 3 ranked team in the country either.  
  
And so I think the rim shrunk on us, we got a little anxiety and a little
tight. That's just the way it is.  
  
That part I would do again because we don't really have a low post presence
right now.  
  
Q. Coach, what was it about Louisville's height or defensive pressure?
What was the most bothersome, do you think, to your team?  
GORDY PRESNELL: I thought we got good shots, but just the -- this sounds kind
of crazy, but the sheer strength of the players. You know, if they got a hand
on a hip, it's a little different, and they're very, very physically strong.
They're very well taught.  
  
Then their recovery, if they break down defensively in their closeouts, are
quite good. That could have had something to do with our -- because we are
open on a pick and pop, but maybe we we aren't open long enough. You know,
they've got to close out, get a closeout.  
  
Q. Coach, they've beaten Notre Dame twice and they played Connecticut,
played a lot of good teams. Watching them on video and actually seeing them in
person, anything impress you more, or did you see things that you hadn't seen
on video?  
GORDY PRESNELL: Well, you know, I was asked before the game a couple days ago
or whatever, well, do you see any weaknesses or see anything?  
  
And, yeah, I saw a few things, but not for us. You know, I saw what maybe some
of the other teams could do against them. But once again, I'm proud of our
team, and we're going to get there, and we got a pretty bright future ahead of
us. We've got some young kids, got some great players coming in and some kids
coming back from injury.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
GORDY PRESNELL: Thank you so much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

### [Erika Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33153)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Marquette - 84, Dayton - 65  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: First of all, I just want to say what a difference a year can
make. I'm really proud of our team and our staff. I thought we came out very
focused and with a mission. This group is really, really fun to coach, and
obviously you can see that by the way that they play.  
  
My favorite thing about them is their chemistry and their versatility. Any
given night, we could have four or five players go off for 20 points. Tonight
they did a phenomenal job finding Natisha, playing off one another. So it's
fun. Fun to win in March. And we're excited to have a chance to play
Louisville on their home floor.  
  
All I can say is I'm supremely proud of these girls to my right and the rest
of the girls in the locker room.  
  
Q. Natisha, you really had it going at the beginning. What did you see
from the defense that they were giving you?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I just had open shots, and Coach was kind of giving me the
green light. If you have open shots, take them. And that's pretty much for
anybody. So I was just taking the shots that I saw.  
  
Q. And this could really be for any of you guys. You did a really good
job getting in the passing lanes. How much of that was a point of emphasis,
and why do you think the execution worked out so well?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: That was a big goal of us coming into this game. We knew
they were all versatile, they all can shoot. So a big part of our defense was
denying, and I think we did a really good job of having our hands in the
passing lane at that moment.  
  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: Like she said, that was a big game plan of ours. Just getting
in the passing lanes, trying to set up our offense on the other side.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I would just say that we've been amping up the pressure and
intensity in practice, and I think that carried over to the game. It showed. I
mean, the amount of turnovers they had kind of benefited us.  
  
Q. And to Erika, after Natisha really had it going, it seemed like you
got some good looks. Did it help that she was drawing so much attention from
the defense?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: Most definitely. We love to go inside-out. So when Ti was --
she was on fire tonight. It opened up a lot of things for me. She found me on
a lot of plays.  
  
Q. Allazia, you didn't really have things going right away, but you pick
it up in the second half. What do you think kind of led to that slow start?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Just over thinking my shots. Some nights it's not going to
go in. But I'm the type of player I can get it going fast, and I score in
bunches. Coach is just preaching to me keep my head in it, and I think I did a
great job of it, just kept my head in it. Ti was hot. When she's shooting like
that, I don't really need the ball anyway.  
  
She was doing her thing, and that's one thing about her team, like Coach said,
anybody can go off. I was just playing off her and waiting to get the open
shots, and I knocked them down in the second half.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what kind of clicked after that opening run,
stayed calm and battled back from an eight-point deficit early?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Can you repeat the question? Sorry.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what just clicked after that opening run by
Dayton, how you guys stayed calm and were able to battle back?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: We caught a pretty quick time-out, but our coaches told us
just get our heads back in the game, play our game, and after that time-out,
we just started picking up the tempo and finding the open players and just
kind of shut down their run a little bit.  
  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: Like she said, we just took a deep breath, just kept playing.
I felt like a lot of us were anxious. So we just had to calm down and play our
game.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Just to piggy-back off what they said, like she said, Erika
said, we were anxious. We had a lot of good looks, and we were just missing
them, over thinking them. So once we got in the huddle, Coach told us to take
a big deep breath, and I think that calmed us all down, and we were able to go
on a run after that.  
  
Q. Excuse me if you've already heard this question, but when you're
down, Natisha, could you have expected to have contributed so much yourself,
to have those three-pointers, I guess, as the first 15 points, to really get
your team back in the game?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Well, I just -- it's March. If you lose, you go home. I'm
not trying to lose. So I just kind of took it into my hands for a hot second
and tried to put the ball in the hoop. My players -- my teammates, they
realized that I was hot, and then after the first quarter, then we were just
finding each other.  
  
So basically, I just didn't want to lose. None of us want to lose.  
  
Q. So I asked players about it, but I'll ask you about it. Really great
job getting into the passing lanes. What was -- how much of an emphasis was
that going in? And why do you think the team executed it so well?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think we talked about their three-point shooting ability a
lot over the last five days. Like the players said, we wanted to get in the
deny and make sure that we were trapping ball screens and had our hands up. We
compete for the most deflections on the team, and obviously that's a strength
of ours to be able to turn the ball over and get the tempo going.  
  
I think our players bought in, and they worked really hard tonight. I think
they played -- or they played personnel better than they've played in a long
time, which was phenomenal.  
  
Q. Could you have expected to make so many threes? Aside from what she
did from long range to really turn a game like that, just to keep it from
getting out of control.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think, just like Natisha, our entire team scores in bunches.
And when we're hot and we're confident, we're really hard to defend. I think
that's what happened tonight. One player got hot, and we feed off each other's
energy. Then Allazia knocked down three threes as well.  
  
For us, we feed off each other's success, which is, I think, the most fun
thing to watch on our team. You see their smiles. You see their energy, and
you see them celebrating each other. When that happens, I know we're in good
shape.  
  
Q. As a followup, what was the most important thing that you saw in that
early stretch before the time-out to really kind of get things under control?
What weren't they doing?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, I don't think it was anything we weren't doing. I
thought, like they said, we got great looks. We missed a bunch of bunnies
around the rim. Obviously, our hearts were pumping a little bit. We just
needed to settle in. Needed to slow down a little bit and focus on the game
plan.  
  
I thought our team did a phenomenal job of weathering the storm and staying
tough and battling through adversity, which is something that we've talked a
lot about since the DePaul game. So I'm really proud of our toughness and how
we handled that.  
  
Q. And as you were saying about being in deny mode really meant that you
guys weren't really spending that much time in your half-court offense and a
lot of time in transition. What impact do you think that had on the team's
offense tonight?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think any time we can get out in transition and we can flow
into our offense versus walk the ball up, that's where our team is most
comfortable. So when we can get our hands on loose balls or we can get tips
and deflections and we're running at a full head of steam, that's when I think
we're playing off each other the best and finding each other versus dribbling
up the court and slowing the game down.  
  
Q. And looking ahead to Sunday with Louisville, got a chance to scout
them a little bit before this, what are your initial take-aways of what they
do well?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, when you're the No. 1 seed, you do a lot of things well.
I think we're just really excited for the opportunity to play a No. 1 seed on
their home floor. They have two really high level scorers, and we're going to
have to do a really good job on Hines-Allen. They're big. We've got to pack
the paint and make sure we can rebound with them.  
  
I think we have an advantage in the open court, and I think our girls will be
excited for that matchup. At this point, we have nothing to lose. I think we
will love the opportunity to come out here and see what we can do.  
  
Q. How much of this is a program kind of statement when you were kind of
waiting for that hurdle, didn't get it last year, and now you finally get an
NCAA Tournament win?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I think we've been waiting for this moment the entire
year. I still remember the locker room feeling at the end of the Quinnipiac
game. I think our players were really motivated by that. They were really
disappointed last year, and I think they came out and proved that their hard
work over the past year has paid off.  
  
When you sit on that feeling for an entire year and you finally get the
opportunity to redeem yourself, I think we did it in a big fashion tonight.
I'm very proud, like I said, of our adversity. This wasn't just how we played
tonight, I think this is a reflection of how hard we've worked in the last
year.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Shauna Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33175)

### [Jayla Scaife](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35107)

### [Lauren Cannatelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35108)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Marquette - 84, Dayton - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Green.  
  
SHAUNA GREEN: First off, I think Marquette, give them credit, they played
well. Their pace got to us a little bit. I thought we came out great. Our
start was exactly what we wanted to do. We executed really perfectly in terms
of our press break, our half-court offense. We were controlling the tempo.
When Jenna got that second foul, it was big. I thought we took the momentum
change when that happened, and they went on that run.  
  
And then I thought we really came out the second half, and we beat them the
third -- or lost by one the third quarter. I thought we played well during
that. But we just didn't make plays when we had to and turned the ball over
way, way too many times against a team like this.  
  
Q. For either of the players, how difficult was their pressure? Were you
surprised by how tough it was to get the ball up the court?  
LAUREN CANNATELLI: I don't think we were too surprised. I think Coach Green
and the coaches did a good job of preparing us, practicing on our press break
and being mentally prepared for the pressure they were going to bring. I don't
think we executed very well most of our press breaks. So I think that was a
major contributing factor.  
  
JAYLA SCAIFE: Basically what Lauren said. We prepared pretty well for their
pressure. We knew they were going to do that. When Jenna went out, just kind
of took us out of it a little bit with us being comfortable with her bringing
the ball up. That was really good.  
  
Q. How tough was their leading scorer Hiedeman? She came out on fire and
even finished strong. What did you guys try to do to try to defend her?  
JAYLA SCAIFE: We were just trying to contest all her shots, not let her get
any open shots. Just stay in front of her was our biggest thing with her. Just
not letting her get any open shots was basically our game plan for her.  
  
LAUREN CANNATELLI: I think a player like her, she's going to get her points.
We just had to make sure we boxed out and got the rebound. They got a lot of
offensive rebounds. I think that's something we could have done better. We
probably could have done better just playing more of a team defense and
getting in our gaps and higher up in the gaps and help side, and our rotations
were a little slow as well.  
  
Q. I know it's tough to look ahead right now, but you're both coming
back next season. What do you gain from experiences this season, and how are
your hopes for next year?  
LAUREN CANNATELLI: I think we have really high expectations for next year.
Obviously, I want to get back here. I want to win a game. I want to make a run
in the NCAA Tournament. It's always a goal of ours. So we're going to get back
to it and hit it hard this summer and just get back to work.  
  
JAYLA SCAIFE: Coach Green always talks about one day at a time, one step at a
time. So I feel like our first goal is really just to get through the A-10.
That's always just our focus. And in the long run, to get back here and make
our run. But we have a lot of pieces. The seniors left a great legacy for us
to just follow in and just continue to go up in.  
  
Q. This is for the players. Just talk about you got off to that great
start, and then Hiedeman ended up with 32. She really got them going. Kind of
talk about that. I know I've seen players do that before, but she really got
hot, and you basically couldn't stop her.  
LAUREN CANNATELLI: I think we started the game off with a pretty good run, and
then when Jenna got her two fouls, we just kind of went into a lull, and I had
a couple of turnovers. I think that's just how the flow of the game goes. Each
team is going to make runs, and we just didn't really have an answer for it.  
  
I think we came back in the third quarter and did better in that respect, but
we just didn't really have a response.  
  
JAYLA SCAIFE: It's like just she's a really good player. With players like
that, you can't let them get hot because every shot they're going to put up is
more than likely going to go in. They definitely got the momentum the second
quarter when Jenna went out, and she just kind of went off. Honestly, all we
can do is just learn from it and not let that happen again and just continue
to grow.  
  
Q. It seems like when you guys needed a spark, it was JaVonna who was
really providing it. Can you talk about her leadership, especially playing in
her hometown?  
JAYLA SCAIFE: Jay does a lot for the team on and off the court. She's a great
energy player, not just with the rebounds, but telling people just to keep
their heads up, just encouraging us always. Definitely, when she brings that
energy, it definitely carries over into the team. I know that, when I first
got here last year, she was the one that kind of took me under her wing. So I
really appreciate everything she's done.  
  
LAUREN CANNATELLI: Yeah, I agree. Whenever she gets a big rebound, like
offensive rebound, it's always a big spark for us. So I think her contributing
that way was really big for us today.  
  
Q. What was most impressive about what they did? You kind of battled
back in the third quarter and would get it down a little bit, and then they'd
come right back.  
LAUREN CANNATELLI: I think they just had like a lot of different scores.
Number 5, obviously, 32 points. 11, 12. I think we just didn't really do a
good job of our rotations, as I mentioned earlier, as well as just offensively
just staying poised and limiting turnovers. We were prepared for their
pressure, but we just didn't execute very well today.  
  
JAYLA SCAIFE: Yeah, basically what Lauren said. Just our rotations kind of
really, it took a lot out of us. I feel like our initial keeping the ball in
front was good, and then after a while, we just kind of got lax in the
defensive possession. Just something we definitely have to work on and get
better from.  
  
Q. Kind of the same thing that I asked the players about. Once she got
hot, they were only 7 for 21, I believe, in the first quarter or the first
half -- excuse me. In the first quarter. Just talk about what she got going.
Did you try to change defenses? Did you do anything to limit her? Or just her
play was so good today? Just talk about that.  
SHAUNA GREEN: We ran every defense that we possibly could run today. We
haven't been -- we haven't zoned. We zoned. We haven't pressed. We pressed. We
tried -- everything that we have in our arsenal, we threw out there. That's
why a team like Marquette, that's why they're so dangerous because they're so
-- every single -- all five of their starters could go off like that. They're
all capable of putting up 20-some points. They do it in multiple ways.  
  
You worry about Blockton, and then you have Hiedeman coming out, and you worry
about one and then the next one. I give them credit because teams have been
daring them to shoot threes, and then you have Hiedeman that comes out and is
8 for 12.  
  
And we weren't going to dare them, we respect them. Our game plan was to have
a hot hand. I mean, we were switching a lot of stuff. So there's really no
excuse that she should have got eight threes that are open. We didn't execute
our game plan. We didn't execute coming out and switching aggressively and
getting hot hands.  
  
And no matter what game plan you have or what scout, when a player starts
hitting two or three threes, that's just -- you've got to do something, and
you've got to get up in them. Give them credit. They made plays, and every
time we made a run, they came back, and they got a stop, or they made a play.  
  
Q. Always tough saying good-bye to the seniors, and a couple of these
players were on the great team in 2015. Did you have any final words after the
game for them in the locker room? What can you say to wrap up their careers?  
SHAUNA GREEN: I mean, there's nothing you could say right now that's going to
make them feel better. I mean, they wanted to win. I told them -- I thanked
them, obviously. They've given so much. And I think you could see it out
there. They just, they wore down. I mean, they wore down. Jenna, what she's
done -- I mean, she played another 40 minutes. I think you said it. She's
played -- her and Lauren played like the last how many games, 40 minutes.  
  
At the end of the day, you look at them. I told her, I ask so much of you.
Just wore down. Her shots didn't shore. They've been huge for this program.
They've set the tone of how you go about your business, how you work. I wanted
this game so much for them to go out and get another win here, but we just
didn't have it. We didn't have it.  
  
The last couple games, like I said, I don't know if it's fatigue or what, we
just didn't have that spark to us that you saw for 17 games. Maybe it is just
they're tired, you know. So they're upset, obviously. They're hurt. But they
need to be proud, and they need to walk out of here, and I told them, with
their head high in what they've done for Dayton basketball. The mark they've
made has just been huge.  
  
Q. You mentioned them playing that many minutes. Are you looking forward
to having a deeper bench next year? We know you had injuries and players
sitting out this year.  
SHAUNA GREEN: And you saw our limit of our players today hurt us. We got in
foul trouble, and there's -- you know, Jenna goes out, and I put her back in,
but I -- we don't have Lauren. I mean, I give her so much credit. She's not a
point guard, and she's played point guard for Jenna the last two years as her
backup. Our injuries, they obviously presented some problems that you don't
have a backup point guard. I couldn't even get Jenna a minute here or there
the last couple weeks in games just because of that.  
  
So I thought you saw today, when you get in foul trouble -- I mean, three of
our players were in foul trouble and couldn't play really the first half. And
then I put Jenna back in. I think you saw that our depth today was just it
came in to be a major, major factor.  
  
So, yes, to answer your question, I'm excited about next year.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

### [Arica Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34761)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. Arica, as you've taken a look at this Boise State team, they've got a
pretty potent guard combination in Lupfer and Hermida. What have you seen
about them and how you plan on going after them?  
ARICA CARTER: Well, we just plan on coming out and playing our game, focusing
on the dribble drive because that's been a big part of our game that we need
to get better at. So we just plan on coming out and playing hard and keeping
people in front of us.  
  
Q. For both players, it's been about 20 years since the last 16 beat a
1. How hard is it to work up the amount of worry that your coach might want
you to feel right now?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We're not getting caught up in the 1 and 16 seeds. We're
just focusing mainly on playing our game, and that'll take care of itself if
we play our game.  
  
ARICA CARTER: Yeah, like she said, we've just got to come out and play hard,
play every possession like it matters, and give all effort.  
  
Q. You guys have been off now for 11 or 12 days. What have you done over
this last period to stay sharp?  
ARICA CARTER: We've practiced hard. We've had conditioning days to make sure
our fitness stays up, and we've watched a lot of film to make sure we're
mentally focused, and we just made sure that we're staying focused both
mentally and physically by going hard in practices and being smart in what we
do.  
  
Q. You guys have had some losses here in early rounds at home before;
how do you get over those types of losses and regroup?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: My sophomore year when we lost here to DePaul, the year
after that, we beat Tennessee, so I mean, it's moving on to the next one. It's
not worrying about what happened in the past, it's staying present, and just
playing our game. If we play our game, I feel real confident in what we can
do.  
  
Q. For either of you, when you look at this field with Marquette and
Dayton and Boise State, what stands out about what they could do to try to
topple you all as a top seed aside from the whole seeding thing?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Every team brings something different. So I'm just excited
to get out there and play. That's really what I know I'm focused on, my
teammates are focused on, just going out there and playing our hardest and not
getting carried away with who we're playing or what round it is.  
  
ARICA CARTER: Like she said, we've just got to come out and be focused. Every
team is going to come out and give their best punch at the end of the year,
and every team wants to win. Nobody cares what seed a team is. So we've just
got to come out and play hard, and we can't worry about what the other team is
doing and just focus on what we need to do.  
  
Q. For both of you, one of your assistant coaches who will remain
unnamed has called this basically a two-game tournament three times. Your
reaction to that, your thoughts on that?  
ARICA CARTER: I mean, it is. Like I said before, every team is coming out to
play hard. We've got to give our best. We've got to give our all and just go
out there and play our game. I mean, there's nothing more I can say about
that.  
  
Q. Arica, at the end of the season you were strong shooting from the
three-point line, and I just wonder if you had progressed to do that,
something that came along in your game, and did you think of that for the
team?  
ARICA CARTER: Well, I mean, I just worked on my game in all areas, and the
three-point shot is what has been the most successful so far. Teams keep
giving me that shot, so when I shoot it, I'm confident. My teammates have
instilled confidence in me as well as my coaches, so when I'm open, I know I'm
going to knock it down.  
  
Q. Is it kind of lonely out there beyond the three-point line when you
go up for your jumper and then it's not like a rebound, you've kind of got the
spotlight right on you on a three-point shot?  
ARICA CARTER: No, it's not lonely. I mean, it's exciting because it's a wide-
open shot. I'll take it.  
  
Q. Myisha, what does it mean to you being a senior and getting another
chance to play here in front of this fan base?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I'm excited. My senior night, I just kept thinking back,
I'm like, I'll be back here, it's not like I won't be back because we're going
to host the first two rounds, so I'm excited, and this is actually right now
going to be the last time I'll be in the Yum! Center, so let's just go out and
win these two games.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about banners in this building. How big would it
be for you ladies to hang a banner, especially Myisha, in your senior year?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: It would be really exciting. But we're not getting ahead.
We're just going to take one game at a time. Never get too ahead or worry
about the banners or cutting down Nets or the trophies. We're just going to
take it one game at a time, and then it'll take care of itself.  
  
JEFF WALZ: We have two of them hanging, but you might not have ever seen them.
They're kind of over on the side. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. In terms of compartmentalizing the whole two-game-at-a-time thing,
obviously the scenario is that you all don't have to leave the state before
you get to the Final Four. How much can you look forward to that in terms of
continuity, practice, just really being an hour away to the next round? How
much of that is motivation?  
ARICA CARTER: I think it's great. We have the best fans in the country, so for
them to be able to travel just an hour away is going to be amazing. I already
know they're going to pack the house. They're going to be the loudest ones in
the gym, so I think the fact that we're so close to home, having our fans
there is going to be amazing.  
  
Q. Myisha, I wonder if you could comment on how you've seen the depth of
the field grow in the women's tournament; there's still a lot of lopsided
scores, maybe even more so than the men. Do you think we're getting any closer
to parity?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yes. I mean, this game has grown so much, and I feel like
over the years you see a lot of different players and their game develop. I
know you're not seeing girls in the game right now dunking, but like you'll
see it on Instagram like them working out and them throwing down dunk and the
handles that some girls have, the three-point shot. So I feel like the game
has grown a lot because girls are more confident in themselves, thinking that
they can compete with the guys. But it's not always competing against the
guys, it's mainly competing against yourself and pushing yourself to become
better, and once that happens, I mean, I feel like we can compete with
anybody. Doesn't matter if you're a girl or you're a guy.  
  
Q. I'm talking about the number of women's teams that are truly
competitive in the tournament, and --  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Oh, sorry.  
  
Q. As an elite team that you are, the expectation is that you're
probably going to win most of your early games pretty handily. Has that
changed during your career?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah. A lot of teams are good. Like Coach Walz just said,
yeah. Doesn't matter what seed you are, you're going to get someone's best
shot, because like I was saying before, top down, girls are getting better, so
they're getting spread out to different teams. It's not all one -- like the
best players going to one team. They're getting spread out, and you can see it
now.  
  
JEFF WALZ: You just look at Marquette, a team that was at Notre Dame in
overtime, lost to Tennessee in overtime. They're an 8 seed. I think the depth
of women's basketball has expanded. You go back to Marquette's first game of
the year, they went to New Mexico and lost at New Mexico. I think New Mexico
finished sixth or seventh in the Mountain West. Boise won the Mountain West.
So I think that speaks volumes that you've got a team that finished sixth or
seventh in conference who the winner is a 16 seed. I just think it shows that
our game is getting there. Do we still have a ways to go? Yeah. But you know,
you go back seven, eight years ago, it was kind of whoever the top four seeds
were were going to the Final Four, where now you've got a Baylor team who's
No. 2 in the AP and coaches' poll who's a No. 2 seed. So it just shows the
depth of our game.  
  
Sorry about that.  
  
Q. Everyone on your team with the exception of the freshmen has
obviously had the chance to last year play the first two rounds at home and be
successful. Why do you think that was so successful last year? What did you
guys learn from those two games here last season?  
ARICA CARTER: I think it's like we talked about this year, just being focused
on the opponent in front of you, not thinking forward to the next game. We
have to win the first game to get to the next game, so you can never overlook
anybody.  
  
I think that's what it is, focusing on the opponent that we have to face, and
also focusing on ourselves, making sure that we play our game and not let
anybody change us.  
  
Q. Just a quiz for you two: On Monday night after Boise State found out
that they were playing you, one of their players made the comment that I'm not
sure if the Louisville girls actually know where we are. So I guess my
question is do you two know where Boise State is.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Idaho.  
  
JEFF WALZ: We have the utmost respect for them. At 23-9, you win your regular
season and conference championship, you're a good basketball team.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I was going to get it right. We know where they are.  
  
Q. For both of you, as the No. 1 seed there's a reward of getting to
play at home and better draw or whatever the theory is. But there are also
expectations when you're a No. 1 seed. Do you guys feel the expectations?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Being the No. 1 seed? Like AC was saying, we've just going
to take it one game at a time. We're never going to get caught up in what our
ranking is, and just mainly just focused on ourselves because it'll take care
of itself.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I agree with what Myisha said. We can't think about the pressure
of what everybody else thinks outside, we can only focus on our people, our
circle inside, and come out and play as hard as we can every game.  
  
Q. At this point of the season, how are roles kind of defined? Obviously
with how the game unfolds determines that, but in terms of how some players,
some of your teammates are playing, how do you kind of see things changing for
some of the other players on the bench?  
ARICA CARTER: This far in the year everybody knows their role. There's no
changing it tomorrow because it's tomorrow, it's a new game. No, everybody
knows their role and what they need to come out and do for the team to be
successful.  
  
Q. Do you see anybody who could have a bigger role, or is anybody
capable right now?  
ARICA CARTER: I mean, our whole team is capable of coming out and doing
something that might surprise you, but that's not their goal, they're not
coming out thinking, oh, I'm going to do this tonight. No, everybody knows
what they need to do.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, AC said it right. Roles are already made. Just
because we're in the NCAA Tournament now, you can't try to do something you
haven't been doing this whole season. So I mean, everyone has been playing
well, and you never know who's going to step up. Every game you have someone
different step up, whether it shows up on the stats sheet or not. Everyone
knows their role and what they're capable of doing, and we know what they're
capable of doing, and the coaches do, too.  
  
Q. She's not here so I have to ask about her; talk about Asia's play
this year. Bleacher Report specifically called her the Michael Jordan of
women's college basketball. Would you two kind of like to weigh in on that?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: That's something -- that's high up there, Michael Jordan.
I mean, that's impressive. But Asia, she's just a phenomenal player. She wants
the best, not only for herself but for her teammates, and she puts her
teammates first, and that's one of the things I love most about her. She's
never caught up in how many points she scored or what Bleacher Report is
saying or the outsiders are saying. It's about us first, and she wants the
team to be successful, and whatever she has to do, she'll do it for us to be
successful. That's one thing I love most about her. That's what I have to say
about her.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I agree with what Myisha said. She's a great teammate, and she's
always there for us even when she might be in the struggle, she's always
trying to pick somebody else up. I see that in a lot of players, especially
top players. She focuses on her teammates. When she's off, of course she might
be down, but then you can't even tell sometimes because she's always just
working hard and doing whatever else she can to help the team.  
  
Q. Do you think it helps that you guys haven't really been a perennial 1
seed like Notre Dame or UConn, you guys have that experience of kind of going
into some match-ups deemed the underdog?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what, being a 1 seed is an honor. There's no question
about it. It's what you've done the entire year. It's your body of work. These
young women have done a fantastic job day in and day out. But now we just
throw all that out. We don't -- we know we have a four-team tournament, you've
got to win the first to get to the second. And nobody cares what seed you are.  
  
Being a 1 seed is fantastic, like I said. It shows you what you've done
throughout the year. But we've had a lot of success as a 3 and a 5, gone on to
play in Final Fours and National Championships. The one thing that makes March
so special, both men's basketball and women's basketball, is the best team
doesn't always win. It's whoever is playing the best basketball that night.
You know, I go back to '13 when we beat Baylor. If that was a best of five, I
don't like my chances. But it's not, it's one game. And that's where you get
into a situation where you start making shots and the ball starts going in,
and then a call here or there, a 50/50 call, ball goes off of somebody's foot,
it gets given back to you, those are the things you can't control. So that's
what makes it so special.  
  
I've said it all along, it's not always the best team wins. It's whoever is
playing the best that night. And that's what you've got to do as a coach,
you've got to do as players, you've got to make sure you're playing your best,
and I feel good about where we are right now. I think the ACC Tournament was
something that we have talked about. You go 3-0 in a tournament, you win a
tournament championship by a total of 10 points. It's not like we blew anybody
out. We're down 12, I believe, to Virginia Tech in the first half, down eight
or nine to NC State, and our kids don't panic. We've been in those spots
before. You've just got to keep working, keep grinding, and like these young
women said, we take care of ourselves. Instead of being worried about all the
time what the opponent is going to do, we try to focus on us, what we have to
do. You know, we know what we have to do in order to hopefully advance.  
  
Q. Following up on your point about the close margin in the ACC, what do
you think those kind of wins really show about this team in terms of its focus
and resolve, and like you said, you're not blowing out anybody, but you're
getting these close wins?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think it shows the maturity of them. You know, they can go
back on their experience. We're up six, I think, six or seven to Notre Dame
with about four and a half, five to go, and they cut it to one, and I didn't
call a time-out. There was no need to call a time-out. Our players know what
to do. It was just a matter of executing, relaxing, taking care of business,
and they cut it to one. We executed the offense, man gets the ball reversed,
Myisha makes a little 15-foot jump shot, and now as the game gets under a
minute, I've got three time-outs to work with. And I think that's where we are
right now right now with this group. Sure, I might have to call a time-out
here or there, but it's not something I feel I have to do to bail them out,
where it's like, oh, my gosh, I've got to stop this. They're mature enough.
They've got enough experience that we know exactly what we have to do to be
able to stop momentum from the other team, and that could be a defensive stop
or execute at the offensive end.  
  
Q. Gordy Presnell, head coach there, has been there for 13 years. What
do you know about Gordy?  
JEFF WALZ: Great guy. I just had the opportunity to talk to him after our
meeting. He's got a great program. He's a very good coach. You know, they lost
their post player early in the year to an injury, so he's had to adjust how he
kind of likes to play, and I think they've done a very good job, and I think
that's what a good coach does.  
  
You know, sure, you might have a system, but if something happens where
someone gets injured, if you can't run the system, you change, and I think
that's when you realize somebody can coach, when they're willing and able to
make changes.  
  
We know that they're going to do some different things at the defensive end of
the floor. We're going to have to stay patient and just make sure we realize
and can recognize what's going on. But he does a great job, and they're a
really, really good basketball team.  
  
Q. Following up on the parity angle, there are men's coaches who when
Kentucky shows up they stop recruiting a player, figuring that it's a lost
cause. Do you have the same experience with UConn, or are there coaches that
do, and how do you deal with that?  
JEFF WALZ: No, I mean, if we had that philosophy, Asia Durr wouldn't be
sitting here playing for us because she was recruited by everybody in the
country. You know, there's enough players -- we're getting more players that
are at a high caliber that UConn can only take so many. You've only got so
many, and the thing about Geno, which I laugh about, is everybody talks about,
well, 15 scholarships is too many, Geno is stockpiling. No, he doesn't. He's
got like 10 or 11, that's it, every year. If you look at his bench, you know,
he always has some walk-ons or some players that he ends up putting on
scholarship, I think, but he's not out there with a full 15.  
  
You know, we have 12 right now on scholarship, and Jess was a walk-on starting
the year. We added her on scholarship because she's worked extremely hard. But
most of your top, top programs, it's hard to keep 15 players happy. You know,
now if you redshirt a couple, which I think is great, but if you don't, boy,
it's hard.  
  
I think if you have that mindset of I'm going to stop recruiting them because
UConn calls them or Baylor calls them or whoever else, it's not really a smart
philosophy to have. You know, so we keep recruiting, but I do say it all the
time in recruiting: The most important aspect of recruiting is know what kids
you can't get. It's not know which ones you can get, because if you spend too
much time on the kids you can't get, it's going to affect you on the one that
you might be able to get. So that's what we talk about all the time as a staff
is, hey, let's get in there and let's get to know the player, let's get to
know the support system around that player and find out.  
  
If mom is going, I don't want my baby to go away from home and I'm doing a
home visit in California, I mean, I've got a pretty good feeling I'm not
getting her. So that's when you've got to -- you might still recruit her, but
I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket.  
  
Q. They won their league, they won their league tournament, they've won
10 in a row. What did the committee miss, or why are they seeded 16? Seems
like they're better than that.  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I mean, I'm not privy to be in that room. But I know they are
a very good basketball team and have got an RPI of about 110, 111, and I've
got a lot of respect for them. There's no question about that. I was surprised
to see them as a 16, and I think if you watch the selection show, from their
expression, I think they were surprised to be a 16.  
  
But you're going to have to play somebody. That's what I say all the time.
Everybody talks about this draw, that draw, this bracket, that bracket. You've
got to play somebody. I mean, it comes down to what are you going to do,
everybody is sitting there telling me, you want to be opposite UConn, you want
to be opposite UConn. I'm like, why. They're like, well, you don't want to
play them in the semis. That's the only time he's lost in the Final Four is in
the semis. So why not play them in the semis? He kicked our ass twice in the
finals. So it's a mindset. It's how you take it. And if you've got the
approach that it's the next game -- like we have to worry about this one here
tomorrow. Believe me, our kids will not overlook Boise because I'm not. I've
got way too much respect for Gordy and the staff and their players, and then
if we're fortunate enough to advance, believe me, Marquette and Dayton are two
really good basketball teams, very well-coached that play hard, and they're
going to present some problems to us.  
  
But we will not look past tomorrow, and if something happens and if we lose, I
promise you, it's not because we didn't have respect for Boise State, because
we do.  
  
Q. Going off of that, when you look at the losses here to Dayton and
DePaul, was there a common thread that allowed that to happen?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we lost up in Albany to Dayton in the Sweet 16. So that
wasn't here. And our game against DePaul, match-ups are a big part of this
game, and three years ago when we played them here, it was a bad matchup for
us, and we knew it when the draw came out. They all shoot threes, they spread
the floor, and you know, we have some players that are more traditional back-
to-the-basket post players, and they really -- they shot -- their 5 player I
think had two or three threes in the first half. So match-ups dictate a lot.
You look at the men's game, and all of a sudden it's like, golly, why is this
supposed to be a close game, and then you realize, well, the opponent has got
four players that can shoot threes, and who they're playing is a traditional
two-post offense.  
  
So I'm not concerned about what's taken place in the past. Our players know
that we have gone on the road and won a bunch of times in this tournament. So
once the games start up, you know, it's -- anybody has a chance to win.  
  
Q. You referenced it earlier, you have a couple banners hanging in this
gym. Talk about how hard it is to get one of those banners and how badly you
want to hang another one.  
JEFF WALZ: It's difficult. It's one thing I would say, people really don't
understand, I think, at times how hard it is to get to a National Championship
game, to get to a Final Four. Everybody is trying for the same thing.  
  
You know, it takes a special group, and I think we have a special group, and
then it takes a little luck. I don't care what anybody says. It takes a little
bit of luck. You've got to prepare, and that's what I tell our players. You
have to prepare and prepare as hard as you can, so when that opportunity
comes, your preparation meets a little luck, and that's fine.  
  
Now, you can't sit there and just pray for luck and not prepare. That's really
not a smart thing to do. So it's something that we put in front of us. It's
our goal. In '14 we lose here in the Elite 8 game with a chance to get back to
the Final Four. I mean, it's tough. There's no question about it, and that's
one of the reasons I give the utmost respect to UConn and Geno. He makes it
look easy. I promise you, it's not.  
  
Q. I asked the ladies earlier about all the headlines that Asia has been
garnering throughout the year. How has it been coaching her, and talk about
how just overall talented your team is? Obviously the ladies sitting directly
to your right are very talented in their own right.  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, we're a ballclub that when we come out and we play hard and
we play together, we're really good. You know, as good as Asia is, you know,
she counts on her teammates, also, to help her. That night she had 47 up there
at Ohio State, it's not just because it's all one-on-one. It was within the
offense. She had about three or four where she just came down out of
transition and scored. The rest of them were out of the offense, kids getting
great screens for her, her reading screens, getting the ball to her at the
right time. So we count on each other.  
  
Myisha has been a double-double just about every night she plays. It's really
impressive. But part of that is because Sam boxes out her man and Myisha's
man. So Myisha is able to get in there and clean things up. Sam is one that I
don't think gets enough recognition of credit for what she does. If you watch
our game, just watch Sam Fuehring. The kid is on the floor more than anybody
that I've coached and is always in there mixing it up and defending and
rebounding. She's taken, I think, about 40 charges on the season. Those are
the things that you have to have. Sam and Myisha play extremely well together.
And that's what's made our team so good.  
  
Arica, I say it all the time, and for those of you who watch it, you
understand what I'm saying, she's a perfect 15-and-over YMCA men's league
player. There's nothing fancy. There's no behind-the-back, there's no hoop-di-
do, there's nothing. She comes off a ball screen, takes her time, pull-up jump
shot. She'll get the ball on ball reversal, she takes her time, straight into
the shot. And I think that's what's makes her so good. She understands the
game. She's got a high basketball IQ, and those are the things you can't
teach. You either have that or you don't.  
  
Her game, I think, someone asked about her three-point shot, the kid made zero
three-pointers her freshman year. I mean, couldn't hit the broad side of a
barn, and just got in the gym. She's worked at it. She's worked and worked and
worked, and she is a testimony of what is hard to find these days because a
lot of players are like, well, I went in the gym for the past week and I shot
extra, but I haven't gotten better. Well, AC has been doing it for three years
now, and finally the rewards of all the work that she's put in, she's starting
to reap. And that's what's so exciting about her as a person and a player.  
  
And Asia is the same way. Asia is the first one in the gym, the last one out
of the gym. But what I love about this ballclub is you can go back to our
Notre Dame, end of the third quarter, I think it was Pittsburgh or end of the
third quarter when Asia hits those threes fading out of bounds, and the bench
is the first one out there to congratulate her. They're all excited for her.
But then if you would have seen Asia's face when Myisha was named MVP of the
ACC Tournament, she's the first one to give her a hug. She's the first one in
the pressroom that's got a tear in her eye, so excited about winning. She
didn't even make first- or second-team all-tournament team, but she was
excited for Jaz, who's had a wonderful year for us, for Sam, for AC, and
that's what makes this group so special. Our chemistry is wonderful.  
  
I tell them all the time, you have to -- in order to be a great basketball
program, you have to learn to respect each other's differences. You aren't
going to be friends with everybody. It's impossible to be best friends with
everybody. But you have to respect each other's differences. And that's what
this ballclub does. There's some great friendships that have been made, but at
the same time, you might like '80s music and you might like rap. You know
what, we compromise, and that's what this ballclub has learned to do, they've
learned to respect each other and care about each other.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. For any of you guys, you've been in a similar situation before, last
year in the tournament playing UCLA in the first round. How do you approach
these games where you know that everyone is kind of expecting you guys to be
the huge underdog?  
SHALEN SHAW: I think it's something that we kind of use for fuel. No one
expects us to win. Everybody is kind of almost against us, but we kind of
rally together and try to play our best game.  
  
RILEY LUPFER: I think coming into this game with your head held high, don't be
intimidated, you can't play scared. Just come in with a chip on your shoulder.
Why not us?  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I definitely think the whole year we were predicted No. 1 in
our conference starting off, but we still had to play the underdog role when
we didn't find ourselves there the whole conference season, so it's something
we've kind of gotten used to. Even though we were the No. 1 seed in our
tournament, we still felt like we had to play and be the underdog a little
bit.  
  
Q. For any of the players who would like to touch this, the men's
tournament does not allow teams to play on their home floor. How do you feel
about having to come in here?  
RILEY LUPFER: I think it's exciting. Our coach was telling us about how they
get like 7,000 a game, and I'm like, the more fans the better, so they bring
in a good crowd. I think it's just fun. We don't mind it.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: I think it's fun because we get to play somewhere that we've
never been. We watch them on TV. We get to see the court, and all the fans,
too, I think it'll just be a good environment and kind of exciting.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I think it's going to be really fun, and obviously like Shay
said, it's a different atmosphere that we're playing in. We see them on TV, we
see this arena, so it's a good opportunity for us to get out of the Northwest
and come down here.  
  
Q. Playing so far away from Boise, an unfamiliar audience of course
you're playing in front of, so the question is who is Boise State? What kind
of team? Who is this Boise State basketball team?  
RILEY LUPFER: I think our culture is we overcome adversity. We go down to
Wyoming with one of the biggest crowds we ever have to win a regular season
championship, and I think we came up, we showed that we were the best in the
Mountain West. I think we come into situations like that and we play our best
basketball, and I think that says a lot about our culture and how much grit we
have.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I think the resiliency that our team has shown is something
that will be showcased tomorrow. We're faced with adversity being a No. 16
team coming in to play Louisville, and so I think the adversity that we're
going to face tomorrow is something that we might not have faced at this scale
this season, but we've had little bits and pieces to prepare us.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, I think the adversity we've had throughout the season and
the injuries we've had, the elevation at Wyoming, I think it's something that
says that we take on adversity and we hold on to it and play behind it.  
  
Q. I wonder if any of your families have had any difficulties getting
here. It must have fairly challenging. I know that Kentucky fans going to
Boise are looking at two connections. Any interesting anecdotes?  
RILEY LUPFER: Yeah, it's crazy. It's a lot of money to travel here. My mom
works for Southwest and she can fly for free, and she can't even come because
the flights are so crazy here and it's just too much time. But I know we'll
have one fan there for sure. My family lives in Memphis, and hopefully they
make it, but you never know. It's a long travel, no matter where you go.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, my mom works for American, too, and she looked at all the
flights, and they were all booked. There was nothing to get here.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: My dad is a road tripper and surprised me at plenty of games,
but I don't think he's going to be able to manage this one. He joked to put
him on the list just in case he finds a way, but flying is expensive, and
driving, that's a long trip.  
  
Q. Shay, for you, it's your third NCAA Tournament, first Boise State
player to play in three. Is there anything you're looking to get out of this
one other than a win that hasn't been the case the last two?  
SHALEN SHAW: I was going to say a win. That's all that I think we're looking
to get out of it, just get that win and hopefully after that get more wins and
just take everything in.  
  
Q. Pardon me if you've been asked this question before, but in terms of
coming here, and you were just alluding to the travel issues. How much of a
change practice-wise or schedule-wise to adjust to the time zone change have
you had to make coming here, just anything with studying and practicing and
what kind of effect that's had?  
RILEY LUPFER: We were joking it was our teammate's birthday yesterday. It was
her 21st, and we just felt like we lost a whole day, coming here, losing two
hours. We were on a plane most of it, and we were like, Ellie, you kind of
missed your whole 21st birthday; that kind of sucks. But otherwise I think we
handled it pretty well.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, we haven't really made a whole bunch of changes in practice
or anything like that. Maybe just went to bed a little bit later.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I think something, at least for school, I have a couple
things due today, so I have a little extra time to turn them in. That's the
only thing I can think about.  
  
Q. Knowing that Louisville has hosted here before and they've lost here
before in the first couple rounds, does that give you guys a little bit of a
different perspective on the game?  
SHALEN SHAW: I think it just -- I don't think it gives us a bit of a different
perspective. I think that we just need to be who we are and play how we play,
and I think that some good things will happen for us.  
  
RILEY LUPFER: Try not to worry about statistics as much as other people would.
I say don't -- just come in here and play our game, play confident, and don't
worry about the past because it's the past. We've just got to be in the moment
and just appreciate that we're here and play hard.  
  
Q. I think the only time a 16 has beaten a 1 was in the women's
tournament in '98. Have you seen that video, or do you take any heart from
that, any of you?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: Personally I haven't seen the video, but we've been kind of
given -- I've been told about it, and I was one at the time, so I wasn't able
to watch. So I think that just proves like something that a 16 seed isn't
necessarily the worst thing that can happen to us. We talked about, it's just
adversity that we have to face.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: I personally also haven't seen the video. I just know it was
Harvard over Stanford, which that's a good game. I'd like to watch it when I
get home.  
  
RILEY LUPFER: I'd say that was a long time ago, and it's basketball, anything
can happen. It's one game, and like anything can go our way. We have to just
get ready for the game and not worry about that.  
  
Q. Three years ago wasn't that long ago when you were 15, Boise State
hung with a 2 in Tennessee at Tennessee, and you guys started out pretty well
in that game and then last year at UCLA was a rough start, so how important is
the first five minutes of the game against Louisville?  
SHALEN SHAW: The first five minutes is everything. That'll set the tone where
we are and who we are. I think that in those first five minutes, it's
important that we play our game and don't let them control the game because in
those five minutes we can do anything, we can shock the world basically.  
  
RILEY LUPFER: Last year against UCLA we kind of came out and got ourselves in
a hole, but the rest of the game it was like the same point margin, and we
showed if we didn't get in a hole, we could stay with them. I'm a big believer
that you set the tone with how you start the game, so if we come in confident,
hit a couple shots, we'll be like, okay, this could go our way. So I think it
helps a lot with confidence the way we start a game.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I think we found ourselves some holes in the beginning of the
season in some early games and we were able to climb out, but when you're
playing on this stage, those holes are the whole game and they decide
everything, so coming out with a confident, strong start is something that we
need to focus on to carry us through the rest of the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. A lot has been made obviously about how you guys are underdogs in
this matchup, but you're riding the 10-game win streak coming off a conference
championship. Do you feel like you guys are on the up right now?  
RILEY LUPFER: For sure. I think we are flowing as a team and we started
flowing at the perfect time of the season, so I would say to keep the flow
that we got at the tournament, keep it going here pretty, but we're confident
in ourselves.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: Yeah, just like Riley said, we're on a 10-game win streak and
we want that to continue, obviously, but we know we're up to face a challenge
tomorrow morning, and I think we're ready for it. We've practiced hard, we
have a good scout, and we're going to be really prepared to play in the
morning.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, I think we've been playing well together, doing the right
things and not being selfish with the ball, which is important, and I think
that we'll be ready to fight tomorrow.  
  
Q. Along that line, Riley, when you look at this winning streak, where
do you feel like you all have really progressed and how that carries over into
a came like this?  
RILEY LUPFER: We started off the season really struggling finding ourselves,
and we lost a lot of games in the fourth quarter, which like giving it to
them. And I think these last 10 games we feel way more confident in our fourth
quarter, and we're like, this is our game. Our shots are going to go in, we're
getting stops. And I think that is the grit and resilience that we have built
as a team this year, and we're gelling right now, so I think that has really
changed a lot for us.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, when you look at Louisville on video, what is the
challenge in trying to slow them down?  
RILEY LUPFER: The challenge of trying to slow them down, I would say trying to
focus on the scout, know the personnel, know that Asia Durr wants to go left
and know who their shooters are. Just do what we do and make sure -- our coach
has spent a lot of time on the scout, so I feel like we need to be really
focused in on that and how to slow them down.  
  
SHALEN SHAW: I totally agree scout is very important. If you don't know the
scout, then you're going to be lost the whole game, and knowing the scout also
helps us on defense, just knowing who the shooters are, knowing who wants to
rebound and who you need to box out in order to get the ball to go the other
way, so I think scout is very, very important.  
  
Q. Is Louisville one of the deepest rosters that you've seen in terms of
just scoring and just the number of things that they can do?  
GORDY PRESNELL: I think they're one of the most dimensional, multidimensional.
They only played six or seven players the whole ACC Tournament if I recall.
But their ball screen motion is phenomenal. They have post presence, they have
size, they have a go-to player. They play multiple defenses where they can get
out and just get after you, and then they can play pack line a little bit.
What they've done here in the last few years is remarkable, and what a great
coaching staff and the job that he's done. They've knocked on the door a few
times, and now they're about ready to step on in and have their place.  
  
Hopefully we will perform at the very best that we can tomorrow, and looking
forward to the game, that's for sure. I think our kids are, too.  
  
Q. How does your team rebound so well with such limited height?  
GORDY PRESNELL: Yeah, emphasis on limited height. Even though we had an all-
conference post player, 6'3", an ACL about the fourth or fifth game into the
season, it just really crushed us before Christmas. So just an effort, and we
have a post coach that her whole job is post and also rebounding, and that's
all that we focus on. I do think we are very, very obviously undersized, but
that's where we are most athletic is Shay Shaw and A'Shanti Coleman and Joyce
Harrell are all rim touchers, and so that's an area that we've just really
tried to put a focus on, and the same thing offensively. We try to go hard,
and I've never run so much 1-4 high stuff in my life because we've always had
post presence. So it's been a great learning experience for me this season, as
well. But just emphasizing that's where our athleticism is, and let's make
someone block us out every time.  
  
Q. Can you perhaps give some perspective on how the parity of the
women's game has improved, and there's still a pretty significant point
differential, particularly in first-round games? Do you see that changing?  
GORDY PRESNELL: I think there's a handful of teams that get some really,
really special players, and then the rest of us are battling like crazy. I
think the home site thing is a humongous advantage, and we've done this, what,
three times the last four years, and four times since I've been at Boise
State, and we've got to figure out some way to get to that 11 or 12 seed so
that we can play on a neutral floor because I truly believe on a neutral floor
we can compete with some teams in the tournament. That's on us, and we've got
to figure out -- and on our league, and we've got to figure out a way to be
able to do that, because it's frustrating, last year I think we were 46 RPI
going into the tournament, and we're a 13 seed at UCLA. So we've just got to
get a little bit better so that we can get someone on a neutral floor and see
what we can do.  
  
Q. Kind of as a follow-up to that, when you guys are playing really well
in conference play, winning your conference tournament and you're considered
to be one of the top teams and then all of a sudden you come into the NCAA
Tournament and it's kind of flipped on its head, how does that feel to kind of
have that dichotomy?  
GORDY PRESNELL: I don't know, that -- I guess we're the 64th best team in the
tournament if we're a 16, or we could be a 61. I think our RPI was actually a
little bit better and there's some travel accommodations met, so we went from
a 14 or 15 to a 16. I don't know, we're just going to come in here tomorrow
and compete our tails off and see where we're at. We've great respect for
their program and great respect for their coaching staff and what they're
accomplishing here, and we want to get everything we can out of this. We want
to enjoy every second. We're going to observe every second. We have one senior
that plays a lot, we have one junior that plays a lot, and everyone else has
got two years in our program. We have the 46th ranked recruiting class in the
country. It's the first time we've even been in the top 100, and we've got
some great kids coming. We've got a kid that led the Spanish national team in
scoring that's sitting out this year on our team, a kid from Kansas sitting
out. So we think who we have returning and who we have coming in that maybe we
can get to that next little notch we want to so that maybe if we're sitting
here next year, we're at a neutral site.  
  
Q. A couple of the players said that they've seen Louisville play on TV
before, and it's certainly a tough task with a team with only two losses. How
do you normalize the game and not let the moment get too big?  
GORDY PRESNELL: You know, we let our players handle some of that. If you know
Riley, she's a pretty tough kid, and she's really competitive, and so I don't
think she's in awe of much of anything. Shay -- we've walked into Tennessee
and Pauley Pavilion and some of those places, so this is a great opportunity.
I don't know what's expected of us, but we're going to come in and we will try
our very hardest, and we're going to defend and we're going to try to handle
their ball screen and try to figure out something to do with Asia Durr on the
ball screen in the next 24 hours and just see what happens.  
  
I'm proud of our team. We are so young. I'm so proud of them. I'm proud of
their grit and I'm proud of their toughness. We worked a lot on toughness this
year. And I'm proud of our conference, too. You know, we have four teams at
NIT, and our league will be better next year. We are a very, very young
league, and everyone is going to be better next year, and you're going to hear
about the Mountain West Conference in the future.  
  
Q. You've alluded to the neutral floor advantage or the lack of a
neutral floor advantage. Do you see that evolving? Do you think there will be
a point where the women's tournament is not played on campus sites or home
sites?  
GORDY PRESNELL: You know, I don't know. I can only control what I can control,
and what I can control is we've got to figure out a way to schedule better or
win some games or not get hurt or whatever those things are so that we can be
an 11 or 12 and be hopefully in the thick of it.  
  
But it's hard to play a whole season and then end up at Tennessee or UCLA or
in this case a No. 1 seed, Louisville. But they've earned that right, and
that's the rules, and they get to host. So welcome in here, and we appreciate
all they've done. It's an incredible facility. We have an incredible facility
back in Boise that some teams are playing in, too. I think Kentucky is down
there today. But we're just honored to be here and honored to represent our
conference and our school and honored to play Louisville.  
  
Q. You mentioned the recruiting class that you guys have coming in. How
have the prior NCAA Tournament experiences helped with that aspect of putting
Boise State on that kind of scale?  
GORDY PRESNELL: You know, there's not a whole lot of teams in the west that
get to the tournament regularly, and we feel like we've gone three of the last
four years where that's beginning to be regularly, so that is something that
we're selling as hard as we can, and we feel like we have a good conference.
We feel like we have a great university, a progressive university, and so we
do have a good group coming, and we have the No. 3 scorer in the nation coming
in out of high school, 36 points a game. So we're looking forward to the
future of our program and the future of our conference.

### [Amani Wilborn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32754)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. Erika, obviously a big matchup against Layfield. What have you been
kind of scouting? What's the key to shutting her down?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: Just, you know, playing our hardest, just basically taking
away her strengths and stuff, and just basically -- just basically just
playing my hardest, and just basically, like I said, taking away her
strengths.  
  
Q. You had quite the performance against Quinnipiac last year at this
stage. What kind of confidence boost does that bring, and what did you take
away from that?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: Basically from like just that, just never take anyone
lightly, to play your hardest at any stage because you never know when it's
going to be over. You have to win to survive.  
  
Q. If you could each talk about what you think a team's strength is of
Marquette and then what you feel like a strength is that you've seen when
you've scouted Dayton.  
AMANI WILBORN: A team strength of Marquette, of course, is our tempo. Just
playing fast, and I think a strength of Dayton's would be rebounding. We have
to keep them off the boards.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I'd say a team strength of us is our chemistry. We really
know where each other is on the floor, and we do a good job of when someone is
hot or someone is on a roll, feeding that hot hand and finding each other.
Like we know our strengths really well. And the team strength of Dayton is
they run their sets really well. They're very deliberate, and they know what
action they want. They do a good job using that action.  
  
DANIELLE KING: I would say our strength would be our disruptive full-court
defense. We really get after the ball, ball hawk a lot. And a strength of
Dayton is their point guard. They have a strong point guard. She runs the team
a lot, so disrupting her would be a good strength for us to attack.  
  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: A strength of ours is our speed. We want to try to get them
down the court as fast as we can in transition. And a strength of Dayton is
that they have just phenomenal players, like they have players that can be on
the perimeter, go inside or outside, and their transitions are really well.  
  
Q. Most of you guys have -- actually all of you guys have been here
before, but one player that hasn't is Selena Lott. What have you guys been
telling her to prepare her for this experience?  
DANIELLE KING: Stay aggressive. She's a great defender, and when she scores,
she helps us a lot, too. She had a strong game against DePaul in the
tournament, and we just want her to keep that same energy and bring it.  
  
AMANI WILBORN: Again, our defense, and just knowing that defense creates
offense, and when she's out there playing hard in defense, that brings the
energy for us and to keep the tempo going.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Just keeping her confident, also. When you're on this stage
it doesn't matter if you're a senior or you're a freshman or sophomore. It's
just all about confidence at this level, and everyone has come to play hard,
and obviously she doesn't play like a freshman, so it's just keep reminding
her of that and how she's a big part of our team, just keeping her engaged.  
  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: Kind of like what they said, just to stay aggressive and most
importantly to have fun. It's March, and this should be a fun time.  
  
Q. Does it get any less nerve-racking the second time around?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I think it's even more fun.  
  
DANIELLE KING: Yes, it's always fun and a privilege to play in March. Not a
lot of teams make it this far, so we always look at it as an opportunity to
have fun and show our best basketball.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I think the most nerve-racking time is during the selection
show because you're kind of just sitting there. You really don't know when
your name is going to be called, but once you found out where you're playing,
you know, another game that you prepare for and you get focused for, then it
just goes out the window.  
  
AMANI WILBORN: Yeah, I think the same thing. It's not just nerve-racking when
you're preparing for it, but just as a team going out there confident.  
  
Q. I'd like to hear what your one pregame ritual is.  
AMANI WILBORN: I'm superstitious, so I have a lot. But I think the biggest
thing that I think my most important ritual is praying. Not necessarily
praying for a win but praying that we go out and give it our hardest, pray
that no one walks away injured, so I think that's something that I keep in the
forefront.  
  
DANIELLE KING: I'm a big hype person, so I have to listen to music. My
favorite artist is MacNeal before the game, so listening to him gets me pumped
up.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I also pray before each and every game, and I'm kind of with
Dani, too, I like to listen to music.  
  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: For me, I'm not really superstitious, so I really try to like
go over scout in my head and what's our strength and what we're trying to do,
so I just listen to music, relax, take a lot of deep breaths.  
  
Q. First of all, how does your approach change having coached this team,
almost this exact same team a year ago on this same stage?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think the biggest thing that I learned is last year we were
just so intent on making the NCAA Tournament, we talked about that all year,
and then when we got there, it was like, okay now what. And all year long
we've been talking about going farther than this program ever has been before,
so I think that was one thing that I changed is let's not just make the goal
to get to the tournament, let's make the goal to win a couple games and
advance as far as we can.  
  
Q. JaVonna Layfield really provides tough matchup terms, a double-double
machine. How are you guys kind of preparing for her?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I think their entire team is really versatile, so they
have a lot of good players that we need to key in on, but we have to keep her
off the glass. Obviously anyone who can put up a double-double the entire
season is phenomenal, so I think we'll throw different bodies at her, change
it up a little bit, and just make sure we're focused on the glass.  
  
Q. How important is it going to be, you mentioned sharing the ball
before, and Dayton really one of those really good defensive teams, I think 35
percent shooting that they allow. What's been the focus going in with that?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think we're at our best when we're sharing and we're taking
Marquette shots. We've done a really good job, and I think we led the Big East
in field goal percentage, so for us we have to take the shots that we want and
not the shots that Dayton is trying to force us into. I think we do a good job
of an inside-outside presence, and we have to continue that as we play this
40-minute game.  
  
Q. Obviously Dayton is the focus, but if you win, two days away,
Louisville, a top seed. How do you balance playing for tomorrow and also -- if
you play Louisville, obviously a very tough matchup that's going to take a lot
of planning?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, there is no tomorrow if you don't win today, so that's
what we're focused on. We haven't talked one ounce of Louisville. We've been
focused on Dayton, and that's one thing that I think we've got to make sure
you can't overlook any team in March, and obviously Dayton is a phenomenal
team with a phenomenal tradition in the NCAA Tournament and what they've been
able to do over the course of their program history. So for us, you know,
we're just focused on that.  
  
Q. And then do the emotions change, too, with last year you were coming
off a Big East title, highest seed in program history, now a bit more of a low
after that big loss, the biggest loss while you've been a head coach. How does
that change the mindset?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Wow, buddy. No, I mean, every game is different, and for us,
last year we won the Big East and we lost our first-round game. This year
we're planning on doing the opposite. We didn't win the DePaul game, but we're
planning on going further. That game is over, and it might still be in your
mind but it's not in ours, and we're focused on this game right here, so
that's all our team is worried about.

### [Alex Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35063)

### [Jenna Burdette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33176)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. JaVonna, I already talked to you a little bit about playing in
Louisville, your hometown, but you're here again. You were here last year.
What does it mean to be back on this court with another chance?  
JaVONNA LAYFIELD: It means everything. We come here to get the job, try to get
a win. That's really what it is. It's not about me playing at home, it's not
about me being in front of family. I mean, it's exciting, but at the end of
the day, I have a job to do, and that's what we're here to do.  
  
Q. You've had a terrific senior season. What's been the biggest change
for your game from the standpoint of rebounding the basketball and what you
were able to do this year at 5'10 ", 5'11"?  
JaVONNA LAYFIELD: Just me having confidence in myself, my team having
confidence in me, and just pushing myself to the best of my ability. I just
found my niche, and just the best I can.  
  
Q. JaVonna, how many people are you expecting to come watch you
tomorrow?  
JaVONNA LAYFIELD: Probably 30, 33 people, quite a bit.  
  
Q. Jenna or Alex, you've seen some film on Marquette now; what do you
see on film?  
ALEX HARRIS: As you said, they like to push the pace a little bit. Their main
thing is just to get in the paint and that just coincides with our key things,
to keep them out of the paint. We don't really have to really change anything.  
  
JENNA BURDETTE: Yeah, they like to run and so do we. I don't think they've
faced a team that runs as hard as we do or gets out in transition like we do,
so I think that's a good thing for us. I mean, no one really likes to play
against pace teams, so it'll be fun.  
  
Q. This question is addressed to all three of you. What's the biggest
difference from last year's team to this year's team and sort of being in the
same spot, but also sort of some of the same pieces but sort of a different
squad?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I think this year we just really pulled together and had a
tremendous A-10 season. I think it's carried us through to where we are now,
and just off the court we're really close, and I think that helps us on the
court, just to have good -- I don't know, we just work well together.
Chemistry, thank you.  
  
ALEX HARRIS: Like Jenna said, we're very close. Last year we were close, but I
believe this year we've grown a lot closer, and age is a big difference. We're
kind of veterans that have played on a playing field like this, and we have no
pressure.  
  
JaVONNA LAYFIELD: Just what these two just said, I just think that our
chemistry on court has grown tremendously in the past year, and we're all
great friends, and we just really work well together. We're all veterans, so I
think that plays a big part in the difference between last year and this year.  
  
Q. This is a very experienced team. We talked about the seniors being
here three years. Do you even have to talk to them about the pressures of
playing here, or are they just so used to it you don't have to worry about
that?  
SHAUNA GREEN: We don't really talk about that in any game, whether it's the
A-10 championship or whether it's the NCAA Tournament. I mean, they know. I
don't have to tell them what's at stake here. I don't have to tell them really
anything about that. They know what's on the line. They know what has to be
done. Now it's just a matter of them coming out really, and like I told them
today, the main thing that I want to see, I just want us to play as hard as we
possibly can play. I want to see us leave everything out there, every ounce of
us, just leave it on the floor and have no regrets. Whatever happens, I want
to walk off that floor with zero regrets, especially these seniors. I want
them to leave it all out there really. We don't have to get into too much
about that with this group because they are, they've been here. I mean, two of
these seniors have been to the NCAA Tournament three out of their four years,
so they are experienced, they know what it's about, and they know what it
takes to win here, too, because their freshman year they were part of our
Elite 8 team.  
  
We're coming here not just to be happy to be here. We're coming in here with a
goal and a task at hand to accomplish.  
  
Q. In the way that Marquette plays, can you look back this season and
sort of compare them to a team that you've already played?  
SHAUNA GREEN: I mean, they're different than probably any team in our league,
but Richmond plays similar to them that we've played more recently. But
they're different. They're very athletic. They have a couple -- I mean,
they're just a very good team, number one, overall across the board with a
really, really good player in Brockton, who was Big East Player of the Year. I
have a ton of respect for them and how they play, the pace at which they play,
and that's going to be -- it's not -- you can't really simulate that, either,
in a practice. Luckily we play really, really fast, so we play against it
every day, in terms of what we do. So I don't think that they're that similar
to any team in our conference, but like I said, we play like that, too, so it
should be an exciting game really for people to watch I would think. It's not
going to be a walk-the-ball-up-the-floor type of game, so it should be
entertaining.  
  
Q. We already know JaVonna is going to have a good fan club there, but
some of those home games toward the end of the season we've had really good
crowds at Dayton. Are you expecting a decent crowd, and talk about how that
can give you a little bit of an advantage or home-court advantage being so
close to Dayton?  
SHAUNA GREEN: Yeah, I mean, last year we were down here, and we had a really
good crowd, and that was with our men playing the night before, so some people
had to choose where they were going. So hopefully with us just playing
tomorrow, hopefully we can get a good crowd down here from Dayton, and I would
assume it is, only two and a half hours away, so hopefully we'll have a good
following. Like you said, our crowds really the last month have been
unbelievable, which hopefully that can carry over and to come down here. Last
year, too, a lot of Louisville fans stayed for our game, so it was a great
atmosphere here, and these guys love their basketball in this town, so I know
it's going to be full. Hopefully it'll be full of Louisville fans and then
Dayton fans, and hopefully Marquette doesn't travel as much so we can have a
full amount of red in here.  
  
Q. And then with the way Tiaera is really developing her rebounding,
what added dimensions does that give to the team's balance?  
SHAUNA GREEN: It's been huge, and last year she did it at a high level, and
this year she's been rebounding at an elite level. When you talk about her
being in the top four or five in the country of rebounding at 5'10", which I
just -- we just measured ourselves in the hallway, and I am taller than her.
I'm six feet, so she's under my size. It's amazing. What she does is amazing
at her height. It's really -- I've said it all year, but it's all part -- I
can't teach it. I wish I could sit here and say that we taught her it. We
didn't. She has an innate ability to pursue the ball, and she has an
unbelievable knack for just making a read. We need her to do that at an elite
level in order for us to win games, and we're going to need her to do that
tomorrow if we're going to win this game.  
  
Q. Obviously you were an assistant when the Flyers made that Elite 8
run. Can you talk about JaVonna and Jenna and their development from then to
where they are now?  
SHAUNA GREEN: Yeah, it's been night and day. I mean, it feels like longer than
four years. It feels like 40 years ago. But you know, Jenna was our starting
point guard as a freshman on that team, which is really remarkable, and for
how much she's grown on the floor, off the floor, as a basketball player, as a
human being, it's just been night and day. She was a little quiet kid that was
probably just in awe back then of even playing with Hoover and Ally and all
them and starting, and now she's taken this team, and it's her team, and she's
the heart and soul of our team. She still doesn't say that much, but she leads
by example, and she leads by how she comes out every single day.  
  
And then J didn't even play hardly at all her freshman year, so how she's
developed and now into these last two years being a really critical part of
our success has been absolutely amazing, and her growth, obviously, as a
player, but then I look at her growth as a person has just been -- I mean, we
laugh about it. You've got to laugh now because we weren't laughing at the
time. She's really grown into an unbelievable person. It's cool to have been
able to be here and see their growth, both of them, to this day.  
  
Q. You don't play a deep rotation, but how important will your bench be
in a game like this?  
SHAUNA GREEN: Yeah, you're right, and that's something that obviously we're
used to playing, 40 minutes a game with most of our starters, but this is
going to be at a whole 'nother pace, and defensively, as well. So our bench
and the couple people that will come off of the bench are going to be big.
They need to come in, they need to bring energy, they need to be solid
defensively, and they need to be able to manufacture some points. We don't
need them to be anything that they're not. We always talk about that, just add
some fire, add some energy, but do what you do and be who you are. But we need
a little bit of production in terms of offense, and then we need them to be
really, really solid in terms of taking care of the basketball and playing
defensively very solid.  
  
Q. Is there a benefit to being back here and playing in Louisville for
the second time in two years?  
SHAUNA GREEN: Yeah, I mean, I looked at it from the positive side of we know.
Everything is familiar to us. The arena, we've been here. We have the same
locker room, everything we're used to, and I think that that's definitely an
advantage. It's not something that we can bus down here, it's not like we've
got to get in a plane and fly. I think that definitely helps us.  
  
Last year us losing that game, they know, like I said, this is a veteran team,
and yes, we learned a lot, and I had told them two weeks ago after the A-10
Tournament, and we had planned on getting in, getting an at-large, we're happy
and we're very excited to be here, but we have business we want to take care
of. We're not just happy to be in it. We want to win a game, and all we focus
on is one day at a time, so we'll focus on the next game after that, but we
want to come here and get the job done and win this game tomorrow.

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Brittany McPhee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33295)

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford 90, Florida Gulf Coast 70  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm really proud of our team, how hard we played. You know,
we really came out and got off to a great start. Sputtered a little bit in the
second quarter and then came out and really had a great third and fourth
quarter.  
  
Alanna got us going, and Britt's defense -- Alanna's defense was, I thought,
phenomenal. She was on 32 basically the whole night, their leading scorer. I
thought she did a great job on defense. Britt's defense; contributions off the
bench, Dijonai coming in. I thought Maya Dodson had a big game for us.  
  
Just, you know, know what we're doing and working really hard out there. It
was really exciting. I'm really proud of our team, especially knowing where we
came from and we're going back to Lexington, I think for our third time in a
row. We love Lexington, so we're really excited to be going there.  
  
Q. Alanna, 13 points in that first quarter what got you going and what
was your mindset before the game?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think just having my teammates around me and knowing we all
had the same mind-set of just coming out and being aggressive.  
  
I think our coaches prepared us really well for this team, and along with like
Brittany and the rest of the starters, we just came out and we said to each
other that this is it; this is our last game at Maples and we need to show it.
I think we all did a really good job of doing that.  
  
Q. I can't imagine you've ever played in a game where the team that you
were playing against took 47 threes. Can you talk about the experience tonight
playing against this specific-type team?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, it was definitely different, and our coaches told us
before the game that, you know, they shoot the most threes, make the most
threes. So we knew that we needed to be out on them.  
  
But I think the biggest thing is we knew that they were going to make threes,
and that was okay, as long as they were taking hard threes and not wide-open
ones by their best shooters. So we were really well prepared and ready for it
I think.  
  
Q. With a team that hits that many threes, they got back in the game a
couple of times and got close. Did you have a sense that a team that hits that
many threes was going to be able to make a run at you pretty quickly?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think it's dangerous, if you're hitting threes, you can
get up nine point in three possessions. It's easy.  
  
So I think that was definitely, like Brittany said, something that we focused
on is not letting them get open shots. I think our team did a really good job
of shooting from three-point line, as well. I think we answered really well.  
  
Q. Tara mentioned a couple days ago that she spoke to you about the
thought that maybe this team isn't going to get to the NCAA Tournament and
then how, you know, things were not going well; you guys fell out of the
rankings and you were hurt for a while. Could you just take us through that
journey and that conversations with Tara and how far the team has come to be
back in this place?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, I mean, we did fall at the beginning of the season, but
we always in our minds knew that we could get it together and that we could be
a really good team that could make a deep run in the tournament.  
  
Even when we had our troubles, we stayed positive and that was kind of the
key. We didn't start to blame others. We didn't start to look other places. We
just said, hey, these are the things we are getting burned on when we play
games, so we need to fix these. It was never as desperate as our record and I
think falling out of the rankings makes it sound.  
  
I mean, it was just kind of like a conversation that was like, hey, we need to
kick it into gear, which we knew, but it was just an extra incentive.  
  
Q. When was that conversation with Tara?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: That was during a game.  
  
Q. When you talked about how obviously they make a lot of threes and
they also don't have a player that's six feet tall. Did you know going in this
could be an opportunity to really take advantage of size?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, obviously we did have a size advantage but I think that's
something that our team did a really good job of taking advantage of tonight.
Yeah, shout-out to Brit and the guards for passing it inside. Good job.  
  
But we all knew that they were a very aggressive, very scrappy, handsy team
and that we couldn't underestimate them even though that they don't have the
height.  
  
Q. You guys had 33 points in the first quarter and I think you maybe had
13 of those. Is that among the best quarters you've played this season and
what went into that?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, it would probably be up there. But I think just it's
that time of year, you know, where you have to treat every game -- it is every
game is possibly your last and I think for me, especially, I'm doing this for
my seniors, for Brittany and Kaylee, because I know this is their last game at
Maples and this is their last game to have a crack at it, so you have to give
it your all.  
  
That first quarter definitely showed that just heart that we have as a team.  
  
Q. Following up on what Brittany was talking about earlier with the
conversations that she had with Coach Vanderveer, when you were 6-6 and had
just lost to Western Illinois, how confident were you that you were going to
get to a situation where like right now, you're two games away from the Final
Four?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think just being the team that we were last year, we
experienced a lot of moments where we were down, and it was halftime and we
were down 17 and we could come back and win the game. I think that has been
instilled in ourselves and we're trying to pass that on to our freshmen right
now; that even if you are down, we had a bad start to the season, we did. We
were 6-6. But that doesn't mean that we can't finish strong.  
  
So we just kept that in our minds. We can't let the start of the season
determine what we're going to do.  
  
Q. Along those lines, did you hear Tara say that at halftime of
whichever game that was, or was that something she said to Brittany?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think that was a personal conversation with Brittany, but I
know that our seniors had a chat with us, as well, and just said, hey, like we
do need to kick it into gear. Like this is something that we don't want to
accept and that we need to do better.  
  
Yeah, I think it was a good conversations to have.  
  
Q. Tara has the philosophy of playing a tough tough schedule to get you
ready for March, and she said this might be the toughest one yet. Did it get
you ready for this?  
ALANNA SMITH: Oh, absolutely. We played some of the best teams in the nation.
Tara says it all the time: Every disappointment is a blessing, and right now
our blessings are coming to us I think, yeah.  
  
Q. For both athletes, as Coach mentioned, the third straight trip to
Lexington for the Sweet 16. I imagine you've had some pretty good experiences
there. When this came out and you saw the Lexington regional -- now that
you're here, are there things that you're looking forward to going back to
Lexington for?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I don't know if it's Lexington in general or just excited to
be in the Sweet 16 again. You know, we're very familiar with the court and
it's always a good time, but it's hard to know exactly like, oh, yes, like
Lexington. But it's funny, when it came out, we knew we were going to be in
there again because we've just been in there for so many times in a row. We're
excited to go there.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, Lexington holds a lot of nice memories for us, as well, so
it's just nice to be able to go back to remember what we did there and what we
achieved.  
  
Q. As you stepped off the court, did you have any lasting memories of
that court and a special moment to remember on that court?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, plenty. It was definitely weird to come off the court
and then when Kaylee came off the court, we really sat next to each other and
we're like, wow, this is it.  
  
But not one that stands out. Just a lot all together, like the little things,
like running through the tunnel last time or something like that.  
  
Q. People talk about Florida Gulf Coast and the three-point shot but
they have other weapons, but you have to be able to keep them out of the
paint, the points-in-the-paint margin and second-chance points, it was a
staggering margin. Can you talk about that and your efforts to keep them out
of the paint?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think they can hurt you with the three and if you come out
on them, then they can put it on the floor. I think that for the most part,
there were some times, especially with 22, China Dow, she hit some nice threes
on us; that was disappointing to see.  
  
I think for the most part, our team really worked hard to get out on the
three-point shooters, and credit Karl and their team. They are a very well
coached team. They move the ball really well. Like you said, there's no player
over six foot and they are scrappy. They knock down shots, and they are a
very, very well coached team.  
  
Our team had to work hard to beat them. You know, you can't take away
everything from a team like that. It's no fun to give up 17 threes, but you
know, they are that good of three-point shooters.  
  
I'm excited that we made nine out of 17. Like you said, our rebounding was
very good. You know, going inside to Alanna, they had some interesting match-
ups. They had really kind of a small player on Alanna and she just went to
town right in there.  
  
I think that jumping on them was a good thing, but then our team let up a
little bit and I was glad to see us come out of the second quarter and do
well.  
  
Q. It feels as if Alanna has really hit a stride here as you got to the
end of the Pac-12 and through the Pac-12 Tournament here. What is it that
she's doing that has her playing this well?  
TARA VANDERVEER: She kind of has a way of playing well in the Tournament.
Thank goodness for that. You know, she really had a great game tonight. I
mean, knocking down her three, finishing on the block. Her defense I thought
was fantastic. Holding their leading scorer to seven points, really focused.  
  
I'm excited for Alanna. Going into the regional with momentum. Like she said,
both Britt and Alanna played really well there, and we will need them to
again.  
  
Q. Playing Louisville, they are a fairly prominent national program and
you've never played them. What's your first impression of getting that
opportunity?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, we almost played them. We were supposed to play
them in the Columbus tournament. But the game that they scheduled was at 6:00
PM on a Sunday and we said we wouldn't play at 6:00 PM because we wouldn't get
home in time for school the next day. So they played Ohio State instead of us
playing them.  
  
So originally, they were on our schedule. So now it's just great to have them
back on the schedule. I've seen them in person. They were practicing in the
same place we were. They have a great team. They have a great fan base, the
Player of the Year, Asia Durr and the ACC. I've watched them play, and they
are very impressive.  
  
I'm going to choose to enjoy tonight, and then, you know, probably wake up
really early, like 4:00 in the morning, and I'll watch their video.  
  
Q. Which halftime was that game --  
TARA VANDERVEER: When we were playing at USF.  
  
Q. And did you figure that Brittany would pass along the message?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yes, I think she did. We had a great second half. We made 11
threes in that game. I just think sometimes with our team, sometimes you've
just got to shake it up a little bit or just give them a little like, hey,
guys, just because you got Stanford, doesn't mean anything's automatic. You've
got to earn it every day, and that was kind of the point of that. You've got
to come out and earn it.  
  
Again, I'm really proud. You know, I did the schedule. We didn't start out
trying to play Connecticut and try to play Baylor. It just happened that way.
It really was -- I think almost any other team would be throwing each other
under the bus, and I'm so proud of the leadership from Britt and Kaylee and
the upperclassmen to just keep playing hard.  
  
You know, there were games that I think we had opportunities to win. We went
into overtime with Ohio State the second time. It was a very close game with
Western Illinois. We didn't have a chance against Baylor. They really took it
to us. Connecticut really took it to us.  
  
I think there were some other opportunities that we had. Tennessee we had an
opportunity against them. And look where we are now, and Tennessee is not in
the Sweet 16. Ohio State is not in the Sweet 16. I think that that is a real
cohesiveness with this group and just improvement, people really working hard
every day, so I'm really proud of everyone.  
  
Q. Val Whiting (ph) got her 1990 championship ring back after 20 years
it had been lost, and this March Madness is extra special for her because of
that. Had you heard that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I had.  
  
Q. What does that mean to you?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think it's great that that means something to her.
You know, that that National Championship -- you know, when we lost in 1989 at
Louisiana Tech and they had Venus Lacy, I remember being on the bus saying to
Amy, "How are we ever going to beat this team?"  
  
And Amy said, "Val's coming near year." And we won the National Championship
the next year. I mean, Val is probably one of the best underrated players that
was a great player at Stanford. A lot of other people get a lot of attention
but she was the real deal and I'm really excited that she got her ring back.  
  
Q. You warned us about Florida's three-point prowess, but could you ever
fathom they would take nearly 50 threes?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, you know, I think they do. That's their game. They came
out with their tee shirt, raining threes. That's their game. And if you come
out on them, they will put it on the floor.  
  
I will say when you look at it, you know, 32 I think is better than a 1-for-7
three-point shooter. 42 we gambled off of and she didn't hit a three. We were
gambling off of 5 and she hit three in a row, so that plan's out the window.
So we had to guard her. You know, 22 we were trying to guard as hard as we
could and she still got threes. That's their game.  
  
Q. For the third year in a row, there are at least four Pac-12 teams in
the Sweet 16?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Isn't that awesome?  
  
Q. I wanted your thoughts on that and just what the conference is like
now.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that our conference has always been really strong,
and we have had great teams, and we have had great players that have not been
recognized. I just want to give a shoutout to Larry Scott and the Pac-12
Network and all the Pac-12 people that have gotten our game on television so
the rest of the country can see the great players that we have.  
  
You know, also, I think that then what happens is then you get better seeds.
If you went back historically, we have had, even in the Pac-10, we've had some
really great teams and great players that maybe everyone thought it was just
Stanford and nobody else, and that has -- I don't think that's ever been the
case. But now there's opportunities and people are taking advantage of it.  
  
Oregon has a great team. Hard he gone state getting into the Sweet 16, UCLA,
and also with six teams going and seven last year.  
  
The conference gets you ready for this. I think women's basketball is
representing in a really positive way and it's exciting.  
  
Q. Do you take any credit for that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that we've had great teams and we've had great
players. But you know, people maybe haven't known about them. I think it's the
Pac-12 Network that deserves the credit.  
  
You know, a lot of times, we're everyone's top rival, but now we've got a
great rivalry with Oregon and Oregon State. The teams, more than the top
teams, there are no -- I mean, the bottom teams are really good. So there's no
easy games. You know, I like some easy games. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You do?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I liked them in the past. We don't have them anymore.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about Kiana Williams and deservedly so, but what
about Dijonai?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I thought Di had a great game. She had three steals. You
know, she missed that first layup and she got it in the second half. She hit a
couple big threes for us, rebounds. Love her physicality. Someone that has
been great to work with. I think she's really improved.  
  
You know, it's different than high school. She was hurt in high school a lot,
but she's healthy and she's playing really, really well. You know, I'm not
allowed to have a favorite player, but if I did, she'd be right up there. I
love her energy and how hard she plays. Like she makes things happen.  
  
Q. You said there are no easy games now. Can you talk about the parity
across the board with some exciting upsets so far with Buffalo and Central
Michigan?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm not excited about Buffalo. We play them next year.  
  
No, it's great. I mean, the Tournament, Central Michigan is a former assistant
of mine. I'm really excited for them to win. I think they go to Spokane.  
  
Buffalo, actually a friend of mine is coaching there. I'm really excited for
her and their team.  
  
And Missouri getting upset, that was a big upset. Florida Gulf Coast did that.  
  
It's great. It's really exciting to see where women's basketball is going, and
again, I'm really proud to be a part of this journey.  
  
All right. I hope somebody's coming to Lexington. It will be fun. Thank you.

_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford 90, Florida Gulf Coast 70  
  
KARL SMESKO: I thought Stanford was excellent today. Their offensive ball
movement and efficiency and execution was outstanding. It was better than our
defense today.  
  
I thought a big part of the game was the first quarter. We had more defensive
breakdowns in the first quarter than we had the whole game against Missouri.
Can't really explain why. Just happened. And then you big that kind of a hole,
you're kind much pressing to get back in the game the entire time. You just
can't build that kind of hole against a team this good.  
  
But I was proud of our team's effort and that they kept competing, got it in
the fourth quarter and knocked it down to ten. But then give Stanford credit.
They answered with a big run as soon as we got it down to ten.  
  
Great effort by Stanford. They look like a team that has a real good chance of
getting to the Final Four, and they have been great to us here, everybody at
the University, and we really appreciate it.  
  
Q. China, you had a great performance at Stanford. I wanted to ask you
how much their height affected your team's play in this game?  
CHINA DOW: It affected us a lot as far as going to the lane. They was way
bigger than Mizou.  
  
So our drives wasn't opened, but we could have cut in penetration and do the
right things when they did come over. That's why we practiced and practiced.
But it was very effective. And what he said, you know, I wish I would have
grew overnight, but didn't work out that way. Their height was very effective.  
  
Q. You found your shot after halftime. How encouraging was that, and
also, what kind of looks were you getting in the first half?  
CHINA DOW: I mean, I had many open looks in the first half. It wasn't wasn't
falling. But if you know him, if you know our program; if you miss, just keep
shooting because that's what we're taught. Like don't just get down on
yourself. Just keep shooting. That's what I kept doing and fell in the second
half, so it worked out.  
  
Q. Is it too soon to look at 431 threes, and say, wow, that was pretty
special?  
CHINA DOW: If you take a look at my percentage last year, my percentage this
year is really amazing for me. You know, I was working on my shot over the
summer and it came through. So it's good.  
  
Q. Lisa, you guys kept coming back. What was the sense in the huddles
when there were time-outs called and stuff? What were you saying to each
other? There's never any quit but tonight was really impressive the way you
kept battling back against really tall odds.  
LISA ZDERADICKA: We knew if we lose, we're out. So we just knew we had to give
it our all and just try to keep fighting and make a run and try to cut it
closer.  
  
Q. Could you speak about the 431 threes? That was your team identity and
your hashtag and it's an NCAA record and kind of a special mark.  
LISA ZDERADICKA: Yeah, I mean, we work on our shot a lot, and all season, we
work on our threes and work hard to get open for good shots and we always try
to take the open shots. So that's just the way we play. We knocked a lot of
threes down this season, which helped us.  
  
Q. What were they doing on their offensive side and on your defensive
side that made it so troublesome for you guys to be able to get the rebounds?
They ended up with more offensive than you guys had defensive.  
KARL SMESKO: We weren't sending many people to the boards. That's why it was
frustrating in the first quarter when we were giving up shots in conversion.
That shouldn't happen when you have so many people back. So those were just
communication errors and really cost us.  
  
As for, you know, giving up so many offensive rebound, once you have defensive
breakdowns and you're in scramble mode, it's really hard to get your block-
outs. We had so many instances where, you know, we screwed up something we
were guarding and somebody would have to help, somebody would have to recover,
and meanwhile, you know, somebody's going to the backboard and getting a
second shot opportunity.  
  
So that was another area where you know, we knew we weren't going to win
boards, but we had to do a better job of holding them to like ten or 11
offensive rebounds instead of 16.  
  
Q. China, you're one of five very important seniors, perhaps most
important one, but all of them very, very important to this program. What was
the mood like in the locker room afterwards? Pretty emotional in there?  
CHINA DOW: Yeah, it was. You know, it's just playing for the last time,
playing your last senior game. I think Nazr gave us -- like she's going to
miss us and stuff, but it's more than just basketball when it comes to your
teammates. We're basically like family. I spend more time with them, basically
more than I spend time with my friends. Like they are my friends and family.  
  
So it's beyond basketball, so it was very emotional, and it's my last college
game. It's just like, dang, like if I could have another year, I'd take it,
even though it would ruffle him but it works out, we get along. But it's more
than basketball. It's very emotional. You have T-Grad, she's six years, so
it's very emotional for her. It's like, I'm going to miss them. We all like
just keep your head held high and regardless if any of them need anything from
me, I always got their back.  
  
Q. Obviously a huge size disadvantage tonight, but they are not just
tall. They are very, very skilled.  
KARL SMESKO: Yeah, they are a talented team. Smith had an amazing game against
us, her picking and popping and knocking down threes and being able to go
inside and post up. She was outstanding tonight.  
  
But they have got a lot of really talented players in there playing really
well right now. You know, we needed a day where instead of 9-of-17 from three,
they were 4-of-17 from three, and we didn't get it. When we gave up an open
shot or gave up something from three, they shot an amazing percentage for the
second game in a row.  
  
So they really got things rolling right now.  
  
Q. You played Ohio State earlier. Any comparisons?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, their size and athleticism are pretty similar, and the way
they get out in conversion, both teams are great out in conversion.  
  
So I mean, I think there's definitely some comparisons. I know the last time
they played, they went into overtime. It was a great game.  
  
I think Stanford has a real chance to move on and advance further in this
tournament. If they keep shooting the ball the way they shot it tonight, I
wouldn't bet against them.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford 82, Gonzaga 68  
  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: You know, we're really excited to be playing Monday
night, especially when you're playing at home. Want to congratulate Gonzaga on
a great season. They have an outstanding team, and we really had to work hard
to be sitting in this situation so that we're playing Monday night.  
  
You know, the two people to my left I thought really made some big plays for
us. I thought Alanna worked really hard defensively. As we know, Jill Barta is
an outstanding player and Alanna worked really hard against her, and then for
Kiana, for her first game in the NCAA Tournament, I think she looked very
comfortable out there. Knocked down big shots. Made big plays. Worked really
hard for us.  
  
And going forward, we're going to need everything they have got and more from
their teammates playing against Florida Gulf Coast, they are a really
unorthodox team and we're going to be very challenged.  
  
But I'm very proud that we're moving on. You know, obviously everyone knows,
we lost last year to this team, and I think our team took it very personally.
We had to work hard, but I thought we had a really good game.  
  
Q. As we said, first year, big moment, tournament, five threes, 50
percent from the field. What's going through your mind and what do you have in
your veins?  
KIANA WILLIAM: I'm just excited to be playing with my teammates, excited that
we're hosting and that we get two more home games for our seniors. I was just
out there having fun with my team and just executed our game plan and knocked
down shots.  
  
Q. When you see Kiana setting up for a three at this point, are you
thinking, well, that's good? She has hit 27-of-44 over the last month. What is
it like for you watching her?  
ALANNA SMITH: I'm just really happy and just almost proud to see Kiana just
flourishing right now. I think she's an amazing player and I'm so excited for
her future.  
  
Just touching on the threes, when Kiana puts it up, you're assuming it's going
to go in. But obviously as a post player, and as our team mantra is to
rebound, so I'm going to go in and rebound it anyway. But when Ki puts it up,
I'm assuming it's going in?  
  
Q. What was it like facing Barta? There was a stretch at the end of the
third quarter, I think you folks were up by eight or something like that. You
hit a three, then you threw a charge from Jill, and then Kiana and Nadia hit
threes, so that seemed like a pretty big stretch in this game. First of all,
what was it like placing Jill Barta, and what about that particular
sequence?  
ALANNA SMITH: Obviously she's a very talented player and she played extremely
well this game, and has played extremely well in the past. We knew that she
was going to be a threat to us.  
  
So we worked really hard in the past week. I think a shout-out to our practice
players and the scout team; they helped us immensely for this game. We just
had to be ready, and knowing that she's aggressive and knowing what shots she
likes to take.  
  
In that just stretch of time, I think it was just about trusting your
teammates; trusting that your teammate is going to hit an open shot. I think
that's what we do really well is that we trust each other.  
  
Q. You said yesterday it was really about energy and aggressiveness. Can
you just talk about the way the whole team kind of answered that bell, and
then can you talk about Dijonai's contribution tonight?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think just every game that we play, we talk about our
mindset beforehand, and Tara really tries to instill in us that we have to be
aggressive and we have to be more aggressive than the other team that we play.  
  
So having someone like Dijonai, who you know every time she's playing, she's
going to come out and give a 110 percent. She's like leader of the aggressive
club, we like to call.  
  
So you know you can rely on Dijonai to be there and give energy, and so she's
one of the leaders in the team in that department I think, and we're really
lucky to have someone like that.  
  
Q. How much did it mean for you guys to start pushing the pace early and
really get out in transition and establish that for the course of the game?
Because they were in here earlier and said they couldn't get stops and it
deflated them?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: We like to push the pace to get the ball down the floor
quickly. Everything in our offense, we have to do it with pace, so that's just
what we've been doing all season.  
  
Q. Tara just said that she thought you looked comfortable. Were you
comfortable, and did you have any of the freshman, first game in the
tournament nerves?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: No, my teammates, they have so much confidence in me. It's
hard to like just think about what I'm doing. I just go out there and play my
game, and our seniors and upperclassmen, they are telling me to stay
aggressive and keep playing my game, so that's what I do.  
  
Q. Do you talk to Daejon at all? Both you guys are doing tremendous as
freshmen.  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Yes, I talk to them when I see them, like either at dinner or
breakfast and I'm in a class with him, so yes, we are really close -- not too
close. (Laughter)?  
  
Q. There was a stretch in the first half and into the second when you
were having people in foul trouble. Marta first, and then Kaylee and Dijonai.
Seemed like -- was the game being called too close or was it just were you
guys were making fouls that you shouldn't have?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: I think I need to move on to another question.  
  
Q. Would you like to call your attorney first?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, I just think we have to move our feet and do a
better job defensively. You know, I don't know, I just -- I didn't -- we
didn't see the same thing sometimes. But you know, for us, we can't be fouling
and getting people in foul trouble. You have to adjust to that.  
  
You know, I don't think the officials make you throw the ball away as much as
we threw the ball away. So we've got to do a better job. We talked about that
at halftime: Take care of the ball, move our feet defensively, not be putting
them at the free throw line. They are excellent free throw shooters. Just kind
of do a better job running our offense.  
  
Q. You're going to be facing a Florida Gulf Coast team that doesn't have
anybody over 5-11, and you've played -- you lost to a Western Illinois team
that was pretty small, too. I don't know if they were any bigger than these
folks. What is the big challenge as you see it when you face Gulf Coast?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Well, you know, they put it right on their shirt: They
shoot 3s. We might have somebody that's made -- Kiana, how many 3s has she
made totally for the whole season? 45? Maybe 50? I mean, I don't know the
exact number. John would probably know.  
  
They have players on their team that have made 88,70, 59. They make the most
3s. They are a very proficient offensive team, whether it's shooting 3s or
getting the ball out of the basket and shooting layups. So it's more about
their skillset I think than their size.  
  
We kind of just -- I thought they were a gritty team. You know, Missouri is a
great team and very physical and very big, and they don't back down.  
  
We're going to have our work cut out for us. I'm very confident that Kate Paye
will be scouting and she will have a good game plan for people. Our team
really works very hard this week to be ready to play Gonzaga. I know it's a
quick turnaround, but they really pride themselves on knowing what the game
plan is and coming out and working as hard as they can to make it a good game
plan.  
  
Against Florida Gulf Coast, you've got to take care of the ball. They force a
lot of turnovers and they don't turn it over. You know you've got to guard
people at the three-point line. You can't give them layups. They had one play
where they are going in for a layup and she tosses out for the three.  
  
The thing I hope is that Steve Kerr will take a couple of those shooters and
have them play for the Warriors on Monday against us because their three-point
shooting is exceptional. They are really -- it's going to be a very tough
challenge for us.  
  
Q. Brittany didn't have the greatest shooting day but 11 points, 11
boards, six assists, two steals. That was quite a performance.  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I thought she had some really nice looks that
just didn't go down for her, like on the out-of-bounds play, she came off her
back and had a layup. I think Britt tried so hard to just win the game. You
know, maybe her shot wasn't going in, but she found other things to do. Her
rebounding was great.  
  
I think rebounding was a real key for us. You know, getting the 17-0 boards,
getting 42 boards; that might have been the difference for us right there. You
know, shooting -- different people shooting a good percentage.  
  
But Britt, I know that Britt's a great scorer and it was great for her to do
other things in this game. Her defense, she didn't get in foul trouble; her
rebounding, her leadership, were all good.  
  
Q. Don't get really mad at me for asking you this question. Have you
reached out to Tony Bennett and what was your reaction to that?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I didn't know. I got a text actually from
Janey.  
  
You know, I watched the game, and you know, I was sad for him, because -- you
know, in basketball now, first of all, seeding is not a science. Who knows,
the seeding. And sometimes you just don't have a good matchup.  
  
I just feel like as much as it hurt last night, probably today when they woke
up, it was even worse. They had an exceptional year, and they have everything
to be proud of. I just feel like I'm in really good company. I think he's a
great coach.  
  
Q. Is it sort of a relief or nice to have that company --  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: No, not at all. I was rooting for them -- you know,
he's from the Pac-12 back then, and I think he's an absolute class guy. You
know, sometimes you can't control everything.  
  
They had an injury, and I know our situation I think was different than that
in that it was -- the injuries that we had, we weren't a No. 1 seed at the
time that we were selected as 1.  
  
You know, it taught me an important lesson. I think he'll learn from it in a
good way and so will the guys on the team.  
  
The thing that really I took away from it was, you know, all year they are
talking about No. 1 seed, March Madness, No. 1. Enjoy each day. I mean, I'm
excited for our team today to beat Gonzaga.  
  
And yes we're getting ready for Florida Gulf Coast and we'll have a lot of
work to do. But enjoy each day. You don't know when someone is going to get
hurt. You don't know when you're going to get run up against a buzzsaw of a
team like they did. It's something that he'll be stronger because of it, and
so will his team.  
  
We'll see everybody either tomorrow or Monday. Thanks for coming.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [China Dow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33185)

### [Erica Nelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35144)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Florida Gulf Coast 80, Missouri 70  
  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Obviously a great win for our program and a great effort by
every kid we had that got on the floor. They all contributed in a big way to
this success at different points during the game and I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. Erica, thought you played an outstanding game today. I thought the
defense was the best I've seen it all season. Would you agree with that?  
ERICA NELSON: Yeah, throughout the game, we knew what player that they were
going to emphasize, and we tried to just focus on that, and then she did an
amazing job tonight but we took everything else away from them. So when you
focus in on one player and nobody else is scoring, and all five of us were,
it's hard to beat us.  
  
Q. You were able to dominate the team in the paint somewhat and stay
even on the boards. Don't have a single six-footer on your team and they have
quite a few. How were you able to do that today?  
CHINA DOW: I think with their post players being in foul trouble, they really
couldn't jump because it's risky. So if you're going in, at first they was
blocking shots because they wasn't in foul trouble. But once they did get in
foul trouble, we was able to attack the basket, and they softened up on
defense, so it worked out for the best and we was just finishing. We knew they
was going to go on runs, but like we just tried our best to stick with it and
stay in the game.  
  
Q. This was a 12-seed beating a 5-seed but didn't really look like an
upset to me. Did you feel confident coming in? Did you feel like this was an
upset today?  
CHINA DOW: No, because at the end of the day we do belong here. We're just
putting our name on the map to let people know we are not just a soft, mid
major team. We can compete with the best of the best. It was a big win for us.
Missouri is a good team but we pulled out the win.  
  
Q. Coming out of media time-outs, you're over on the sideline riling up
the fans, 4,000 miles away from Fort Myers.  
CHINA DOW: It means a lot. Our fans is a big part of our program, and they get
us going, so if you want to stay in the game, you keep our fans going; I don't
care how many fans other people have. Our fans always make noise, so shout out
to them for making their way down to Cali and we can just have fun and enjoy
the California weather for a couple more days.  
  
Q. This didn't look much like an upset. I know you're not super pleased
when you get a 12-, 13-, 14-seeding. But do you look at this as an upset? Or
do you feel like the quickness and the sets you run would be able to off set
what Missouri likes to do, as well as what you were able to do today?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Well, it's an upset in terms of seeding, but we definitely
came in with the mindset that this was a game we can win if we executed at a
high level.  
  
A big thing that we emphasized was the last four times we've been here, we
performed well. But at the beginning of each game, there was like a sense of a
little bit of nervousness or tension, and we never got off to good starts
because I thought that's a little doubt, are we as good as the opponent.  
  
And so we made a real emphasis this time to let our team know, hey, you belong
here; you're just as good. It's going to be whoever plays better today.  
  
And this was the first time that from the jump ball, I thought we were all in
and believed that we could get it done.  
  
Q. Due to foul trouble and a lot of other things, you ended up having to
use a lot of different players matched up on Cunningham, and it looks like
towards the end you settled on China. What did you like about that matchup?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Well, that was actually Coach Lyles's idea. You know, we
had Rose on her and Rose was making her work. She was hurting us with post-ups
for a while, we were guarding her well on the perimeter but we were slow to
help on the post.  
  
So we actually, I put tie on her for a little bit but then tie got lost on a
screen and we gave up the three to her. So that was Coach Lyles said, hey, I
think we need to put China on her. I was a little concerned because China
fouls a lot and I didn't want to have to put China on the bench; and, it's a
lot of effort to be chasing Cunningham around and then guarding her in the
post. You've got to be the first one back because she runs out in transition.  
  
But all the credit for that goes to Coach Lyles. I definitely wasn't leaning
in that direction but China did a great job on her. You know, really helped
limit her scoring down the stretch.  
  
Q. I thought the two keys in this thing were, one, turnovers, just nine
for the game and they had 16. You were really able to hang on the boards
today. I thought those two things were key. If you can expand on that.  
COACH KARL SMESKO: That's always the biggest key is you have to try to find a
way to win possessions, and the possessions are how many offensive rebounds
and how many turnovers you have.  
  
So we know we're at a disadvantage rebounding, so all five of our players have
to be contributing on those defensive boards on every shot, and they all know
that that's their responsibility.  
  
And then we have to be better with the ball than the other team, because if we
are going to give up a few more offensive rebounds, we can't also have a few
more turnovers and expect to be successful.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sophia Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35145)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Florida Gulf Coast 80, Missouri 70  
  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Just like to congratulate FGCU. Coach has done a
phenomenal job there. They have got a great program. That's a really talented
team.  
  
Obviously this time of year is hard. That last game, you know, I felt like we
were really in a good place coming into the tournament. Really proud of our
seniors. They have impacted our program in so many ways on and off the court
and that's a tough class to say good-bye to.  
  
Obviously put them at the free throw line way too many times. We knew we had
to guard the three but we also knew they had the ability to really attack and
I felt like we just allowed too many direct line drives, put them at the free
throw line too many times and that came back to hurt us.  
  
Q. Seemed like turnovers were an issue for you guys in the first half.
Was it something they were doing defensively?  
SOPHIA CUNNINGHAM: No, very good defensive team. We just need to value the
ball more. They did push us out farther than we wanted to, credit to them but
we just have to value the ball more than we did.  
  
Q. Yesterday you had mentioned at the press conference, you mentioned
that the Florida Gulf Coast defense reminded you of a mini Georgia. In what
ways were the same and what ways did they present different challenges from
that defense?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Well, we got around our average. I think we are
averaging about 70 points a game but I think they are scrappy. They play hard.
They have got some good athletes. They are very physical.  
  
You know, I think it definitely hurt when you are starting four and five only
played 17 minutes each, and so they didn't play half a game, and I thought
really that could be where we could take advantage of some things with their
defense.  
  
And so I think it hurt us when we had to rotate and go a little bit deeper
into our bench. But give them credit. Very physical, scrappy, aggressive
defensive team.  
  
Q. Tough immediately after a loss but what do you think you're able to
do that's most effective today?  
SOPHIA CUNNINGHAM: I just had the size advantage down low and my teammates
were getting me the ball when I needed it, and when they collapsed, I gave it
right back out to them. I just think the size advantage is what allowed me to
get those easy points.  
  
Q. You maybe alluded to this with the foul trouble that your post had,
they are known for taking a lot of three-pointers, and you shot seven more
than they did. Is that just the way the game went or just sort of the plan
going in?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: I think there was probably a handful of those were late-
game threes, so I think that's a little bit, when you just look at the box
score, I think it's a little bit deceiving. Probably had five or six or seven
there at the end of the game.  
  
But we talked about what a great 3-point shooting team they were. I thought we
did a great job of that part of it for the most part. But the problem was, you
know, just that one-on-one direct line defense.  
  
And they are a team that if you give much help off of, you're going to be in a
tough situation, and that's where they get their good looks from the three-
point line transition threes, dribble, penetrate and kick; and we just said we
were going to try to make them finish tough one-on-one at the rim, and that's
where we got into a lot of foul trouble.  
  
Q. It looked like a lot of Sophia's success in the post, especially,
happened from the second quarter on. Was emphasizing Sophia in the post always
a plan going in or was that an adjustment that was made?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Well, we had to rotate some players because we had our
starting four and starting five out with foul troubles early, really
consistently throughout the game.  
  
So we moved both her and Amber around a little bit from that perimeter
position to a post position, and it's something that we try to take advantage
of regardless of what lineup's out there, but any time we can get a mismatch
within our motion offense, to really look to get the ball inside.  
  
But they made it tougher to catch. We had some forced passes inside to her. A
couple times she caught and was swarmed, three or four defenders and made the
kick outs tough. She's one heck of a player. I'm glad she's on our team.  
  
Q. Tough immediately following the loss but how would you put into
perspective the season you've had this year?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I think in the moment, it's just hard and all's
you can think about is how disappointed you are, and I think we are all in
that. But time helps and helps gain a better perspective.  
  
It's been one heck of a year. I mean, all year long, we've been in that top
20. We were in conversations about hosting. You know, we've done some things
here this season that haven't been done at Mizou in a long time, but we also
have really high expectations.  
  
I think to a certain extent, we feel like we fell short of those. We want to
be a team that's competing. We felt like the next step for our program would
be a Sweet 16 team, and then you hope to get to the he Elite 8, a final four
and win a championship.  
  
It's just such a process, and we continue to build and grow. It's just that as
you have more and more success, your expectations become higher and higher,
and that's good. I wouldn't want it any other way.  
  
So initially, the finality of it is really challenging. I think with time and
perspective, we'll be able to embrace the season that we had. We had some
incredible seniors on this team. We're going to miss them. We're going to miss
them a lot, their leadership on and off the court. It's been a really good
year. It's just hard to focus on that immediately after your Final loss.  
  
Q. Kind of along those lines, what's the message you have to the younger
players on your team? You talked about the strong senior leadership. What are
you going to say to the players that they are going to have to step up to fill
a leadership void soon?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Well, first of all, thanks for coming out. We appreciate
you being out here.  
  
We absolutely have work to do. We've got -- we're losing some really good
players and great leaders, and you know, I think this is going to be a big
off-season for us; that we've got an opportunity to focus on some areas that I
think were glaring weaknesses for us this year and some things we need to
address that way.  
  
But you know, our girls work really hard. It's an incredible group. I love
them to death. I'm very thankful I have an opportunity to coach them. They
work hard. They do things the right way. It's a special group, and I know they
will be just as anxious as I am after we take a moment to exhale and catch our
breath to get back off it and focus on some of those areas that we can be
better and stronger moving forward.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Lisa Fortier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35120)

### [Jessie Loera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35151)

### [Emma Statch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35152)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford 82, Gonzaga 68  
  
COACH LISA FORTIER: Stanford was too tough for us to stop on the glass today.
Unfortunately that was a big key for us, and our players played hard, they
always do. We were gritty. We fought till the end.  
  
I thought, at times, we did enough offensively and executed well enough, but
they had too many second chance points and too many rebounds, coupled with --
specifically offensive rebound, coupled with our inability to really get on
the glass. It's a good team. They really know their role, it's just the same
stuff with talked about yesterday: They know their role and they fulfilled it
to their highest ability, and today we couldn't overcome that with our
defensive efforts on those personnel collectively.  
  
Q. How difficult was it the way they were able to get out in transition
and really push the pace? Kiana in her NCAA debut had a really impressive
day.  
EMMA STACH: They just wanted to push in transition. They made us -- tough in
the first couple minutes and especially just like throughout the whole game.
We couldn't just like get stops. It was just like back and forth. So we
scored, they scored, but yeah, we knew that she's a great player. She can
shoot it. She can drive it.  
  
So yeah, just like we struggled and just like playing defense, it's just like,
yeah, play defense, whole court, especially.  
  
COACH LISA FORTIER: I'd just add to that one; that the rest of their team did
such a great job of transitioning that our safety is stuck inside a little bit
so that opened up the perimeter. I think she had three in the first quarter it
seemed like; maybe it was just the first half. So when the rest of them run
the floor, these guys are recipients of that sometimes. They run the floor so
hard that someone else receives the efforts of that.  
  
Q. For both players, was it surprising to see some of their bigs hitting
from three, and how frustrating was that?  
EMMA STACH: Yeah, just kind of what Lisa was saying, it's difficult when the
drivers can just like penetrate in the middle and just like it opens up
everything and then -- Smith can shoot it, or, you know, like all, some of the
other players can shoot it from the outside. It's just difficult to defend
when you're just like not keeping them out of the paint. So I think, yeah, we
struggled a little bit, just like keeping them out of there.  
  
Q. For Jessie, you provided a big spark in the first half. What was the
feeling at halftime?  
JESSIE LOERA: I think knowing how hard we came out and how hard we were
playing, we were all thinking we've got to keep it upcoming into the second
half.  
  
I mean, we're all feeling great and confident as our comeback was coming into
the second half. I mean, Lisa said they did start rebounding a lot more and
that's what made it a lot tougher. But that second half -- that first half is
what really kind of got us going at first.  
  
Q. Emma, what's the feeling like, your final game? It's been quite a
career for you, nothing but postseason appearance for you. What's your thought
right now?  
EMMA STACH: First of all, just like being super grateful that I got the
opportunity to play here, you know, just like play in the NCAA Tournament. Not
everyone gets to do that.  
  
Yeah, just like looking back, I think we had a great season. We did even stuff
that like other teams before us didn't do. So just like right now, it hurts
really but I think just like in a couple days realizing what we did this year
is going to be good, just like looking back. But yeah, right now, it hurts.  
  
Q. Near the end of the third quarter, there was a sequence where they
hit three, I think it was like an eight-point game or something like that.
They hit three 3s and Smith took a charge from Barta. How important was that
sequence in this game?  
COACH LISA FORTIER: You know, I don't remember that exact sequence. I felt
like there were several stretches where we would have a great offensive play
and then we didn't get a stop on the other end. They beat us in the percentage
game.  
  
We talk a lot with our team about percentage-and-possession game, so they
either make a big bucket to counter what we had just done or get a great
offensive rebound or something like that. I can think of a couple of those
opportunities in the first half where we kind of do something good and then
they have an answer. You know, that's how teams like this play.  
  
So I would say probably that specific sequence, they make a couple buckets,
and then we're probably scoring, maybe not, and then that foul, I thought she
had an open player so she could have kicked too.  
  
But it's hard to keep your team, a bunch of teammates who are talented and
care about each other and competitive; it's hard to keep them realizing that
we have to take it one possession at a time and it's not all you or you or you
or you. It's going to take all of us in those kind of situations. That one,
Jill got the ball and she was going to score. Maybe one of those threes was on
her. Alanna hit a couple in that stretch.  
  
You know, not in a negative way but just those guys, they want it so bad that
they are trying to make something happen, and then often times, as we all
know, it's counterproductive.  
  
Q. When they have the ball -- is it a helpless feeling when their post
who shoots 27 percent from three is draining them? And did you guys feel a
little tentative when you were in 3-point shooting range?  
COACH LISA FORTIER: Well, I think first of all, she's a way better shooter
than her percentage indicates. I know that you know our team very well. We
liken her extremely close to Jill Barta. She really can shoot it. I know her
percentage doesn't show it but that was not -- the scout was not to leave her
open at three.  
  
I think Emma kind of nailed it where they are driving down the gut and we are
having a hard time keeping them out of the paint, and so you have to help and
then she pops out at a great time. I mean, matching offense, everybody in the
world backs off, that's how we defend that offense because of all the cutters
and most people don't put their unskilled player right there, and Stanford is
too smart for that. So everybody backs off, back off, back off, and they pop
them right out there.  
  
We adjusted to where we weren't backing off but the game plan was never really
to let her shoot threes. And I forget what your second question was -- oh, on
our side.  
  
I don't think there should have been. One of the things in the film, when you
watch Stanford play, they get a high hand every time. And so I think, I don't
know that we were tentative, I don't think we had open threes, really. There
were a couple times I thought Stach maybe could have shot one. She's been
shooting the ball so well for us.  
  
But Barta got some off that looked pretty good. Chan know had a couple that
looked good. Jessie, my thing with her sometimes is her footwork. But we don't
shoot a ton of them. So 17 is probably about right if we had only made five. I
wouldn't want to -- shot many more. Maybe we were a little tentative but I
definitely think they were trying to make us think about it and not have any
catch-and-shoot.  
  
Q. Now that you've scouted and seen Stanford, where would you sort of
rank them as an improved team in this country?  
COACH LISA FORTIER: We were actually talking about that today. My husband and
I went for a run this morning, and I think it's a huge compliment and I hope
it's taken this way. We've said this about BYU, and I know a lot of people say
this about us: Stanford's teams are always, always, always better this time of
year than they are in the beginning. They get good players; don't get me
wrong. I know they have plenty of All-Americans and those kind of things, but
some teams get players that are just unbelievable and Stanford gets the right
ones, and then molds them into the team that they want to have, and you know,
has them understand their roles and play.  
  
I think that they are drastically improved from early. Again yesterday we
talked about how they had some injuries and stuff and getting healthy helps
that, but they just buy in and continue to improve. You know, I hope that
people think that about our team because that's a compliment that I'd love to
have and a group of teams that I'd love to be included in, as opposed to a
team that maybe gets all the best players or underperforms or something like
that. That's never going to be the case here.  
  
I remember a few years ago our guys in Stanford lost two games early that
people didn't think they should lose and everyone thoughts they were terrible,
and it's just laughable because they are just going to continue to get better
as they understand what their coaches are trying to get out of them.  
  
Q. Does getting stuck with the 13-seed instead of 12 sting after what
happened to Missouri?  
COACH LISA FORTIER: Yeah, I didn't see any of that game. I think that's the
difference is the home team versus the road team, and I'll be the first to
admit, we were that spot last year and we didn't capitalize on it.  
  
But it is different when you're playing a team at home. It's actually one of
the issues that I have with the way that it's bracketed. You know, we were
recipient of home-court advantage a few years before and we were always a low
seed, so I didn't think that it was enough to overcome the higher seeds we
were playing necessarily, but it does help you.  
  
You know, if you had asked me any day, play a bigger team or a whatever team
on the road -- or equal team on the road or home, of course you're going to
pick the team that's on the road.  
  
I know that Florida Gulf Coast does a great job, so again, not having seen any
of that, I don't know if it was because Missouri was on the road or not, and
who knows what's going to happen on Monday. But I would take the switch, just
not knowing much about Missouri just because again, I over-scout (ph).  
  
Q. Both Jenn and Jessie got some pretty big runs today. How important
was them playing in a big time game like, this two players projected to be
long-term, important pieces?  
COACH LISA FORTIER: I think any time you can get your young players is good.
We said that last year; we had a couple of them, I don't remember who -- Laura
played, and Jill played, in the NCAA Tournament, and it was their first time
actually playing in the NCAA Tournament. Barta was on that team but was
redshirting that went to the Sweet 16 a few years ago.  
  
Any experience that they have been able to get all year long has been valuable
to us. They will have make an impact: We had Jill Townsend in at an important
team; we had LeeAnne in at important times. Hopefully that's something that we
can build on going forward and now they understand a little bit, and next time
we're in this situation, hopefully it will be a different outcome.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 16, 2018

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kaylee Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28443)

### [Brittany McPhee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33295)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all thanks for attending. We are thrilled to be
hosting the NCAA tournament and I am so proud of the two women to my left, as
seniors, as captains, they have had this incredible four year run at Stanford
and I know that they want to really, they will, you will see both of them lead
the way and I think just play exceptionally hard for us, for our team
tomorrow. It's bitter sweet in that to think of them, the journey that they
have been on from freshmen to seniors, to see their growth, I'm really excited
to have them here today and I'm so proud of them and so excited to see what we
can do in this tournament and just our whole team I think has been working
very hard and improving a lot and we know we have to play very well to have a
deep run, but I feel a little emotional sitting up here with both of them
because they I just can see them as high school players and now they're right
here as senior leaders. It's really something special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. This particular season, this particular group of kids that you have,
where you are today going into the tournament from where you started, can you
just take us through how you feel about this growth.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that there's been a couple of story lines, I think
first of all this is a very young team in a lot of ways, even our juniors were
not starters or they didn't play very much and our sophomores, so when we
first of all we introduced a new offense, we played arguably the toughest
schedule that Stanford has ever played, and it wasn't by design, it just
happened. Teams dropped us in the summer, and Baylor calls, I'm like, okay, we
either play no one or we play Baylor. And then on top of that, Brit got hurt
and when you have a senior leader, that's, so every, the deck was really
stacked against our team and so we obviously had -- and we will, I think we
didn't always, we weren't consistent. When we got Brit back and we hit the
PAC-12, I think we kind of just found our footing. We were able to get some
traction with big wins against UCLA and USC, Arizona State when we got them
back here and we were the only team in the PAC-12 to go undefeated at home, we
were the only team in the PAC-12 to beat everyone else, and again I'm
exceedingly proud of Kaylee and Brit for their leadership, their resilience,
to kind of to be sitting here today is a little bit surreal, honestly. There
were points in this season where I told them to, I said we might not even be
playing in the NCAA tournament and to be hosting and one of the other things
that is really I think relevant to this particular field is three of these
four teams were in the same tournament in Vegas. I don't know if you know
that, but ourselves, Gonzaga and Florida Gulf Coast were all in the same
tournament and when I saw Karl this morning he said, Tara, your team has
improved so much. And that to me is the ultimate compliment that -- and again
you don't improve unless people work really hard, they have a lot of
confidence and determination and again I think just great senior leadership
with these two.  
  
Q. How much does Gonzaga look different from the last meeting against
this team was on your floor and how much does that motivate -- I know it's
been some time in between -- but you know each other pretty well, these two
teams.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Lisa does a fabulous job. Gonzaga has an excellent team.
They're a different team and we're a different team. We know that we have to
play well and I think that they probably know the same thing, but we have
worked very hard this week just we focus on who we're going to play in terms
of scouting but what I tell our team is it's really about us. We need
Stanford's A game and in order to have a deep run, whether it was in the
PAC-12 tournament or in the PAC-12 or whatever we need a great effort and
great focus from our players and our team. I've seen that from, especially
from our seniors, they want to keep it going. At least it feels that way to
me. They love playing, they love playing for Stanford, we have a very close
team, and we know that I think in some ways the last, having lost to Gonzaga
there are some situations where I think some teams -- they look at the seed
and they just assume a better seed is -- the seed is going to take care of the
game. And it's not. Our team knows that we have to play well and I don't have
to remind them of that.  
  
Q. For both of you, as we were just talking about, how quickly did you
guys think about the last time you faced Gonzaga when on the show it popped up
that you guys were going to face them?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: It wasn't a big shock, but we definitely think about it and
we watch clips from last year where they burned us. But we just know that
we're a completely different team, they're a completely different team and
that we both have to show up and be ready to play.  
  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Yeah, just going off of what Brittany said, we know they want
to come in, they want to beat us. We know what we want to do. And at this
point it doesn't really matter who you're playing, what the seeding is, what's
going to matter is how you're going to go out there and perform that night
when the time comes.  
  
Q. Brittany, you, are you Irish? McPhee?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Oh. A little bit, yeah, back a ways, yes.  
  
Q. So do you feel lucky tomorrow?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yes.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Brit, you did not have the best PAC-12 tournament and we were told
that you were not at top health. Was that true and if so how much did it
hamper your game?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, I had a cold, but everybody's always facing something,
so I just thought Kiana stepped up really well and we were able to play even
though I wasn't the one scoring, which is fine with me, as long as we're
winning. So, yeah, I was sick, but like there's probably a hundred people in
the NCAA tournament who have some sort of either illness or injury that's
hurting them too, so that's not an excuse.  
  
Q. Kaylee, you're going to run up against Jill Barta in this game. Does
she remind you of anybody in the PAC-12 and what do you think of the challenge
of facing her?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Well, she's obviously a great post player, she's got an
outside shot. We have seen players like that and it was almost like good
practice playing against players with a good outside shot, good post moves
inside. But I'm excited, I'm excited to play her, I know a lot of other post
players, even like other people are excited to play her and defend her. We
know it's going to be a challenge but looking forward to stepping up to it.  
  
Q. Considering that the men are all, the PAC-12 teams are all gone from
the men's bracket, considering that the football bowl situation was terrible
for the PAC-12, do you feel any added pressure on you and Oregon and UCLA and
the rest of the women's teams to have a really good showing in this
tournament?  
TARA VANDERVEER: No. We just want to have a good showing for us.  
  
Q. Brit, you mentioned Kiana stepping up in the PAC-12 tournament. As a
fellow guard, someone who also can kind of sympathize with what a freshman's
going through this time of year, what has stood out to you about her
development and where she is right now mentally and physically?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: She's just such just a person who loves the game of
basketball and just loves to be out there playing. So it really shows. And as
long as you're having fun and excited to play, then everything else kind of
falls into place. It's when you start thinking about the negatives that you
get into trouble. But she's not like that because she loves the game so much.  
  
Q. Kaylee, in the week that you had between the PAC-12 championship game
and the Selection Show what was the thoughts about the fact that you might not
be hosting and then what were the thoughts when it was announced that you guys
were hosting and you would get to play one, maybe two more games here at
Maples?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: We were obviously disappointed with the outcome of the PAC-12
tournament. It never feels good to have two weeks off like from a loss, you're
kind of stuck with that feeling. But it helps us, just kind of it lights a
fire inside of us to just want to get back on the court. It was really eye
opening, realizing that you can't just have that many more mess ups and try
again, you only get one chance. So after the game we knew at that point things
were out of our hands, we were going to see if we were hosting, whether we
weren't, technically, we didn't even know if we were in the tournament. So
we're just looking forward to it and regardless of where we're going to be we
knew what it was going to take to accomplish what we want to.  
  
Q. How key has the development of Marta been handling the ball and to
your team's success this year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think Marta's been really key, not just handling the ball,
her scoring, her defense, her court leadership. She's a competitor and you
don't ever want to put pressure on one player and say, well how so and so
goes, the team goes. But when she plays well, we obviously play a lot better.
Thankfully I think that we can give her arrest with playing Kiana at the point
and we have been able to play a lot of players this year, which is, I think,
been great for us. But her playing has really, there have been, she's had some
absolutely brilliant games where we don't win the game without her doing what
she has done. We're going to need her to have a great game for us to go deep
in this tournament.  
  
Q. Kaylee, can you talk about the time since the Oregon game and was
there anything from that game that has kind of informed your guys' prep as you
practiced since then?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Yeah, after that game we obviously watched a lot of video on
that, we just saw things that we knew that we just couldn't walk out on the
court with again, just kind of lack of effort, lack of focus. Something the
coaches I think have been great with emphasizing is how you practice is how
you're going to play, you can't just show up to play and all of a sudden do
everything right, you have to practice that way. So I think that's something
we really try to bring in, into the practice with us these past two weeks
really bringing concentration and focus and then giving everything you have on
every play, because that's what's going to matter and that's what's going to
show come game day.  
  
Q. Lisa has talked about your influence on her and on other young
coaches and being such a positive role model. How would you respond to that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: That's a tremendous compliment. I think that Lisa's done a
great job at Gonzaga. Having, obviously, been coaching a long time, I do want
to be a good role model for our young coaches and I want to set a good example
and hopefully I try to do that, but when it comes down to it, I would like to
see the mentor win.  
  
Q. Brit, you've talked in the past about kind of pushing the thought of
taking the uniform off for the last timeout of your head. I'm wondering, how
is that, where is that fitting with you now as you get ready to make this
tournament run?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: I think it's still the same because I mean if you're going
into the game thinking oh my gosh this is going to be the last time, like
that's not a good attitude. I'm just excited and grateful for each extra game
we get because there's a lot of seniors who don't get to put on the uniform
again. So just want to soak up every minute and just have as much fun and just
give it all.  
  
Q. Brit, obviously I'm sure you're aware but your dad and Laura
Stockton's dad also played together back in college, but I mean, what's the
relationship like with Laura, do you know her and what's that like?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, I don't know her well, we grew up playing against each
other a lot and then I've met like all the Stocktons, but it's just always a
battle because she's such a great competitor and our parents know each other,
but I don't think there's any extra fuel that needs to be added to this game
because any sort of NCAA game should be enough incentive to play hard.  
  
Q. I don't recall a 3 p.m. tip off in the past, do you? For a NCAA
tournament game. Coach?  
TARA VANDERVEER: We play when they tell us to play. I don't remember it, it's
just, let's come out -- I think it's great on, hopefully, a rainy Saturday
afternoon, what would be a better thing to do? Come and watch the game. So
it's a great time to play. We're very excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach.  
  
KARL SMESKO: We're just really excited to be part of this, to be here at
Stanford, what a great university and a place known for women's basketball and
for us to be a part of it is a big thrill for all of us. We feel like we have
earned our spot to be here and we're going to prepare to compete at the
highest level we can compete at and we know we play a great team and we're
looking forward to the challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sophie said that in trying to think of a team that maybe compares to
you guys they played maybe a mini Georgia. Does Missouri remind you of anybody
you guys have played?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, they have different styles offensively and defensively, but
offensively they execute at a real high level, they're maybe a lot like a
DePaul. They can shoot the 3 and still score inside. Defensively, they're very
physical, even though they don't play as many passing lanes, so they're maybe
a little bit more like Jacksonville in terms of they're not afraid to bump you
a little bit when you cut and they're not afraid of contact. So those will be
a couple combination of teams that might fit the style a little bit.  
  
Q. Obviously Missouri's probably not the first team you guys have played
this season that is a bigger team than you are, how have you had success going
up against teams that have height, especially multiple six footers and
above?  
KARL SMESKO: Well we have to be willing to be physical and we have to be
willing to help one another. We got to have all five people competing on the
defensive glass, looking for somebody to block out and controlling that block
out as long as possible and pursuing the ball. Obviously their posts are their
second and third leading scorers and they're both very good players. We're not
in a situation where we just go one-on-one, we need all five players doing
their job to make it difficult to get the ball inside and understand what our
game plan is to try and limit their opportunities.  
  
Q. Stanford hosts almost every year and sometimes there are women on the
team who have never been to California, so sometimes we ask that, I know it
seems a little silly, but what have you guys been able to do and have y'all
been here before and also what's it like to be playing at Stanford that has a
storied women's basketball tradition, as well as just athletics in general
here.  
ROSEMARIE JULIEN: I've been in California but not northern California so it's
a little bit different because it's colder. But it's a great experience being
here. It's a beautiful campus, a very big campus, we're not used to that
because we have a small campus, so it's a good experience playing in this gym.
It's big, nice, comfortable.  
  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I've also been to California, I've actually been to San
Francisco, but as far as what we're going to do today later this evening,
we're going to go down town San Francisco for lunch and stuff like that and I
know the team's really looking forward to it. Then obviously just playing in
this gym it's just a great opportunity, it's big, so I mean we hope that we
can win and do great things here and actually get a good crowd for everything
that's going to happen here, so I just think it's just an awesome opportunity
for us.  
  
CHINA DOW: I would just say that it's a good opportunity to be here and see,
we didn't get to see much and we'll get to see a lot later on, so I'm just
looking forward to seeing it later on.  
  
Q. Taylor, as proficient an of a three-point shooter as you are, for
your team and how many 3s you guys shoot as a team to beat a team like DePaul
and to win your conference championship game in games where you don't shoot as
many or maybe they try to take it away a little bit more, how does that kind
of show that you guys are still able to get your offense without necessarily
just firing away from deep as often as you guys do otherwise?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I like to think our team is pretty versatile. We have a lot
of girls that are very talented and they can shoot, they can also drive and
with that comes a defense where you have to take away the 3 and when you have
to take away the 3 you can't be as good at helping on drives and that, so I
think that the way our offense is set up, as long as we're high and wide and
we have space that our drivers can do their job to beat their person, even if
the 3 is not open as often.  
  
Q. Rosemarie, when this was announced the other night, didn't know a lot
about Missouri, but I think I showed you the stats for Sophie and you kind of
went, Wow. Now that you've had a chance to look at her, what do you think
about your matchup against her?  
ROSEMARIE JULIEN: To be honest, I don't think that that really has anything to
do with it. I'm very confident and I'll have a really good chance of wowing
everyone and showing them what our team is all about, so. Kudos to her, but
I'm ready for tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Have you met Tara Vanderveer previously?  
KARL SMESKO: I have previously. I'm pretty sure this is accurate, we played
them when she won her 900th game. I know she's over a thousand now, but that
was down in Mexico and she was very gracious and obviously she's a coaching
legend, a Hall of Famer, but I can tell you, meeting her again this morning
how courteous she was, she insisted on showing me all the facilities and
invited me up to the office. I had a practice plan to finish up, so I didn't
go there, but she was just really gracious and a great host and everything
that you ever hear about her.  
  
Q. China, y'all like playing these power five schools and taller kids
don't. Y'all get into it a little extra hard and what do you think about the
matchup?  
CHINA DOW: I think the matchup will be good. Like coach said, we need five
players locked in and helping each other because that's what it's going to
take to beat a team like this, because we are shorter. But at the same time we
do have fight in us, I think everybody sees that. So the more we fight and
push like we'll be okay, as long as we get help from other teammates. So we
play together and stay strong and we should pull out the win.  
  
Q. Sophie is such a good scorer, it's also the efficiency that kind of
tends to stand out to a lot of people that she's able to put up a lot of
points without necessarily taking the volume of shots that others around the
nation take. What are some of the things that you kind of noticed about her
that are going to be challenges for you guys defensively in terms of stopping
her?  
KARL SMESKO: One, she's really active and to be six-one and be able to shoot
the 3 so well with that kind of length is a challenge, but she's always
moving, she reads her screens, she's really smart, and as you said, she's a
willing passer, she's not the big time scorer that doesn't look to get other
people involved, she moves the ball. She's really good at drawing fouls and
initiating and getting contact and getting the call her way, so she's just a
smart player who is really talented and can score in a variety of ways. They
posted her up a lot this year as well, not just had her shoot 3s. And she
scores in conversion a lot too. So she finds different ways to keep putting
pressure on your defense.  
  
Q. You guys shoot more 3s than any other team in the country, put up
over 1,100 this year. What's your philosophy when it comes it 3-pointers and
how it fits into this offense?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, we definitely like to shoot 3s. We like to have as many
people on the floor as possible that can make them and we want to spread you
out and make you have to guard every inch of floor. I think we're pretty
selective in terms of we understand what a good 3 is and what a bad 3 is and
we just want to work together as a team to get a great shot. If it's a 3,
great, if it's a drive and get fouled, great. We just really are more
concerned about what our shot selection is and what our likely efficiency is
from that shot. That gets defined through the years and our players all know
immediately, was that a good shot or was that a bad shot.  
  
Q. With somebody who is as versatile and can kind of do it all like
Sophie can, is there kind of a comparable player that you've had to kind of
phase your game plan against in that regard?  
KARL SMESKO: Well we played some great players, we played some All-Americans,
we have gone against Mitchell at Ohio State, DePaul has some great players,
South Dakota State, the Miller kid is probably pretty similar to the
Cunningham kid. In terms of their versatility and being great shooters as
well. So we have faced really good players and Rose has always done an
outstanding job on teams' best player and players and we have other players
that when Rose needs a break that have been up to the challenge when called
upon this year. We understand it's a big challenge, but I feel confident in
our team that they're going to compete and they're going to at least make
things difficult, you're going to have to work for it.  
  
Q. Rosemarie, I heard that you might not follow the NBA all too closely,
but there's an NBA team here that loves to drop 3s as well and it's on your
bio that your favorite athlete is Steph Curry. What goes into that, I know,
you're not going to get a chance to catch the Warriors while you're out
here?  
ROSEMARIE JULIEN: I wish. No, I don't think I'll be going to catch it, but,
yes, Stephen Curry is my favorite. If his shot is not on he'll continue
shooting and that's what coach always tells me to do, because I'm a great
shooter and you have to believe in that and have the confidence and no matter
what big shots will be there for you to knock it down.  
  
Q. You said on flight over yesterday that the game plan was almost in.
How was practice last night, how do you feel going in, the game plan obviously
is firmly in at this point and how do you feel about the kids going in?  
KARL SMESKO: Well I feel like we have a plan and we know what we want to get
accomplished. I think practices have been really good. We have had everybody's
attention, they're excited about this opportunity and we all want to have a
great showing and we really, we want to win and move on and advance. And we
feel like we have a team that's capable of winning and we're looking forward
to trying to see how well we can play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

### [Jordan Frericks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30778)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for joining us. We are be joined by Jordan Frericks and
junior guard, Sophie Cunningham.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: We appreciate you guys being here, obviously a really exciting
time of the year. At this point in the season, with the NCAA Tournament, you
know, everyone has a new record and a clean slate. It's going to be very
competitive. I'm excited about the success of our team so far this season. I
love my girls. They worked really hard. We feel like we've continued to raise
the bar in regards to where we're at as a program and I had a little bit of a
tough stretch there at the end of our regular season. But I think the last
week and a half has been really, really good for our team and we're refreshed
and know that we're going to have a big challenge in front of us with Florida
Gulf Coast, great coach, great program. But we're looking forward to tipping
the ball tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Florida shoots a lot of threes, what's your
defensive mindset going into the game tomorrow?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Obviously, probably won't go into a lot of details about that
for obvious reasons. Watching them on film I'm so impressed. Coach has done
such a tremendous job with that program and I feel like we shoot the 3-ball a
lot and it fails to compare against how much they shoot it. They spread you
out, hard to guard. They have five kids that are interchangeable in the that
starting lineup and the kids coming off the bench do a great job, very
unselfish, great ball movement, great spacing on offense. It's a completely
different look than what we're used to defending, so it's definitely going to
be a challenge for us.  
  
Q. Sophie, when you shoot 47% of your threes, what is the opposition
generally doing to try to stop that? How do you counter what their moves
are?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: My teammates get me the ball when I need it. They set great
screens for me and I read my defense. But they're taking away the threes and
if they lapse on me I'm going to dish it off to a teammate that's going to be
wide open.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that Florida Gulf Coast, their style is
something you haven't seen. Are there any opponent that they do remind you of
or is this a new style for you?  
ROBIN PINGETON: There's a few teams I think we've faced. Not necessarily
within our conference, but over the years we've played some teams like a
Western Illinois, Indiana a little bit. They shoot quite a few threes. We've
faced some teams, but really I'm so impressed with their offense and their
spacing and their movement. Just high basketball IQ kids. Really do a great
job creating confusion for the defense and being able to take advantage of it.  
  
So it's definitely a unique style. Obviously they're ranked I think second in
the country in regards to three-pointers per game next to DePaul, 12 a game is
quite a few. So it's definitely a different style.  
  
Q. Robin, obviously it's a lower mid-major, I think it sounds like it
and looks like on the odds up there that you have respect for FGCU. You're
going to be physically much bigger. They do a good job of off-setting size
against larger programs. Just your thoughts on that on your kids, you can say
the right things not overlooking a mid-major and how FGCU is able to deal with
a taller teams and how you deal with a team that deals with taller teams?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Mid-major, power 5, it doesn't matter. This time of the year
the best of the best are in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
You know, I've got a history being a coach of a mid-major team, so I
understand what that mindset looks like. I think when it's the NCAA Tournament
you're not looking at what conference they came from. So just knowing how
competitive it's going to be and how challenging it's going to be. They've got
an incredible record there at Florida Gulf Coast. They've got some really big
wins. We've a common opponent in Kentucky and they obviously beat them. A
great team like DePaul. I don't think any of us are looking at them as a mid-
major by any stretch of the imagination.  
  
We're looking at it as a first-round game in the NCAA Tournament that's going
to be a battle for forty minutes. I think it's a chess match a little bit, we
might have more size but they're awfully quick and athletic. They do a great
job defensively. They're not afraid to play physical and obviously I think
they can exploit you with the way they can spread the offense with their 5-out
motion. Like I said from the start I think it's going to be a tough challenge
for us.  
  
Q. Sophie, obviously the last game was almost two weeks ago at this
point, but Georgia defensively seemed to have a good game plan against you
guys. I don't know the last time maybe you thought of that game, but is there
anything as you think back to what they did in that game that you looked at on
film that have seen and adjusted to?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, Georgia is a really good team and we consider this
team like a mini Georgia, just not with the height. So we have worked on our
spacing and our motion and not collapsing on the ball. We did a lot to
ourselves in the SEC tournament, but this team has bounced back. I think we're
in a good spot. We have watched film and digested some things and our team is
learning, but I think we're in a really good spot right now.  
  
Q. Jordan, your team ranks 15th in the country in rebound differential.
Rebounding, everybody knows is a lot of desire and all that and obviously
boxing out, things like that. Is there something more to it that would explain
why you folks are so good at it?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I would just say the emphasis that we put on it. Coach always
tells us that we need to be outrebounding teams every game and I think, like
you said, the desire and the grit to go get the ball, I think just to have
pride in wanting to go do that.  
  
Executing it, I think, is just like our game plan. But just emphasizing that,
that's a big part of the game is what we try to do.  
  
Q. Jordan, that Texas A &M game seems like a long time ago now, but for
the team in general you had a long winning streak going into that and that
kinda setoff a rough stretch. Did that game take the wind out of your sails
when you look in hindsight what did that game do for this team?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Well, I just think that these past, like, three games we've
just kind of had a rocky road, but I don't think it knocked the wind out of us
at all. I think if anything it helped us see the things that we need to
improve and what we need to do these past few practices. I think it's just
encouraged us and helped us get a mentality that we do need to improve in some
areas and that's where we're going to grow and we found those areas and trying
to execute them in this tournament. This whole year has been constantly
learning.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like as consistent as Sophie is the very few times
she doesn't shoot the ball as well she seems to be able to respond in the next
game with a really big game. Is that something that as you've watched her grow
over the couple of years with you you've seen her develop a good mindset in
terms of how to wash off a bad game and come to the next one?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I don't know that I can think of too many games that Sophie
has had a bad game. I think she does so much better than scoring. So probably
one of the most unselfish players in the game. I know she is not driven by how
many points she has. She wants to help our team be as successful as she can.
She has great court vision. She is a great passer. She shoots the three. She
can attack the basket. She rebounds well. She is a tough defending and
anticipates well.  
  
I know a lot of times we look at box scores and from a black and white
standpoint we have certain standards when we think it's a really good game and
a lot of time it's predicated on points, but I think it's so much bigger than
that.  
  
Where I have seen Sophie grow over the years is from a leadership standpoint.
A tremendous leader for our team and I think she is really invested in those
relationships. The most important thing to her is the front of the jersey. She
is a resilient kid. She impacts the game in a lot of different ways, and I'm
just really proud that she represents our university.  
  
Q. Sophie, China Dow doesn't start, but she is a terror lately. Kind of
a tough match-up. She is not a small gal and she likes to put her head down
and drive and she has a nice three-point touch. Your thoughts on not
necessarily you matching up on her but just your thoughts on her?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I would love to have her on my team. She is a big kid but
can handle the ball and shoot ball like a point guard. She is going to be a
touch match-up for us, honestly. They can all shoot the ball and get to the
rim if you close out hard on them and I have a lot of respect for her. I've
only seen her a couple of times on film, but she is going to be a tough match-
up for whoever is guarding her.  
  
Q. Jordan, how much does it mean to be at this stage and to know that in
your final run. If you don't lose you go out on top like this. How much fun is
it to be here as a senior?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: It's so fun, just enjoying these moments and these last few
moments are bittersweet, but like I said, just trying to stay in the moment
and enjoy every part of it with my team and coaches. You know, freshman year
we weren't in this position, so just not taking it for granted and like I
said, enjoying it all.  
  
Q. Coach, when you were a player and you started your coaching career at
St. Ambrose, what did the NCAA Tournament mean to you? What was it like as a
player and coach at that level?  
ROBIN PINGETON: You're trying to date me and I don't appreciate that!
(Laughter.) The game has changed so much. It's evolved. I played at an NAI
school and we played Notre Dame and some of those big Division I schools as an
NAI program and it's changed so much. From my coaching career to go from St.
Ambrose which we competed for National Championships, but their National
Championship is different than the NCAA. I had an opportunity to go on staff
with Bill Fennelly at Iowa State and then I coached at Illinois State. For me,
it's the Big Dance. It's what everybody's vision is, what everybody's goals
are. You're in this business and you don't need to talk about it, but
everybody knows everybody wants to compete for a Championship.  
  
But for us, and for our program it's really been about the process and it's
about, you know, just taking it one day at a time and constantly pushing that
needle as a program. I think we've really worked hard at laying a strong
foundation at the University of Missouri; and I feel like, you know, we're
moving the needle in the right direction. Really trying to become relevant in
regards to a top-20 program in the country.  
  
You don't go from the bottom to the top overnight. There are peaks and valleys
and a lot of challenges along the way, but it's been rewarding to see the
growth of our program and we're looking forward to March Madness. Right?
Anything can happen in March.  
  
Q. Robin, two of your wins jumped out at me. One was at Berkeley, a
3-point win there, since we are so familiar with the Bears; and the other one
being your win over South Carolina. Could you describe how you were able to
win those two games? What kind of games were they? Just give using information
about those?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I think for that tournament in California, you know, a
short turnaround between games. But we've got a lot of respect for Cal and
they're a great program. We knew it was going to be a challenge, a physical
game. I give you will at credit to these girls. They've done some things that
just haven't been done at the University of Missouri in a long time; and,
again, it's the players that came before and the foundation that's been laid.
I think we've competed well in those big games this year.  
  
I think everyone that we've gotten beat by this year is in the NCAA
Tournament, they're all top-50 RPI teams. We've had some of those games where
we came out on top and some that we fell short in regards to the scoreboard.
Cal was a big one. It was a big momentum one for us. We lost the first game of
the season and we said we have to steal one back in that nonconference, and
Cal was that game we felt like we had to steal back to put ourselves in that
position to get the high seed in the NCAA Tournament. South Carolina obviously
is a great program.  
  
A team that we had beat the year before so we knew them coming back to our
home court they were going to be ready to go, but our kids competed and played
at a high level. Playing those teams on your home court is huge. The six-man
environment, our community has been tremendous in the support that they've
given us all year long. So you want to play those games at home as much as
possible.  
  
Certainly that's a special environment for us. We've had some that we've come
out on the good side of the scoreboard and some that we've lost, but playing
in the SEC every night it's a battle and I think we've really had a successful
year. Certainly you want to get a few more wins as you go through the SEC
conference, but I think we've competed at a high level all year long.  
  
Q. Speaking of competing well in big games you've never competed against
FGCU or Gonzaga before. What are the challenges for you coming into the
tournament facing a team that you've never competed against?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think it's being on top of your scout and really doing a
great job of breaking it down and putting your players in a position to be
successful. These guys have been here before and they understand it's survive
and advance. If you don't come out ahead the season is done.  
  
But we want to embrace where we're at. We want to stay true to who we are. You
know, we want to go out playing our best basketball. This last week and a half
I think has been huge for us. I think we're almost looking forward to playing
someone outside of the SEC conference.  
  
I think everybody gets to that point with postseason, that you've faced your
in-conference teams so much that it's nice to get a fresh look. But certainly
got a lot of respect for everybody that's in the NCAA Tournament. You're not
in this tournament unless you're awfully good. So our players get that. They
understand that.  
  
Q. Sophie, when the draw came out and it was Stanford, you guys won a
tournament here at St. Mary's here a couple of years ago. Is it nice to come
back to the Bay Area?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, we wanted to host really bad this year. But we didn't
get that opportunity, but we have a new one and California has been good to
us, really since my freshman year. So we're all really happy to be back here.
But we know it's going to be tough, but it is nice to know we have a couple of
wins under our belt here in California.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, everyone. Best of luck.

_Stanford, California_  
  
LISA FORTIER: Good afternoon. You know, our team is excited to be here. We
have had a great season. I think we've overcome adversity early. We've
overcome things throughout the conference slate. We've proven that we're
capable of playing a variety of different styles and being successful doing a
variety of different things. I don't know if our team has distinguished itself
as an offensive team or a defensive team, but we've shown some great strengths
in both of those areas, and hopefully tomorrow we'll put forward a great
effort, and be able to do one other the other or hopefully both very well
against Stanford.  
  
Q. Jill, what do you remember about the game last year when you beat
Stanford? They don't lose at home very often, but you got them. What do you
remember about it?  
JILL BARTA: It was a very disciplined game for both of us. I think that's what
it's going to come down to this year is who's going to be more disciplined on
offense and defense. When we played them last year, it was super fun. It was
exciting. But it just came down to who was going to get stops and stuff.  
  
Q. Coach, over the years that you've been able to play Stanford, they've
obviously been a consistently successful program. Beating them here last year
and getting that first win against them, did that kind of have a moment for
you, for the program, to kind of say, yeah, okay, we've done this now, and do
you kind of feel as if that kind of thought process of we haven't done it
before has kind of evaporated since you were able to do it last year?  
LISA FORTIER: A little bit. Actually, I mean, I definitely don't think -- we
were talking in the locker room about the fact that last year Kiara Kudron,
Elle Tinkle, Makenlee Williams and Emma Wolfram -- Emma is on the roster, but
those four players played really well here and did big things for us and
helped us to win that game, and this is a very different team.  
  
I look down the row, and all three of these were part of that team, as well,
and they had a big impact. So it's nice to say that we've done it. I can
certainly now say we can do it again, versus before we're saying we can be the
first team to do this, and it was very exciting for all of us as a coaching
staff and definitely one of our highlights for last season, and something that
you can kind of talk about in your career.  
  
But it's just a new team that we have. I think they have different strengths
than they had last year and different weaknesses, and so do we. So it's
somewhat relevant but not entirely with just the way that -- sometimes from
one week to one week, or definitely one month to month, but certainly a year
brings a different thing, but it is something that we do have.  
  
Q. Lisa, we talked about earlier this week the slow start last year
against Oklahoma and the uphill struggle; how do you go into this game with a
different mindset of hitting the gas pedal right away?  
LISA FORTIER: Definitely wasn't the plan last year, but I do think that having
had that slow start, we've experienced it now. It's just like anything. Once
you experience it for yourself, you can talk about it and talk about it, but
once you do it for yourself you have a different perspective. For these
players that are still on this team, we know how important it is because after
that first quarter we were about even, or maybe we even finished ahead, I'm
not sure. It was close. You just can't afford -- when you're a 13 seed playing
a 4 seed or last year a 12 seed playing a 5 seed, you can't afford to have a
quarter like that. It's debilitating, and it's just really tough to overcome.  
  
We've had quarters this year where we've been on the opposite site of that.
You were at our BYU game at home where we gave up two points in a quarter, and
that's going to make the rest of the game a struggle for that team. So we have
to be ready from the start.  
  
Stanford is not the kind of team that beats themselves. So if we're not ready,
they're not going to make very many mistakes, and we're going to find
ourselves in a hole quickly, and so we're doing everything we can within our
power to come out with the right mentality, play call-wise. I'll be ready with
a quick time-out if we need it. We're thinking through those things and trying
not to recreate that from last year.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you tell us about the basketball culture up there? We
see it in the media with all your fans traveling for the WCC tournament.
You're about 4,000 plus season tickets for women's basketball. What's it like
coaching and playing in that environment?  
LISA FORTIER: It's so much fun. I have been to a lot of towns and cities in
the country, but I've spent a lot of time in ours, and there can't be a better
basketball town than Spokane. Driving around, I feel like I'm in an old movie
or old book with all the signs everywhere throughout the town and the flags.  
  
Our women's program is supported as well as any program. We're regularly in
the top 10, 12 in attendance, and capacity attendance last year we were first
because our building only holds 6,000, and it's almost full every time.  
  
It gives these guys the true student-athlete experience that we're looking
for, and there are a lot of places where people treat their players well and
they have good coaches and they bring academic support, but the fan support
isn't quite the same. So these guys, I know they all appreciate it, and they
really enjoy what it's like to walk out of that tunnel every day with all
those people there. But it's pretty special and something I'm very proud to be
a part of.  
  
CHANDLER SMITH: Yeah, well, for me when you're coming out to the gym two and a
half hours before the game and all the parking spots are full, it's just a
different experience. I mean, all of our fans are out there trying to get
pictures with us going in the building. You feel like a celebrity or
superstar, and it's actually a great feeling to have so much support. I'm
biased, but I feel like we have the best fans in the world. Just super
thankful.  
  
Q. What bothers you, or from what you've seen in the scouting report,
what do you think is the toughest thing about Stanford?  
JILL BARTA: I'll just say it like I said before, how disciplined their team
is. They know who's going to take the shots. They know exactly what role they
play on each team, each number. I think that's going to be the hardest thing
is we're going to have to overcome that a little bit, and we're going to have
to show that we're just as disciplined as they are.  
  
EMMA STACH: And I would say like Lisa already said, just like Jill just said,
they're really disciplined. They know what they're doing. They do it for a
long time, and they're really good. They really know their strengths, and they
just like highlight every person when they play. They know their role.  
  
Q. For the players, you talked about how much fan support you guys get,
but this is going to be a road game for you guys here versus how it was last
year when you were in Washington with the drive over to Seattle. How much of a
challenge is that going to be playing against such a tough opponent in their
home gym?  
JILL BARTA: I mean, we of course hope to see as many 'Zaga fans as we can, but
it's really not about people coming to watch us right now, it's about everyone
in this room right now sitting next to me to my left and right and everyone
that's back in the locker room. We've got to step up, play together as a team,
and really stick together.  
  
Q. Emma, three-point shooting has been an issue all year, but you guys
are hitting the mark at the right time. What kind of confidence booster is
that to be shooting so well from three-point right now?  
EMMA STACH: Yeah, I think it's -- I mean, it's a confidence booster,
especially when we started in the beginning. But I think just like making the
right reads during the game and just like looking for open teammates, so I
think that's just like playing together. That's what really made the
difference in our last couple of games that we made threes. So just like
playing together, finding the open shot.  
  
Q. Lisa, I don't know how much of being a point guard is genetic or
inherited or anything like that, aside from speed, I suppose, but how would
you describe Laura's game? Let's start with that. How would you describe her
game?  
LISA FORTIER: She's feisty, and she's competitive, and I think those two
things have come from her dad. I'm guessing that's kind of part of where this
is going to go at some point.  
  
She's a great competitor. She uses ball screens well. She's getting better and
better at using ball screens. She wants to make the big play, whether that be
a pass or a shot. She has that kind of confidence and that kind of drive.
She's a good defender. Actually that's a growth area that she's made in the
last year, I think, is she's become someone who we trust as a defender who can
guard a variety of positions who's a very strong guard, but she doesn't
typically get overcome by people who maybe have some size on her height-wise.
She's a good floor general. But I would say that her biggest attribute in my
mind and why I love her as a point guard is how competitive she is.  
  
Q. What was it like recruiting her? Obviously both her parents went
there and her dad was the most famous Gonzaga athlete ever, but what was it
like recruiting her and her family?  
LISA FORTIER: Yeah, it was fun. I got to recruit her as an assistant coach
first for a little while. Since she was local, we were recruiting her for
quite a while, and then as a head coach. She was one of the players that I
kind of continued on as main recruiter. When you become a head coach, you
don't have the luxury of necessarily being the lead on a lot of the
recruitments.  
  
But so with her, I got to know her pretty well personally. She actually tried
to totally disconnect her family from the equation. She really wanted to make
the decision on her own based on her and not her dad and brother having her
basketball careers there, her mother having her college career there. She made
us work for it quite a bit.  
  
But they're a fun family. You can tell they're extremely family oriented, so
it was great for me to see how loyal they are to their siblings and to their
family and kind of to their -- they don't really have a brand, but their
family dynamic. It was great. John has been fun to have around. He's been
coming to our games for a long time. He was around when Courtney Vandersloot
played with us, and he's actually been a lot more hands off with Laura here
because he wants to let her do her thing, and I think she prefers that, so
he's become a great fan of ours. And her mom had these guys over for dinner a
couple times this year. She's a great cook.  
  
So they're kind of just like all the other parents that we have, the local
ones who chime in when they can, support us the best that they are allowed to
do and give their daughter an extra hug after.  
  
Q. Being here is kind of déjà-vu for you guys since both teams played
there in Las Vegas. What are some of the things that you saw in Stanford then
that are different now and maybe the growth of their team and how that may be
something you have to look at or could be dangerous for your team?  
LISA FORTIER: Well, Stanford at that time -- first off, we were hoping to
match up with them down there, and after our first game we realized that that
wasn't going to happen. So I didn't get too deep into the scouting of them.  
  
But at that time they didn't have Brittany McPhee, and I think Dijonai was out
either then or shortly after, as well, so they were dealing with some pretty
key injuries. We had several injuries of our own at that time. All three of
these guys -- no, two of these three up here escaped around that time, as
well.  
  
So I think the biggest difference in them then and now is Brittany McPhee.
She's a good player. She's so versatile, and the pace at which she plays and
her athleticism, she wants to -- again, talk about Laura and her
competitiveness and her desire to make the big plays, Brittany has all of
those things in her. So I think that she's going to be problematic. I like our
game plan. I think people that we can run at her defensively, we can throw
different things at her. But if we can't slow her down, then that would create
some issues for us.  
  
Speaking of injuries, Dijonai is so great on the glass, so those are two
things that I think would have changed some of the outcomes that Stanford had
early and as far as the games go, just win/loss. Alanna, they have a variety
of players that I think our team has articulated that well. I'm glad to see
we've gotten our point across that they play to their strengths, and their
players know their roles, and they play to them as well as anyone in the
country. And so they don't have people going rogue and doing things, shooting
threes when they're supposed to be driving and just doing weird things. They
do what they're supposed to do.  
  
So regardless of the time of the year or different center now, I think that's
a trait that's been consistent with them throughout all the time that I've
been playing against them. It's been several years now. That and their
rebounding is something, they're always among the best, in our opinion,
rebounding teams in the country. So those are two areas that if we don't
follow the game plan, we could be in trouble in those spots.  
  
Q. Lisa, can you talk about the influence Tara has had on the game and
on you personally having grown up in this area?  
LISA FORTIER: Oh, she's just -- I mean, I always wanted to play for or coach
with a great female head coach, and I didn't have the opportunity to be with
someone who was well-established. My college coach was new, both of them. I
played junior college and four-year with new head coaches. They were both
female but new. I worked with Jaime White for one year at Northern Colorado,
and it was her first year of Division I, and then I spent a lot of time under
Kelly Graves, and he was a great coach but he was a man, obviously.  
  
I've tried to seek out -- not necessarily -- I wouldn't say that Tara has been
a mentor to me, but she's someone who will always answer the phone when I
call. She's spoken to me before about hiring staff, and a few years ago we
exchanged scouting reports with her staff. She's interested in growing the
game of women's basketball, not just in her team continuing to be successful,
and that's something that I really admire.  
  
Of course I admire the way she pulls the best out of her team every time and
demands that you -- demands greatness really. And she's someone who -- I've
told you this, but I worked for camps when I was in college. I came over here
and worked camps, the Tara VanDerveer camp for three or four years, and so
have great respect for her and what she does. Obviously her teams are always
well-schooled and well-prepared.  
  
Q. Chandler, a lot of teams sometimes go into Selection Sunday and they
don't know what their status is going to be. You had the luxury to kind of
know you were going to be in, it was just a matter of where. What was the
first thought that came to mind when it showed up it was going to be Stanford
and you guys were going to be playing them?  
CHANDLER SMITH: Overall it was excitement. I think going in, we kind of knew
just from bracketology and just kind of listening around that we were going to
be around this area. We didn't know if maybe we'd face them first or second
round, but just knowing that we were in the tournament and had an automatic
bid that we were going to play Stanford, someone who we were very familiar
with, we were very happy, so very excited to be here.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 80, Michigan - 58.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lauren, talk about trying to with defend Thome. What did you do
differently in the second half to slow her down?  
LAUREN COX: She's really long and she's really skilled around the basket. We
had to really adjust. We kind of bodied up to her a little bit, just had to
time our blocks better.  
  
Q. Lauren, talk about how your game has kind of come together. Four
straight double-doubles. You seem to be playing well right now. Just the
difference of what you learned this year.  
LAUREN COX: I think a lot of it goes back to last year. We had five really
good post players. I learned a lot from that. Then this year just working with
Kalani, we work really well together. This time of year, I know that I was
going to have to step up, especially with Kristy going down. All of us had to
step up. We have a small roster. We're all going to have to step up and do our
part.  
  
Q. Juicy, what did you think of your defense tonight?  
JUICY LANDRUM: I think I played great defense on Flaherty. She's a really
great player. They set a lot of screens for her. But I think I really did a
good job of chasing her around the screens and getting over screens. So, I
mean, I held her to three points in the second half. I guess that's a pretty
good job.  
  
Q. You came out in the third quarter and made a run. What did you talk
about at halftime?  
LAUREN COX: Start of the first half and the second half are always big for us.
We always want to get off to a really good start.  
  
I think we let Flaherty and Thome go off. I think they had 30 of their 34
points at the half. We really focused in on them. We had a lot of good help
side.  
  
Q. Alexis, talk about what the Big 12 tournament, these two NCAA games
have done for you, the change in your role. How do you feel moving forward?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: It's taught me a lot about being mature on the court and just
my preparation before games. Like now I know it's win or go home. I have to
take every game seriously. I can't take players lightly. I can't take anything
lightly.  
  
It's just me having to be more mature, yeah.  
  
Q. Lauren, I know you haven't been here for all of them, but this is 10
straight Sweet 16s for Baylor. Talk about keeping that tradition going.  
LAUREN COX: It's a huge honor. This team has gone through a lot this year, a
lot of adversity. We fought through all of it. We stayed together.  
  
Getting to the Sweet 16 is really important for us. That was obviously one of
our goals. We just want to get over the hump of that Sweet 16, Elite 8, get
ourselves to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Looked like y'all were trying to push it on every play, get the ball
in transition. Was that a point of emphasis for you guys?  
JUICY LANDRUM: I know coach always says -- well, our last game our transition
offense wasn't the best. In practice we kind of worked on that. She said we
just need to run, so look for that in the game.  
  
ALEXIS MORRIS: I feel like when we push the ball, it makes us a better team.
Coach always tell me to work on the John Stockton curl. Is that what it's
called?  
  
KIM MULKEY: She doesn't remember who John Stockton is.  
  
ALEXIS MORRIS: She always tell me to work on that curl, push the ball. When
you make decisions in transition, can't nobody stop that.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ALEXIS MORRIS: No.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Someday they won't know who Michael Jordan is either. We may be
dead.  
  
LAUREN COX: Never heard of him at all?  
  
ALEXIS MORRIS: I never heard of him.  
  
LAUREN COX: Sad.  
  
KIM MULKEY: I kid you not.  
  
LAUREN COX: That's crazy.  
  
KIM MULKEY: She thinks I just made that name up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You ended up winning pretty comfortably. Was this almost a perfect
type game as you head to the regionals?  
KIM MULKEY: We ended up winning comfortably. I thought it was a well-played
game. I thought both teams were fatigued at the end. You're just playing hard.
Everybody knows you go home if you lose.  
  
The game's getting better. We don't have the parity that the men have on
playoffs with all the upsets you've seen on the men's side. But the game is
getting better on the women's side. There's some upsets, but there's not as
many blowout games.  
  
Great crowd today. I don't know what the attendance ended up being. If you're
saying did we get pushed today? Sure, we got pushed. Played basically six
players. I think Juicy Landrum needs to be written about. That kid comes
coming off screens, guarding. Flaherty, she's a hard kid to guard. We tried
Morris on her. I said, Forget that, put Juicy on her. You can't wear Morris
out who has to communicate with me.  
  
I thought Juicy was tremendous today. She hit big threes, took the ball to the
rim. I just thought her defense on that kid, especially in the second half,
was good.  
  
Q. You have been here for all 10 of the Sweet 16 appearances. Is there
something different and special about what this team has accomplished?  
KIM MULKEY: Comparing teams is like comparing your children. You can't do
that. Each is different.  
  
So to answer your question, I'm not going to say these things to compare them
to other teams, I'm going to talk about this particular team.  
  
This by far, no question about it, has been my roughest, toughest year away
from the court for personal reasons both for myself, my child, and these kids
and their families. Then you add injuries to it, depleted roster. I kid you
not, if you walked up to my office, I looked at this, every day, I'm not big
on journals, but every day, I don't know if you say the word traumatic that
happened, I wrote it down. Some of it you guys don't even know about because
it involves those kids and their personal lives.  
  
To think we're still winning. I'd like to take credit for I kept the stern
face, went in there and acted like nothing happened. You can't do that. You
have to be real with these kids. You have to address it. It's not going away.  
  
I think anybody that knows me knows I wear my feelings on my sleeves. I say
what I have to say. It's not personal. We move on. I don't leave white
elephants in the room. Sometimes that offends people.  
  
But these kids cry. These kids have laughed. These kids have pulled for each
other. It's been a tough year. But now you go on the court, it is my most
enjoyable team because when I turn that corner out of that tunnel every day, I
know what I'm getting out of them as people. I know what I'm getting out of
them as competitors.  
  
It really is the highlight of my day.  
  
Q. Their two big players scored 30 of their 34 in the first half. What
specific adjustments did you make in the second half?  
KIM MULKEY: They, like a lot of teams, want to get off to a good start. You're
not fatigued early in ballgames. When you start the third and fourth quarter,
that's usually where games are won.  
  
I thought Juicy's composure. She was tired. Her ability to not fatigue created
some of their missed shots. Then I thought Kalani was challenged at halftime.
You got to go up and block a big girl's shot. She's nine for nine at the half.  
  
I just thought that some of their shots they missed was fatigue, but some of
their shots was just Juicy and Kalani and Cox and those guys just grinding it
out and saying, You're as tired as we are, but whoever defends the best is
going to win.  
  
Before the game, to help you guys a little bit, how do you beat a team like
Michigan? I gave these kids five things in a scouting report yesterday.  
  
Run. We got athletes, you better run. We're not very polished in running. We
want to run when people are back and think we can take them off the dribble.
We have to know when to run and when not to run.  
  
I thought taking care of the basketball was very important. We only had nine
turnovers. Give us a shot every time, and I thought that we did that.  
  
I thought that offensive boards would be big. We had 21. I challenged Dekeiya
at halftime. She had no rebounds. She's our best offensive rebounder. She
almost finished with a double-double. She accepted that challenge in the
second half, got us nine boards. Lot of them were offensive boards.  
  
Free throws, I said get to the foul line more than Michigan. We did. We missed
too many, but we did get to the foul line. So there's our scouting report.  
  
Q. What have you thought of the job that your strength and conditioning
staff has done to get the girls to where they are right now?  
KIM MULKEY: Matt is new in our program. It's a great story about Matt. He ran
the entire athletic department strength and conditioning at Arkansas State,
all of it, football, men's basketball. He hired people to do the specific
sports.  
  
The first thing that caught my attention was he got in touch with us. I'm
thinking, Okay, is he about to get fired and looking for a job. But when he
told me the reason he wanted to come to Baylor, it touched my heart. He had
his first son. He wants to spend more quality time with his family. Instead of
being charged with however many you have on a football team, specific sport in
women's basketball, it's 15 kids. That was the first thing.  
  
The second thing is I needed to make sure he was good. I called people. They
said, this might make all the coaches at Baylor mad, they said, He'll be the
best Baylor has. And I do believe that. He's got energy. He has creative mind.
Basketball is a different sport. You have to work individually with those
kids. You have to motivate them. They have to want to eat right. You have to
figure out what does Kalani need, Juicy need, Cox need, Natalie need. It also
allows him to be with his son.  
  
To answer your question, I think he's the best in the business. I think he's
the best at Baylor. He speaks all over the country. We're fortunate to have
him.  
  
Q. Four straight double-doubles by Lauren. Forget the numbers. What
development have you seen in her?  
KIM MULKEY: Lauren Cox signed to come to Baylor when we had a slew of post
players and All-Americans. That tells you what an unselfish kid she is and
also how confident she is in her ability.  
  
Her freshman year, as all of them will tell you, is the most difficult year of
your life, not just in sports, but in life. You're leaving your comfort zone
after home. While she's close, Flower Mound is certainly not that far away.
She has to deal with diabetes. Now she doesn't have mom every day to nag her
about, Did you check this, do that?  
  
All the things that a normal student would have to deal with as a freshman,
add a little bid to Cox's plate. I challenged her in the locker room, I won't
say exactly the way I said it in the locker room when it was over last year,
but I challenged her right in her face. I think she accepted the challenge.
She's in the best shape of her life. Her diabetes is under control. We had the
little episode earlier in the year, but that was because she had Strep throat
and fell asleep and didn't check it.  
  
When you do all the things you're supposed to do and you feel good, you play
good. I've said this, if you don't understand basketball, you don't understand
what she brings to our team. It's easy to see who scores, who rebounds, who
blocks shots. Lauren Cox's presence on the defensive end of the floor, her
knowledge of the game, where I need to be to help, the angle I need to be, can
I get on my man, guard a perimeter player. If you understand the game, you
understand her value if she never scores a point or blocks a shot or gets a
rebound because she understands what a coach is looking for even when she's on
help side.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 18, 2018

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Hallie Thome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34722)

### [Katelynn Flaherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32715)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 80, Michigan - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with a short overview from the head coach.  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Baylor is a great basketball team. It was a great game for
us tonight. They were strong and physical and really challenged us. I thought
we hung tough in a lot of spurts. We turned the basketball over early. I
thought if we hadn't done that, we might have put ourselves in a little bit of
a better position.  
  
In the second half, they really wore is down and did a great job on Katelynn
and Hallie in the second half. They weren't able to get as many easy touches.
They were double-teaming and triple-teaming Hallie inside, trying to lock up
Katelynn on the outside. They're an incredible team. Obviously they only have
one loss on the season.  
  
I thought for the most part, until down the stretch, we really battled tough
and hung tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Katelynn, what do you attribute the turnovers to?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: Sometimes I think we just see people and we try to get it
to them quick. Baylor, their guards are super fast.  
  
But I think just we had to get adjusted to the game. We made some turnovers. I
think we got a little bit tight and made some more. Kind of forcing some
passes to certain people. I think we just had to clean that up.  
  
Q. Katelynn, I know the game just ended. Curious as to your thoughts on
your career, finishing at the NCAA tournament, leading scorer.  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: Yeah, I really haven't gotten a chance to think about it
even this whole season when I surpassed those records, whatnot.  
  
I made the best decision coming to Michigan. I would never change that. I love
my coach. I love Hallie (tearing up). Sorry.  
  
It's a great school. I couldn't do it without them. I give them credit to them
for believing in me. Also to my coaches, for not only helping me grow as a
player, but I've grown so much as a woman. I'll leave a better person than I
came here. Sorry.  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I did a good job of not causing this in the locker room.
Like you guys got me yesterday, now you got her today.  
  
Q. Hallie, what kind of problems Kalani and Lauren presented. You had
success early in the game inside.  
HALLIE THOME: Yeah, I think in the beginning I was very comfortable. I felt
like I had a lot of room to score, using my quick moves against them, my
speed. It helped me a lot. I think they kind of realized what I was trying to
do. A lot of time my spin moves, the guards were all packing the paint,
getting little touches. Then Kalani locked down on my baseline hook. She's an
outstanding player. I played against her at USA.  
  
It's a fun experience to play against a top post player in the country.  
  
Q. Katelynn, you can watch it on film, but are they maybe faster,
particularly Alexis Morris, is she faster than you can see on film?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: I mean, they looked pretty fast on film. It is different
when you get out there always. They're pretty physical, too. They're not just
fast. They're all pretty physical. It's definitely a different look,
especially from last game. Very quick, very fast, physical, like I said. So
kind of was a lot tougher in that sense.  
  
Then when you're driving past them, you have to go into two huge post players,
it's hard, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KIM BARNES ARICO: The question is, how far do I think they can go.  
  
We had the opportunity this year to play against Notre Dame and to play
against Louisville. Both of those teams were great teams, and they're No. 1
seeds. I think that Baylor is of equal talent to that. I mean, they're the
biggest, best rebounding team that we faced all year long.  
  
I think their point guard is becoming more and more confident as the
tournament goes on, which is definitely going to help them. The young lady
knocked down a few threes, Juicy knocked down a few threes for them, which I
think is going to help them to extend the defense, not allow size to pack it
in.  
  
What we have played against, as talented as any team in the country.  
  
Q. Their run there in the third quarter, you having led by five in the
first half, do you think you forced them into another gear at that point?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I mean, the game was a game of runs definitely in the
first half. They would make a run, we would make a run, they would make a run,
we'd call timeout, we would make a run. It was real fun in the first half.  
  
I think we kind of got stagnant being able to score a little bit. I feel like
it was at 45-41 for about three or four possessions where we had an
opportunity to extend that. Then we turned it over. We went for the steal.
They got the layup. We came back. Hal turned it over again, they passed long,
I think they got the and-one. That was a big swing when they were able to go
up. We had three or four chances to score at that time.  
  
I think a lot of pressure was on Katelynn and Hallie to score. We just needed
to add more options in that time. So when they made that run, then it was hard
for us to come back once they got it up to 10, 12 points.  
  
Q. I saw you nodding your head when I was asking Katelynn about the
turnovers. Was it a matter of them getting sped up too much? Was this
uncharacteristic of the way they usually play?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I think initially, early on, we were trying to find Hallie.
We tried to do that sometimes, and that sometimes causes us to get turnovers,
especially from the top of the key. Katelynn tried to find her early. Katelynn
had five or six on the day, but they had three probably in a minute span. So
once she regrouped from that minute, I think she was a lot better.  
  
We finished with 19, but we had 12 at half. We were much better in the second
half. I think the environment, it was pretty loud. I think every time Baylor
made a run, the pressure. But once we settled in, we did a much better job of
taking care of the ball. A lot of them were unforced early because we were
trying to get Hallie inside. We wanted to be able to try to attack her a
little bit in transition. We thought once we set up in the halfcourt, they
would have an opportunity to double. We thought her best looks would be out of
transition. I think we forced a couple early. I think the jitters had to get
out early. Once we were able to do that, we only had seven in the second half,
which was a lot better.  
  
Q. Just seemed like the physicality, rebounding, a snowball rolling down
the hill. Was that also a contributing factor?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: They wore us down, for sure. No question about it. I thought
we battled and kind of hung tough and really fought and really tried to
rebound in the first half. Then I thought they really wore us down physically.
Even Katelynn said, I felt I was getting bumped and pushed. There were a
number of times where I probably would have gotten foul calls that I didn't
get foul calls that she's accustomed to. I think the game, everyone watching
them on film a lot, they're a very, very, very physical team. They rebound the
ball so exceptionally well. It really wore us down.  
  
I mean, we had possessions where 29 seconds had gone on the shot clock, great
defense, then they get an offensive possession where we'd have to defend them
again. Obviously that's the strength of their team. That's something that
makes them so good, is they just go after it. Obviously they have two bigs,
but it's their guards as well that really, really wear you down.  
  
That's where we felt we could have an advantage, if we could get the rebound,
we'd be able to go in transition, because five were on the glass. But it's
really hard to get the rebound over them.  
  
Yeah, they definitely physically wore us down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Thank you, guys.

WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 17, 2018

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Alexis Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34789)

### [Juicy Landrum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35142)

### [Dekeiya Cohen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34766)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Juicy and Alexis, talk about the matchup, trying to face Kayelynn
Flaherty, what she brings to them.  
KIM MULKEY: Let me help y'all. We go over our scouting report on them today.
They are kind of waiting to get in that locker room. Probably specifics of
players...  
  
They saw third quarter maybe yesterday and some film today. I don't know how
much they'll help you with details. They'll certainly be able to answer that
if we were able to come up here after film.  
  
Q. Dekeiya, obviously your senior year. You played basketball your whole
life. Do you have any particular superstitions that you have to do on game
day, night before?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: The only thing I have is the pregame nap. It's my ritual. Other
than that, no.  
  
I don't listen to music before games most of the time. Sometimes I do,
sometimes I don't. I don't really have too many superstitions.  
  
Q. Alexis and Juicy, with what you have done with the guard position,
what does it mean when you actually are given the opportunity, someone
believes in you, then you gain even more trust by your play?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: For me as a freshman, it means a lot because being a freshman.
I'm young. It's harder for me to gain Coach Mulkey's trust than it would be
for a junior or somebody else who has already been here. It means a lot to me.
I value it.  
  
JUICY LANDRUM: For me, it means a lot to me also. Like last year sitting down,
but I learned a lot from Alexis Jones and Alexis Prince, playing behind them
every day in practice. It means a lot to get this opportunity to be able to
start and, like, help the team.  
  
Q. Dekeiya, you're a senior on this team, you're in your fourth NCAA
tournament. How important is that experience playing against a Michigan team
that maybe doesn't have the experience you do?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: It means a lot to us really, just knowing how everything works,
going to the tournament, how important it is to take it one game at a time
when you're going deeper into the tournament. It definitely gives us an
advantage, the fact that a lot of us have been there before.  
  
For the freshmen, us having experience helps them out really because we can,
like, give them some insight as to what's going on.  
  
Q. Dekeiya, what is it like to be able to know that it took you time to
be able to get quality minutes, not that you didn't have some early? You've
become a major force. To be able to do that as you close out your career?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: It means a lot to me just knowing that everything has paid off.
Waiting and putting my time in is all paying off this year. Just to see that
happen is pretty great.  
  
I think it couldn't come at a better time really. I mean, we're making a good
run in this tournament. We had a great season. So just being able to
contribute toward that means a lot to me.  
  
Q. Alexis, being a freshman, what would you say is the biggest point in
your game? What has changed the most from when you first walked onto the
campus to where you are now as a player?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: I would say maturity on the court. Like in practice when I
first came here, I would always get mad at myself, get down on myself, just
bring this bad energy into practice, kind of just being selfish.  
  
I think I've grown in that area. I can't be like that now, being a starting
point guard. I have to grow in that area. That would be it.  
  
Q. Juicy, now that you have a big impact role on this team, where have
you seen your game change the most?  
JUICY LANDRUM: I would say my defense, like my communication on the court.
Like last year, I know I wasn't, like, the best defender. I'm probably still
not the best defender. I make a few mistakes. I just don't let myself get
down. When I make a mistake, I move past it.  
  
My communication skills have gotten better.  
  
Q. Dekeiya, you start the year with Natalie and Kristy as your
backcourt. What have you seen from these two as they've taken over in those
roles?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: I seen them getting a lot more confidence. I see them become
more leaders on the court. Like she said, more vocal. They stepped up in every
way we needed them to.  
  
Juicy, she's a shooter. She's been shooting the ball well. Lex, she's a
scoring point guard, and she's been doing that well, too.  
  
I mean, they've done everything we can ask. We're happy to have them on our
team because most people, it's hard for them to step up when the opportunity
knocks, but they've done a great job with it.  
  
Q. Juicy, for you being a Waco native, how special was it coming out in
the starting lineup yesterday?  
JUICY LANDRUM: I mean, it was great really to be able to host the first two
rounds here, have my mom and my dad. My dad didn't get to see my freshman
year. It was great having my dad in the stands and my mom.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Behind every great program there's a great coaching staff.
Specifically coach Toyelle Wilson, how has she played a role getting to this
level?  
KIM MULKEY: That's my Yankee on the staff. She's a Jersey girl.  
  
Toyelle, how she got here, her story is I played against her in the NCAA
playoffs. She was a head coach at Prairie View. Didn't know Toyelle. Just
watched her kids play, watched how she conducted her business in meetings,
press conferences. I knew I wanted to hire a female. I interviewed her and the
rest is history.  
  
The area that Toyelle is so good at is, one, she has sat in a head coach's
chair. Number two, she has grown in recruiting because at Prairie View, as she
told me, sometimes you have to wait and get what others don't get. She said,
Now I can go knock on a door because I'm in a program where we can go after
those that we want to go after. She's just grown leaps and bounds in
recruiting.  
  
On the floor, she's particularly good on relating to the young kids. She can
talk their language when she needs to. Sometimes she's a little harder on them
than I am.  
  
Toyelle is a piece of a great puzzle that I have. If you look at every coach I
have, they have specific responsibilities that, one, I'm not good at or I
don't want to do any more. They're up there in the film room as I speak to you
guys.  
  
Several have been with me a long time. I guess I'm blessed to have the kind of
players I do. But really I'm blessed that I don't have a lot of turnover in my
staff. I have three that have been head coaches that chose to come here to be
assistant coaches, to be a part of a program like Baylor. Then I have those
that don't aspire to be head coaches because they're content to be where they
are.  
  
Q. While Michigan was making their NCAA tournament debut yesterday,
their players, they played a lot of WNIT games, that carried over in their
composure. Did you see that carry over?  
KIM MULKEY: The more you can play as you're building a program, the better
you're going to be. We played in a post-season NIT one year. Lost in the
championship game to Auburn.  
  
So, yes, it is a carryover, particularly if you have a lot of underclassmen.
If you're losing a lot of seniors, it may not be as effective. But if you've
got a lot of returning players that play a lot of minutes for you, the more
you play, the better you get.  
  
Kim, their coach, is one of my favorite people in the profession. She brought
her kids with her. They came in the office. Just to hug those kids, it just
makes you smile to have a coach like that in our profession.  
  
Q. You have put up the numbers as a point guard, had some really good
point guards, but you also play a lot of big girls and post players that you
have here. Which would you rather have, the point guard, the difference maker,
the leader, or someone inside that's got size?  
KIM MULKEY: When you play the position, you're the extension of the coach on
the floor. You're going to get all the grief. When I start getting on kids, I
start with the point guard play. So that's probably the most vital position
because they have to know every position on that floor. Those post players are
so dependent on their guards, you can't throw it to yourself.  
  
Then you turn it around a little bit and go, Well, you know, the rebounds
don't happen if you don't have the bigs. I was blessed at Louisiana Tech to
have great post play. The value of post play will never be undervalued from
me. I played with the greatest in the game at Louisiana Tech. Now, they
weren't 6'7", but they were the best of the best at that time.  
  
You got to have both. What has happened, and you see it in the NBA, is you
don't have the big, big man hardly any more. Everybody wants to shoot the
three, everybody wants to spread the floor. We figured out all those motion
offenses. That's very good.  
  
But I guarantee you, if a Wilt Chamberlain walked through that door that could
dominate the paint, it would change their approach. You have to change with
the personnel that you have.  
  
I will never stop recruiting big players. But if we don't get big players,
we'll change and meet what I've got to do to expose our kids' strengths.  
  
Q. Specifically about Alexis, talk about her basketball IQ.  
KIM MULKEY: It starts with her level of confidence. That kid has swag. She's
had it from the time I've watched her play. I've been watching her since the
seventh grade. It's not a turnoff type of swag. It's humble, sweet. But when
you get on that floor, she's trying to beat you. If she needs to pump a fist,
she'll do it. If she needs to tell Juicy, no, you go first, I'm not going
first, when they're up here arguing about who is going to answer the question
first.  
  
She didn't want to mess up. Sometimes she's right. She can get I don't want to
say down on herself, but she can focus on that one mess-up and we've moved on
to three more plays. She's learned how to move quickly from a mistake.  
  
Tremendous quickness. I don't think she really uses her quickness the way she
will before her career is over. She can take off with a ball in her hands
quicker than most people can run down the floor. But I think she is trying to
prove and has proven through the years that I can run if I need to, but I want
to show you I can find the open person, I can run an offense, not just an
athlete out here playing basketball.  
  
Alexis, she's just a player that I'm not surprised by her ability to just step
in when Kristy got hurt. That's just not something that has shocked me.  
  
Q. You obviously have to be somewhat familiar with Katelynn Flaherty. As
a former point guard, to see what she's done this year in one season, what do
you think of what she's done so far?  
KIM MULKEY: Yesterday was my first time to actually see her in person. I've
read about her, watched her very little on TV because we just don't get very
many games in your conference.  
  
But she is the engine to their team. She puts up a lot of shots. She creates a
lot of shots for her teammates. Her size, she's not six foot out there on the
perimeter, she does it as a normal-sized guard.  
  
I watched a lot of her game yesterday, for obvious reasons, in case we played
them. But the respect I have for how she involves everybody on her team. Even
though she puts up a lot of shots, she involves everybody on that court in
some capacity.  
  
Q. Juicy, Alexis, Didi, do you ever have to pull them aside and say, You
have a lot of raw talent, you can be as good as you want to be? Do you have to
tell them they can be so much better than they already are?  
KIM MULKEY: First of all, when you recruit them, you tell them how good they
are. You also tell them the truth on what I think you can do even better.
Their personalities are just three totally different kids.  
  
With Juicy, when she told you she has to learn to communicate more, she's a
quiet kid, she's a happy kid, a pleasant kid. She just spent an hour after
practice the other day because a teacher that's in hospice care just wanted to
see her. She went from practice and just spent an hour with that lady. Knowing
Juicy, she probably didn't open her mouth. She was just hugging that lady and
holding her hand.  
  
You have to understand Juicy's personality, how hard you can get on her, what
motivates her. That takes time. I think you're just seeing a kid that she's
just taken off. It's like a flower. She's opening up. It's happening for her.  
  
She has as good a range. I've always said the greatest perimeter shooter that
I ever coached was Emily Niemann. I only got to coach her two years here. She
was the MVP of our 2005 championship game. When she missed a perimeter three,
you were like, Are you kidding me? That's how good a shooter she was.  
  
I think Juicy's range, her ability to score the basketball from way out there.
Look at her percentage. It's pretty darn good. She missed her first two shots
yesterday. I was wondering how she would handle that.  
  
Then you move to Didi Richards, who I think people need to talk about this kid
more. Her value to our team, I couldn't believe she didn't make all freshman
team in our league. What she brings is length. She brings quickness. She
brings a little nastiness when she has to go in there and bang with the bigs.  
  
You can't go to practice and be in a bad mood around her. She's a happy kid.
She dances. She laughs. She tells jokes. She'll come up and play with my hair.
She makes you enjoy what you do.  
  
Then you go to Alexis, who is a little bit harder on herself. Didi is hard on
herself. I have to get her through mistakes because she dwells on the bad. I
have to make her understand you have to forget about it.  
  
Alexis wants to play the perfect game. There is no such thing. Yet Alexis, you
know, she'll miss two or three shots, she'll go, My shot is off.  
  
I'm like, Really? Just keep playing.  
  
So they want to do good. Their ceiling is unbelievable. You're going into,
what, the second round of the playoffs with a freshman and a sophomore
backcourt filling in for a sophomore and a senior that played a lot of
minutes. They act like they belong. They expect to be good.  
  
Q. What has stood out to you about the way Dekeiya, Alexis and Juicy
play together for you in the backcourt?  
KIM MULKEY: Kristy is Dekeiya's buddy. They know each other well. Kristy
probably knows where to get Dekeiya the ball a little bit better than Alexis
does.  
  
But I think Juicy has become more comfortable with Dekeiya because they've
been on the floor two years together. I think Alexis' job is a little more
difficult because she has to learn every one of them's strengths and
weaknesses. Does this one like the ball here? Can this one get out and run
with me? Is this one capable of guarding somebody off the dribble? How much do
I have to help her? That just comes with playing time.  
  
I think Kristy's injury happened so late in the year, the only way that you
fix that or the only way you get that is playing. The more they can play
together, I think they'll kind of be able to figure some of those things on
the floor out.  
  
Q. What do you expect to see from them defensively? You talked about
Flaherty. They have the inside girl, Thome. What about that matchup inside?  
KIM MULKEY: It's a good matchup for us because they have the big girl, we have
the big girl. They've got a defensive stopper in Dunston, two all conference
performers. I think the matchups are good position by position.  
  
What do I expect to see? All I can tell you is what I've seen on film and
prepare for it. Sometimes a three quarter press, 1-2-2, 2-3. I mean, there's
nothing Michigan can throw at us that we haven't seen. There's only so much
you can do in the game of basketball defensively. You're not going to come in
here and change who you are offensively. We're going to have to guard them. We
understand the problems they present.  
  
But at this stage, you might tweak an inbound, you might tweak something in a
timeout, but you are who you are. We'll prepare for every defense possible
that we may see.  
  
Grambling did exactly what we thought they would do. We were prepared for it.
We'll be prepared for anything they throw at us, traps, presses, zones, just
anything. You never know with our two bigs what you might see.  
  
Q. You were a 4.0 student in high school, I don't know what it was in
college.  
KIM MULKEY: 3.82. Zoology and accounting. So I wasn't going to become a
science teacher or an accountant, but that was my two Bs.  
  
Q. I know about your rule that retired jerseys are for those who have to
graduate to get that done. How much does that play into what you do when you
recruit a point guard, if anything at all?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, with the NCAA rules the way they are, I'm not going to
recruit one that's not going to be eligible. The facilities, the resources,
everything we have here, as difficult as it is academically, you're not going
to fail here. You can't fail here unless you just don't go to class. You're
going to go to class if you play for me. That's why our graduation rate is
what it is.  
  
Then you have a private school setting of 16,000, 17,000 students. You're not
a Social Security number. How big is Michigan enrollment?  
  
Q. 35, 40.  
KIM MULKEY: You have some schools 50, 60 in your league. We're not that type
of environment. So when you go to class here, they know who you are. They are
going to sit down and I've never met a professor that wants a kid to fail.
When you're in large, large classrooms, they could care less. They don't know
who you are.  
  
Just like when I leave here, I can remember just about every one of you here,
what questions you asked, where you stood. That's what Baylor is about. You
have teachers that come to your games. You have teachers that will put you in
a position to be successful. If they can't help you, our academic people are
on top of things. Then my academic coach is on top of things.  
  
I don't go out there and go, God, I can't recruit that kid, she can't make it
at Baylor, she's going to fail out. I've never approached it that way.  
  
It is hard to get in school at Baylor if you weren't an athlete, NCAA
eligible. I don't know what the requirements are. It's expensive to go to
school at Baylor, but most private schools are.  
  
Q. You talked about a lot the other day going to the neutral sites
didn't work. For the teams like Michigan that are trying to make a run, how
hard is that for them? Do you have any suggestions on what the NCAA should do
to make it a little more equitable?  
KIM MULKEY: I was hired here in 2000. You know how many games they won before
I got here?  
  
Q. I don't.  
KIM MULKEY: Seven. You got to go build your program. The NCAA Selection
Committee doesn't go, I like Coach Mulkey, because they don't. They say, What
16 teams have proven themselves through the course of the year? I went to Duke
my very first NCAA tournament, my very first year, played Arkansas and lost in
the first round.  
  
You have to build your program and commit to your program and have the
resources and the administration that will help you build it.  
  
It seems like it's a disadvantage, but really it lies on the coach, the
school, and the administrators to build a top 16 program. It doesn't lie on
the Selection Committee.  
  
That's what we did here. Every year we kept digging, we just kept staying
hungry. We don't want to let go of that. I'm just telling you, I've been
around the game a long time. You can't go to neutral sites in the women's
game. You will see all across, back in the day when I played, Louisiana Tech,
Stephen F. Austin, those gyms were packed.  
  
In fact, I'll tell this quick story. Karl Malone played at Louisiana Tech when
I did, and we didn't play doubleheaders. It was a cult following during the
early '80s for the women's basketball program.  
  
You just have to build it. When you build it, you'll be rewarded with that.  
  
What are our options? We tried the options. It just didn't work. It didn't
work. You got a great coach. She has a lot of energy. She does it the right
way. She's one of my favorites in the business. I'm going to leave here now
and take her three children Easter baskets. That's not an NCAA violation, is
it? Got chocolate in it, a little iTunes card. They're young, okay?  
  
It's good to see her have her program here. I understand. Nobody wants to go
on anybody else's home court. I get it. But just keep building your program,
and someday you will host it. Then those teams will have to come to your home
court.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jillian, yesterday you were on a 5'6 " point guard, tomorrow likely
on a 6'4" forward who can do a little bit of everything. How do you adjust to
that?  
JILLIAN DUNSTON: I think I got a lot of experience with that throughout the
Big Ten from guarding Kelsey Mitchell to Kaila Charles, very elite players. I
mean, the height doesn't really make a difference to me as long as I give it
my all.  
  
Q. Katelynn, just in terms of the March Madness vibe, everything going
on around the country, playing a No. 2 seed on their home floor, do you take
anything from that? Do you prepare like it's X opponent?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: We just prepare like it's another game. We definitely scout
them. They're a great team. I think we've done a good job at scouting them
from yesterday. I think we did a good job executing in practice today.  
  
But at the end of the day I think it comes down to us having confidence within
ourselves, within our abilities.  
  
Q. Coach talked after the game yesterday about how it was time to play
and have fun in the tournament now that you finally made it in. Were you able
to do that yesterday? Is that the approach you're taking going into this next
one?  
JILLIAN DUNSTON: I think, yeah, I was more tense in shootaround than I was in
the actual game. I had a moment of like, Oh, my gosh, we're here. Then when we
got to the game, it all felt loose, felt good to be out there.  
  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: Yeah, knowing this is the end of our career, some of the
last games, just to have fun with it. We've worked our whole lives just to
play basketball.  
  
I think yesterday we both came out pretty loose, weren't really nervous. I
think that's why we did so well.  
  
Q. Hallie, with Kalani, she actually enjoys facing size. You had to go
against smaller players yesterday. Do you enjoy that challenge of going up
against a player of your size?  
HALLIE THOME: Yeah, I had the opportunity to play against her this summer in
USA. It's a fun battle when you're playing someone your size and ability. To
go head-to-head with somebody who is known as one of the top post players, it
will be an honor to go and do tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Kim said you're one of her favorite coaches in the business.
When you were at St. John's, you got to know each other a little bit?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I was just telling the story outside. I remember quite
some time now, probably 10, 12 years ago, Emma had just been born, I was on
the All-American committee. It might have been Sophia Young. I introduced
myself to coach after the announcement of the All-Americans.  
  
She said, Girl (laughter). Being from New York, I wasn't accustomed to that. I
know who you are, girl. I've watched your team play.  
  
She actually had watched our team, spoke very highly. I think that was the
first time we met. I think in our business, a lot of times trying to juggle
having this career and having a family is difficult at times. It's a balance
and finding that balance.  
  
When you find someone that's kind of going through it, you have a little bit
of a connection. She had seen me at that time a number of times on the road
with one of my three who I probably had to bring on the road because they were
babies, I was nursing. She was like, I've been there. I think McKenzie was
playing at the time. It kind of was an immediate connection.  
  
I think it's really important for my own children, but for the players in our
program, to have role models and mentors. For me watching her and being able
to see what she's done here for this program, or Muffet McGraw, Pat Summitt,
those are such great role models and inspiration to women and young girls.  
  
So we connected right away. I've been a fan of her and her program and just
watching her children blossom. But the players in her program really blossom.
My middle one Emma is a big basketball fan. She had a big tournament in
Indianapolis this weekend. She's their point guard. She doesn't miss any
tournaments. When Baylor showed up on the screen, Kristy Wallace is No. 4,
she's No. 4, that's her favorite player obviously next to Katelynn Flaherty
and the likes of our team. She's like, Mom, we're going to Baylor. She was
really excited to come down here.  
  
Just to watch what Kim has done, the program she created down here, it's
pretty special and incredible. I'm a fan of hers as well.  
  
Then she went and got these guys some Easter baskets this morning. I'm like,
You can't cheer for them tomorrow. I let you wear green one day of the year.
You got your green on today. Tomorrow they will be back Michigan blue through
and through.  
  
Q. You don't see size like you're going to see from Baylor, I don't know
if you've seen it at all this year. It's one thing to have one player Hallie's
size, but two of them, what kind of matchup problem is that? How do you want
to try to neutralize some of that?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: We went back, I was talking outside trying to think if we
faced any teams this year with that size. We had a great non-conference
schedule. We played two No. 1 seeds in the tournament in Notre Dame and
Louisville. We've played against some of the top teams in the country and
really tested ourselves against the top teams.  
  
But neither one of them had two players like Baylor has. That's why they're so
good. I mean, they are incredible. Lauren Cox, Kalani, a monster inside, but
Lauren is a monster inside, point guard mentality outside where she's such a
great passer, shoots the jumper so well. Incredibly difficult matchup.  
  
Jillian Dunston was being humble before. We look to her to do so much for us.
She has to guard the other team's best player, whether that's their point
guard or their five player on any given night. Tomorrow she will have that
matchup of Lauren Cox.  
  
I think Jilly's advantage in that matchup will hopefully be her speed and
maybe the ability to keep the ball out of her hands. When the ball is in her
hands, she makes such good decisions with it, whether that's passing to
Kalani, shooting it, distributing it elsewhere. She's such a great player.  
  
It's a difficult matchup. I think that's the reason probably they have lost
only one game this year. Lauren didn't play in that one game that they lost.
So they're an incredible basketball team. We know that will be a difficult
matchup.  
  
We have to somehow try to exploit that on the offensive end for us, try to
make them maybe have to come out of the paint and defend some screening action
and some ball screening action.  
  
Q. You don't have a lot of NCAA experience on this team, but you have a
lot of post-season experience. Do you think that helped them get over the
nerves yesterday, and will it help them tomorrow?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I think we saw a lot of nerves with some of our younger
kids, for sure. Akienreh Johnson, her first time. Deja Church, the first time
in this environment, was a little bit timid and nervous yesterday. Katelynn
Flaherty, Jillian Dunston and Hallie Thome, last year when we didn't get
selected, we made that run in the WNIT. We played in a championship game
atmosphere. We had to come back from being down. Those kids are experienced
playing in our league, they're experienced with our non-conference schedule,
with the likes of Notre Dame and Louisville. They have tested themselves,
whether that's been at USA or during the season against some of the toughest
competition and have been in post-season play.  
  
I thought yesterday we came out composed. I thought Katelynn was a little non-
aggressive. We really tried to go to Hallie early because we saw the matchup.
Katelynn then started to be aggressive, and Jilly was aggressive from the tip,
which I liked. When you're a senior fighting for your last opportunity to
play, I think you sometimes put those nerves aside because you don't want to
stop playing.  
  
Jillian and Katelynn have done that throughout their career. They have meant
so much to our program. I'm not ready as their coach to have them finish
playing just yet. I know that they feel the same way. So they're just going
out and trying to be as loose and composed as possible.  
  
Q. Is playing on Baylor's home floor something that you talk about to
the team? Do you prepare as if you're playing at a neutral site?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I definitely think it's obviously an advantage any time you
get to play on your home floor and you have your crowd here, your support,
your normal environment, normal game day routine. It's an advantage. We are
fortunate this year we had an opportunity to go to Ohio State after losing a
tough one to them in overtime at home and beating them on their home court in
front of a crazy crowd in a big rivalry game.  
  
Our kids know that it's possible. We don't really talk about it being here and
the advantage it is for Baylor because I don't think that's really going to
help us too much. We just talk about how great it would be to have an
opportunity to beat a team on their home court in the NCAA tournament. That
probably doesn't happen very, very often, if ever. So what a wonderful
opportunity that would be.  
  
So just focused on that matchup and just focusing on Baylor and what we have
to do to stop them.  
  
Q. Talk about Katelynn's game, what she brings, what she's meant to the
program.  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I first heard about Katelynn when she was in the third grade
because I lived in New Jersey, she lived in New Jersey. My husband was a
football coach, came home, said, I heard about this great player down the
Shore, she's in third grade.  
  
I rolled my eyes, I'm sure she's great. I'm sure her parents think she is
wonderful, probably a really great player.  
  
There we were three years later, I had my first opportunity to watch her play
in middle school. Golly, this kid really does have an opportunity to be pretty
special. I knew of her at St. John's. But at that time she was looking at
high, high academic schools. She's a great student. She was looking at some
Ivy League schools. When I first got to Michigan, she was one of the first
calls I made because I knew that Michigan education was going to be a priority
for her.  
  
I was very fearful of her leaving that area. She's the only child. Her dad has
trained her his whole entire life. He was a college basketball player at Seton
Hall, her mother was a college basketball player and softball player. They
spent every waking moment she wasn't in school with a ball in her hands from
the time she was three years old. I wasn't sure they would allow her to go
this far from home.  
  
But I have a tremendous relationship with her parents and her father. I think
he trusted she would be taken care of, she would be in a great place, she
would have an opportunity to thrive both academically and on the basketball
court, really an opportunity to grow up, her first time being away from them.  
  
Her mother always told me when they went to McDonald's, she would have to
place Katelynn's order. She didn't speak, she was quiet. Can you imagine this
kid packing up and leaving for the University of Michigan? It's just an
incredible story. The more I talk about it, I'll get emotional. Holly cow,
it's incredible.  
  
It's incredible the amount of success she's achieved being away from
everything that she knew. But really if you think about it, it's really
special. Her parents, we've been fortunate that they've been able to come out
a lot, so they have been a part of it as well.  
  
From the minute she got on campus till now, she's getting ready to leave, the
amount she's grown, more as a woman than even on the basketball court. The
amount she's grown on the basketball court has been truly incredible. She came
in as a freshman. Every time she touched the ball, like most freshmen, she
shot the ball, whether it was a good shot or bad shot. Didn't matter, she saw
the hoop.  
  
Katelynn, you don't have to shoot the ball every time you touch the ball. But
that's all she knew. Now she's recognized as one of the best point guards in
the country.  
  
It broke my heart last year when we didn't make the NCAA tournament because I
wanted so much for that team, especially for Katelynn, to be showcased on the
national scene because of the player that she is, what she can do for our
team, what she can do with the basketball in her hands, her ability to score
as a 5'7" guard. You see Baylor, what we're going to be matched up with. For
this young lady to get her shot off, is really incredible.  
  
So what she's meant to our program, it's just been tremendous. How much she's
grown, how much our program has grown. She's humble. She's not that kid that
wants to be up here. I brought her to talk to Cici's elementary school this
year, she was more nervous than Cici to get up in front of the kids and talk.
But when she does, she just lights up a room because she's so articulate, she
has a smile, she's so down-to-earth.  
  
I can't even tell you guys, my children have watched it, hopefully they can
take a piece of it, that she's worked on her craft to get where she is, it's
incredible. I've never seen anything like it in my 40 plus years of living. I
like to tell them I'm 25. I've never seen anything like her work ethic. She is
deserving of all of it. Just meant so much to our program. I hope soon we're
going to see that Katelynn Flaherty banner hanging in Chrysler Arena because
she is deserving it. Glen Rice came back to honor her when she passed his
scoring margin. She's an incredibly special kid.  
  
I don't even know if I answered your question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 96, Grambling State - 46  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with a short overview from the head coach.  
  
FREDDIE MURRAY: It was a hard-fought game. We knew actually what we had to
deal with with Baylor. I think everybody in the country knew what we had to
deal with. It was no surprise.  
  
They were a hard cover for not just us but any team that they come up against.
We fought gallantly. We thought we was able to do some things against them
defensively.  
  
But in defeat, you know, my hat goes off to them. Like I say, a lot of passes
they got throwing, you're looking at a 6'4" kid, with her hands raised being
6'8", throwing it to somebody 6'7" with her hands raised, being 7'2", 7'3". 56
of their points actually came in the paint. We thought we was able to get some
things against them early on.  
  
I think the physicality of the game was a little different, not making any
excuses, but it's a little different from our players.  
  
In our conference, a lot of the physicality is actually called from the
referees. Here at this level, it's allowed. If anything I want to bring a
light to is consistency in officiating across the board because officiating
should be the same way everywhere. Our players kind of got caught up into
calls that they generally would get in our conference, they don't get now.  
  
But those are things that we have no control over. You have to continue to
play. Baylor is a great team. But I'm proud of these young ladies. They did
something special this year that hasn't been done probably in over 19 years.
We have nothing to hang our heads down about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shakyla and Monisha, at what point did you realize these guys are
much bigger, much stronger, and it was hard to make any inroads inside?  
SHAKYLA HILL: Well, for one this is Jaz, not Mo. For two, I think we knew
right off the bat they were bigger and stronger than us. I don't think we
backed down at any point throughout the game.  
  
JAZMIN BOYD: Like she said yesterday, they still put on their shoes like we
do. We just kept fighting till the end.  
  
Q. It's one thing to see it on film, another thing to be on the court
with it. How tough was it to get going in the paint for you?  
SHAKYLA HILL: It was very tough. If anybody has ever seen me play, they know I
normally typically get to the cup with ease. I think I did that tonight still,
but I think because they were so much bigger and taller and longer, it wasn't
as easy as it normally is.  
  
Like I said, I don't think we gave up. I didn't really change anything that I
did. I just kept going until the end.  
  
Q. I think I was sitting in front of your mom maybe. She was going crazy
the entire game. What does that mean to you?  
SHAKYLA HILL: That means everything to me. Actually, I have probably the
biggest support system out of everybody. I think I needed 26 tickets for this
game. Throughout the whole season, my family, they do not miss a game. They
come to everything. They support everything.  
  
That means probably the most to me. It motivates me past anything.  
  
Q. I know this game didn't go the way you wanted it to. When the look
back at the season, what are you going to take away from it?  
SHAKYLA HILL: I think we actually had a big accomplishment. We did something
that hasn't been done in 19 years. We came here. We got here. I don't think
we're going to look at this as a negative. We're actually a young team. We
only have one senior, so everybody should be coming back. Next year we plan on
doing the same thing, but coming back bigger and better.  
  
Q. You were the hot hand tonight. What were some of the emotions you
were feeling on the court throughout the game?  
JAZMIN BOYD: I was excited. Being that they are a bigger team than us, it felt
good to hit shots on them, to score, to get in the rhythm.  
  
Q. When you were attacking the basket, you were trying to draw as much
contact as possible. You weren't getting a lot of those calls. What was going
through your mind?  
SHAKYLA HILL: Honestly, it was a lot of frustration going through my head. I
thought I was doing like what I needed to do. I thought I was getting into
their body. I thought I was drawing contact. But the refs weren't calling it.  
  
In my head, I had to keep going. There was a lot of frustration going through
my mind.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it early when you saw how well Baylor was out-
rebounding you guys?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: It was frustrating somewhat. Like I said, make no mistake
about it, we knew what we were up against. It was no surprise to us. They did
nothing that we didn't think they were going to do. We just thought we could
do certain things, keep a body on them, kind of get into their body, move them
out from where they wanted to be at in order to try to make passes harder for
them.  
  
Like I said, when you're throwing well over 12, 14, 15 feet where you are,
there's nothing you can do about that. The thing is, they're a great team. I'm
not going to take nothing away from them. Like I said, we thought we could
probably negate some of the things they did in the open court. They did a good
job of kind of clogging up the driving lanes on us, which made us more of a
perimeter-based team.  
  
In these type of games, you got to make shots. But my hat is off to them. They
going to be a tough team to beat.  
  
Q. When you take a look at how things were going at first, the ladies
never gave up, talk about what you told them at halftime.  
FREDDIE MURRAY: One of the reasons I kind of alluded to the officiating early
is because our players, that was a concern of theirs. When you don't feel like
you're fighting for them, then they kind of lose it mentally. I wanted to let
them know, Let me handle the referees, let me stay on them.  
  
Again, the physical play is different from where we play at. There's a lot
allowed today that's not allowed in our conference. It is frustrating. It's
frustrating for them because they feel like all of their hard work is going
negated. But that's something we have to continue to fight for, consistency
across the board in officiating, no matter what conference you're in.  
  
We make no excuses about today. We were beat by a greater team. We were able
to do some things against them, but they were the greater team tonight and my
hat is off to Kim and the Lady Bears.  
  
Q. Being that you've been to the NCAA tournament many times, what was
the preparation like for Baylor?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Like I said, both teams came in with a reduced roster. A lot
of players we did not have with some size we had earlier in the year. When you
have to tailor your offensive and defensive schemes to do some things, it can
only get you so far.  
  
Another team with players smaller, you might see a different outcome. Again,
Kalani Brown, Miss Fox, they are hard to cover. Like I said, I've been a fan
of them as a coach. I'm going to continue to be a fan of them.  
  
Like I said, we wanted to fight from start to finish, and I think that's what
we did.  
  
Q. Only one senior on the squad. How will that experience help with next
year's potential return back to the NCAA tournament?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: It's going to help a lot. It's going to help a lot. When
you're able to get to this level on a consistent basis, nothing is new to you.  
  
I think the players learned a lot from this. I think they're going to grow
from this opportunity. We plan on coming back here for years to come.
Hopefully it will be a much lower seed to where we don't have to have an
opponent like a Baylor the first time out.  
  
We plan on coming here. We're going to do a great job of recruiting trying to
get more size, more depth at other positions. We want to be one of those teams
that are consistently making the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. What do you take away from a game like this looking forward?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: We have to get more stronger. We have to get more aggressive
in our play throughout the season. Again, like I said, it's kind of hard to do
because of the imbalance of how officiating is throughout the year.  
  
Like I said, a lot of these kids was in high school last year playing on teams
with players much smaller and the pace of the game much slower. So to be here,
you know, just the experience from it, just taking in everything from winning
a championship, the preparation that goes into it, coming here and being
around great people. I think Waco and Baylor did a great job of hosting us
here. We're very thankful of that.  
  
Like I said, just the experience from it. I think we're going to go back to
the table, we're going to learn from that. We're going to recruit some bigger
players, recruit some more size to be more effective when you do make it to
post-season play, especially to the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 96, Grambling state - 46  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get rolling here with questions.  
  
Q. Kalani, how special was it playing Grambling knowing the connections
your mom and did have to Louisiana Tech?  
KALANI BROWN: It was great. My mom and dad told me many stories about
Grambling, how great of a school it was, how much fun they had there. Some
players I played against in AAU went there. My teammate Darae Taylor, she went
there. I haven't seen her because college split us up. It was great seeing
her.  
  
Q. Lauren, had you a career-high 30 tonight. A little bit of a slow
start really. Talk about what you were able to do inside and the way you and
Kalani shared the ball.  
LAUREN COX: I think a big part of it obviously was our size advantage. I was
just able to catch it on the low block, turn and face, just shoot over them.
Me and Kalani, we're going to be a matchup disaster for some teams. You have
to focus on one of us. When you focus on the other, then the other one's going
to go off.  
  
Q. Alexis, what stood out about your perimeter defense tonight?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: My teammates did a good job of helping us with dribble-
penetration tonight.  
  
Q. Lauren, you were able to avoid getting into any sort of foul trouble
inside, actually racked up quite a few blocks. What was working for y'all in
the paint?  
LAUREN COX: It's a timing thing. Me and Kalani both played volleyball in high
school. I think that helps a lot. It translates to the basketball game,
blocking shots. Coach Mulkey always tells the guards if somebody gets past
you, don't foul them or anything, because we're the second line of defense and
we're going to help you out.  
  
Q. Alexis, how much does this help you? We talked yesterday about now it
gets serious. How much did it help you to calm your nerves, get a game under
your belt?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: I would say it started in the Big 12 tournament. That was my
first real feel of starting. I been got the experience under my belt in the
Big 12 tournament. It helped me today.  
  
Q. Kalani, you shut down Hill. She only had 10 points. Going into the
game, what was the message from coach to you guys specifically with her?  
KALANI BROWN: She said she played against height. I guess we challenged her
shot with us being a presence in the paint. Just by us being there, it altered
her shot. Made it hard for her to get her shot off, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Mulkey.  
  
Q. You don't get a lot of these types of games, particularly first round
games. To get one like this, rest some of the players, how much does that help
going into Sunday?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Well, any time you can rest what few players we can rest,
we're thankful. We can score the ball, and I didn't think we came out and shot
it particularly well. Dekeiya doesn't miss that many wide-open shots. Juicy
missed her first couple of shots. We've been off a week. I thought we were
just a little bit rusty offensively on open looks. I didn't think that we took
care of the basketball. Had just unforced turnovers that we need to clean up.  
  
Obviously they were concerned about our height. They played the little matchup
zone. We tried to make things happen too much. Just made some bad decisions
early.  
  
But we'll take, whatever it was, a 50-point win any day and rest kids as much
as you can, particularly this late in the season.  
  
Q. You dominated inside the paint and the boards. In your point of view
how were you able to do that so well?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Those two kids, Cox and Brown, they're just special talent.
You can come up here to press conferences and tell somebody you've played
against height. Well, there's a difference in playing against height and
playing against talented height.  
  
I don't know that there are many girls 6'7" in the country really that can
play as well as Kalani. Then when you look at what Cox brings to the table,
you have to guard her on the perimeter, she can shoot the three. That helps
Kalani one-on-one in the paint.  
  
Those kids, they're just a special duo. I just get to be the lucky one to
coach 'em.  
  
Q. Was it helpful to build up that lead early to get Natalie in there,
back used to game speed?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Not just Natalie. Moon as well. Moon is a Louisiana girl. We
talk about Kalani. You forget that Moon is a freshman from Destrehan. Let's
not forget about Moon. She got 15 minutes. I tell you, she's as quick as
anybody on that floor. We had a couple turnovers. She sprinted to the other
end and contested layups. They either made them, but they had to worry about
Moon.  
  
Just getting everybody an opportunity to play. There was another opportunity
tonight to play the two managers. That's a feel-good story. They just played
in their first NCAA tournament. Those memories will last them a lifetime.  
  
Q. During the game, in the fourth quarter, Kalani and Lauren were up on
the Jumbotron. They were giving the bunny ears. They joke around all the time.
What does their relationship mean to you, if any, how Kalani talks about the
team being her family?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Well, it's not just those two. Those two are just an example
of what I get to see every day. We have many more on the team that have fun
and laugh and love and cry and hug and pull for each other. Really you have to
with only eight players in uniform.  
  
I didn't see that. I probably would have given them the evil eye and said,
Wait till the game's over. But I may not have. I may have winked at them and
said, Enjoy yourselves.  
  
They just like each other. I've coached some wonderful teams here, some
talented teams, championship teams. You can't make a team have chemistry. You
can't make kids love each other. You can't really coach that.  
  
I have to give those props to their families, to their parents. I say this
many times. Lauren Cox and Natalie Chou came to this program with All-
Americans in front of them, but they still came here. That just tells you the
unselfishness of those kids. You add Didi, Juicy. They know when they get
recruited to Baylor, there's no promises in playing time. They're promised one
thing only, we'll get you a degree. I can't promise you national
championships, I can't promise you Big 12 championships. We'll make you a
better player. We will promise you a degree, however long it takes you to get
that.  
  
When you see those kids want to come play with the talent that we have,
knowing they're going to have to work every day, that's a testament to how
they're raised.  
  
Q. Some of it was not getting the minutes, but how much better is Lauren
than she was a year ago?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: You can probably answer that just from what you saw a year ago
and what you see today. A year ago we had a bigger bench, a lot more depth. It
was a challenge as a coach to figure out who needs to play with who, develop
the freshmen. You had four seniors. It was work every day. Not that it's not
now.  
  
You don't have many decisions you have to make as a coach. When you're a
freshman and you're coming off the bench, your window is pretty short because
you can't make many mistakes or you're probably going to come out.  
  
Now they have to play through those mistakes because they can't come out. We
don't have anybody to sub for them. I think conditioning, her knees feel as
good as they've ever felt. I think her diabetes is probably under -- we just
watch her closely and monitor her diabetes. She eats healthier now. She has
fun. I think Lauren Cox is just a happy kid right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Michigan - 75, Northern Colorado - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with a short overview from the head coach then
questions from the student-athletes.  
  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Obviously just congratulations to Michigan. I thought they
played a great game. Clearly their size and their length really bothered our
team, especially in the first half. I just thought we played really a badly
executed game plan maybe or just game based on the fact that we really just
couldn't take advantage of mismatches or I think the way they were guarding
our on balls, we just didn't handle that we well.  
  
I thought we got some good looks, had some slips to the basket the way they
guarded our on balls and we couldn't make the plays because of their length
and size. It's something we don't see much in our league. We tend to be able
to play small and succeed. You clearly can't do that against a team like
Michigan.  
  
I just think that put us behind the eight ball a little bit. 15 turnovers
really kind of doomed us. We recovered and did a little bit better in the
second half. It was just too much of an uphill climb.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Savannah Scott, looked like you had some success against the Michigan
defense. What did you see they were doing out there?  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: They were just long, as coach was saying. Just trying to get
past their length, any open shot that you could get, trying to take advantage
of that.  
  
Q. Either one of the Savannahs. How difficult was it in the first half
to get good looks from the perimeter?  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: It was hard just because like we said before, their
length, kind of their aggressive defense, them hedging out on us guards. Not
being able to throw it over to the open post player was kind of difficult.
Just kind of threw us off.  
  
I don't know, I think just again their length was the hardest part.  
  
Q. You were finding some open cuts late in the second half especially.
Was that more of a halftime adjustment in running an offense?  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: Yeah, well, we went small definitely in the second half.
But I think it was more just us settling in, being like, Okay, we can score
and get good looks.  
  
Q. Kianna, can you speak to what it was like trying to guard in the post
in the second half?  
KIANNA WILLIAMS: It was really hard because she's really big. But I think I
had really good help at times, so that makes it easier, a little easier.  
  
Q. Savannah and Kianna, you're both controlled right now. When is it
tough knowing it's going to...  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: It already hit me.  
  
Q. Did it come out with your fifth foul?  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: Yeah, I was pretty mad.  
  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: It hit me kind of when I came out, but I don't think it's
going to hit me until we get back to Greeley, when they start practicing again
and we're not there.  
  
Q. Any of the three of you. These last four days, has it been more of an
eye opener, exciting, then playing a game on top of everything? Is that a lot
to consume over a short period of time?  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: Yeah, because there's a lot of attention, which is not
really what we're used to. To play a game, I don't know, just really exciting
though at the same time and really nerve-wracking.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Did you at any time in the first half think of going smaller sooner
than you did?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: I didn't really think that was the answer. I thought we could
just settle in. Even if our posts can't score, I think we're young in our five
spot. Even if we couldn't score it, I just thought just keep us in offense. A
lot of the things we talk about, let's not turn the ball over. When you have
15 turnovers at halftime, you don't have much of a chance to see a shot, if
you wanted a shot.  
  
We just kept forcing balls to players that aren't ready to catch or weren't
ready to catch or in bad position when they did catch, just couldn't simply
catch the ball. A little bit more structured offense that we tried to run in
the first half, and we didn't succeed at it very well at all.  
  
I thought we loosened up a little bit and played better in the second half. A
little bit more athleticism let us pass, cut and catch better.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about not being able to go out and recruit 6'3
", 6'4" type of players. How much going into today did you feel like they may
start pushing it inside and taking advantage of your inexperience down low?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, there's no question we knew they had an advantage in the
post. It was going to require us doubling in the post and keeping it out.  
  
Ultimately, in this tournament you have to be able to score the basketball. We
didn't give ourselves a chance in the first half to score the basketball with
15 turnovers.  
  
The game ends up being in the 70s. But good teams can score 70, 80 and 90
points in this tournament, and you have to be able to keep up. Defensively I
never thought that was the worst thing ever. It was just offensively I thought
we were just not good enough.  
  
Same old story. Savannah Smith has trouble when people put real long, lengthy
athletes on her. They did that. That made her game a little tougher in the
first half. I thought we managed that a little bit better in the second half.  
  
Again, they're not just long in one position, they're long in a lot of
positions. I thought that disrupted our offense a lot in the first half.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about their size and rebounding. How difficult is it
with no second-chance points?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, that's not completely out of -- we're not great at that
no matter who we're playing. Against this team, you just knew we were going to
rely on first shots. I thought we would get better shots than we did.  
  
Again, we regrouped a little bit and did better in the second half. Our
offense is pretty finesse, it's pretty open, the open court. You have to pass,
catch it, cut it pretty well to be successful. We didn't do that with the big
lineup. That just put us in a tough situation to be able to run our stuff,
much less get any kind of offensive rebounding.  
  
They're a good team. They make you pay, get the rebound, push it up. Their
kids run the floor well. They got some easy baskets in the first half that we
tried to make an emphasis of not letting them have. I think I'll look back and
just know that we really hurt ourselves in the first half and didn't give
ourselves a chance.  
  
Q. Did you fear at all or think you can't let them jump out and have to
play catch-up?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, yeah, you don't ever want to get behind. I didn't even
think at halftime it was insurmountable. I think as the game went on, we went
small, it made for -- we couldn't get three and four stops together in a row
to put much of a run on them. I think we may have gotten a 5-0 run, they came
right back and got a three-point play. Seemed like we made enough mistakes to
get them to the foul line or get them something easy while we were trying hard
to be better on the offensive end.  
  
Again, we scored it better, but it was pretty much an even game in the second
half. It all goes back to that same old thing that's hurt us all year. We've
had numbers of quarters where we score eight points or we score 11 points or
we have a real low-scoring quarter, and that comes back to bite you. It did.
Two of them for sure can certainly put you out of the tournament really fast.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Michigan - 75, Northern Colorado - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I thought it was a great basketball game for us tonight.
Northern Colorado is really a well-disciplined team, shoots the three
exceptionally well, and runs their offense really well. We knew it was going
to be a tough matchup for us.  
  
But I thought we came out and did a tremendous job on the defensive end,
especially in the first half. We were able to find Hallie and establish Hallie
early. That was a key for us. Then Katelynn got on fire, as she normally does.  
  
Just a great overall win for our team. Excited to be here. This was really a
goal of ours, but we didn't want to just get here, we wanted to be successful
in the tournament and keep advancing. So that was really important for us to
come out and play well today. I was really proud of our effort from the tip.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Katelynn, first time in the NCAA tournament. You didn't seem to have
a lot of nerves. What was it like as things developed for you guys?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: I think we just came out confident. I really didn't feel a
lot of nerves, just trying to take it as another game. I think that's kind of
what coach reiterated all week. Also to be appreciative of where you are.  
  
I think we got defensive stops that really helped us settle into our offense.
I think we let the game come to us.  
  
Q. Hallie, you had a pretty big size advantage in there. What did you do
to try to take advantage of that?  
HALLIE THOME: Definitely show my numbers. I know I have the guards on my team
who can make incredible passes. To have shooters like Katelynn Flaherty and
Nicole Munger, just helps a lot to be on the same side as them. Decreases the
chance of a double.  
  
At the end of the day they have to pick their battle, do you want to go with a
two or three. I definitely thought our guards did an outstanding job at
finding me. I know when they give me the ball, I'm in a position to score.  
  
Q. Hallie, did you feel before the game you were going to see the ball a
lot at the offensive end, knowing it's a mismatch in terms of height and
length and athletic ability?  
HALLIE THOME: Yeah, coach definitely emphasized that. I think she's kind of
helped my confidence throughout this whole year. With any opponent, even if
it's the same size, always saying, Hallie, one-on-one I think you always have
the advantage.  
  
Having that always in the back of my mind, then coming into the NCAA
tournament, even if I have an advantage, you know they're going to give
everything, so you just have to be prepared for anything thrown at you.  
  
Coach Arico does an outstanding job at making sure we're prepared, have a good
offensive execution, being able to take advantage of our height and size, then
taking advantage of shooters like Katelynn.  
  
Q. Hallie, when they went small in the second half, did your eyes light
up?  
HALLIE THOME: Yeah, for sure. Definitely when you see a small roster, you get
excited, but you get a little nervous on defense because of their speed. My
team helped me. The whole time I was out there hearing Kayla Robbins
screaming, You got it, you're good.  
  
Having my team behind my back, knowing I can get a stop on defense definitely
helps.  
  
Q. Katelynn, I saw a little exchange where coach said to get out there
and be aggressive. How many times has she had to say that to you in your
career? Did you need that reminder a couple minutes in?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: Yeah, she's definitely had to say that a few times. But, I
mean, just coming from your head coach, once she says that, I'm like, okay.
It's okay to mess up, as long as I'm being aggressive. It means she believes
in me, has always believed in me the past four years. I know that.  
  
It is a good reminder sometimes. Like I said, I wouldn't be half the player
without how she has my back and how my teammates have my back. I think that
really opened up the floor for me when she said that, I was aggressive.  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Forgot about that part (laughter).  
  
Q. Katelynn, you've talked about how guard oriented they are. What did
you do to try to shut them down on the perimeter?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: I mean, we scouted their defense for the past few days. I
think we really emphasized communication defensively. If we were going to
switch, we had to make sure we communicated it. They ran a lot of ball
screens, they cut a lot, made sure we were in help on the ball screens.  
  
I think we prepared really well. When it came down to it, we communicated
well. I think we messed up a little bit in the second half, kind of let our
guard down. That's something we're working on, just to continue to play even
though we're up. I think overall we did a pretty good job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. First time in the NCAA for these players. You seemed to really buckle
down in defense in the first half. How much was that a factor on the offensive
end?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: It was definitely a factor. I think I was concerned about
Northern Colorado, the way they move the basketball, the way they shot the
basketball. But we had a few days to prepare. Our kids felt really confident
in their prep.  
  
Jillian Dunston led the way. I thought she just did a tremendous job on
Savannah Smith in the first half. That's key to their team. Savannah Scott got
going a little bit in the second half. We really locked up Smith in the first
half. Jilly did a tremendous job on her. But Hallie did a great job of
protecting the paint, as well.  
  
It hurt us a little bit when they went small in the second half. It helped us
on the offensive end. Defensively that's a tough matchup for Hallie. But it
was a great opportunity for her to have to be in that position.  
  
But setting the tone on the defensive end was important for us to establish
early in the game.  
  
Q. Was there one player in particular on Northern's team you were a
little bit afraid of in terms of you can't...  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Savannah Smith. Actually watching them, I was telling
everybody that's been traveling with us, I watched one of their games with
they made nine threes before they made a two. I was really concerned about
them shooting the three.  
  
But it seemed as if Smith was really key for them, Savannah Smith. Once she
gets going, their team is really tough to stop. She had 35 points I think in
the championship game which I recently watched as well. I thought she was
critical for them.  
  
Scott is a heck of a player, as well. She really did a great job for them when
we did a good job on Smith.  
  
Jillian Dunston is a first team all defensive player in our league, so we knew
that she would provide that length on Scott and really disrupt her. I thought
she did. I thought she got a little worn down in the second half, but that's
to be expected. She was key for us, for sure.  
  
Q. (Question regarding Savannah Smith getting tight.)  
KIM BARNES ARICO: That's kind of what we watched. I went back and watched them
play against similar type teams to us. Even some of their non-league opponents
earlier in the season, when Scott didn't have a great game. I said how did
they defend them, get stops.  
  
We felt pretty confident with Jillian's length, because she's a bigger guard
and a stronger guard, she would be able to do a great job on her. She's done
that. She's had to guard point guards for us all year long. Potentially on
Sunday she can have a 6'4" kid. Tonight she had a 5'6" kid. That's the kind of
defender she's been for us.  
  
She really did disrupt, got tips on some of her shots early on. Then Smith
started to go to the basket a little bit more. Once we gave Jilly a break, she
was refreshed, able to get out more.  
  
Really my assistant coaches do a tremendous job of going back and scouting
that. We thought that was a critical matchup for them.  
  
Q. Did you have any idea they would go small? Had you seen that on
film?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: That was definitely a surprise. I thought we probably could
have gone small, but I said let's leave Hal out there, see how she handles it.  
  
No, we weren't prepared. I hadn't seen them go that small unless they had the
matchup like that. At that point in time, they have nothing to lose, and I
think that was probably a better way for them to try to go against us.  
  
It was disruptive for us on the defensive end. I thought we did a great job of
taking advantage of it on the offensive end.  
  
Didn't you feel like Katelynn came out non-aggressive (laughter)? But then she
went to work, she did.  
  
Q. You mentioned briefly when she went small, you did a great job at the
offensive end. You went to the basket. Did that come from the bench or was it
instinctive from the players?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I think it was a combination. One of the things we've really
tried to get better at, this is something -- we had a four-year starting point
guard graduate, so we have a freshman and Katelynn running the point for us
this year, which is two different roles than they've been in.  
  
One of the things we need to continue to get better at is seeing the reads. We
work on that every day in practice. Read it, read it. Especially when you have
Katelynn Flaherty on your team, two people are going at her every time. If you
can read that, you're going to have layups.  
  
I thought in the second half there were a number of times we read the defense
on their switch as well and got layups. I was really proud of our kids.
Akienreh did one time. I was really proud because that's something we've
really been working on. The defense doubling, are they switching, can we find
the open player.  
  
I thought in the second half we were able to do that. I was proud of the way
we reacted to that.  
  
Q. Did you watch their game with they were 4 for 40 in three-pointers?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I did. I watched the Fordham game. One was 0-8, one was 0-9.
Fordham is a solid defensive team. They missed some looks in that game. I went
back and looked at all the box scores, which ones I should watch. I watched
that one.  
  
I think the game wound up being 50-44. Neither team could score in that game,
but it was a defensive battle for sure.  
  
Q. How long do you enjoy this one before you turn your attention to
what's next?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I think that's a great question. For us coaches, we let the
kids enjoy it for a minute because it's tough to get here. For our team, we
haven't been here in a minute, and they need to celebrate this. Short-lived, a
few hours.  
  
But my staff has been working incredibly, incredibly hard on the film. I've
watched these teams play a ton. I know, I'll get back to the hotel and we'll
start talking about matchups, potentials. It's going to be drastically
different than it probably was tonight.  
  
But I think when the season's over, it's a great time to reflect, to look back
and try to enjoy this a little bit and appreciate this. But for our players,
that's what we talked about today, like there's no pressure, there's no
pressure. This is a game, and it's supposed to be fun. They prepared their
whole lives for this opportunity. Now let's go out and enjoy it.  
  
I was so happy that Jillian and Katelynn were able to do that tonight. Jillian
seemed relaxed. She wasn't pressing. She was able to go to the rim a couple
times and really looked confident. For a coach, that's kind of how you want
them to play and how you want them to respond.  
  
I hope they celebrate this. Most of their families are here, which is
wonderful. They'll have an opportunity now after this to go sit and watch a
little bit of the next game and spend some time with their families, then
we'll get back to work tomorrow.  
  
Q. With Church coming off the floor with an apparent injury, immediate
update on that?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, she said, Coach, I think I overreacted, which is the
cutest thing ever. She's a freshman. She hurt her ankle earlier this week, so
it's real sensitive. It's swollen, it's sore. She's kind of been tentative all
week, limited action all week. That's why tonight we went with Johnson in the
starting lineup instead.  
  
I think she was scared. Her ankle has been taped up. It's sore. She tweaked it
a little bit. But she said, I think I'm going to be okay. That was great news
to hear. She should be fine by Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. The moment, being here, getting in the tournament, how does it feel
playing against a team with such a high caliber as Baylor?  
SHAKYLA HILL: We're all pretty excited about this game. We're also pretty
excited about being here. It's actually a really great feeling. We're just
happy to be here.  
  
MONISHA NEAL: It's an honor for us to be here. Everybody is excited. We're
pumped up for the game.  
  
JAZMIN BOYD: We're all excited to be here. The experience has been great so
far. We're just seeing what's next.  
  
Q. When you see all the film of what Baylor does well, which seems to be
everything, how do you not get wide-eyed?  
SHAKYLA HILL: Us as a team, we kind of think we match up well with anybody. So
we try not to get discouraged about anything that they do. We all know as a
team that they put their shoes on just like we put our shoes on, so we're
ready to play.  
  
MONISHA NEAL: Just because it's a bigger conference, we can't look at it that
way. We have to keep our head straight and know that we can play with them,
so...  
  
JAZMIN BOYD: Playing big schools like this doesn't do anything but motivate
us. We're kind of pumped up to play them.  
  
Q. Monisha, the matchup inside with Lauren Cox, Kalani Brown, how do
y'all try to deal with that kind of size? Have you seen that kind of size this
year?  
MONISHA NEAL: We played height before. Height doesn't really matter. We're
smaller, so we're going to run on them. Height can get tired quick. That's
what we plan on.  
  
Q. Playing the tough non-conference schedule you had at the start of the
season, how has that prepared you for tomorrow?  
SHAKYLA HILL: It's prepared us a lot. Coach Murray always says it's not how we
match up with teams, it's how teams match up with us.  
  
Although they do have height, a lot of the schools we played in our non-
conference schedule, they also had height. We'll take heart over height any
day and we're really excited about this game.  
  
Q. You and this team have been in do-or-die mode since the SWAC
tournament. How do you feel that plays into your preparing of you've already
been in the situation if you lose, your season is done?  
SHAKYLA HILL: I think Coach Murray and the coaching staff, they instilled in
us this is win or go home. None of us really want to go home. I think going
into the SWAC tournament, we knew we had to play our best basketball. Right
now we're playing our best basketball.  
  
Going into this game, we're just going to continue riding this high we're on.
We plan on coming out with a win.  
  
Q. I'm sure you look at Twitter, Facebook, ESPN. How do you block out
the noise that Baylor is a 2 seed, you are 15?  
SHAKYLA HILL: I think we don't really look at the seeding and the rankings. If
you look at the SWAC tournament, we weren't No. 1. We weren't even No. 2. We
came out and won that.  
  
We don't really take that too personal. We really don't I don't want to say
care, because it's important, their accomplishments are great, but that means
nothing to us.  
  
Q. Overall what has the support been like on campus? What have fellow
students been saying to you?  
SHAKYLA HILL: The support on campus has been really big. Actually it's kind of
propelled us forward, I think so, because more people believe in us than we
actually would have thought. Like especially on social media, people have been
tweeting us, people at school coming up to us, We believe in you, you guys can
win.  
  
Coming in, I think we all know they're bigger and they're in a bigger
conference. But having the support back home, from our family and friends, it
really means a lot.  
  
Q. I don't know if you would be necessarily matched up with her, but
Alexis Morris took over at Baylor at point guard. I don't know how much you
would have seen of the Big 12 tournament. What did you see from her?  
SHAKYLA HILL: Actually, I have no idea who that is, so... I have no idea who
that is. But like I said earlier, it really doesn't make me any difference
because they put on their shoes just like we do. I'm going at whoever is
holding me, whoever I'm holding, I'm going at them the same as if they were
anybody else.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Murray.  
  
Q. From an X's and O's standpoint, what makes Baylor such a scary team
offensively and defensively?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Well, we know that Kalani Brown is a big part of what they
want to do, along with Lauren Cox. Size is definitely something that is their
strong suit. When you lose players such as we have, and they have as well, you
have to kind of tailor your offense around what your strengths are.  
  
We know what they kind of want to do going in. It makes it a little bit more
easier to prepare for. But they're a well-coached team. Coach Mulkey's success
speaks for itself.  
  
Like I said, we're going to treat this like any other game. As you can tell
with my players, we don't really get too high, we don't get too low. We
prepare for everybody the same way. The same thing is going to happen with
this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. You and this team have been in a do-or-die mode since the start of
the SWAC tournament. How does that play into an advantage approaching this
game?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: These players have heard me talk about this since I've been
here. I've been fortunate to make it to this level a few times. They hear me
talk about it so often. So for us to finally get here, they really know that
it can actually happen.  
  
Like I said, do or die, with sports, one thing about sports is that on any
given day anybody can be beat regardless of how big or how small you are. We
don't look at it as a do-or-die, we prepare every game the same. Every game
brings a different set of circumstances that go along with it.  
  
We're prepared. We've going to use this next day and a half to sharpen what we
want to try to do against them. We always say styles make fights. This is two
contrasting styles, and it should make for a great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Do you feel the non-conference schedule you had this year, pretty
tough, do you feel that set you up for a good spot tomorrow?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: I think it does. It's part of the plan in non-conference. We
play a pretty tough non-conference schedule. We were here two or three years
ago when Baylor was in the top 10 in the country. When we walked off the
court, we got a lot of praise from a lot of fans here because we were small
then. Wasn't as deep depth-wise as we are now. We were small then. People
really appreciated what they saw from our team on that particular night.  
  
At that time Shakyla Hill, Jazmin Boyd, were freshmen. They were new to it.
Now they're juniors. They come here with a different looking mindset, prepared
for Baylor.  
  
We played Mississippi State when they were in the top 10 that same year. We
played George Washington, they were in the top 20 that same year.  
  
The stage will never be too big for these players. That's why I always say,
Don't bet against the underdog.  
  
Q. What makes Shakyla Hill such a great player?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: The kid is special, man. She's special on the court, off the
court. She flirts with quadruple doubles every single night. She very rarely
gets the credit that she deserves. You all just saw the one time she did score
a quadruple double. We see it on a regular basis.  
  
She does everything for our basketball team. She has the heart of a tiger.
Like I said, we wouldn't be here without her. I'm just glad she's a junior and
we got one more year with her.  
  
Q. As someone who went to the WNIT last year, you upset Ole Miss, how
strenuous was the journey this year, never giving up on your goal of going to
the NCAA tournament ultimately?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: I alluded to it earlier in an interview. We came up short in
the championship game last year in our conference. It kind of propelled us
into summertime workouts with the mentality that we want to try to achieve our
goal. Our motto was: Road to redemption.  
  
We were able to meet that same team in the semifinals in our conference and
beat them, come on into the SWAC tournament game, win that. All of that hard
work, along with being able to beat an SEC team last year in Ole Miss, that
poses the same problems that Baylor poses. I think all that kind of works to
our advantage.  
  
We've seen teams like that before, so like I said, our team wanted this. They
wanted this from June all the way up until March. We're not here to just be
glad to be here. I think we're fortunate to be one of 64 teams playing. We
honestly are coming here looking to advance on. That's the mindset of our
players.  
  
Q. What support have you seen from outside colleagues? Friends in the
profession given you any tips on Baylor?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: I'm an old school player, I'm an old school coach. I've been
doing it about 19 years. Like I said, that's one of the things I bring to our
team, is the old school mentality. That's to prepare for everybody the same.
Obviously you come with a different game plan.  
  
But the outpouring of love around the country has been awesome. I've been in
it about 18 years, so I got friends far and wide, every conference you could
possibly think of. Everybody is happy for us. They're happy for my success.
They're happy for the team's success.  
  
One thing about it, they know as coaches, we preach the same thing to players
each game. You got to believe that you can win. This team really truly
believes that they can win.  
  
Q. How do you block out the noise from social media, and the literal
noise tomorrow night?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Me personally, I don't deal with social media. I don't have to
deal with that (smiling). They get on me about being old school, not nothing
what Twitter and all this is. I'm not really into all of that.  
  
We take they phones away from them, we take they iPads away from them. We try
to reduce as much distractions as possible at this time in preparation for the
game.  
  
They've heard it. They know. Like I said, we try to put their minds on other
things to prepare them for what we need to do. We try to block out all of that
the best we can.  
  
A lot of it you really can't avoid because it's the age we're living in. But
right now, the only thing on our mind is this game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Did you watch Alexis Morris at the Big 12 tournament? I asked Shakyla
about it.  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Trust me, she doesn't know about it, I know about it. She's a
special player. It's almost like if y'all are sportsfans, go back to the
Alabama game when Alabama was in the national championship. Their starting
quarterback wasn't performing. It was a person that came off the bench off of
their practice squad who nobody never knew anything about that made the most
in that game.  
  
We know what she's capable of doing. These players are recruited for a reason,
whether it happens at the beginning of the season, whether it happens at the
end of the season, in a tournament. They're just waiting for a opportunity.  
  
Alexis Morris is a special player. We're going to have to be dialed into her
tomorrow because she can pose some problems. Like I said, the only difference
I think right now outside of the size is they have eight players really that
are playing and we have nine players. We got one up on them (smiling).  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey was talking about how she wanted the Grambling band to
come play in the arena. Is that going to throw you off?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: Band is at all of our games. Kim is a big fan of Grambling.
She grew up in the area. She's aware of the aura around Grambling, and the
band plays a big part in that.  
  
The band was at our tournament game, as well. They are part of our fan base as
well. I don't think it's going to pose a problem. I think the fans here are
probably going to love the array of songs they going to play. I think right
now she wanted them to come and I think they are coming.  
  
Q. With the amount of connections Kim has to Louisiana Tech, the area,
are you friends, message quite a bit?  
FREDDIE MURRAY: No, we don't really message that much. We see each other a lot
of times on the recruiting trail. At the end of the day, we're all friends.
This is a small fraternity. Everybody knows everybody. I know their whole
coaching staff. Johnny is a real good friend of mine being from northern
Louisiana, as well. We all really at the end of the day are competitors on the
basketball court, but we're a family outside of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kalani, the NCAA starts now. What is the excitement level? This is
your third go-around.  
KALANI BROWN: The excitement level is high. There's nothing like this time of
year. Different teams. I'm excited to play someone new. Coming off of
conference playing everybody second or third time, seeing new opponents is
good.  
  
Q. Have y'all ever seen a player, even guarded a player, like Shakyla
Hill?  
KALANI BROWN: No, not really. I'm a post and she's a guard, for one. But no.
Closest person I've seen I will compare her to a Kelsey Mitchell. Makes a lot
of shots, penetrates, yeah.  
  
LAUREN COX: I mean, she's a real unique player. We put a lot of focus on her.
She's their best player. All conference player. Like Kalani said, she hits a
lot of shots, she's quick. We have to stop her in transition.  
  
DEKEIYA COHAN: Same thing really. She's a quick guard. She scores a lot of
points for them. We've seen a lot of guards like that really in the Big 12,
like Britt McCarty, so on.  
  
I think we'll make a good adjustment to guard her.  
  
Q. Lauren, you were in a position last year being a freshman playing
your first tournament game. You have big contributors on this team that are
freshmen. What advice would you give them?  
LAUREN COX: Just to stay focused. Don't let the hype of March Madness and all
that get to your head. We're one-and-done now, so we have to stay really
focused, take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Dekeiya, what is the comfort level playing the first game, and if you
win, the first two games here at home?  
DEKEIYA COHAN: There's definitely a lot of comfort just knowing that our fans
are here, we're going to have a lot of support, like a home court. It makes it
more comfortable. We don't have to travel. We can just do our normal routine
of a home game. It definitely makes it a little easier for us.  
  
Q. How do you not look past the fact a 15 seed? How do you keep it one
game at a time, an opponent like anybody else?  
KALANI BROWN: Upsets happen all the time because teams take 15 seeds, lower
seeds, for granted. That's how you get upset. I feel like you have to play to
the height of your potential every time or you're going to get beat. Like
Lauren said before, we're one-and-done. You can't play games with everyone.  
  
LAUREN COX: We just have to take it one game at a time. Teams like this, they
have nothing to lose. They're going to give everything they have. They're
going to throw up some crazy shots, probably make some of those. We just have
to adjust to that kind of stuff.  
  
DEKEIYA COHAN: Yeah, like Kalani said, that's how upsets happen, you take them
for granted. We just have to take advantage of playing a lower seed, just do
what we're supposed to do, which is to try to dominate the game.  
  
Q. Dekeiya, being the only other senior, how much do you miss Kristy?
How much did it help to have those games under your belt with Alexis?  
DEKEIYA COHAN: We definitely missed Kristy a lot. We missed her leadership on
and off the court. Just her being a great person in general. We're going to
miss her. I mean, it's a given.  
  
But Alexis Morris, she's definitely stepped up. She's done a great job. We're
definitely proud of her. She's doing everything we asked her to do. A couple
games under your belt before going into the tournament, it means a lot to us.
It gives us comfort, reassurance. I think it gives her confidence, as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. How many phone calls or texts have you received from guys in Lincoln
Parish ahead of playing Grambling?  
KIM MULKEY: Quite a few. You spend 19 years of your life in Lincoln Parish.
Ruston was dry. Everybody at Tech and Ruston went to Grambling to get alcohol.
Went there or you went to Wilmart.  
  
Know lots of people still living in Grambling. I hope I see them after or
before the game tomorrow. You can't say Ruston without saying Grambling or
Louisiana Tech without saying Grambling. I saw so many of Eddie Robinson's
football games.  
  
I have to be honest. We stayed till halftime. After we watched the band
perform, we left. That's what you did in Lincoln Parish if Louisiana Tech
wasn't playing somebody in football that you wanted to see play.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about what challenges you face with gambling.  
KIM MULKEY: Guard play. Obviously we're bigger than they are. We're bigger
than a lot of teams. But they have great guard play. We're just going to have
to defend Hill, just like we do a lot of great guards. Transition defense, a
lot of motion offensively. I would imagine a lot of different changing
defenses.  
  
They're going to be excited. Our kids are excited. Everybody should be excited
this time of year.  
  
Q. The one thing GSU has done pretty well is their outside shooting,
better than inside. Do you feel you have the personnel to defend the three-
point ball?  
KIM MULKEY: I do. We're a pretty good team. We've defended a lot of great
guards. A lot of people want to bring the big girls outside and defend. I
think if you watch us play, Lauren Cox isn't afraid to go out there and defend
a perimeter player. Kalani doesn't want to do it, but she's been made to do it
a lot.  
  
But we'll defend the three. If you look at the NCAA stats, our field goal
percentage defense is ranked up there pretty high. We defend the three ball
pretty good.  
  
Q. Is there any level of disappointment at all that you're not a No. 1
seed?  
KIM MULKEY: Not really. You know, I was just thinking the other night, talking
to some of my mentors, if we were 32-0, which we very easily could have been
with Cox going on that game, me possibly coaching in it, would we have gotten
a No. 1 seed? Probably not. Think about what you just said. We could have been
32-0 and probably wouldn't have received a No. 1 seed.  
  
I don't know. You can talk about non-conference strength of schedule. The
bottom line is it's so subjective. I mean, it really is. The older I get, the
longer I've been in it, we've been No. 1 seed, we've been No. 2 seed, we've
won a national championship being a 1 seed, we've won it being a 2 seed.  
  
Do I think that we're as good as some of those that got the 1 seed?
Absolutely. We played Louisville last year in the semifinals. We played
Mississippi State in the Elite 8. I thought we were as good as those teams.
It's not like they've just jumped over us and leapfrogged us.  
  
You can only pick four. They picked the four that they thought were worthy. If
non-conference strength of schedule was the deciding factor, so be it. I still
say if we were 32-0, we still wouldn't have received it. If we have Kristy
Wallace, that became a factor. If Kristy Wallace was up here today, we still
wouldn't have received a 1 seed in my opinion.  
  
It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter to me. Let's go play.  
  
Q. You said you weren't surprised by anything Alexis did. Did it help
her, maybe the other players' comfort level, in terms of what she did, getting
those games under her belt?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm sure it helped her. But honestly we expect that. Kristy
Wallace was a senior, this is a freshman. We have watched them every day in
practice. We have scrimmaged every day and watched them go at it. The scores
in the scrimmages with Alexis' team versus Kristy's team, guys, that was no
fluke. The kid can play. She's got a swag about her that she expects to do it.  
  
She's not Kristy. We miss Kristy's leadership. She's quieter than Kristy. When
Kristy was a freshman, she was quiet, too. That's why she's lucky to have
these three that were up here today help her. Lauren Cox will be a leader for
us and help her because Lauren is not afraid to open her mouth and say things
and help her get through that.  
  
It helped her probably to play it. In her world, in my mind, all she did was
expect it, and we've seen it every day.  
  
Q. How beneficial has this time off been since the Big 12 championship
to allow your team to rest up for this run?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think it's beneficial to all teams, but especially when
you're limited in numbers like we are. Having only eight players that can
play, these two big girls playing 40 minutes, three straight days, that's
asking a lot of their bodies. But they gutted it out. We don't have to do that
any more, thank goodness.  
  
Q. How have you seen Didi's play grow and improve the past couple
weeks?  
KIM MULKEY: Didi Richards, she doesn't get the credit she deserves. I think
Didi Richards, her activity, her quickness, her length, she can guard any
perimeter player. She just has an intuition on when to help a post player.
She's just somebody that I'm as confident in her ability as I am Alexis
Morris.  
  
Q. How do you not overlook the 15 seed, Grambling, just think it's an
easy spot to the second round?  
KIM MULKEY: You're looking at her. You're looking at her. I will never let a
team I coach overlook anybody. If we get beat by a team that should not beat
us, it won't be because we overlooked them. It won't be because we're not
prepared. It will be because they absolutely played better than we did and
they deserved it.  
  
That's happened to us, not with 15 seeds, but if you look at the history of
our program, our losses in the Elite 8, Sweet 16 games, a player either had an
unbelievable game that they've never played like that in their life, or a team
that went on to win a national championship after we had an injury that they
couldn't beat us the whole year. That's something that you can't prepare for.  
  
It won't be for lack of preparation. It won't be because we overlooked a team.
We'll do our scouting report. We've done our scouting report. They know
personnel. They know tendencies.  
  
You can't help the unknown. The unknown is some great performance that you
just can't stop them. But it won't be for lack of preparation.  
  
Q. You've won a bunch of NCAA games on your home court. How big of a
deal is it to play once again the one game and possibly two games here at
home?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, you know, in the women's game, we tried to go to neutral
courts several years ago. In my opinion, it was a disaster. It was a disaster
when we tried to do that. We're not ready for that. I don't know that we'll
ever be ready for it.  
  
In the women's game, fans follow their teams. You better do good during the
season because you're going to be rewarded with a top four seed if you do
good. That's just the nature of our sport. Nobody was in the stands when you
did those neutral sites.  
  
So is it an advantage? The advantage would be that you have a better team than
maybe those that come in here. But the home court doesn't win a game for you.
The advantage may be that you have more fans in the stands than the opposing
teams, but you still have to play the game.  
  
You have neutral referees that come from all over the country. Those guys are
professionals. They don't know what court they're really on. They're just
calling a basketball game.  
  
It doesn't give you a win. It just gives you a little comfort. You get to stay
in your same bed, eat the same food. But that's the way the women's game is.
It's the way it's going to probably be forever because I don't see that
changing. I've been around the game 35 years now as a player, and it's never
changed. You're not going to be able to go to neutral courts early and sell
many tickets.  
  
Q. As head coach here, then a player and assistant coach elsewhere, what
are your fondest memories of March? What stands out in your mind of the NCAA
tournament?  
KIM MULKEY: Lord, you're asking me to sit in a rocking chair and tell you
every one of them? I can't remember them all, man (smiling).  
  
At Baylor? It would have to be 2005. We were a 2 seed. We beat three No. 1
seeds to win the first championship. It would have to be before that, the very
first NCAA tournament we participated in, which was my second year here. No,
it was my first year here actually. We had Lambert and Crockram in that group.  
  
Then it would be just the 18 years that have been remarkable. What a
tremendous ride it has been. To build it as quickly as we built it, just stay
up here, got a few more gray hairs, a lot more wrinkles, a few more pounds,
but still hanging on, still doing what we do.  
  
Q. What is your relationship like with the people at Louisiana Tech? Do
you still talk to people over there?  
KIM MULKEY: I talk to Coach Barmore regularly. I talked to him the day the
announcements were made. I told him to hop on that Grambling bus, come with
them. He doesn't like to drive, stays on the golf course there at Squire
Creek.  
  
I have many what I consider family, but they're really friends, just like
family that I stay in touch with there in Ruston and in north Louisiana, the
little surrounding communities. My children were raised by a lady that lives
right there in Simmsboro. All her family live in Grambling.  
  
We've laughed about playing Grambling, me making sure Grambling brings their
band. If you've not ever been to a Grambling football game, do that before you
die because their band is unbelievable. I know it won't be a football band
here, but it has to be some of the same band members. They're entertaining,
full of life. As I told Baylor band, You better get ready because they're
going to blow you out the water when it comes to instruments.  
  
Q. You talked about Natalie getting in a softer, smaller cast. Is she
able to do everything you need her to do? Can you trust her to play more
minutes?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, yes. I could have before she got the smaller brace. The
problem with that is Juicy is playing so well. You don't want to mess up a
rotation of kids that are playing good. Now, she certainly is not the player
that she was before being injured as far as her timing on her shot, maybe
conditioning just a little bit. It matters.  
  
But she can go. She can play. If I need her to, I will. I may. It's four weeks
now since the surgery. I would imagine each day her confidence grows. But
she's doing reps in practice like the rest of them. There's only eight, so
she's going to have to help us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How has your several days been so far? Hectic? Normal schedule? Do
you feel like residents already?  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: It's been a little different than our usual trips just because
we're traveling with a cheer team, just a lot more people coming.  
  
It's been great. We got to fly charter, which is like a cool experience. Never
done that before. We're really just enjoying the new experience we have.  
  
Q. You haven't practiced today yet, have you?  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: No.  
  
Q. Yesterday was all travel? Did you practice at all?  
SAVANNAH SMITH: We practiced yesterday morning before we left.  
  
Q. What was last night like? Film and scouting report stuff?  
KIANNA WILLIAMS: We watched film and then went to bed.  
  
Q. What did you learn from the film?  
KIANNA WILLIAMS: They like to push it in transition. We're going to have to
stop Katelynn Flaherty, No. 3, she's a really good shooter. No. 30, they'll
give it to her in the post all the time.  
  
We're scouting them.  
  
Q. You do you feel like this is just one in a string of normal road
trips? Are you feeling this is different?  
SAVANNAH SMITH: This feels a little different. Even this press conference is a
little different than what we do. Just flying charter, the whole experience
just seems a lot different than what we're used to.  
  
Q. Does it raise some good anxiety?  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: Yeah, I think so. This is what everyone wants to do when
you're a little kid. You want to play in the NCAA tournament. We've finally
gotten here, so I think so.  
  
Q. Savannah, you have another chance. Can you imagine doing this like
some programs year after year after year?  
SAVANNAH SMITH: That would be so awesome if that did happen for us. I don't
know. I think just we're trying to think about this year right now, focus on
what we're here to do, not think too much about the future.  
  
Q. As seniors, what does it feel like getting Northern Colorado to the
NCAA tournament for the first time?  
KIANNA WILLIAMS: It's great. I'm just glad to be part of the first class that
was able to do that.  
  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: Like she said, it's been awesome.  
  
Q. You've had a year of many firsts and lots of records. What has been
your favorite part of the run?  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: I would say definitely just winning league championship, then
winning our conference tournament, because that's been the goal all year, and
we were able to complete that.  
  
Q. When you talk about it's been different, when did it start feeling
different? Before you left? Was it the charter that started sinking in that
this is a different kind of trip?  
KIANNA WILLIAMS: Yes.  
  
SAVANNAH SCOTT: Yeah. I think for me it started feeling different just when we
were having our view party because we've never done anything like that before.
Just seeing all the support from the community, which we had all season, but
just to have everyone come together, that's when it really felt like it for
me.  
  
Q. Nerves set in yet at all? Any nerves?  
SAVANNAH SMITH: I don't know how much nerves rather than just kind of, like,
excitement really. I think we're all just really excited to be here rather
than nervous. Just trying to have fun and enjoy the moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. How much of a normal schedule do you try to keep? This is old hat for
you when you were competing. How much did you learn from that now coaching?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, I go back to this team is doing things that we haven't
done. Then spring break came on us after Reno and our conference tournament.
We just flew kind of right into the watch party. It's not a lot of time to
think. It's not like it's real difficult that you have to deal with.  
  
We have tried to keep a little bit of a normal schedule, but it is spring
break for us. We got some rest after our tournament, since our conference
tournament just ended on Saturday. We just have had about two days to get
ready for this game, kind of prepare who we're playing for and against.  
  
The excitement part is just, you know, with your team. They don't get to do
this. It's all brand-new to them. We want to make it special. We want them to
enjoy it. We want them to make memories with it. We're making a point to do
all of that along the way because no matter how many times you're here, you
want to make it special and you want to understand what you've done and
accomplished, especially for a group that's never been here before.  
  
Q. The tough schedule that you had in front of you, and your goals, how
good is it to reach to your goal? How do you look at this Michigan team, put
them into perspective?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: It's really hard to compartmentalize. You look at your season
as a pre-season. You have those games. We finished 8-3, played some great
basketball, some great competition. So you feel prepared for that.  
  
Conference was its own challenge. We had to face some demons, our own demons
in the conference tournament where we've gotten knocked out. To accomplish
that, we got through those, now sitting here at a 13-game win streak, it feels
really, really good as to where we are.  
  
I'm glad we played a non-conference schedule like we did. I'm glad we played
LSU, Brigham Young. Colorado State is a little bit longer than us. DePaul
obviously. We played some length and some size and some really great athletes
in our non-conference. I'm glad we did that just because it gives us a chance
to kind of already have some things in our mind about what we're going to face
against Michigan.  
  
They're a power team. They're probably more traditional than we are in the
sense they play two posts most of the time, got great shooters, skill players.
Really good in the open court. They present a lot of problems and a lot of
challenges for us.  
  
But I do feel good that it's not going to be brand-new to our players.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts when you saw who the matchup was? What did
you know about Michigan before you got into the real scouting process?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: I know Kim a little bit. I think she came to K State when she
was at St. John's, then I met her a little bit through USA Basketball. I think
she's done a tremendous job. It's been fun to follow her team and see how it's
progressed, from her WNIT run last year, then making the NCAA tournament. I
know they've got to be thrilled about the direction of their program, the
steps they're taking.  
  
You're never really satisfied with your draw. You don't look up and go, Oh,
good, I'm glad we get to play them. You just shift. You're just a coach. You
just shift to, All right, let's start scouting, take a look at their games,
try to find a way to make your team successful.  
  
It's just exciting to be in the 64-team field. You got to play somebody. You
know it's going to be a quality opponent, so just do your best.  
  
Q. After all your success at Kansas State, what all did you learn there
that you took with you? You brought pretty much your entire staff from K
State.  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Gosh, I just think it's a career of being in this business. As
a player, what it was like to play at a high level. Being in a power
conference at Kansas State, you learned how to compete against different types
of teams and programs and styles of basketball.  
  
That's really how basketball is. It's not perfect. Everybody can't build the
perfect team. We probably can't go out and get more talent than a lot of teams
out there, but we have to figure out a way to play, compete, build a team that
can be successful in our own league and hopefully across leagues, as well.  
  
I think that's what we've learned. Again, we're not going to go out and get a
bunch of 6'5", we can't do that probably. But we try to play a style that can
be successful even if we're playing against bigger, stronger and sometimes
even faster teams. That's what I've learned.  
  
Basketball is a great game. It doesn't have to be played the same way. You can
be successful in playing it in a lot of different ways. I think what I've
learned over the years is just have a high standard of what you want in a
program and what you want out of your players, and build a program to that
standard, try to get your kids to want to achieve those kinds of goals and
accomplishments.  
  
In year four, really feel like we've developed our program to that level.
These seniors, upperclassmen, they've really grown from when they came in as
freshmen. It's nice to see them get to this point by the time they leave their
career.  
  
Q. I'm sure your scouting report was done before the practice
yesterday?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Yes.  
  
Q. When you practiced yesterday, was defense of Michigan part of that
practice?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Yes, yes. I mean, you try to find their highest frequency
plays. You try to have an idea of how you're going to do those. At this point
you're not going to change who you are. We're not going to morph into
something different. Hopefully you know how to defend most of the things that
Michigan does, no matter how they get to it, because you're 30 games into your
season or more.  
  
Clearly you start presenting personnel. I think that more than anything. We
got a great team with a high IQ. They want to know personnel. They get into
that. They want to know how to guard people and tendencies, a little bit of
what they do, how we're going to guard certain sets.  
  
You're pretty much what you are by this time. You need to be able to defend it
at this point. You're not going to figure it out today probably.  
  
Q. Do you dare look ahead to the possibility of Saturday?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: It's the same thing. It's the same answer. It doesn't matter.
If you were to win, you are what you are. My coaches certainly have to go
forward and have a scout and kind of look at the same thing, the two teams
playing after us.  
  
On such a quick turnaround, again, you're not going to get a lot into great
depth of sets or things that other teams do.  
  
We're just going to live in the moment right now. We're going to play this
game. We're going to compete really hard. We'll see what happens at the end of
the game.  
  
Q. You have two seniors, one underclassman, two little freshmen, Tiarna
and Alexis. Those freshmen in the last month have been huge contributors.
They're the future of your backcourt. Is it too late to be concerned of the
size of stage those two are on tomorrow?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: No, I'm not going to worry about the freshmen. I'm just going
to trust our upperclassmen, these three that were up here. I think they
prepare unbelievably well for games. I don't think they're going to change. I
think they're going to have their teammates ready.  
  
Again, this thing has gotten a little bit bigger than me. They're really good
at that. I think they're really confident in who they are as players and
leaders. I think they'll have their team ready.  
  
I love our underclassmen, the freshmen in particular, because I think they've
really risen to the occasion. Knowing these are last days of the senior class,
they want to do this for them. I think they've really played up to the level
of these seniors. That makes us have a chance at least against most teams.  
  
Q. You're a native of this state. Do you feel at home? Does the humidity
bother you?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: No complaints. We have zero complaints right now on our team
(smiling).  
  
I certainly love the state of Texas. I'm not unbelievably familiar with Waco.
It's good always to come back to Texas. Got a lot of people coming to the
game. It's a little easier trip for most of them.  
  
No complaints off this group.

## March 15, 2018

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Katelynn Flaherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32715)

### [Jillian Dunston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35033)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with some questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about being at this big stage, not getting caught up in the
bright lights of it.  
JILLIAN DUNSTON: I think this whole year, this was our main goal. It's been a
very business year. Katelynn and I, even though it's our last year, we took
the emotion out of it.  
  
It's a big deal to be here, but we don't want to get too far ahead of
ourselves.  
  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: It's awesome to be here. We worked super hard to get here.
We're trying to take it as just another game, taking it one step at a time,
one day at a time.  
  
Like I said, it's awesome, but definitely trying to keep a level head.  
  
Q. Katelynn, what does it feel like finishing your senior year in the
NCAAs after three years in the WNIT?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: Definitely indescribable. Like I've said, we worked so hard
to get here between the players, coaching staff, all our support. It's awesome
to finish like this.  
  
I think we put ourself in a great position this year to be here. I'm just so
proud of my teammates, how hard they worked, how hard our coaches worked to
put us in this position.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for head coach.  
  
Q. Obviously this is not your first time here. Have you told the players
how to treat this or how to approach this, anything different than how they've
gone throughout the year? Also, do you have any kind of different perspective
or appreciation for getting here this time around?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I think sometimes people from the outside think it's
easy to get here. It's incredibly difficult. We found that out last year when
we didn't make the tournament. I think that was a devastating blow to all of
us because we thought we were in a position to make it.  
  
But the way our team responded, to go and win the WNIT. I think the champion
of the WNIT could have made a decent run in the NCAA tournament as well.  
  
So for our team, that's obviously the ultimate goal, is to win championships.
You can't do that without getting to the NCAA tournament.  
  
I think our schedule has prepared us for this opportunity. We played already
two No. 1 seeds in Louisville and Notre Dame, then we had the opportunity to
play great teams in Maryland and Ohio State in our conference and be
successful in both of those games.  
  
I think we really prepared ourselves throughout the course of the year for
this opportunity because ultimately it's to get here, but it's to be
successful in the tournament.  
  
Once you get an opportunity to play in the NCAA tournament, anything can
happen on any given day. It's one game, it's survive and advance. It's being
the best team on that day. That's our goal starting with Northern Colorado
obviously.  
  
But trying to have our kids embrace this moment and enjoy this moment and just
leave it all out on the court and see what happens. Let's just be the best
Michigan team that we can be.  
  
Q. What has been the key to your offensive efficiency all season long?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, we're lucky to have one of the best scorers in the
country in Katelynn Flaherty. I think for me as a coach, I've been fortunate
to coach some really great players throughout the course of my career.
Katelynn is at the top of that list.  
  
I'm so happy for her to have the opportunity to play in the tournament, for
the rest of the country to see what she's capable of doing. She's such an
incredible scorer, such a great scorer.  
  
We do have a 1-2 punch in Katelynn and Hallie Thome. We have a 6'5" post
player that has incredible hands, incredible touch, can really run the floor
well. They have been tremendous for us all year long.  
  
They know, as Katelynn said, you can't do it with two players. Akienreh
Johnson has been stepping up for us offensively. And Nicole Munger has done an
tremendous job of knocking down shots as well. We had another scorer with
Hailey Brown that went down with a little bit of a knee injury earlier this
season and won't be back for the contest.  
  
I think it's multiple people on the team that can score the basketball, but
led by our all-time leading scorer Katelynn Flaherty.  
  
Q. Northern Colorado not necessarily a team that's on the major radar.
How long did it take you to get familiar with them? As you watch them on tape,
what do you see as being the keys to the matchup tomorrow?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Northern Colorado is actually a great team. I've had an
opportunity to watch a lot of film since we found out we were going to be
playing them. They're a team that beat LSU, a team that beat DePaul earlier in
the season. They can really score the basketball.  
  
They shoot a ton of threes, and have multiple, multiple, multiple shooters.
They run a motion-type offense where if they're not shooting threes, they're
back-cutting you. Really tough to defend.  
  
We've faced some teams similar to that. Last time in the NCAA tournament, we
played Villanova. We had an opportunity to play Villanova a little bit in the
WNIT last year as well. They remind me as a similar type style. You have to
make sure you're helping but then you also have to make sure you close out
with a high hand and shooters to contest those shots.  
  
I know their coaching staff, their coach. She was a tremendous player. She was
with USA Basketball with me for a little bit. They were at K State for a
while. They did a tremendous job coaching there.  
  
It's a great program. They're a program that's definitely on the rise. They've
won 14 games in a row. They've had a really good season. Not a team like
Baylor who you would see on TV as often as you do, but have had an opportunity
to watch a lot of film.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Notre Dame - 61, Mississippi State - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Notre Dame, we have head coach
Muffet McGraw. We have her five starters, Marina Mabrey, Jackie Young, Jessica
Shepard, Arike Ogunbowale, and Kathryn Westbeld. We'll take an opening
statement from Coach.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'm just so speechless at this point. To see this team come
back from yet another huge deficit, to see Arike make an incredible shot, to
see the resilience of a team that never gave up.  
  
Mississippi State was a tremendous defensive team. They really gave us a lot
of problems in the first half. We lost our composure a little bit, but we got
it back, and we just kept fighting.  
  
Thank you, Jesus, on Easter Sunday.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Amen. Hallelujah.  
  
Q. Arike, walk us through the final shot. Did you think it was good
right away? How did it feel when it went in?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: When I saw it travel a little bit, I thought so. But that
last play, there was just a lot going on. I can't even describe it.  
  
Q. Arike, were you as off balance as the video looked like you might
have been?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, I was kind of falling to the baseline. I think, when
I shot it, I was kind of at a good angle to the basket, but once I started
falling, I was a little off.  
  
Q. Kat, what did Coach say to you guys at the half? She said things
weren't going right and you lost your composure. What did she say to get you
guys to rally and win this game?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: She was just going over what we needed to work on and what
we weren't doing. We really weren't playing our game at all, and I think just
kind of getting -- she talked about getting our mental game back. I think a
lot of us were shook a little bit. Our minds were kind of going everywhere. I
think she tried to calm us down as much as possible and just get us focused on
the main goal again.  
  
Q. Jessica, Vic Schaefer in a very complimentary way said, in effect,
you put your head down and went to the basket when the outside shooting wasn't
working. Was that accurate?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think we knew we had a little bit of a mismatch when I was
at the high post driving on McCowan. When you have great shooters around you,
it opens things up. To have a one-on-one matchup makes it a lot easier.  
  
Q. Can you take us through what's going through your mind winning a
National Championship in your home state of Ohio? What's going through your
mind here?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: It's honestly so surreal right now. Just trying to process
everything. There's so many alums back, which makes it even so much better.
But just -- I'm just so proud and thankful to be on this team. And for what
we've overcome this season, for them to send our seniors out on this note,
like it doesn't get better than this. And for it to be in my home state, it's
just have all my friends and family here, I just honestly couldn't ask for
anything else.  
  
Q. Jackie, on the last play when you were inbounding the ball, first of
all, what were the instructions from Coach McGraw on the play? And then what
did you see and how did you manage to get the ball to Arike?  
JACKIE YOUNG: Initially, we were looking for Jess, but -- I mean, whenever I
was looking at it, I didn't like the way it looked. I knew, if I threw it, it
would have possibly been a turnover. So I talked to Arike before, and I was
like, if the matchup doesn't look right or if Jess isn't in the position that
we're looking for, then come back to the ball. And I just made sure that Arike
was literally coming to the ball before I passed it to her.  
  
We had confidence in her. As soon as she put the shot up, I knew it was going
in.  
  
Q. Marina, this is for you. 58-53 when Ro Johnson hits a three. You guys
haven't hit a three all night. Take me through your thinking and just sort of
what you were looking to do getting that three to get you right back to
58-56.  
MARINA MABREY: I was definitely looking to make it (laughter). We weren't even
looking for a three. We were 2 for 9. We didn't even get any. We were looking
for Jess inside, and my player left. I think she trapped down or something.
Jess just kicked it to me, and I was like, okay, Marina, it's time. You really
need to make this. So I got lucky.  
  
Q. Arike, you were 1 of 10 the first half. I don't want to remind you of
that shooting, but what got you on track the second half? It seemed like
getting to the basket certainly helped.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: It's just my teammates. They're talking to me all the time.
No matter if I'm 1 for 20 or whatever, they're like, Keep going to the basket.
We need you. So I think they give me the confidence to keep going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll take questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. What did you think when the shot went up? Did you think it's going in
again?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it was kind of a desperation shot, you know, with only
three seconds. She had a great idea of the clock going in her head and got it
off just in time. She was our second option. We wanted to go to Jess first,
but I knew that she would get a shot off. When it went through, I couldn't
honestly believe that it went in.  
  
Q. Muffet, you said the other day how this is a great thing for women's
basketball, like Friday night when you had the two overtime semifinals. I
think this just adds icing to the cake for how great the weekend was for the
sport.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Phenomenal for women's basketball. Three exciting games. I hope
the ratings reflect it.  
  
But the crowd was tremendous tonight. Everybody came back. Just an incredible
job by Columbus and the local community. Great support for women's basketball
and definitely one of the best Final Fours since 2001, right? (Laughter).  
  
Q. Muffet, the decision for you guys to go a lot more up tempo second
half, pushing to the rim, was that an adjustment to their defense, or was that
something you wanted to do all along?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No, it was rebounding. I think we were able to get some
rebounds and get going a little bit more in transition. Just really couldn't
get anything going in the second quarter. So I think the third quarter we
definitely came out and were a little more focused on trying to use the high
ball screen.  
  
Q. Muffet, we used the word "resilient" a couple of days ago. It doesn't
seem quite sufficient considering how much you guys sort of keep coming back
at it. Do you have other words that you would like to choose at this point?  
MUFFET McGRAW: What though the odds, part of our fight song. The fighting
spirit of Notre Dame is just amazing. Relentless, competitive, they have a
swagger, they believe in themselves with the confidence that starts with Arike
and Marina and just filters down through the team.  
  
Q. Muffet, Vic was in here, and he said they talk about one more. His
experience is it does come down to that one play. At this level, at this
point, is that what you've seen through the years, that it is that one turn,
that one play that changes everything?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I don't know. For us, it's -- like our thing is every
possession matters. Every possession is important. You have to get it right on
every possession. And then I think it's the runs. It's a game of runs. One
team's going to go on one. You've got to be able to withstand it and then
answer it.  
  
Q. Muffet, you talked about the fighting spirit to win your second
national title 17 years to the day after the first. What does it kind of say,
not just about you, of course, but about your program? We don't see the day-
to-day work you guys put in, but just longevity and what you've put together
at Notre Dame.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we've established a great culture. I think starting in
2011, when we were able to get back to the Final Four for the first time in
ten years, and I think the culture just perpetuates itself, starting with the
seniors and how they address the team, how they indoctrinate the freshmen into
our culture, and the work ethic. I think that's what really separates the good
teams.  
  
Q. When you did get back to the Final Four in 2011, was it almost a
feeling of like, okay, we're getting closer and closer, just any one of these
years now?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, well, 2011, Skylar kind of led us, and we had just a
really good team. And then she graduated, and we're like, now what's going to
happen next, and then Kayla McBride brought us back, and then Natalie Achonwa
brought us back. It has been fun doing it with different teams and knowing
that the culture is going to continue.  
  
Q. Congratulations. Two parts to this. One, you've talked very fondly
about this team. You always do talk fondly about your teams, but it seems like
you have a particular attachment. Now that you're at the end of the road on
this particular season, does this feel like someone -- one that's atop the
list for you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, there's been so many great teams and so many players here
with us celebrating in the locker room just now, all the former players. And
we talked about how we've done it for all of them that weren't able to finish
the job. So this team is really special just because of their personality.  
  
You know what, they're a fun team. They have a great time together. They're
always enjoying each other's company on and off the court. They have fun in
the locker room.  
  
The season's a grind. I mean, it's a long season. So you have to have a
passion for the game, and you have to be able to enjoy it, and this team,
probably more than any other I've had, enjoys it.  
  
Q. Just the second half of that being you're bringing these players
back. You're bringing reinforcements back. You have Brianna Turner coming back
from injury. Do you think this is a team that has a chance to do something
that sets it apart even from every other team you've had here?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I definitely think they have a chance. There's no
guarantees. Bringing back some good players. We're getting some good players.
We're returning some good players. The ball bounces in a funny way sometimes.
You have to take advantage of your opportunities, and that's why I'm so
thankful we were able to finish this one.  
  
Q. Muffet, you kind of just answered it there, but was it sweet having
some of those players like Natalie and Becca and those that were here to
celebrate since they were so close those years, and to take part in this
wonderful night for Notre Dame?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was great to see so many of our alums and how happy they
were for us. They were just -- they couldn't be happier for this team, for
what they've accomplished, for the whole program, for the coaching staff. We
are a family, and it's great to have them back.  
  
Q. First half, they pressed a lot, and you went between Jackie and
Marina as the ball handler. Neither one seemed to be working. What did you do
in the second half that really kind of eventually got you able to get that
offense going again?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think Jackie and Arike did a little more ball handling and
running the point, and I think that took Marina off to the wing a little bit
more. I think that was the most success that we had against their pressure
because it was really great pressure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I just want to say McCowan is an unbelievable player. She had a
fantastic game. She's so difficult to guard. She is definitely an All-
American.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Notre Dame - 61, Mississippi State - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Mississippi State, head coach Vic
Schaefer, student-athletes Blair Schaefer, Morgan William, Roshunda Johnson,
and Victoria Vivians. We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach, and
then I'll take questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, congratulations to Notre Dame on a tremendous
basketball game. Just like I saw on Friday night, there's a tremendous
passion, a relentlessness, a toughness, and a resiliency to that bunch, and
they're to be commended for that and for how they played today.  
  
At the same time, my bunch has got the same thing. This is the toughest, most
resilient team I've ever seen. Their competitive fire and competitive spirit
is second to none. Again, congratulations to Notre Dame, but I'm awfully proud
of this group.  
  
You're up five with 1:40, it's my job to get them home, and I didn't get them
home. It's always been my philosophy up four, down four, as a head coach, it's
my job to get them home inside of four minutes. And I didn't get them home
today. I'll wear that maybe for the rest of my career.  
  
But I'm proud of them. I thought they fought. These four seniors are so
special. They've done so much for me personally as well as professionally.
They spent time at my house. I've had dinner with them numerous, numerous,
numerous nights, more nights than you can count. Spent time obviously at the
gym with them over the last four years. This is a high character, classy group
of seniors.  
  
We've got great kids coming in. I've still got great kids in that locker room.
But the integrity and the character of this group is something I've not seen.
I'm so proud of them. I'm proud to be their coach. I'm proud of their fight.
They're going to be so successful in life because of their grit, their
determination, and how they embrace the grind of life as well as the grind of
basketball.  
  
It hurts right now. Again, it's not their fault. They played their hearts out,
and you just got to give Notre Dame credit. They made one more play. We talked
about it in pregame. These games come down to one more. That's been our motto.
It's on our national finalist ring a year ago -- one more. It's been our
calling card all year -- one more. Notre Dame made one more play tonight, so
we congratulate them. And at the same time, these kids right here are
champions, 37-2. That's hard to do. Especially living in my league.  
  
So I'm proud of what they've accomplished, and I'm just proud of them as
individuals. I just think they're the best. Three of them came to us and have
been with us four years. Ro turned us down the first time, but she came back
to us and been with us the last three. What a blessing. She had another big
shot tonight. I thought tonight was going to be another shot where you'd be
talking to her about a big shot she made that helped us win a National
Championship. But she made another one when we were struggling to score.  
  
Q. Morgan, sort of take us through that wild scramble at the end. What
did you see? Did Teaira foul on purpose knowing that there were two wide open
Notre Dame players under the basket?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I believe so. I got tipped, and Teaira ended up passing to me,
and I just saw Tori and got a deflection. Notre Dame ended getting it and she
just fouled. I think there was somebody open for a layup down the court. She
fouled.  
  
Q. Did you get a foul?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: No whistle, so it wasn't a foul.  
  
Q. Ladies, congratulations on a wonderful career. Thank you for
everything. Victoria, can you talk about that final play and how you guys
wanted to defend it? It looked like you were right there with Arike on that
final shot.  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: We wanted to defend it, but we didn't deny the ball. Me and
Ro was supposed to deny her and not let her catch it. So she caught the ball
and we got shut off, and she made it.  
  
Q. Ro, can you talk about that shot that you hit on the right wing.
Looked like you had a pump fake to get yourself some separation and got it off
just before the shot clock.  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: I just thought they was dropping heavy to the corner, and
once I pump faked, I saw her jump, and nobody was in front of me to pretty
much shoot. So I took the shot, and I ended up making it.  
  
Q. For Blair, what do you think -- you guys had a good lead. What do you
think changed? What changed in the game?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: We didn't get two stops when we needed to get stops, and they
obviously executed on offense and got two big buckets. And then the game was
tied.  
  
Q. Victoria, we've asked you guys kind of all weekend about the legacy
of these four seniors. What do these three next to you mean to you, and how
proud are you of them just for bringing all you have to State?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: They mean the world to me. I'm glad I came in with this
class. I'm very proud of them. I'm proud of the whole team as well, for them
to come out here and do what they did today and last year. It's never been
done at State. I'm so proud of them, and I thank them for being my teammates.  
  
Q. Blair and everyone, congratulations on the season that you've had and
the careers that you've had.  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: Thank you.  
  
Q. Blair, I saw, as Vic was talking about taking responsibility you just
shaking your head, as a player and also as his daughter, what's going through
your mind right now with what you guys have accomplished?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: He said it was his fault because he didn't get us home, but at
the end of the day, we have to go out and execute. But he's always been
accountable, and he always takes everything on his shoulders. I think one time
we need to accept that we didn't make that one more. But I'm just proud of him
for getting us back here and being able to experience this with him has been
really special. So I don't think it should be his fault, and I don't think
anyone should think it's his fault either.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a wonderful season. The defense in the
first half was so good. Percentage-wise, their adjustments, those percentages
would indicate they made some adjustments offensively and then defensively.
Can you address what they -- what adjustments they made offensively and what
adjustments they made defensively in the second half?  
VIC SCHAEFER: They stopped trying to run any offense. They just put their
heads down and drove to the rim. That happens sometimes. Our defense is so
good, if you've got kids that can drop their head and go to the rim, and
that's basically what they did. They just decided to stop doing that. They
even tried to post us still at the guard a little bit, but it never really
bothered us. I was concerned about that.  
  
But at the end of the day, they just put their head down, went to the rim, and
tried to get fouled. They went inside. Their big kid was 8 for 10, and we had
a hard time dealing with her. And, again, you give her credit. We just had a
hard time handling her.  
  
I mean, to me, you took their biggest weapons and held them to 6 for 21 and 2
for 7. You know, the two kids that we're really concerned about that had such
great nights the other night, Mabrey goes 3 for 9 with nine turnovers. I don't
know what else we could have done. Offensively, we got really good looks and
couldn't make a shot. The Achilles, we're a great free-throw shooting team,
and we go 10 for 17.  
  
Too many turnovers against the zone. Good gosh, 15 turnovers. We started the
game with five. Really disappointed in our start. You know, we forced 17. They
end up shooting 42 percent, 22 from three, but they made the big one they
needed to make. We just -- we had some really good looks that we didn't make.
You know, we got deep in the shot clock, which is uncommon for us a lot. Out
of bounds plays, not knowing the shot clock. That's uncommon for us. You know,
I don't know what to attribute that to, but we had some real -- just some real
lapses where we just didn't realize what the shot clock was even after talking
about it in a time-out.  
  
So I was disappointed. We really wanted to attack the zone and split it and
try to create, and I didn't think we did that either. I thought we were -- we
really appeased them and just threw it around and reversed the floor instead
of trying to split it and creating. That was something we talked about.  
  
So it was a heck of a first half. You give them credit. They answered in the
third quarter. And then the fourth quarter is a knock down, drag out. We had a
chance and don't get it done, and they make the one play.  
  
I still felt like, even with Tea fouling out, we go to overtime, we're going
to win the game. That's just how I felt about it, but I thought we defended
the play pretty well. The kid made a shot. Pat her on the butt, man. She made
a great shot.  
  
Q. Vic, you had a time-out when it was a tie game, and I guess that's
the play you drew up with Tea getting the layup. I mean, is that what you drew
up?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah.  
  
Q. She wasn't fouled on that one.  
VIC SCHAEFER: I mean, I'm going to her every time. I tell her that in the
locker room. I'm calling that play. I'm going inside. I'm going to let my All-
American have a bunny. She's going to get a drop step dunk, and it just -- it
didn't fall. She's had a heck of a year. She had another double double
tonight. I've got so much confidence in her.  
  
And you know what, I think she got to her spot, not their spot on that one. It
just didn't fall. But we still went down and made a play defensively, had a
chance coming back. I was screaming time-out. I don't know if anybody saw it.
I mean, the right people didn't. But I was screaming, Time-out.  
  
But, I mean, it's a bang-bang deal. It's hard. I get it.  
  
Q. Vic, this year, compared to last year, you wanted to make sure you
guys had more energy and things. Did you feel like you prepared differently
and in a way that you saw that tonight, that you guys had the energy that you
wanted to have after giving it all on Friday?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Absolutely. No question. That team is averaging 94 points a
game, y'all. How many times have they been held to 61? They got their 59th,
60th, and 61st point with three seconds to go in the game. We guarded the crap
out of them.  
  
We had a hard time scoring tonight, and we got some really good looks. Like I
said, we got deep in the shot clock, which is uncharacteristic of us. Part of
that's execution. Part of that, you got to give them credit. We've been
playing that zone all year. It's not like we just started it.  
  
They're handsy. They do a great job of stealing and taking away gaps when you
want to attack gaps. It was a heck of a game. I mean, it was a heck of a game.
It was just, like we talked about, it comes down to one play. You've got to
make one more play, and we just didn't make the play, and they did.  
  
Q. Victoria was right on Arike for that last shot. What was your talk
with them about the kind of defense you wanted to play coming out of that
time-out?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, we take away the first option. They wanted to go inside,
and we told Blair, as soon as they hand it to her, bail out and go front to
post. Zion was right behind it. I almost got a five count. Then they went and
screened it, and we switched it. Usually our rule is -- it's not usually. It
is the rule. When you switch, you switch to deny, and we just didn't get the
denial.  
  
Again, the kid made a heck of a shot. I mean, I thought we defended it well
right up to the point where the ball went through the net. Other than keeping
her from catching it, I don't know what else you could have done on it. I
couldn't have even fouled her fast enough. We'd have fouled her on the shot.
It was a catch and shoot. We couldn't even have fouled her on it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: I just want you all to know how much I appreciate you being
here, covering our great game, covering these ladies, covering our four
universities. What you do means a lot to our game, and I just wanted you to
know how much I appreciate it as a Coach that's been doing this a long time. I
just want to say thank you.  
  
Praise the Lord and Go Dogs. Happy Easter.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2018

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach
Schaefer.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Good morning, everybody. It's a great day to be a Bulldog,
giving God the glory for No. 37 last night, I believe, and just excited about
the day and the opportunity.  
  
Congratulations to Notre Dame on a tremendous hard-fought victory last night.
I think last night was great for our game. And you had two outstanding games
played by four outstanding teams. And as somebody that's done this a long
time, just proud to be a part of this industry and this game.  
  
So we're excited. Today's a pretty important day. People ask me all the time,
what did you learn last year and what would you do different? And there's
going to be some things that we'll do different today that we didn't do last
year to get ready.  
  
But just excited for our kids. I'm so happy for those four seniors. They're
getting to play it out again in their career. And, so, again, we're just
excited about the day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. When you were at this point last year you had just come off the
historic, unbelievable thing that no one outside of your locker room thought
was going to happen. Is it easier this year that there wasn't that monumental
upset to get to the championship game? It was obviously a great game last
night but not that magnitude to focus and get ready for the title game that
maybe last year would have been?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. I think that's yet to be determined as far as how we
respond. We know we're going against a tremendous Notre Dame team. Muffet is a
tremendous coach. Her and her staff do a tremendous job. And so we know we're
in -- people say, well, you thought you might -- they might have thought, we
might have thought we'd play Connecticut.  
  
The only thing worse than playing Connecticut is playing the team that beat
them. They're really good. Notre Dame is a heck of a team. And you know what?
Coming in we had an assistant already prepared in case that happened. I knew
they played earlier in the year. It was heck of a game. In fact Notre Dame led
most of the way.  
  
So we fully knew that what happened last night could happen. And so we're
prepared for that. But hopefully, like I told our kids, what we're going to do
today -- I thought last year we got beat because we looked tired the second
day. Now, whether that was from emotional distress, from, you know, just
coming off the high, or if we were just physically exhausted, which I don't
think it is, whatever the case, I can control that today. And I'm going to
control that by what we do in practice. That's something that I will control.  
  
Q. Coming off that high, have you had a chance to check in with your
team mentally today and see how they're doing today after last night's late
night? And does going through that last year, kind of experiencing the highs
and lows of that emotion, do you think that will help this time around?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know what, I haven't had a chance. Last night I think I
left the film room at 3:30. I was up at 6:30 this morning. Victoria received
the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award this morning, so we were at that award
presentation. We left the hotel at 7:20. I've been with her all morning.  
  
I just got back here 20 minutes ago. My starters are here now, but the rest of
my team isn't here yet. I haven't seen them. The only thing I've done is check
in with Julie, my trainer, on an injury report because I had some kids get
dinged up last night a little bit. So I wanted a full report on them.  
  
I'll see them here when we get done and check in with them. But we played
basically seven kids last night. So five of them are here. They seem pretty
good.  
  
Q. You talk a lot about how the loss, 98-38, two years ago planted the
seeds --  
COACH SCHAEFER: And I'm never going to outrun that, am I? That's okay.  
  
Q. But in that game, Teaira McCowan in particular was essentially your
most effective player by far. I'm wondering what you saw that day and what you
remember that made you see or think that she could be what she is now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That's a great question and the answer is that day she was
about the only one that I felt like on my team that wasn't intimidated in
Bridgeport. It was 14,000 people in there, they're all wearing blue. And she
was the only one that, to me, functioned that day -- wasn't intimidated,
competed, and just didn't seem like she was bright-eyed and wooed, just in
awe, not wooed, but in awe.  
  
I walked out of there that day feeling really good about her from that
standpoint, competitively. And then it was a matter of us going to work and
developing her, which Johnnie has done a tremendous job with.  
  
So it's a great question and I've always said, to me, that was my turning
point with her is when I felt like she was going to be what she is now,
because that day she wasn't intimidated, by the crowd, by who she was playing
against. She didn't care. And she really to me displayed that that day.  
  
Q. Can you go back a year with Tori when she was in that shooting slump
and you kept trying to tell her you can get through this, but eventually she
and some of the starters ended up moving them to the bench and coming off? Can
you go back to that and then everything she's done since then, the work she
did in the summer and the way she's kept her shooting percentage all this
year? I feel like nobody's probably upped her draft stock more than she has
this year.  
COACH SCHAEFER: When she's in that slump we looked at a lot of film, and the
film shows shot selection more than anything. Her form's always been great.
She's a big-time, high-rise jump shooter. Hard to get to her. Big frame. It's
not mechanics for her a lot of times; it's just selection sometimes and the
contested shot.  
  
Last night her first two shots they were in her shot chart, they just weren't
necessarily in mine. So that was something that I wanted to -- and again it's
just because the kid's trying, for nothing else. And again you've got to know
I've seen her make those same two shots a hundred times in her career, and I
saw her make them a hundred times in high school with three people hanging on
her.  
  
And so for her, it's just been showing film, showing shot selection, hey,
there's a hand in your face, you're contested heavily. Or, hey, you're
settling here, look who is guarding you, go get you a 10-footer instead of the
22-footer.  
  
As far as this summer, I just think the maturity of her, her confidence, she's
got a presence. People talk about swag all the time, swagger. It's hard to
have swag if you don't have a skill set. I've heard coaches say, well, we've
lost our swagger. Well you've lost three in a row. It's hard to have swagger
when you've lost three in a row.  
  
I think she's got a presence about her. She's very comfortable when we put her
at the 4. She's not only adapted to the mismatch that she has on offense, but
she knows there's been some mismatches she's had defensively. And I think that
adds to her confidence, her ability to defend better and impact the game.  
  
She's rebounding at a high level, over six a game. So I think, again, in the
summer we do a good job, I think, my staff does of maximizing our two hours a
week for eight weeks. We don't try to wear them out. But we kind of space that
out over a week where it might be four 30-minute workouts or three 40-minute
workouts. We really pay attention to detail. We're a big technique program.  
  
Q. What do you know about Jackie Young and did you know about her before
last night?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, I mean, I know she's had some big games for them. She's
explosive, very -- just a heck of a player. They've got so many weapons. All
those kids can really score, and her in particular, again. Again, I think
explosive is the best word. She can get to you a number of ways. And again I
think they're playing with a lot of confidence as well.  
  
Q. I saw you sitting on press row last night watching the game,
scouting, obviously. As you were going and watching it did you take for a
second as a fan going, wow, this is great to watch? I mean, I'd pay money to
sit and watch these two teams go at it and play basketball?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Absolutely. I was complaining about my seat because I was so
low and sitting behind people I couldn't see that well. It was a heck of a
game. You're talking about two great coaches in our industry who have had so
much success, and great players out there making plays left and right. And it
just makes you proud to be a part of this industry.  
  
So it was a heck of a game, great for our game. And one team made one more
play than the other. That's what it came down to. One play. So did I enjoy it
as a fan, probably not, because I'm throwing up, worrying about it -- it
didn't matter who I was going to play. I'd be worried about it for the next
two days. That's just who I am because I have such tremendous respect for both
those programs. But it was certainly an outstanding game.  
  
Q. If you go back to 2011 when you were at A &M, you were designing the
defense to go against Muffet. I know Mississippi State hasn't played Notre
Dame, but you've played her in a championship game. Could you talk about, even
though the personnel is entirely different, what are the things about Notre
Dame that are still the same, and how difficult is it to scheme against
them?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, they're so -- to me they just have so many weapons
offensively and they have so many ways they can score. They're smart. I'll
tell you what they do well, they pass interiorly well -- in the lane, 10 feet,
five feet -- they're just really good, they're smart and heady, even I think
their leadership really stands out especially when you go through what they've
gone through.  
  
They have tremendous leadership, and that starts at the top, it starts on the
bench with that coaching staff. I think you just admire that. I think from the
standpoint of maturity, leadership, I think they all have a presence. And
that's what their program is about, that's what our program is about; we want
our kids to have a presence.  
  
I think offensively they're multidimensional. You just can't really help
(indiscernible) -- so you've got to win some one-on-one battles.  
  
Q. Specifically what are some of the things you're going to do
differently today than you did last year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. I just mentioned it to my seniors and they screamed for
the team doctor, because they think -- I knew they would -- they've thought
I've lost my mind.  
  
We're not going to go out there and kill ourselves out in practice, number
one. We're going to really spend a lot of time stretching and especially with
those kids that played a lot of minutes last night. We're obviously going to
shoot a lot. We still haven't really shot it well. So we're going to shoot a
lot.  
  
And we'll go through their stuff and we'll go through our stuff and that will
be it. That's unusual for me because I'm typically a drill guy, a fundamental
guy for 30, 45 minutes of practice. We're going to do that come heck or high
water. Probably going to bypass that today.  
  
Q. You've got Victoria for one more game then she's going to move on to
presumably a pro career. What kind of pro do you think she's going to make as
a rookie? And do you get her ready for that pro career while you're also, you
know, fitting her into what you're doing in your season?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think, you know, if you've watched us play, you've watched
me coach her, anything and everything I've ever talked to her about, dealt
with her in coaching, in game, out of game, I'm trying to get her ready for
that next level, realizing that the next level is you've got to produce,
you've got to do it their way or they'll find somebody that will.  
  
And so I think for her, number one, she's going to be a great pro. When all
she's got to do is worry about wake up in the morning take care of her body
and eat right and go work out and not have to worry about -- right now she's
up at seven every morning and dealing with one-year-olds. Been doing it all
semester. That's part of her internship.  
  
She tells me she's not changing diapers but she's doing everything else. You
know, she does that all day until she gets to practice this semester. But just
being able to focus on her job. I think she's still a long way from being the
player that she can be. I think she's really good right now. I think she's
going to be a heck of a pro.  
  
The longer she's been with me, she's gone from being that volume shooter and
gotta score to now understanding what shot selection is and enjoying the pass
and the assist and being able to make it. In her high school career, y'all,
I'm telling you, if I didn't see it 10 times, I saw it a hundred times, if she
passed the ball there was a timeout, her coach met her at half court and she
got a chewing.  
  
I've got to break that. It's hard to break when someone's chewed out for
passing the ball all their career. So she's learned to enjoy the assist. And
we've put players with her that can finish.  
  
So she's going to be a heck of a pro. No doubt in my mind. And going to do
exactly what you want her to do all day, every day.  
  
Q. You referenced Notre Dame's struggles with injuries a little earlier.
How hard is that as a coach to overcome? And what do you have to do when you
have to change players that many times?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, a blessing for her is she's still had some pretty good
players there to play. So I think for her it's the chemistry piece. And then
it's the you've got to really, the wear and tear piece over the course of a
grueling season.  
  
You know, we've not played very many kids either. And so you've got to really
do the maintenance piece and make sure those kids are staying healthy and
taking care of themselves, too. You've got to educate them on eat and sleep
and all that.  
  
So, again, let's talk about the kids that are there. Boy, they're really good,
talented. A lot of McDonald's All-Americans there. So they've been able to
really overcome it and I think the biggest piece is just the chemistry piece
with the kids maybe playing more minutes than maybe they were going to play
and then just the maintenance of playing at such a high level all year long.  
  
They have really been able to do that. And, again, you play the schedule they
play, play the schedule we play, and it is a long, hard grind this season that
we call basketball. It's the only sport on campus that goes both semesters. If
you're doing your job, we start conditioning at our place, it starts in late
August because we start school in the middle.  
  
And if you're doing your job you're playing on April 1st. Today is March 30th.
So I think that's the thing that people miss about basketball. It's really --
it's hard on these kids. And, oh, by the way, we're going to go to class and
graduate and do all that and have good grade point averages.  
  
Q. Apologize if you've been asked this, but last year I know you had a
really crazy night at the semifinals, you had the celebration and all and went
back to the hotel, had to sign autographs. Might have gone to bed about 4.00
a.m. or something. How much different is it this year to play that early game,
scout, go home, get a little bit of rest, and get this day -- how much
different does this feel this year as opposed to last year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: It doesn't feel any different to me because I was in there, I
said it earlier, I was in the film room at 3:30 going, I did this last year,
how is this happening again? But I realize my kids had been to bed where they
hadn't been last year.  
  
Our kids got to bed quite a bit earlier obviously this year. And I've talked
to my starters this morning. And they said they feel, they're fine and they
did get some rest. So I think it will be, from that standpoint, hopefully it
won't be as difficult.  
  
You know what, the opponent hadn't changed, though. Still a heck of an
opponent. Great program. Well-coached and great players. So we've still got to
go play.  
  
Q. Last year in the postgame press conference after losing to South
Carolina you mentioned that you thought you'll be back, but you also talked
about like the confetti and that's something you're looking forward to. Have
you thought about this year, just that feeling of getting that far and coming
up just short? And is it something you kind of look back to and use to
hopefully avenge this tomorrow?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I mean, we've not dodged talking about winning
championships at Mississippi State, whether it's Southeastern Conference
championships or winning a national championship. We've talked all year about
unfinished business.  
  
But it's one thing to talk the talk; you've got to walk the walk. And I think
these kids have walked it every day in practice, preparation for games, in
games. And here we are again, we're in that game. We're in the last game.  
  
So I do think that our kids have been prepared for this moment. They've wanted
to be in this moment. And last night's a great indication of how bad they want
to be. You talk about toughness. You know, we have a saying, when it gets too
tough for everybody else, that's when it gets about right for us. It was just
about right last night. And so I think we've embraced that. And we've lived
it.  
  
Q. You talked about having the feeling like you've had a target on your
back as a team, playing undefeated for a long time. Is there any way in which
tomorrow's night is a bit of a relief -- you're here, you got to the place you
wanted to be, you kind of survived that gauntlet? Is there a bit of a relief
to get there as well?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't think so. I think our kids, you know, they want to be
in tomorrow night's game and they want to win. If we don't. I think there's
going to be a lot of disappointment. I think our kids are emotionally invested
in trying to win a national championship. They have been since day one.  
  
So while it's great to be here, you know -- some teams you just want to make
the NCAA Tournament. Other teams they're interested in that seeding and
hosting. Other teams are interested in this day. I think we've been interested
in tomorrow for a long time.  
  
Q. It was an amazing day yesterday for basketball. And both games going
into overtime, just all the theatrics and dramatic finishes. When you go
through a day like that and now you have a championship to play, what is that
like to be a part of that and the challenge of building on an amazing day of
basketball and now trying to go out and now win the whole thing?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, certainly, as a coach, I'm proud of my sport. And again
I thought it was a wonderful environment, all four teams provided, their fans
provided for our sport. And so it's a great day. We did our part. Now for us
we're in the game now. What do you have left?  
  
We have a saying: "One more." We've got one more. But also the one more means
one more when you're playing -- one more rebound, one more toughness play, one
more charge, one more steal, one more stop, one more -- it's just one more.
It's going to take a one more tomorrow for somebody. And so for us it's, I
think that's where we are right now, it's one more.  
  
Q. I think last year you played in the finals you played a team you knew
inside and out, it was South Carolina, your SEC rival. Is it easier or harder
to play a team you've never played before, that the kids don't know who the
opponent is, as far as -- that well? Or is it something new and the tension of
this is who we have to play against and that sort of thing?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. For me, obviously, it's a familiarity. So when you have
such a short turnaround, maybe somebody you've played, it helps. Obviously
we've never played Notre Dame. I played them in 2011, but, I mean, that's
completely, a long time ago.  
  
So I think it's the challenge -- again I told my staff again last night, hey,
this is where we do our job and we do it really well -- the one-day prep,
getting our kids ready, putting them in a position to be successful.  
  
I have so much confidence in my staff and I know they're going to be -- we're
going to put our kids in a great position. It's our time to make sure we do
our job so our kids can do their job.  
  
Q. I have a very short first question then a follow-up if you don't
mind. What is your why?  
COACH SCHAEFER: What's my why?  
  
Q. Do you understand what I'm referring to?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You give it to me.  
  
Q. You said you've asked the kids what is their why as to why
Mississippi State can win or should win or whatever word you want, verb you
want to use, a national championship. What is your why?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, I think for us our why has been all year why us? Why
not us? We're good enough. We're tough enough. I think our skill set's good
enough. So we talked about that earlier in the year when we lost a couple of
kids to injury and all that.  
  
That doesn't affect -- to me it didn't affect us and put us in a bad spot. So
why not us? And the answer is we're good enough. Now, we've got to go play a
great team. But in my mind two years ago I told the team before we played I
thought we had a Final Four team. This year, I thought we had a team that
could compete for a national championship. Here we are.  
  
Q. Is it fair that tomorrow's game will, could or will it define the
legacy of the seniors?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't think so. I think their legacy is etched in stone.
Certainly it would add another -- I don't know what the word is -- epithet or
whatever you want to call it -- it adds something to their legacy. But, look,
they've won 128 games now in their career. They've won the Southeastern
Conference championship, the first one in the history of the school in a
women's sport. They did what one other team has done going 32-0 in the
Southeastern Conference.  
  
So I think their legacy is pretty well set. If we win, to me it just adds
another line to what they've brought. Because what they've done for
Mississippi State and for women's basketball, in particular, really has more
to do with off the court than on, in my opinion; the impact they've had in our
community, on our fan base, on our university, the pride that they have
instilled in so many people across the country.  
  
We've got people here at the game that they're all worked up over all kinds of
things, you know, during the course of the game. And I look at them and go:
I'm wondering six years ago were you that worked up about something that
happened in women's basketball? But here we are today and it's important to
them. And what's happened is because of our kids. These seniors in particular.
But all of our kids. I call them -- I told you, I call them "The people's
team." They just love our kids. And so it's special what they've been able to
do to raise the brand of Mississippi State.  
  
Q. Seems like every opposing coaches gets asked what are you going to do
against Teaira McCowan. What have you seen coaches try to stop her and how do
you counteract that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I've seen coaches use her like a clothesline and hang all over
her. You know, that's what's so amazing about her numbers. She's just done it
night in, night out with the best game plan, the best players, trying to
attack her in so many different ways. The place where that kid's grown so much
is, you know, you take some of the beatings that she takes, it's really hard
to keep that positive attitude and not let it get to you a little bit. And I'm
not saying it's right or wrong. I'm just saying it's physical down there.
That's all I'm saying.  
  
And for her really working with her on that piece mentally, hey, you gotta
play. You've just got to play through it. We talked about playing through it
all the time, play through it. And I think she's been really good and we
continue to work with her on that. Because it can get -- it can get tough down
there. It can get frustrating. With a post player, the mental piece is as big
as the physical piece. You're down there. You're rubbing on everybody. You're
just -- it's so physical. You get a tough rebound. You outlet it. You run down
the floor. You post up. You are wide open and some guard misses you. That can
get frustrating after a couple of times.  
  
And for a big, you've got to let that go: Okay, I'm still going to go down
there and rebound and get that next rebound I'm not going to go: You didn't
get me the ball so you go rebound.  
  
You've got to have that mental toughness, hey, I'm still going to do my job,
maybe you'll catch me the next time. So I think for post players and their
development it's the mental piece sometimes as much as the physical piece. So
I'm proud of T. But, again, we continue to work with her.  
  
Q. You probably addressed this but I missed it. You've achieved so much,
but what would taking this next step mean for Mississippi State?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, it would be the first one we've ever won in any sport.
I think enough said. It's so hard to do. We live in a tremendous conference.
We know how hard it is to win those championships. But to come on this stage
at this level, compete against the teams that we have to compete against, you
know, in an NCAA Tournament and then in a Final Four, tomorrow you're going
against one of the really tradition-rich storied programs in the history of
sport. Not just women's basketball, but sport. Women's basketball.  
  
What Muffet's done there and the consistency they've done it, it's incredible.
So hard to do year in, year out. They're one of those programs, like I said,
you either have a top -- I want a top 10 program not a top 25 team. She's one
of those top 10 programs year in, year out. You're not looking down there at
11 through 20 where are they, no, they're somewhere in that top 10 year in,
year out.  
  
So you've got to -- you've got to respect that, which we obviously do and
realize how hard that is to do and so obviously they've got our full
attention. But to go against someone like that, hey, that's what it's supposed
to be. It's supposed to be this.  
  
Q. I was wondering last night how you were feeling going into overtime
and what was like your plan of attack?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, a lot of confidence. We feel like overtime is our time.
And to get to overtime to have to execute a great -- to execute that play and
then to make the shots. One thing to execute the play. Another thing to still
go in there and make that shot. And to get through and get to overtime at that
point overtime we feel like we're built for. And then we obviously had a
little momentum. And so I felt really good about it.  
  
We typically (knocking on wood) don't lose many overtime games. Historically,
at Mississippi State, even in my career, that's toughness time. We really
pride ourselves on our toughness, competitive spirit, and just the will to
win.  
  
And I think that's when you bow your back and bow your neck and that's when
toughness comes to the top. And again when it gets too hard, when it just gets
almost impossible, that's when it gets about right for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2018

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais now for Notre Dame, head coach Muffet McGraw. We'll
start taking your questions. First question right here.  
  
Q. I'm hoping you can take me through around the moments finding out
that Jessica Shepard was immediately eligible, what your recruiting was like.
She really was so much a product of the state of Nebraska her entire life and
through college. What that transition has been like behind the scenes.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think that initially she's good friends with Brianna Turner,
and she knew Arike and Marina from USAA basketball. So she had a level of
comfort and probably why she made the initial call to us. Then coming on
campus, felt really comfortable with the girls.  
  
The transition for her, I thought was seamless. She really, from the first day
of practice, was the one that was encouraging the freshmen. She picked things
up really quickly. She has a great basketball IQ, really understood the game.
So that part was pretty seamless.  
  
The hard part for us was we didn't want to put in a lot of new stuff and run
things for her, not knowing if she was going to play or not. The day of our
exhibition game, I was home. Got a call from Jill Bodensteiner, and she said
Jess is eligible. I know I was screaming and jumping up and down and couldn't
wait to get started and retool the offense to accommodate her.  
  
But it was just a great day because really, without her, I mean, we have six
scholarship players, and I don't know where we would have been.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of talk about how Mississippi State pulled off the upset
and they were out until about 4:00 in the morning enjoying the win and such.
I'm guessing you guys, you've done this before, business as usual after the
game and got an early night's sleep and such?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it was a late night, just getting back to the hotel,
getting something to eat. I think the problem was falling asleep. I think that
was the problem. Everybody was trying. They slept in this morning, and that
was good. Beth was up all night watching film, but overall I think everybody
feels pretty good today.  
  
Q. You've been in Mississippi State's position before where you're
coming back after being the runner-up last year. I wonder what that does to a
team's mindset, if that changes anything going into a championship game. And
if I could ask a followup, how much of a difference does mindset make in a
title game where you were two teams that are so well prepared and so
talented.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Nobody on my team has been in this position. I guess possibly
Kat and Coco. It's all about the mindset. Really it's all about this is a
game, two teams coming in playing for a National Championship. They were here
last year. They know what it's like.  
  
So for us, I think just a matter of continuing to do what we've been doing and
not let the pressure of the moment get to us.  
  
Q. UConn obviously left Jackie open last night. What do you do with her
heading into this game with Mississippi State knowing that she can score 32
points?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think they're going to leave her open. I think it will
be a little different defensively. I'm just so proud of her, for her. She is
somebody that has always been almost like a secret weapon. She's had huge
games. She was the MVP of our Gulf Coast Classic where we beat South Florida
and South Carolina. She's played well in a lot of big games. And even when she
doesn't have a lot of points, she seems to hit dagger shots when we really
needed them over this past weekend in the Sweet 16.  
  
But she's capable of taking over. I think she defers a little bit to Arike and
Marina. But I think she proved last night she's as good as anybody.  
  
Q. McGowan is such a dominant post. As you try to devise a way to defend
her, how does her ability to pass out of the post complicate matters?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She has 17 assists on the season. So we're hoping that she
doesn't add too much to that total. But she is a force inside, tremendous
player. Works the boards like nobody I've ever seen. I mean, she is a
tremendous rebounder. Just a phenomenal player inside. She's so dominant, both
ends of the floor. She's a tough matchup. We haven't faced anybody like that.
I mean, A'ja Wilson was really mobile and did a lot more away from the basket,
but just the sheer size.  
  
We have a player in the league, I think, that's big, but not quite as wide and
as dominating as she is. So, yeah, that's going to be a first for us. So tough
matchup.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that, what do you do? How do you contain
McCowan?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know that you can. You've got to try to get a body on
her, but she's just so darn big that you can't outjump her. We've got to try
to keep her off. She does such a great job with her body of getting great
position. So I don't know. We have a couple of plans that we'll go to, and
hopefully one of them will work.  
  
Q. Following up on the Jackie Young question, obviously, great scorer in
high school, but there's always an adjustment period. What steps or what
things has she done in the last two years to become the scorer maybe that we
saw last night? Or how has her game developed and evolved from those beginning
days?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought she came back and was the most improved player in the
summer. I could tell immediately how much time she spent on her game, and she
worked on driving the ball. She can go either way. She really was able to take
people off the dribble and finish with contact, which is something not a lot
of women can do. I was really pleased with that.  
  
She didn't shoot as much as even her freshman year. So we tried to get her to
look at the basket, but people were guarding her. So she was taking them off
the dribble. Her game is kind of -- it's still evolving. I think there's a
couple games where she made some big threes. I'd like to see her shoot more of
them. She's just really comfortable doing either one. So hopefully, she'll
take advantage again.  
  
Q. Also a question about Jackie Young. I believe that I've read that
you've compared her to some of the greatest players to come through your
program and that she might even surpass some of those players like a Skylar
Diggins. What have you seen in her development that has led you to believe
that that will be the case?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think she's most like Kayla McBride on her team,
and she can play the one, three, four position, so she's got versatility. I
think the thing she does that doesn't get talked about a lot is the way she
rebounds. She can get inside offensively especially. She can go up against
anyone and finish in the lane, but she's just a tough matchup because she
moves really well without the ball. She's got probably the best vision on our
team in terms of finding people for assists.  
  
So I think that she has the ability to -- she has no real weaknesses in her
game. She can defend, she can rebound, and she can score. She can pass. She
can handle. So she can do all these things, I think, as well as anybody we've
ever had.  
  
Q. I also wanted to ask you a little bit about Jessica Shepard. Looked
like she might have gotten a little banged up yesterday. How is she feeling?
Obviously, she got through yesterday, but how is she feeling?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know that she'll practice today. I think she's probably
just going to take it easy. Her and Kat will both be sitting on the sidelines.
I'm not sure how much time we'll put in today, a little bit of a walk through
maybe. Everybody is a little bit banged up. One more day and just got to give
it your all.  
  
Q. Coach, Victoria Vivians has really improved her shooting percentage,
has become a more efficient player this year. I wonder if you could comment on
how tough it is to guard her at 6'1 ", things she can do offensively. And then
also what you've seen of her defensively because she's improved that aspect of
her game too.  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's just a great all around player. She's going to be a
really tough matchup for us. When you have somebody with her size that can
also put it on the floor and take it to the rim, she is shooting the ball very
well. She can do pretty much whatever she wants offensively. She's just really
hard to guard. Defensively, she's a great presence for them. Their whole team,
great pressure defense. I think Vic does a great job just with their defense
and getting up and getting on the ball.  
  
She's an All-American for a really good reason. She is just a great player.  
  
Q. Obviously, you don't stop McCowan with just one player, but I'm
wondering if you've talked with Jessica a little bit about what you're going
to need from her inside to kind of take charge and slow down McCowan. You
mentioned last night that you wouldn't be here without Jessica, so, obviously,
she's going to be important for you tomorrow. Have you had a conversation with
her about what you're going to need?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have. It is literally a tall order. I think she's got --
Jess has the strength, I think, to help, but we're going to need to bring some
help, and that's really hard to do, the way they shoot the ball. So they're
going to spread you out, four out one end, and make it really tough for us to
defend her. But Jess and Coco both are going to have that assignment.  
  
Q. Muffet, you mentioned before just Vic Schaefer's team, Mississippi
State, they're going to play a lot of man, apply a lot of pressure. How do you
think your team matches up to that offensively?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we've gotten better at it. I think that they're a great
defensive team. We haven't seen that kind of pressure as often. I think
Louisville is that kind of team defensively as well. So we have had a little
experience facing that. We've got to rely on our -- kind of our bringing up by
committee. You know, I don't think one person will have the job of trying to
attack their pressure. So we'll just see if we can figure out who's going to
have the best chance of getting the ball over half-court.  
  
Q. Coach, remember being in South Bend in January when you played
Tennessee and you were down, I think it was 20 at the half, whatever the
number was, and came back with an unbelievable win. Do you think that started
the belief in yourselves? I think the Louisville game was the week before that
didn't go that way. That this team thought, okay, maybe we do have something
here, we can get this going, and now you're sitting one win away from the
championship?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Absolutely. Tennessee was the turning point of our season. I
think the biggest thing was we got a renewed commitment to defense. We played
our zone and played it a little differently. We played it well.  
  
So in the second half they could see defense can translate to offense, and it
can translate to winning. That changed our mindset. I think we went into games
knowing we could score, but now with the defense, we thought we could be a
pretty good team.  
  
Q. Coach, a long time ago, 2011, you guys haven't faced Mississippi
State, but you did face a Vic Schaefer defense in a championship game back in
2011 with Texas A &M. What are the things that are just characteristic about
defenses he coaches that make it tough?  
MUFFET McGRAW: He's got just a great mind for defensive philosophy. He,
obviously, is great at practice, getting his team to do exactly what he wants
them to do. They are pressure all the time. They take a lot of pride in their
defense. That's probably the thing that he instills in them is how much pride
they take in their defense. I think they're known for it.  
  
He is somebody that I have great respect for, and I know that he's done a
great job at Mississippi State to bring that program to where it is now from
where they were when he got there. Two years in a row in the Final Four is not
easy, and he's really done a fabulous job.  
  
Q. Muffet, just a little more about Jess. Two parts to this. One, the
fact that she's such an effective passer for you, how significant is that on a
team where you need a lot of people to do more than the usual, you know, with
a short bench? But also, when you think about sort of where she can be given
that this is her transfer year, and so she's sort of done this all on the fly.
Do you see her shooting threes the way she did in Nebraska for you down the
line? Where does her game go from here?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she's really just scratching the surface. We like her at
the elbow in the Princeton offense because she is such a good passer, and that
offense is kind of geared to have a center that can really pass. So she's
doing a great job there.  
  
She is going to start stepping out and shooting for jumpers, I think, next
year. This year we really needed her around the basket. When she steps out, we
don't have a lot of rebounding inside, and that offense is not really geared
for that. So I think next year she'll work all summer. She does get in the gym
and shoots a lot, but I would like to see her step out and do a little bit
more.  
  
With Brianna coming back next year, obviously, we'd have somebody on the
inside.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have now beaten UConn four times in the national
semifinals. In the previous three, you went on to a National Championship. The
other two didn't. Can you talk about the difficulty of when you have that? I
know both teams had overtime games last night. But when you have tough,
emotional semifinal games, coming back from that, you've had that experience
even if these kids haven't, and how do you implement that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's really tough. 2011, we beat Tennessee in the regional,
came in and beat Connecticut. Nobody had ever beaten them back to back. It was
like we were done. We were spent. That was all the emotion that we had. We
just never really recovered from it. And I think it was similar -- any time
you beat Connecticut, because of the dominance of their program, it's just
such an emotional win. It makes it really hard to kind of get back to work.
You feel like that should have been the championship game. We should be going
home right now.  
  
So it is, it's a lot of emotion. It's a lot of adrenaline. It's a lot just,
you know, on the mental part of your game. So it really is hard to come back
and try gather yourself just with one day in between. Not a lot of time.  
  
Q. Go Yankees. How did they do last night?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know. That first night that guy hit a couple of home
runs.  
  
Q. Good start by Stanton.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah.  
  
Q. Congratulations. Good luck tomorrow. I asked some of your student-
athletes about not feeling sorry for yourself with all the injuries. You
talked about resilience and how that's a good word. What have you talked to
them about, about not feeling sorry? Because that's so easy to do.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We actually didn't really talk about it at all. We just
constantly focus on what we have, what we can do, who's going to step up, how
are the roles changing? What do you need to do now? We never even talked about
where we could be or what we should be thinking. We just kept focusing them on
the future.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had teams where I think you've denied odds to get here.
You've had years where you expected to get here. Where you sort of knock on
the door a lot, is that -- how emotionally difficult is that for a coach?
Because like you said, in some years you've done everything except get the
National Championship. Or have you just sort of grinded through that even
though there's disappointments?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think I define success as achieving your potential.
So if we get to a year where we get to the Final Four and maybe that's the
potential of the team. We've had a couple of those years where we got to the
final that I really felt like that was one that got away. There was probably
two of those. So I think -- you know, for this group, this is their first
time. I try to look at it from their point of view, of first time here. Let's
see what happens.  
  
Q. A lot is made of the injuries, but I haven't seen anything about the
status of the young ladies who are not playing. You touched on Brianna, about
her coming back. Can you just let us know where they are in their respective
paths back. I haven't seen everybody. I imagine they're here with you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, Mikayla Vaughn is way ahead of schedule. She's doing
really well. Mychal Johnson, way ahead of schedule. Mychal will be graduating,
though, she will not be coming back. Lili Thompson exhausted her eligibility,
so she won't be coming back. So we have two coming back and two graduating.  
  
Q. I don't want to assume, but if I could just leave it as a general
question, for teams that might play zone against a team with as many three-
point shooters and then with, obviously, McCowan inside, what are the
challenges that you guys have to do? Because I know you said after the
Tennessee game, that was a very important game for you guys defensively to
know that you could guard. I'm assuming that will present a pretty big
challenge for you guys tomorrow.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I didn't think we'd be able to play as much zone as we
did last night. You look at Connecticut. They're a great three-point shooting
team that can all shoot. We thought, let's give it a try. See what happens.
See how long we stay in it. And we ended up staying in it a good part of the
game.  
  
We're a team that we can't get into foul trouble. We've got to play a couple
of possessions of it. We'll see what happens. But it is a tough matchup with
their three-point shooters.  
  
Q. Muffet, you've been to a lot of Final Fours as coaching in them and
just going to them. It seems that Columbus has done a really nice job so far.
It was really electric, sold out a month in advance. Just what have you
noticed from this city's first Final Four and what it's brought so far.  
MUFFET McGRAW: This has been the best that we've seen in a long time. I think
from the -- just from the people in the city, the organizing committee, the
local organizing committee, what they've done. Everything's been first class.  
  
The salute dinner was the best we've ever been to in all the years we've been
here. I think everybody's gotten behind it. The crowd was phenomenal.
Hopefully, they'll all come back for Sunday night's game.  
  
But two great basketball games with a lot of excitement. I couldn't be more
pleased with the way everything is here, from the facilities, hotels, and
everything.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Notre Dame - 91, Connecticut - 89  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais now is Notre Dame. We have Muffet
McGraw, student-athletes Jackie Young, Arike Ogunbowale and Jessica Shepard.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: So proud of this team. We got off to a great start. We had a
little bit of trouble in the second quarter and responded well. It was kind of
a dogfight, I thought. Both teams throwing punches. They made some big plays,
some good plays. We made some plays back. I thought it came down to rebounding
in the fourth quarter in the overtime.  
  
Jackie Young, I don't know what to say about her. I knew she had it in her,
and to get a career high in the national semifinal against Connecticut, I
don't think you can ask for a better performance than what she gave tonight.
Big shot by Arike, unbelievable. She does it all the time in practice, so we
weren't that surprised. Definitely an exciting big shot. And Jess was awesome
the entire game.  
  
Q. Arike, you said yesterday that you didn't remember the first meeting
between these two teams. Do you think you'll remember this one a little bit
more?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think a little bit, just a little bit.  
  
Q. Arike, could you describe what the plan was for the last shot, and
did you end your -- take us through that one.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: That definitely wasn't the play call.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Do you know what it was?  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Like we switched who was going to take the ball out two or
three times, me and Jackie. And then Jess had the open lane, and Marina got
it. And I was like, I guess I'll go get it, and my team trusted me to have the
ball at the end.  
  
Q. Did you know going in you made the shot?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, it felt good. I didn't know it was going in, but it
felt good.  
  
Q. Arike, I think you missed two free throws a little before that. Was
it sort of redemption you could have put the game away then but now you hit
the shot that everyone is going to remember for this game?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah, I can't really dwell on the two free throws. I have to
just think next play.  
  
Q. Jess, you know, you came to UConn as a freshman playing University of
Nebraska. Talk about how much you had to learn that day. Do you feel like your
journey has led you to this, and what do you think you've learned that got you
to a point where you can come in and beat them tonight?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think the UConn game my freshman year was a big wakeup call
for me. As Geno said, I was out of shape and that's why I was missing the easy
shots that I'd normally put in. For me, coming in this year I knew that was
something that I wasn't going to let that happen. Just an unreal feeling to be
playing for the National Championship on Sunday. It's unbelievable.  
  
Q. This question is for Jackie and Arike. Guys, what gave you the
confidence and faith that you guys were going to pull this out even after
UConn takes back two five-point leads in regulation and overtime?  
THE MODERATOR: Do you want to start that, Jackie.  
  
JACKIE YOUNG: I think the coaches just really prepared us for this moment.
They didn't let us get too hyped up whenever we had a lead. I think we were
able to really just keep our composure and just get the job done.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah, I think sadly we've been in this position a lot when
we were down by a big margin. I guess it really helped for this game because
we were used to it. We've had to overcome large deficits before, so we didn't
get down on ourselves.  
  
Q. I've got a few for Jackie. First, two points against Connecticut in
December. How do you account for getting 32 tonight? And when did you realize
that you were on and going to be on fire? And one more question after those.  
JACKIE YOUNG: I mean, from the start, they just left me open. And I think I
hit my first shot, and after that, we came back down, and they just kept
leaving me open. I was able to get going.  
  
Q. How did it feel, after winning a state championship in high school,
to win both state and a National Championship, if you can do that Sunday?  
JACKIE YOUNG: Yeah, it would be a great feeling. Not many people have the
chance to do that. The coaches are going to prepare us for Sunday. I think
we'll get the job done on Sunday. It's really just coming out strong Sunday
and just finishing the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
McGraw.  
  
Q. Muffet, tell us about the last play, what the design was, what the
plan was.  
MUFFET McGRAW: The plan was to get Arike to go one-on-one and drive to the
basket. We didn't think they'd foul. Tie game, we didn't want to put her on
the free-throw line. We didn't want to isolate her on the wing. She had a
little trouble getting the ball. Took a little while. We wanted to use a
little clock and shoot with five seconds left. We were trying to run the clock
down. Fortunately, the way they were playing defensively, we had no choice but
to use the clock.  
  
I probably should thank every catholic from coast to coast for all the prayers
on Good Friday at the end of that game.  
  
Q. I mean, you've played UConn 48 times now and just you had a lot of
really good games. Where do you put this one in the lore of this rivalry?  
MUFFET McGRAW: This is, I think, the second or third time we've beat them in
the semifinal. That's been our lucky charm. Can't seem to beat them in the
final. But this one, I mean, to come from behind -- well, to have a big lead,
squander that, come from behind, and with this team -- I mean, this one's
really special. It's got to be the best one.  
  
Q. Muffet, you know you have a talented team, and you know you're not
very deep, but what did they show you tonight that maybe you haven't even seen
yet to this point in the season?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought our zone was really good tonight. I thought we were
active. We moved well. I thought we did a lot of really good things. We were
on it with the press. We switched man to man at times, and we were really
aware of where the shooters were. That's something we haven't done a great job
of. But I think the resilience just really shines through and the fighting
spirit that we had tonight.  
  
Q. Muffet, I'm just curious, as far as Jess goes, to be able to get her
and get her to be able to play immediately, you know what we're dealing with,
you talked about it back in the fall, but have you reflected on how
significant that turned out to be, especially being down so many players?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Probably I would say every game, we have a toast to the state
of Nebraska and Jessica Shepard for being with us because we wouldn't be here
without her.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you appreciate what kind of showcase this was tonight?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Unbelievable. First time we've ever had two overtime games in
the Final Four. Definitely set a record for what time the game finished. I
think just great basketball. Both games, hard fought battles and exciting for
the fans. That had to be a great TV game both times.  
  
Q. Muffet, you've been in this game for a while. You said yesterday that
Jackie Young might be the best guard in the history of Notre Dame when it's
all said and done. I'm guessing tonight's game adds to that potential.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she showed what she can do. She definitely has the
ability, and I'm so excited now. Maybe this will be kind of the first step for
her to continue to be aggressive offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, after they switched their defense up a couple times, what do
you think your team realized, or what did they recognize to then kind of
settle down and stabilize a little bit?  
MUFFET McGRAW: They were changing defenses on us a little bit. I think that we
didn't handle it as well as we could have in the second quarter in particular.
We had some openings, and we weren't able to see them. We talked about it a
little bit in the time-outs and at halftime. That bothered us a bit, the way
they came out. And they're just so long. That was difficult. And I'm rambling
because I've forgotten your question. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Just was part of that your forwards, Jess and Kathryn, they had 14
assists. Was that something they recognized as the game went on?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Our posts are really good passers, and the way we run the
defense from the elbow, it requires them to look for each other. Jess got
double-teamed and found somebody open. I think that's definitely a big part of
it, the way they have the vision to pass the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, four players go down with ACL tears. What would you have said
if someone said you have four players out with ACL tears and you'd still win
the National Championship Game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I didn't think we'd have more ACL tears than losses. I think
it's just an amazing accomplishment for this team and the resilience they've
shown all year.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Mississippi State - 73, Louisville - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais for Mississippi State, head coach Vic
Schaefer, student-athletes Teaira McCowan, Victoria Vivians, and Roshunda
Johnson. We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer and take questions
from the student-athletes.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Wow, so proud of my team today, as I have been all year. We talk
about when things get a little bit tough and too tough for most people, when
it gets really, really hard, that's when it gets about right for us.  
  
Today was pretty tough. You're down three with, I don't know, 11 or 12 seconds
left and not much -- you're going to have to do something right, and a lot of
people are going to have to do it right. I thought we executed really well on
a sideline out of bounds play. We put Blair in and ran her out, and the whole
team seemed to run with her as a decoy. We put Ro out on the back side, and
Tea really set a tremendous screen for her, but you've still got to make the
shot. I thought, obviously, when you're in that position, there's a lot of
things you've got to do well in that spot.  
  
I want to really congratulate Jeff and his team and his program. What a heck
of a game they played. I have so much respect for him, his staff. I've known
them all a long time. Asia is such a tremendous player. When you have to go
against somebody like that, you'd better have somebody that can lock her down,
and I thought Ro started and then Jordan -- Jordan Danberry comes off the
bench and plays 26 minutes, really did a nice job defensively on her, held her
to 6 for 17 and has 10 points, 4 rebounds for us. Really, that kid's not
played half that many all year but was really playing well today, hit some big
free throws for us.  
  
So when you get in these ball games like this and you play a great team like
Louisville, you're going to have to have somebody on your bench step up. And I
thought Jordan did that for us.  
  
This one -- what do you say about Tea? 25 and 21? She's done it all year
against the best teams in the country, the best coaches in the country. She
did it tonight on the best stage you can do it on. Plays all 40 minutes, 6'7".  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: 45.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sorry. 45 minutes. I stand corrected. That's just hard to do for
anybody. It's hard for Morgan William to do or anybody in a smaller size, but
you put Teaira McCowan out there, and she's dragging everybody up and down the
floor. Then competing every possession. She wants to get them all. I'm telling
you, she wants every rebound, and you can see that as she's playing, how hard
she plays.  
  
But just so, so proud of these kids for -- we talk about toughness all the
time, competitive spirit, and I just thought today it was really special with
them. I've said it all year. I don't have the words, y'all, for when this is
over. These four seniors, I don't have the words. So at least now I didn't
have to have anything -- I wouldn't have had anything prepared today. At least
now we're going to play the last game in the last year, and maybe we'll figure
it out when we get to there.  
  
But just really proud of our group again today. I thought their toughness won
out.  
  
Q. Tori, it was a really slow start offensively. What did you have to do
to get things going?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: We just had to settle down and play our game. Like Teaira
said before, we need to get out of our bodies. We just need to stay calm and
do what we do best.  
  
Q. Ladies, congratulations. Tea, for all the points and all the
rebounds, Coach mentioned the screen. Can you take us through that play, what
you did to get Ro open on the screen? And then if you could talk about 25
rebounds, career high.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, on the screen, we set up the play for -- well, they
thought we were going to go to Blair. So once I saw everybody shift, I took
one fake back and screened for Ro and got her back in the middle of the free-
throw line. So I knew she was going to be open when she threw the ball, and Ro
knocked down the shot.  
  
As for rebounds, Coach always says, Go get them all. So that's what I try to
do, go get them all.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Coachable.  
  
Q. Ro, you were 2 out of 5. I think Coach even mentioned that. But you
hit maybe the biggest basket in your career. Take us through having the
confidence to make that shot. What was going through your mind?  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: Shooters never give up on a shot. I felt like, even when I
was missing, I wasn't going to stop shooting just because I wasn't making any.
My teammates got me open. The Coach wrote up an excellent play, and we just
had to go out and execute it. When I hit the shot, I mean, it made me 1 for 3
(laughter).  
  
Q. This question is for Victoria. How are you feeling right now? Going
back to the championship, what does that mean to you?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I'm feeling good. I hope they're feeling good too. It means
a lot. This is our second time doing it, and we're still making history for
our school. I just feel like this year, we're going to have to execute and
finish it all out and be on top this time.  
  
Q. Victoria, you were out with four fouls, and they pushed the lead to
seven. You came back in, and immediately it was like a 10-0 run. What was it
like watching the game start to maybe get away from you, and how were you able
to affect the game when you came back in with the four fouls?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I didn't feel like the game got away from me. I just feel
like I had slow down and focus and be mature about what I was doing at the
time because my team needed me. When I got back in, I was making smart
decisions. I guess in overtime I didn't make a smart decision, and I fouled
out. But, hey, my team finished it out well. I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. Teaira, speak of that, Victoria just spoke of a while ago, you guys
had that huge win last year and then didn't finish it up. How much has that
driven you guys? Everybody keeps talking about how UConn has been driven by
that loss, but how much does that drive you all that you didn't finish your
business last year?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: It drives us because we didn't do all the small things that
Coach talks about. Sometimes as players, we blow Coach off and say we'll do it
in the game. Sometimes in the game you can't turn it off like that. So we
focused on boxing out, rebounding, playing plays out, and that's gotten us to
where we are today.  
  
Q. Coach Walz said you were the biggest difference between the teams,
that they were going to try to push you out to keep you off the offensive
boards. You only had five shot attempts in the first half. But we've talked
all season about the wearing effect. They tried multiple players on you. How
much did you sense the wearing effect and picking up steam as the game went
on?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, I mean, they were subbing them out, so I didn't really
know who I had. So I guess I was wearing them pretty good.  
  
Q. Teaira, congratulations. Just wanted to know whether you had talked
to Vic before the game about were you going to be in for the duration. When
did you realize you would be potentially playing all 40 and then all 45? And
just down the stretch, how you managed to gain speed. Even in OT, you're
making those plays that define the game in the final minutes.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, in practice we play bulldog, it's a little scrimmage of
five minutes. It's the toughest five minutes ever. That just really prepares
me in the game. You don't get any subs. So you're just going three games, five
minutes -- four minutes?  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Four minutes.  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: So, yeah, just going and competing.  
  
Q. Teaira, back to you again. I told you in the hall before the game
started, I saw you making those faces on television after the -- in the
interview at the end of the regional. But what was that look on your face as
you -- at the end of the game tonight? It was a scowl? How would you describe
it? And what did it mean?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: This one?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I just was feeling, I was in the moment. Came up with a face.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Welcome to my world (laughter).  
  
Q. This is for Victoria. Obviously, you guys tied the game. There was
that wild sequence at the end. Did it almost take some pressure off you guys
going into overtime? What did you guys say to each other before overtime
started?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Yeah, it take pressure off because we know we're an overtime
team. If it's overtime, we say it's our time, it's our game. I feel like
everybody just locked in, locked down, and they knew what it was time to do
and we came out with the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll take questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. You have so many weapons, but what in that
final sequence had you draw the play up for Ro, given what was already said
about where she was tonight up until that point?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I don't think you can get caught up into where she is
tonight. I mean, I've seen that kid for three years now, I've said it for
three years. She's a pro. She's going to get to play basketball a long time
after Sunday, and she wants to be in that moment. Her and Blair, I could have
picked either one, but I really felt like they were going to run with Blair. I
thought she'd be a great decoy.  
  
Plus we were on this side, and we brought it back to her left hand. So that
was the side that you want to bring it to Ro on. So I just felt really
confident. That's a play we've run several times. Not a lot lately. So if you
hadn't gone back a ways, you might not get that in your scout. But, again, I
thought, when Blair took off across the top, they just -- they were running
with her. I knew the back end would come wide open if Tea could just catch
half of her, and she caught all of her.  
  
Ro's got to make a shot. Let's face it. It's the biggest shot of the night, of
your career, on the biggest stage you're ever going to play on. I don't care
where she plays after this. That stage out there tonight is the biggest stage
you're ever going to play on in my opinion, and it's going to have the most
ramifications. So, you know, I've got a lot of confidence in Roshunda Johnson.
She's been somebody we've just been really blessed to have, and she's made the
difference in our team many nights, as you know.  
  
Q. Vic, you got big performances from a lot of players tonight, but what
Jordan Danberry gave you off the bench, what kind of contribution did she
have? And did you expect you'd get as much out of her as you did tonight?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't think I expected that much. I don't know that I expected
her to play 26 minutes. She hasn't played 20 minutes, I don't think, all year.
But she was really doing a good job defensively, and we were doing a poor job
rebounding.  
  
Jeff, his team is so relentless on the boards. That's their toughness. And we
knew going in, we've had two really bad days, y'all, of rebounding in
practice, and it's not something we've had an issue with, but we've had two
bad days of it, and it reared its ugly head tonight.  
  
Jordan gives us that rebounding edge at the guard spot. But I thought she was
doing a really good job on Asia. You know, between her and Ro just trying to
rotate fresh people on her, giving her a different look. Both of them maybe
lack a little size, but, boy, they bring a lot of quickness and savvy. So just
trying to do that.  
  
And at the end of the night, Jordan really was the difference, I think, in a
lot of areas for us, both ends, obviously.  
  
Q. Vic, I mean, Tori's had a lot of great games during her career. This
seemed like one of her best, just getting you buckets during the tough minutes
when it was hard for you guys to find offense. That's not much of a statement
-- it's more of a statement than a question, I guess, but she played like an
All-American tonight.  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, she gets 25, and I wouldn't have guessed she had 25. It
was pretty quiet. But she made a couple of big threes when we needed them. You
know, her start was not what I wanted it to be. But, again, when you need a
bucket, she's a good one to go to. We went with her and Tea both, just trying
to isolate them a lot down the stretch.  
  
Victoria's been in that moment, as you know, all her life. You score 5,700
points in your high school career, you've probably done that a bunch, and then
she's done it for us for four years. I can't think of anybody better to have
the ball in her hands in that moment when you're really dying on the vine and
you need a bucket. She's just, you know, tonight struggled a little bit
defensively, then picked it up, struggled rebounding a little bit, then picked
it up. But just like last year, remember, she fouled out last year in this
game. I don't think she's fouled out but twice in two years, and it's both in
the semifinals in overtime. Killing me.  
  
Q. With the game that was so passionate and so physical, how do you get
your group to regroup for Sunday with a possible rematch of last year?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, no matter who we play, I think it's real important from
this moment on that we do some things a little different. The fact that we
were able to play in the first game and not the second game. You know, last
year we walked out of this arena, went back to the Loews hotel in Dallas,
Texas, and walked through the lobby at 1:35 in the morning, and there were
5,000 people waiting on us. I mean, you talk about an amazing atmosphere, but
still you're walking out of there really late.  
  
So tomorrow will be different. Coach Schaefer will do some things different. I
already had planned it if we advanced. There's just got to be a way that I
need to manage it differently, so we will. You know, our kids, especially
those four seniors, they got one left. We've had this opportunity before,
didn't go the way we wanted to. It doesn't matter who we play tomorrow, y'all,
both those teams are monsters. Super talented, well coached. It's the best of
the best. So you'd better be ready.  
  
And I think our kids, you know, we'll do everything we can to get them ready.  
  
Q. In the short time you have to celebrate before Sunday, you can look
at Teaira's 25 rebounds, putting you guys in the record books for a Final Four
record. Any thoughts on that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Again, she's an All-American. It doesn't surprise me. Just
really proud of her development, continue to be proud of her development in so
many areas, not just as a basketball player. You know, tonight, we all were
out there. I mean, she's got a couple people hanging on her most of the night.
That can wear on you a little bit. She was able to really control her
emotions, I thought, tonight in a really positive way. That's some growth for
her.  
  
So proud of her. But am I surprised? I'd have to say, no, I've seen her get 30
and 20 in our league. The kid's done it night after night after night. So
she's a warrior. If there's a better five player in the country, y'all bring
her. I'd like to see her because she is an absolute monster. I love her to
death. I'm not trading her for anybody.  
  
Q. Vic, I think you guys kind of arrived in the eyes of the, I guess,
general sports fan public last year with that win over UConn, but then to
follow that up with the season you guys have had and another thrilling
national semifinal. What does that say about not just your program this year,
but the direction your program is headed in and how much more you guys can
grow?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think anything we've done this year validates last year. You
know, like I've said many times, I wasn't hired at Mississippi State to bring
them a top 25 basketball team. I was hired to bring them a top 10 program,
which you have to understand at my university women's basketball is very
important. They give us, in women's basketball, all the resources that we need
to be where we are right now.  
  
Now, what you also have to know is my fan base has changed in six years. Our
first game might have had this many people at it six years ago. Now we have
10,000 tonight. They all thought going into September practice, October, this
is going to happen. If this hadn't have happened, the sky was going to fall in
Starkville, I'm telling you. They thought we were going to show up, and we're
going back to the Final Four. It doesn't obviously work that way.  
  
But our administration, our president, our athletic director -- there's so
much that goes into this, and you have to have the support of everyone because
you can't do it unless those people in a university are supporting you. And I
think what we've shown the country is that, when you get the support of the
right people and there's an investment in a program, this is what can happen.
You can be in Final Fours. You can play for National Championships. You can
have 10,000 a night at your games. You can have a passionate fan base that
make the Final Four so special for everybody. I'm telling you, I couldn't be
prouder. I couldn't be prouder to be at Mississippi State, to coach this team.
The good Lord has blessed us in so many ways. I think, for us, this is the new
norm.  
  
Q. Congratulations. I'm just curious, you have never hesitated to
substitute players in and out. You pulled starters. You even did it tonight
with Victoria. Teaira McCowan plays all 45. Did you know going in that short
of foul trouble, she was going to play all 45? Why is she so indispensable for
this team?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't think I go into any ball game thinking -- you know, I
don't have any minute number, but Teaira's played a lot of minutes for us.
Most games, she's logging 36-plus. I need to be better getting her out with 30
seconds before media, just to get her that extra time. But you're in a ball
game like this against a great team like Jeff's, I can see me taking her out,
and Jeff going after my redshirt sophomore Zion down there because that's the
kind of coach -- I mean, he's a great coach, and he's got great players, and
he's smart.  
  
So I think that's in the back of my head. And you know what, you want to see a
scowl, take Teaira McCowan out of a game. She don't like it. It doesn't matter
if we're up 20 or down 20. She does not want to come out of the game. So for
her, I just think it's where she is, it's where we are. I'd like to get her
some time here and there, but it's really hard sometimes when you're in a
knock down, drag out.  
  
You know what, that's what makes me so proud of that kid, and, of course,
Coach Harris, who's brought her along and developed her. She wants to. Most
big kids are going, hey, Coach. They want out. Give me a blow. I'm tired.
She's not that way. She wants to play. And I got a whole team of kids like
that really, though, to be honest with you. Victoria didn't like coming out
tonight either, trust me. But I needed to have a word with her, get her calmed
down a little bit, and she's right back in.  
  
I thought it worked a little bit because she came back in and took a better
shot. Her first two shots, I thought were a little off the chart. I want them
on my chart, not her chart. So I thought she settled in after that and really
made some good decisions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and Go Dogs.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Mississippi State - 73, Louisville - 63 OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Louisville, head coach Jeff Walz,
student-athletes Jazmine Jones, Asia Durr, and Myisha Hines-Allen. We'll take
an opening statement from Coach Walz, and then we'll take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you. Just first want to congratulate Vic and Mississippi
State. What a great ball game. I mean, back and forth runs by both teams. It
was a great ball game. I thought we competed, we played our hearts out. I
thought they played their hearts out. Just an unbelievable basketball game.  
  
I'd like to thank these three next to me and the nine in our locker room right
now. It was one of the most enjoyable seasons that I have had in coaching, and
it's not because of our record, it's because of these young women. They're not
only great basketball players but they're great people. And I told them, I
said, you know, the most disappointing thing to me right now is that we're not
going to get a chance to practice tomorrow, and that's the tough part of this.  
  
Athletics is a wonderful thing. It's a great thing, boy, but there's some ups
and downs that just kick you square in the ass, and right now this is one of
those. But you can't let a moment define you. You've got to figure out what
are you going to do to be able to get back here next year and then make sure
that doesn't happen.  
  
Myisha Hines-Allen, she's a young lady that we've had four wonderful years
together, and I truly -- I treat them all like they're my own daughters.
There's ups and downs. They don't like me a lot. My 4 1/2-year-old doesn't
like me a lot. It's okay. It's called parenting. But the one thing I do know
is this young lady is going to walk out of here with a degree, and she's
prepared for life. There's no doubt in my mind. No matter what Myisha decides
to do, she's going to be successful, and we take great pride in that here. Not
only winning basketball games, but making sure they are productive citizens,
can make a contribution when they're out there because, as my grandfather says
at 96, that's the most important thing I can do as a coach is make sure they
go out there and they are productive and they contribute because he needs to
keep getting his social security check. So he wants them to get good jobs and
pay taxes.  
  
So it's just -- it's a tough one, but I couldn't be more proud of these young
women.  
  
Q. Myisha, end of regulation, overtime, what was going through your mind
as you see the shot go up right there at the end of regulation?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: The one when she shot the ball? Who shot?  
  
Q. The shot right there at the end of regulation.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I don't know, to be honest. I seen it go up, and I was
like hope she misses, of course, because we would have won the game, but she's
a phenomenal three-point shooter. Phenomenal team that we just played. It was
a mental breakdown that we had, and she got that open look.  
  
Q. Myisha, on your layup near the end of regulation, you cut to your
left, and it was an open lane to the basket. Did you think for a second about
taking the ball out rather than laying it in? And did you think you left them
too much time?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, the last play I had an open layup, and I decided to
dribble it out. My teammates told me, you have an open layup, shoot the layup.
I got the opportunity again, and I wasn't going to disappoint my teammates.  
  
JEFF WALZ: That was the right decision. You want to score. You're going to go
to the line anyway, and you'll have to make two free throws. So that was the
right move. I told them, if you've got a layup, you take it.  
  
Q. Jazmine, how tough was it to defend this Mississippi State team that
had so many different options?  
JAZMINE JONES: It was really tough. They have great guards all down their
team. Victoria, she's a great player. She was an All-American. It was really
tough guarding her. And their three-point shooters, because they can spread
out the floor while driving. So it was really tough tonight.  
  
Q. Jazmine or Asia or Myisha, there at the end of overtime, it seemed
like their No. 15, Teaira, kind of stepped it up a bit. Did you sense that out
on the court? Did she become a little bit more of a force?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, she was doing that all game. How many rebounds did she
have today?  
  
JEFF WALZ: 25.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: 25 rebounds. That didn't happen in the last five minutes
of the game. She's a phenomenal player too. She's an All-American. Kudos to
her. She did a great job in overtime.  
  
Q. Question for Asia. When you think of Myisha Hines-Allen, what comes
to mind?  
ASIA DURR: (Crying.) I'm sorry. I can't talk.  
  
When I first got here, she did so much for me. My first year here was so hard
for me. She's the one who brought me through, took me underneath her wing, and
she's done so much for our program. She's a great person, and she played her
butt off tonight.  
  
It's been so fun to play with her my three years. I will miss her a whole lot.
I'll be by her side throughout her career. If she needs anything, I'll be
here. I wish the best of luck to her, and I know she's going to do great
things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We're going to start with questions for the
head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a wonderful season.  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you.  
  
Q. You mentioned in the press conferences before McCowan was probably
the biggest difference. What did you tell your post players to try to do to
try to keep her out, maybe push her out, so she wasn't a factor on the
offensive glass?  
JEFF WALZ: We were trying to push her out away from the basket, trying to make
it as difficult as we could. I thought Sam competed and fought all night long.
I mean, all of them did. Myisha did a heck of a job in there competing and
fighting.  
  
Teaira's a great player. I mean, we all know that. She did a phenomenal job on
the offensive glass, and that was the one concern that we had was trying to
keep her off the offensive glass, trying to face guard or do whatever we
could. Unfortunately, we just weren't able to do it.  
  
But I couldn't be prouder of a group. I mean, it's a tough one. It's just
tough. Yeah, it sucks.  
  
Q. Jeff, what was your view of Sam's fourth foul and her technical
foul?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I can't comment on much. I mean, I'll get in trouble. But I
just can't -- you know, she slapped the floor out of frustration. She wasn't
trying to mock the officials or anything like that. You know, whatever.
They're all paid a good amount of money to be out there officiating. So what
do I know about that? It's just, it's -- it's tough. She's battling the entire
game, getting beat up too. It was physical underneath there.  
  
It's a shame it has to come down to that. If she had said something derogatory
to the officials, which if she did, then she definitely deserved it. Slapping
the floor -- you know, who knows?  
  
Q. Did it impact the game?  
JEFF WALZ: It was a five-point swing. So it impacted the game.  
  
Q. Congratulations on the season that you had. I just want to return to
Teaira for a minute. You talked before the game about having a plan A, plan B,
plan C. A lot of that really did pay off. She didn't get a field goal until
two minutes left in the first half, and you guys down the stretch were denying
her the ball. You see her end up with 21 and 25, does it feel like this is the
best you can hope for as a team playing against her?  
JEFF WALZ: We had a three-point lead with 11 seconds to go. You guys make it
sound like we just got our ass kicked. I mean, we competed. These young women,
we did a heck of a job. We knew we weren't going to be able to hold her
scoreless.  
  
I had talked before about just guarding everybody else and seeing if she can
score 50 on us. She's got 25 rebounds, halfway there on the boards part. You
know, I thought we did a really good job on her. I thought we did a really
good job. But you've got to give Johnson credit. She goes 2 of 6 in the field
and hit probably the biggest shot in her career.  
  
Q. When you think about Louisville greats, you think of, obviously,
Angel McCoughtry, Candice Bingham, Shoni Schimmel. How does Myisha fit in that
category?  
JEFF WALZ: You're looking at a kid that scored over 2,000 points and 1,000
offensive rebounds. I mean, there's only one other player that's done that,
Angel McCoughtry, and she's pretty good. She's right up there with the best of
them. I couldn't be more proud of her. I'll miss seeing her in practice,
there's no question.  
  
Q. Was Danberry very much a part of your scouting report?  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, yeah. She definitely was a part of our scouting report. She
drives the thing. We knew she was a driver. She attacked the rim. I've got to
give her credit for stepping up and going 4 of 5 from the free-throw line. She
hit some big free throws. She was on the scouting report. We knew that.  
  
But unfortunately we just -- you know, it was a great basketball game. It was
just a great game.  
  
Q. Jeff, with so many swings, the Sam foul, and the three at the end and
the three at the end of the third quarter too, was there one from your chair
that stuck out the most, as most impactful? How did you keep your team --  
JEFF WALZ: It was a game of runs, big time shots by big time players.
Obviously, Johnson's three was huge. Obviously, sends the game into overtime.
But there's plays in the first half, I just told our kids in the locker room,
everybody is going to look at that play and be like, man, that's the play of
the game.  
  
I've got about six of them I can show you from the first half where we didn't
communicate, we didn't switch like we're supposed to, and we give up a layup
on an out of bounds play. Well, that's just as critical as that last shot, but
it's sports, which is great, everybody remembers the wow moment. They don't
look all the way back and go, man, if you get that stop there, you win by two.  
  
But that possession there, it was just a hard fought game. I'm happy for Vic.
Vic's a great friend. That's a part of this job was tough. You build
friendships with people, and then you're out there trying to beat them, and as
bad as it hurts for me and my players, you're crazy if there's not a little
bit of you that's not like, you know, he's a good friend. I'll be watching
him, unfortunately, on Sunday instead of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one last question.  
  
JEFF WALZ: I got all day.  
  
Q. Just in terms of Myisha's future, what do you think she brings to a
WNBA team?  
JEFF WALZ: I think she brings power, brings strength. She can play inside out.
She'll continue to work on her three-point shot, but I think she has the
ability to extend to that range. Rebounding, just -- I mean, she's got a
chance to have a pretty long career in the WNBA and then playing overseas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you. And I'd like to thank Columbus and everybody here. It's
been a wonderful, wonderful event. Columbus has done a fantastic job, the
committee, everybody. So thank you for that.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2018

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Notre Dame - 91, Connecticut - 89  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut, head coach Geno
Auriemma, student-athletes Gabby Williams and Kia Nurse. We'll take a
statement from Coach, and then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, there's really not a whole lot that you can say in a
moment like that, to have a game like that and then come up short. We knew we
were playing a great team, obviously, and we knew they had a lot of players
that could decide the game. They thought they had us put away a couple of
times, and we kept coming back and coming back, and we just ran out of time.  
  
Q. Kia, obviously, everybody is going to kind of focus on how it
finished, but can you talk about how you guys started and how ultimately
damaging that was, the way you guys got off in the first quarter.  
KIA NURSE: Obviously, I think in the first quarter, they came out and made a
couple of shots, got out in transition and defensively got some stops. I mean,
they got up on a bit of a run. So yeah.  
  
Q. I guess, did you sort of feel like this was just -- I'm sorry. This
is for Kia. It was just trading punches and trading punches? You guys were
able to make some big plays at the end of regulation, and it seemed like you
took momentum into overtime, but then it was just one punch after another.  
KIA NURSE: I think it was one of those games where, obviously, it was just a
grind back and forth the entire game, and it was just a battle. I think, like
Coach said, there were so many times they could have put us away, and we
clawed and clawed and clawed our way back into it and made big play after big
play. So I'm proud of my team and the way they played in that section.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss them back to the locker room. We'll take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, you come back from a 13-point deficit the first quarter, five
down the last 21 seconds in regulation, last few seconds in double overtime.
Two years in a row you lose on a buzzer beater in overtime, can you describe
how tough this is?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Some things just don't need explanations, you know. You really
can't describe what goes into -- what goes into getting here and trying to win
a championship. It's very, very difficult. For a long, long time, we made it
look like it was easy, but it's very, very difficult, as it's played out the
last two years.  
  
As I said, for us to make the plays that we made to tie the game in regulation
then have a chance to win it and to tie the game in overtime, I mean, that's
kind of -- that's what Connecticut basketball is all about. But they made one
more big play than we did tonight.  
  
Q. Geno, I'm guessing that the last two years here kind of proves what
you've always tried to say, that this is a lot harder than it looks.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah. You know, when you do something and it seems like it's so
effortless, you do get numb and forget. It's difficult. It's very, very
difficult. There are no bad teams. There's no bad players. You can't luck into
a National Championship. You have to play great.  
  
You know, one or two players really make the difference at this time of the
year. I made this comment before that, when your team gets to the Final Four,
it's not your talent, and it's not your team that's going to beat the other
team. Generally, when you look back, there's one or two players that just make
unbelievable plays and just dominate the game. And going in, you never know
who they're going to be.  
  
We thought, hey, we do a great job on Mabrey and Arike. And we did first
period. And Jackie Young's a good player, everybody found out. So you don't
get to this point because you're not good enough to win a National
Championship. Obviously, Notre Dame's good enough, and they were better than
us tonight.  
  
Q. Geno, on a tough night, can you appreciate what kind of showcase this
was for the women's game tonight? Two overtime games to put two teams in the
title game.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, crazy. Two overtime games. Again, when you see the
bracket come out and you see the field and you kind of project ahead, if
everybody wins, the four teams that could be in the Final Four, and it played
out that way.  
  
There's not -- there's no easy games here this weekend. There's no somebody
snuck in there or somebody upset three different people to get here. The four
best teams in the country were here, and they played like it.  
  
And it was. It was an amazing night of basketball for the fans here, for
people watching. It was pretty impressive, I have to say.  
  
Q. Geno, you've spoken about this time of year and specifically this
game, helping to define who players are. What did Azura Stevens define herself
as tonight? What did you learn about her tonight?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, kind of what I already knew. Azura can get a lot of
things done on the court that most players can't, and then she does things on
the court that I can't explain.  
  
So for her first year playing for us, I thought she was amazing all year long.
She's come a long, long way. This game will help her an awful lot because
she's never been in this environment before. This is her first time. And this
is Crystal's first time really, where we said, hey, you're going to have to go
out and help us win this game, instead of come off the bench and contribute
ten minutes. So for the two of them, this was big. This was really big.  
  
Napheesa really struggled last year in this game and played great tonight. Lou
had a great game. She was a little bit worn down. Sometimes you have to be
exposed to this and fail when it's all on you. It's a great learning tool. But
I'm a pretty smart guy. I don't need to learn this shit two years in a row
(laughter).  
  
Q. Geno, you talked about the underclassmen for the learning experience,
but it's got to be tough for the seniors to go out two games like this in
consecutive years.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah.  
  
Q. Just talk a little bit about that.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't know what our final record was the last two
years, but Kia and Gabby got a lot done in two years, and that's not even
counting the two previous years that they had at Connecticut. Again,
unfortunately, the way the game is set up, one weekend in March gets to decide
your whole season if you're Connecticut.  
  
But for our seniors, you know, they're going to remember this one and last
year's for a long, long time. The two championships they won freshman and
sophomore year are probably distant memories right about now. But when they
look back, they're going to look at what an amazing career they both had and
what a great impact they had on Connecticut basketball and the people that
they've come in contact with up at Connecticut.  
  
So, yeah, that's the unfortunate thing about being a senior in college. Very,
very few kids have their senior season end with a National Championship, and
it's happened to a lot of kids at Connecticut, but it wasn't meant to be for
these two.  
  
Q. Geno, first, will you talk about that first quarter and how much
ultimately you think it impacted the tone of the game for you guys. And,
actually, I forgot the second one because it's late.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, we came out thinking that there's a couple things that
we're going to have to do defensively, and we got those things done.
Unfortunately, on the offensive end, shots that we normally make, we didn't
make, and we started to struggle a little bit finding any kind of rhythm on
offense at the beginning. I thought we became a little bit tentative.  
  
And then once the second quarter started and we found ourselves, then the game
obviously turned. It was a lot like last year's game as well, where the
similar scenario happened.  
  
But games like this, this time of the year, generally speaking, they're never
won or lost in the first quarter. You can't win or lose a game in the first
quarter. But I think the ability for Notre Dame to get to the free-throw line
and how physical they were inside, I thought, going into the game, we said
there's no way that -- Notre Dame does two things really, really well. They
shoot the ball well; and when they miss, they go get it. So those are two
things that are difficult to deal with, and tonight they did both of those
things really well.

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Blair Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33278)

### [Victoria Vivians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28376)

### [Morgan William](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30442)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais for Mississippi State will be head coach Vic
Schaefer. We have student-athletes Blair Schaefer, Morgan William, and
Victoria Vivians.  
  
We're going to start with an opening statement from Coach Schaefer, then we'll
take questions for the student-athletes. We'll then have the student-athletes
go back to the locker room and continue with Coach.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Just thanks for being here. Appreciate everybody in the room.  
  
This is -- we're really excited to be here, I'm sure, as the other three
teams. Obviously, I'm very proud of this group, this particular team. Our four
seniors have meant a lot to our program.  
  
These three were part of that first ranked class that we ever signed at
Mississippi State. They've been with us all four years. Ro's been with us
three years, transferring in. But these three have -- they've seen a lot.
They've won how many? 127? They've won 127 games in their career, and they
just really meant a lot to not only our program, but to our university and our
community. Obviously, have set a standard at Mississippi State in women's
basketball that will be hard to duplicate in years to come.  
  
Our team's been special this year. Obviously, when you're 36-1, you've got a
really unique and special team. In 33 years, I've never had one like that. You
can do it another 33 and never have it again. But they've weathered every
storm that's come their way. They've worn a bulls eye on their back all year
from what we accomplished a year ago.  
  
And then, as the year went on this year and we were undefeated up until 32-0,
they wore that bulls eye. And that's extremely difficult to do.  
  
I've marvelled at and been amazed at this group, this team, but when you
really step back and look at the kids, these seniors in particular, you
understand how we've gotten it done.  
  
Obviously, we've got a tremendous challenge in front of us in Louisville. I've
known Jeff a long time. We actually talk during the course of the season every
now and then. He's got him a heck of a team. They're extremely multi-
dimensional, multi-talented, can do a lot of things to hurt you. Offensively
and defensively, they're a mirror image. When I look at them, I think we could
probably -- you know, both our teams are very, very similar.  
  
They're tough, they're physical, aggressive. So it's a team that's a lot like
mine on that end of the floor. So we've got our work cut out for us. We are
really focused on them. I do believe we've had some good weeks -- good three
days of practice, and we'll see how it goes tomorrow night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Good morning. Victoria, I'll start with you. Do you have an
appreciation -- you guys are back here at the spot that you were last year. Do
you have a sense of how hard it is to get back here now? I mean, what did you
feel like in terms of how difficult it was to get back to this spot?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It's always difficult to get back here because you've got to
go through the NCAA Tournament. All of the teams in the tournament are great,
so it's tough every night. I feel like it was difficult this year, but we made
it.  
  
Q. For Morgan and for Blair, you're fond of looking at Coach's green
folder there for the opponents. Not sure if he has one for Mississippi State.
He even remarked about the similarities. What's the help in playing a team
that has so many similarities as you guys do?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I think we have to understand how we make other people feel
who play as hard as we do on defense. So we're going to have to counter that
and get open and actually have to get into them to get open. We're going to
have to be crisp with our passes, just understand everything we're trying to
take the other team out of. That's exactly what they're going to do as well.  
  
Q. For Morgan, obviously, the Final Four last year was quite an
experience for you. Can you reflect on that and what it's like to be back in
the Final Four for you?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Last year's experience was great. UConn, of course, and just
to get back here, it's a blessing. It's hard to get back here two times in a
row. So I'm glad we came back and made it back. We worked hard for this.  
  
Q. What do you see as your dividing moment to get you back to this place
right now? I'm sorry. For Morgan, what has been your defining moment for this
season?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: To get us back here.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I don't know. SEC definitely is tough. I feel like it
definitely prepared us because every game in the SEC is definitely tough.
Everyone is good in the SEC, so when we get to NCAA, it's win or go home. So
you get everyone's best game.  
  
I feel like that really helped us. I feel like the target is on our back. It
gives us motivation to get out there because we don't want to get upset or
anything.  
  
Q. This one's for Blair. Blair, aside from the Xs and Os, what's the
feeling you guys have to recapture when you came here last year? Is there a
sentiment or some sort of confidence that you guys need to come with that you
came with last year as well?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: Honestly, I feel like we have a better vibe about us this year
because we know -- our seniors know what it's like to be here, and until you
actually get to this stage and play on this stage, you really don't know what
it's like. People can tell you what it feels like, but you don't know for
yourself.  
  
I feel like this year we understand the feeling, and I feel like we're very
focused and mentally just in the moment. I feel like that's what we're going
to have to be if we're going to be prepared to play Louisville tomorrow.  
  
Q. Blair, I'm sure you've answered this many times, but what's it been
like playing for your dad for the last few years? There's only two more games
playing for him. Just what's it been like for your career to have your dad be
your coach and obviously your dad?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: We have a really special relationship to make it work. We
separate father-daughter, coach-player really well. It's been a true blessing.
He is so well-known and looked at through other coaches in this industry, and
to be able to play for one of the best and him be your dad at the same time,
you really can't replace that. So I'm blessed.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: I'm the best dad too, by the way.  
  
Q. This game is more than just individuals in looking at the scout. Can
you tell us what you've seen from Asia Durr and what challenge that creates
for the team tomorrow?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Asia Durr is a great player. She can create for herself and
her teammates. We've faced it all year. I feel like we have certain players on
our team that can do certain things. I feel like it's going to be a team
effort to stop her. Not just individually. I feel like it's going to be a team
effort offensively and defensively against her.  
  
Q. For Morgan, how much of a factor do you think tempo is going to be in
this game?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like we're just going to go out there and play our
game. I know last time we played, they won the track meet or whatever. We just
went out there and played our game and let the rest handle itself.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Schaefer.  
  
Q. I asked Morgan about last year's Final Four. She became instantly
famous overnight, and then she didn't play that much in the final. How did she
deal with that, and how has she responded this year to being kind of famous?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think she's dealt with it fine. I mean, the thing about last
year, it's so unfair to her. It's unfair to me. I'm a big guy. I can take it.
But to write some of the things that were written about her, really unfair.
And if anybody had have done their homework on my team, they would have
realized last year Jazzmun Holmes played 25 minutes against DePaul in the
second round, had 14 points, 8 or 7 assists, and 1 turnover, played 25
minutes.  
  
Nobody wanted to write about that. They wanted to write about a fourth quarter
where I just felt like Jazzmun Holmes was playing a little better and had a
little more energy. We did that all year. If you followed us this year, we've
done the same thing. We've ham-and-egged it with them all year long. Mo right
now is playing really well. She's played a lot of the bulk of the minutes here
lately because she's playing so well.  
  
I'm blessed to have two great point guards in Morgan and Jazz that it's
allowed me to redshirt three-time Gatorade Player of the Year, Myah Taylor,
who's a point guard. That's how fortunate we are.  
  
Morgan William is a competitor. She is a tough, competitive cuss. I mean, you
don't -- she is the ultimate point guard. She is a hard worker. She is like
one of my own. And some of the things that were speculated and written about
last year, not fair, and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to bring that up
because that kid didn't deserve any of that.  
  
She made a big shot on Friday night, but there were so many other things that
went through for our team to have a chance to win that game during the course
of the game. But she made a big shot. But then to have everything that was
said on Sunday, not very fair.  
  
Q. Two-part question. One, are you the best dad in the world as you
said? Seriously, though, I remember last year at the Final Four it was brought
up how you guys had the 60-point loss to UConn. Was there something -- I mean,
not similar to that, but some sort of message of that nature that you guys had
all season that was hidden until the Final Four, and now you brought it out?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sure. The dad piece, I try. I try to be to all these kids too. I
just love them to death like they're my own, you know. It's a special group
not only to have my twins, but I've got 14 daughters. It's really, really
special and unique that I really enjoy about my job.  
  
This year's been unfinished business. I think this team has tried to embrace
that and done a great job with that. We have not run from the target on our
back all year. We've talked about, hey, you're going to get everybody's best
shot. For what you did last year, you're going to get everybody's best game
plan. Everybody's going to be excited to play you. We had a really good
nonconference schedule.  
  
But then as the year went on, that target got joined by another target, which
was the undefeated target, to go 32-0, and they've handled that like a champ.
So really difficult to handle both of those things, and for these kids to do
what they've done is quite remarkable.  
  
We didn't run from wanting to win a Southeastern Conference Championship. We
put a picture of their trophy, big picture, laminated it, put it on their
lockers. I wanted them to see that every day. We won the Southeastern
Conference. I mean, that's so hard to do.  
  
So this team has embraced challenges, starting with the end of the season last
year, what we wanted to try to get done this year.  
  
Q. Back to Morgan for a second. I'm sure it's not every kid that you've
probably ever coached could probably be able to handle that coming in the
game, not coming in some other game. What is it about Morgan that's allowed
her to sort of persist through this? And she said earlier in the season that
she was struggling with her shot a bit. Is there anything in particular that
you guys did to work with her? Because it looks like it's fine now.  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, Morgan's a great kid. Monica, her mother, has done
a tremendous job with her. She's just a great kid. High character, tough,
competitive. And so Morgan has, like I said, she -- it wasn't anything new for
us really last year. It was new for -- it seemed to be new for everybody else
watching the game. So this year, again, we've -- I've gone with who's hot,
who's playing well, who's running our team right.  
  
This year Morgan and Jazz both, they have so many weapons around them. Morgan
hasn't had to score as much this year as she did in years past. Years past, we
might not have had as many shooters or offensive weapons that we have this
year. So her role changed as a point guard.  
  
Now here lately, she's shooting the ball well because she's been in the gym.
She's really worked hard to -- Coach Dionnah has been with her in the gym a
lot, as all my coaches are with all my position players. She's really worked
hard on her shot, and you're right, she's shooting it really well, playing
with a lot of confidence. She's got that presence about her that I like to see
in all of our players, but especially a point guard.  
  
So I think that's the biggest thing with her right now is just her swagger.
Look, it's hard to have swagger if you don't have a skill set.  
  
Q. Coach, your team came here last year and was, like Blair said, they
didn't really know what to expect. It was a new experience for everybody. Did
that factor into the way you guys approached things and how do you sort of
recapture that newness when it's not new now?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, obviously, this time last year, there probably
wasn't anybody in the room who thought we'd do what we did, except the people
in my locker room. So there was probably a little bit of a -- we had great
focus and great preparation leading up to that ball game. But we also, I
think, were -- you know, when you're the underdog, there's a little different
approach than when you come in now and we're -- we're still obviously going to
play a great Louisville team, but we're not playing a team that's won 111 in a
row, so to speak.  
  
But with this team, I think they've been here. They understand what's coming.
Again, we have a tremendous amount of respect for Louisville, and we have a
great understanding of what they present, the problems and the challenges they
bring. But this team has handled that all year, as they said, in the course of
the season with the teams we've had to play against in our conference and in
our nonconference.  
  
So I've shown them enough film on Louisville, and we know they're the winners
of the ACC. They won the ACC Tournament. And I know Jeff personally. He and
his staff, and know what kind of job they do. So our antennas are up.  
  
Q. Vic, over the past decade, how have you seen the women's game change
specifically and how evolved and how have you adapted to that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Wow, may not be enough time in the day. Number one, I just think
the skill set of our players is so much more broader. I think the coaching is
really, really good. Staffs are really, really good. I think there's -- you
know what, I think there's an importance placed by administrations on women's
basketball. I know at my place in Mississippi State, women's basketball is
really important. They spend a lot of money on women's basketball.  
  
I tell our kids that all the time. Hey, there's people investing in you. We
owe it to our administration, our fans. So I think that's the thing I've seen
is -- you know, back when I started in 1990, just talking about the high
school game, the offensive coordinator was the girls basketball coach. That's
not the case anymore in high school. They're hiring girls high school
basketball coaches.  
  
So I think then, as you go through the college game today, administrators are
doing their homework. They want good people running their programs. They see
the value that a women's basketball program can bring to our university, just
like at our place. Six years ago, there was about this many people at my
games. Now we've got 10,000 in there. This year we had over 10,000 four
nights. We averaged over 8,500. It's important.  
  
But it's important because our administration started with them. It's
obviously important to me, my coaches, and my players. So I think there's an
investment on a number of levels, whether it's your players, your coaches,
administration, that's really allowed it to become what it is today.  
  
Without talking about rule changes and things like that and freedom of
movement and all that, I just think that's -- there's so many things -- so
many other things that go into it within the skill set that these kids are
developing in high school, AAU, things like that. It's just really improved, I
think.  
  
Q. Vic, what is the challenge -- I mean, you've had all these girls four
years, three years. They hear your voice every day. What is the challenge of
getting them to continue to listen and be locked in and keep that message
fresh?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think there's a trust factor with our kids and with my staff.
I think there's a real credibility when you've done it as long as I have. To
have the staff that I have and what their backgrounds are, I just think our
kids know that, you know what, if we're saying something, if we're making a
point to put it in a scouting report, it's important.  
  
And I think we don't give in. If we think our message is falling on deaf ears,
we don't just throw our hands up and go, Oh, well. I think you keep coaching,
you keep teaching, you stay after it. So for our kids -- you know, 27-7, 28-8,
34-5, and now 36-1 -- I think the proof's in the pudding. So they have a real
respect and understanding of, hey, if Coach says it, then we need to listen
and do it.  
  
Q. Vic, as you mentioned, Louisville has a lot of threats offensively
and defensively, very similar to your own team. But what are the main
differences you see between the two teams?  
VIC SCHAEFER: There may be a difference in Tea's a true, back-to-the-basket
five. Both their bigs can face up and do some things off the bounce. Once you
get past that, I think that's -- that in and of itself could be where we think
we have an advantage. It may be where they think they have an advantage.  
  
After that, I think our teams are so similar. I mean, really, I think we both
could flip flop and coach each other's group. Terminology might be a little
off, but it meant the same thing.  
  
Again, I just -- I think that's who Jeff is and how he coaches those kids, and
the fit those kids have in his program are the same fit we have for our
program. You've got to have tough, physical, aggressive basketball players.
You know what, if somebody describes your team, it doesn't matter what sport
you're coaching. Is it tough, physical, aggressive? Football, baseball,
basketball -- you probably like that as a coach. That doesn't say anything
about your skill set.  
  
I just think his team, we both mirror image each other from the standpoint of
being tough, physical, and aggressive.  
  
Q. Coach, in the UCLA game, you saw a couple different defenses early
on, and Victoria hit that bomb early on, Morgan hit a couple, but then Ro
Johnson knocked down two. What have you learned about her as an offensive
player throughout this season to where you're really playing four-on-one
around here?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Ro, I've known it since we got her three years ago. When we got
her three years ago, I thought, man, she is a pro. Roshunda Johnson can do so
many things with the basketball. She can take you off the bounce. She can
create her own shot. She can stretch you deep. She can bail you out of some
really bad sets and make shots.  
  
And I still believe that about Ro. Ro has really been that X-factor for us
that allows us to -- you know, people run out of defenders some nights. You
can put a good one on Tori, or you can put a good one on Tea, or you can put a
good one on Ro. Well, there's two other players now, and you're out of good
defensive players.  
  
So I think that's the beauty of this team is you've got to find all five of
ours. It's hard to double off of any of them because they can all beat you.  
  
But Roshunda Johnson has really been a tremendous addition for us and has made
our team what it is today, in my mind. I mean, we don't have Ro, we have a
different kind of player there, now people can guard us a little differently.
So she's really special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and Go Dogs.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now on the dais from Notre Dame, head coach Muffet
McGraw, student-athletes Arike Ogunbowale and Kathryn Westbeld. We're going
right to questions now.  
  
Q. Kathryn, do you guys appreciate getting back here? There was a time
when Notre Dame was in the top four every year, your freshman year also. Do
you appreciate what it's taken to get back here, specifically with injuries,
to be back here playing in the Final Four?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: Absolutely. I think every year it's an expectation that
Coach sets. Obviously, it's not going to be easy getting back. Obviously,
we've had hard times in the past couple years. Yeah, especially this year,
going through what we have and kind of overcoming everything, especially when
no one thought that we really could. I think it's really something special for
us, especially it being my senior year, being in this.  
  
Q. Arike, on the season you guys have had and the setbacks and the
injuries, how did you guys push yourselves through that? Is it a cumulative
effect?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think everyone who's playing right now, we're all hungry.
We all love the game. So it's not hard to push and try to get as many wins as
we can.  
  
Q. This is for Kathryn. When Jessica came in, you guys weren't sure
right up until November that she'd be able to play this year. I know you
obviously practiced with her before. But how quickly did she fit in to Notre
Dame in terms of the culture, the demands, everything that you guys did? How
fast was that for her?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I think her impact was immediate. Even when she came in the
summer, I think during practices and workouts, she was one of the loudest
ones, talking to everybody, really trying to get to know everybody and fit in
as much as she could. I think she really did do that.  
  
As far as basketball-wise, we all love playing with her. She works so hard.
She's made such an impact on the court on both ends, and obviously with our
injuries, we're very lucky to have her.  
  
Q. For both players, how would you describe what you've found with your
starting five to make it to this point, obviously, not having as many players
as you would have hoped at this point. But to play so well and to get this
far, how would you describe what you've found as a unit?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think just chemistry-wise, I think we have to be a really
close team to be able to play as many minutes together, and we have to know
each other really well. There's not a lot of subs, so we have to capitalize on
a lot of possessions so we're not tired. So I think that's a big point of it.  
  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: Going off of that, I think trust is a big thing. Just
playing off each other. Like she said, chemistry is huge for us. But at the
same time, it's hard to play with only seven players, but it kind of gets
easier because you're only used to playing with that lineup or only a couple
different lineups, not used to a bunch of different people coming in and
having to learn their strengths and weaknesses and playing off of that. So I
think we can really maximize on each other's strengths.  
  
Q. For both you guys, there was a time that UConn and you would play
four times a season for four straight years. You probably knew what flavor of
gum everyone was chewing on the other team. It seemed -- I mean, it's still a
rivalry, but is it less that you see them once a year in December, and maybe
we'll see you again in the Final Four or some other point? There isn't that
same we're focused on UConn all year, as opposed to now you see them once and
then maybe see them again?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I don't think, even if we played them four times, we were
only focused on UConn all year. That's only four games out of 30. We don't
come to games thinking this is a big rivalry. We come to the game, we have to
get another win. It's just another team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kathryn, do you have anything to add?  
  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: No, I pretty much agree with that.  
  
Q. Arike, how important is defense in this game? Both teams can get up
and down and score, but could it come down to which team can play a little bit
better defense and make a few stops during the game?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think that's really what it does come down to. Like you
said, we both can score. We both have high average as a team per game, so it's
definitely who can get the most stops.  
  
Q. Arike, the game in December, Coach McGraw was saying on a
teleconference the other day that even though you lost that game, it gave you
confidence because of how well you played for a lot of that game against
UConn. Can you go back in that game? I mean, the fourth quarter kind of got
away, but what are the best things you can take from that game, and what do
you most want to avoid that happened in that game?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: That game was a while ago, so I don't remember a lot of it.
We played well against them. I remember we had a lead for a lot of the game.
So I think that's just a positive coming out of the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Coach, Kathryn said, in some ways it's easier to play with seven
players. As a coach, is it easier in any way to play with seven players?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, there's not many decisions to make who's going to go in
the game, where you look down and go, I've got to get her out and get somebody
else in. In some ways it's easier, but it's generally harder. I think practice
is harder. Foul trouble is harder. You worry so much with the anxiety of what
else is going to go wrong. As soon as someone gets their first foul, I start
to worry. How is this going to play out? Can we play zone?  
  
So I think some of the things we're trying to look at is how we manage
practice, how we manage the game, how much zone can we play, do we need to
change our strategy to avoid fouling? I think there's a lot more strategy
involved when you only have a small bench.  
  
Q. Prior to the season at ESPN before all your injuries, you had talked
about wanting to have this team as a bigger defensive identity. Is that
changed now, or can you actually go out and just outscore UConn in this
game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think our defensive identity really came to fruition during
the Tennessee game. I think that was the game we realized, if we can guard, we
can win. And that -- that was a turning point for us because it gave the
players the idea that, hey, maybe this commitment to defense is something that
we could really hang our hats on.  
  
And I think we got a lot better from that moment on defensively. We took a lot
of pride in it and had more of a commitment to it. We realized it can create
offense for us. I think we've been better defensively since that game.  
  
Q. Hey, Coach, same thing I asked the players. I mean, not saying that
you don't appreciate going to a Final Four any time, because it's special, but
with what you guys went through this year with injuries and stuff, does it
make this one a little more special, that you're maybe not expecting to be
here after what you guys have been through?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, absolutely. This has to be the most rewarding and
probably -- you know, I think you saw the coaching staff after the Oregon
game. I mean, just such joy for us to see that the players get to have this
experience. You know, we've been there. The seniors have been there. But to
talk about it and say how much fun it is and how exciting it is, it's just not
the same as being here.  
  
It helps the program from here on. Now everybody in the program's been there,
so next year they have that experience.  
  
So I think it's one of the most rewarding -- since '97, when we were a 6 seed
and completely unexpected to get here -- this has definitely been one where
we've really worked hard for it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this team's resilience a little bit through the
injuries and having all these things happen in season. Is it something that's
come naturally to them, or did you really have to work hard to instill that
resilience in them as you're going through this?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think resilience is the perfect word to describe what our
team is and how we got here. I think the coaches worked pretty hard at it, but
I think you have to have that. You have to have a certain amount of mental
toughness to get through the season, and some kids, especially this team, are
tougher than normal.  
  
I think people talk a lot about this generation and they're different. This is
a team of maybe throwback type of players because they all are the kind of
kids that would run through the wall for each other and for us.  
  
So I think that we -- you know, we never let it get us down as coaches. I
think we approached it like, okay, whose turn is it to step up now? And when
you ask players, would you mind playing 40 minutes, I don't think there's a
problem with that, especially with our guards. So I think in some ways it was
just like we're just moving on. We didn't really talk about it a lot. Just
figured out how we're going to move on. Always talked about what we have and
what we can do rather than what we lost.  
  
Q. Coach, if I could ask you sort of similar to what I asked Kathryn,
about Jessica's impact because it seems like it was immediate. But also, how
has she even evolved and improved just playing one year for you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, her impact, as she said, at our first practice in the
summer, she was the one that was encouraging. She was the one that was helping
the freshmen. She was the one that would always say, hey, we'll be okay. Never
really got down. Could take criticism, could take coaching. Understood what it
was like. The hardest thing for me was that you kind of want to build some
things around her, and then at the same time, think, well, if she's not going
to play, we're wasting all this time.  
  
So learning she could play at the last minute made it a little bit tougher
because we weren't really geared to throw the ball inside as much. So she's
really come along in terms of what she can do because she's really special. I
mean, she can rebound, put it on the floor, she can pass, she can score in a
lot of different ways. So I think her impact is continual. I think she's
gotten better.  
  
She set a Notre Dame record. I think she had a bunch of double-doubles in the
row for the first time in the NCAA Tournament. We've never had that before. So
I think that she is continuing to improve.  
  
Didn't get the attention, I didn't think, nationally that I think she
deserved. I think she's one of the best power forwards in the country, and she
certainly has played that way for us. We wouldn't be here without her.  
  
Q. Coach, Marina Mabrey has taken on more of a point guard role for you
now, but how has she evolved as that off ball scorer to the point where her
career high coming into the season for threes was four, and in this tournament
alone she's topped that multiple times. How has she evolved to be a better
scorer as she's taking on even more point guard duty?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It has been a challenge for her. I think coming in, her
willingness to take on that role was the first thing. We talked about it early
in the season, and, of course, after Lili went down, she was pretty much going
to take over. I think her evolution has been phenomenal. You look at what she
was in the beginning, we helped her a lot. Niele did a lot of work. I think
her sister Michaela helped her a lot long distance.  
  
Getting her to run the offense and think pass first was not something she was
used to doing it. She worked all summer on her shot. So going through the
transition of a scorer to now I've got to look for everybody else, and now
she's figured out I can do both. So it's been a long road for her, and she's
done a fabulous job at it, especially in calling the plays.  
  
She's now at the point where she's calling her own stuff, not every
possession, but certainly at big times in the game. She can see what we need,
who needs the ball, and who has the mismatch. So she's really come a long way
in that. It's another reason that we're here.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma said earlier today about that stretch where you were
playing each other four times a year was maybe too much, but it's also the
best stretch that you had against them. Do you make anything into that? And
what is the blueprint to beat them? And my other question is, some of the
players you talked about the other day that might be back, are some of them
back?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think playing them four times, I think two years in a row,
was great for the game. I think they were always great battles. It was a time
when we had Natalie Achonwa, Ariel Braker, and Kayla McBride. Nat and Ariel
are coming and Kayla is still overseas. So we're excited to have them back.
They were part of the group that really was very successful against
Connecticut.  
  
So I think now that we only play them once a year, I think there is some
distance to the rivalry. I think that it always, of course, will be a rivalry
just because they're the best team in the country right now. But I think it's
not that intensity that we had when we were in the Big East because you're
constantly watching in your conference. Now we're in the ACC, and we're
focused on that, and that's the best conference in women's basketball. We
can't really afford to be watching a lot of other teams. We really focused on
that.  
  
So I think it definitely has lessened the intensity of the rivalry, but that
could change tomorrow.  
  
Q. Muffet, from your standpoint, are you happy you don't have to see
them four times a year now? The only thing said is you see them once in
December and maybe we'll see you in March. As a coach, okay, we only play them
once a year, and then we can move on and then maybe see them again?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think it's good, especially for us in the ACC, with
playing so many good teams. It's great to have a challenging non-conference
schedule and then a great conference schedule and then get ready to focus on
them again. Playing them one time gives you that feel for what it's going to
be like, and I think it helps.  
  
Q. Coach, was there a point this year where you just thought to yourself
this is just -- this is just not going to happen for us this year? And if so,
how do you fight your way through that? What do you do?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think for me, I go home. That's how I fight my way
through it because Matt is always there with the positive. You know, I can
vent. I can get it all out. And he's there with a hug and a smile, and he kind
of just pushes me back out. So any time we're taking some knockout punches,
he's the one picking me up.  
  
So that allowed me to let it out and then get back to practice and just go at
the team and say, hey, here's where we're going now. Always looking forward. I
think that was the key for us.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess Arike didn't remember much about that December game,
but you did say that -- and I don't know. Maybe she just wasn't telling us.  
MUFFET McGRAW: She doesn't remember the Oregon game (laughing).  
  
Q. You said you felt like it was a confidence build, and I know you lost
Lili since then, but who do you think on your team from that team might be
able to take the most from it or could take something from it?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Probably everybody with the exception of Arike because she just
plays. I think Jessica looked at the game. I think Kat kind of studies the
game a little bit differently. Jackie looked at the game and how that went. So
I think that -- I think we could take a lot from that to see where we went
wrong.  
  
I think we changed some things since then that have helped us. Hopefully,
those guys will help Arike remember what we did.  
  
Q. Muffet, you and I talked a little bit about it, but what Kat's done
the last three weeks, from potentially seeing her career end with an injury to
a big win over Villanova. Just talk about what she's done and a chance to play
near home for her last games.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I was saying to someone after the Oregon game, I couldn't be
happier for a person than I am for Kathryn Westbeld. She has gone through so
much, so many injuries starting last year. She had the injuries, she didn't
practice the last six weeks of the season, only played in the games. Played
through a ton of pain, had a surgery off-season. Took a bit longer to get
back. She was supposed to be 100 percent in October, it was November, then it
was December. Then she turns the ankle again. We wouldn't have beaten
Villanova without her. She's won the Oregon game for us.  
  
She's done so many things that have just not shown up anywhere. She doesn't
always show up on the stat sheet like she did in those games because she's
taking a charge, getting an offensive rebound that gives us another
possession. She's steady and always calm. We call her the glue because she
just keeps us together and does so many things.  
  
And then to come back home and be able to play is just a phenomenal story.
Couldn't be happier for her.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais, for Louisville, head coach Jeff Walz,
student-athletes Myisha Hines-Allen, Arica Carter, and Asia Durr. We'll start
with a statement from Coach Walz.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Just wanted to thank Columbus, the organizing committee, everyone
that's been involved. It's been an absolutely wonderful experience for our
student-athletes, our staffs, our families. It's been first class. We're just
honored to be a part of it.  
  
We're looking forward to a wonderful ball game tomorrow night against a very
well coached team, a very talented team. Just excited. It's a great time of
the year. You work as hard as we have the entire year to hopefully have the
opportunity to get to this point, and now we're here, and I know these young
women are excited to start playing.  
  
Q. For Myisha, these teams are very, very similar in a lot of ways, but
what are the biggest differences you see between yourselves and Mississippi
State?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: When we watch film, I don't really see like a big
difference. They run kind of the same plays that we do. They want to push the
ball, but they're really good at half-court sets too. So there's not a lot of
differences. They have a true post player in Teaira McCowan, and me, Sam,
Bionca, and Kylee are your nontraditional post players. I would say personnel
would be the only difference, but we run the same kind of plays.  
  
Q. Myisha, you've been around Coach now for four years. Just what have
you learned from him? What of his personality has rubbed off on you guys? And
what's the best thing you've learned?  
JEFF WALZ: How much time does she have? Where do you want to start?  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, right?  
  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, man, that was a good one. I'm laughing. That was funny.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, he's just a competitor, and I think we've all taken
away from that, got that from him. But I mean, yeah, he's a competitor. He
loves to fight.  
  
JEFF WALZ: That's all I get, Doug.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: That's all you get.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you.  
  
Q. Myisha, how does your game change when you're playing a true post
player? And how do you compensate for the height difference?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We've played different post players already that have been
taller than us, but it's your competitiveness. If you want to fight, if you
want to just complain and say, oh, she's taller than me. I can't get around
her. I can't box her out. I can't play defense on her. Then you shouldn't be
here.  
  
But we've earned the right to be here, so we're going to fight and try our
hardest.  
  
Q. Asia, how do you stay consistent in your preparation and what you've
done all year when you're in such a new experience with so many things coming
at you?  
ASIA DURR: It's been the same thing that we've been doing from day one, from
the first game. So, yeah, it's the Final Four. We truly appreciate it. But I
mean, if you just think about it, it's just another game. That's what we're
all trying to think about. We're just trying to have fun. We're all in, but
this is just another game for us.  
  
Q. Arica, my question for you is: What is the key for you guys to be
successful tomorrow against a team, as we said, is sort of the mirror image of
you guys? What are the keys you have to do to be successful and come out with
the win?  
ARICA CARTER: I feel like we have to stay within ourselves. Even though we're
very much alike, we do have some differences. So I think we have to stay
within ourselves and play hard, get all the 50-50 balls, and try to frustrate
them as much as we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll start right up here with questions for
Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Jeff, when Vic was in here, he was saying that you could pretty much
flip-flop and coach each other's teams. That's how similar he thinks your
teams are. What do you think about that?  
JEFF WALZ: I would agree with that. After going back and watching his teams
play, and knowing Vic -- you know, I consider Vic a friend, and I know how he
does things. He demands the best from his players. He challenges his players.
But at the same time, it's what we do here at Louisville, but the same thing
is done that -- players want to be coached. Great players want to be pushed to
be great, as long as they know you love them off the floor and you care about
them. And that's what I know Vic's players feel. I know my players feel that
same thing. It's about building relationships and building trust. It's not
about being their best friend. It's not what we're here to do. I treat them
like their my own kids.  
  
There are times that my own four don't like me very much, but that's called
parenting, and there's some good times and some bad times. I feel that we do
things pretty much the same way. I think he's got really tough kids that are
going to come and compete, and I truly believe we have tough kids. That's a
process. It's not something that a lot of them just come in with. It's
something that they learn throughout their time with us.  
  
Q. You've been here before. Your first time at the Final Four, did you
think that you really understood how difficult it is to get here in the first
place and how hard it is to get back? And kind of will you just talk about how
difficult it is to get here.  
JEFF WALZ: Yes, I knew -- I know exactly how difficult it is. The one thing --
in '06 at Maryland, when we made it to the Final Four, I got a phone call from
a good friend of mine, Lyndon Wiese, who used to be an assistant at Texas
Tech, that said, Before you go up, make sure you enjoy it. Enjoy every second
of it. Don't sit in your hotel room and watch film. The film's not going to
change. You've already done all your preparation. Make sure your kids are
prepared. Make sure you know what you're doing, which obviously you're not
here if you don't. Practice the way you practice, but enjoy the rest of it.  
  
That's one thing I try to do with our players. I want them to enjoy what's
going on around here because I do know how hard it is to get back. I never
take it for granted. I don't sit here and think that, hey, we'll be back next
year. We'll be back the year after that. You just never know when that
opportunity is coming again.  
  
As I've always said, the best team doesn't always win in March. It's the team
that's playing the best that night. And then all of a sudden, somebody gets
beat. It opens up an easier path possibly to make it somewhere. So we are
enjoying every second of this. I mean, I want our players to soak it all in.
We're going to do all the things tonight with the kids to make sure they get a
chance to experience it. I've told my staff to go out. Once we're prepared, go
out with your friends. Go out. I'm taking my wife out. We're going to enjoy
it.  
  
So to me, that's what it's all about. You know, it's our third time in 11
years, which 11 years ago, when I got hired here, the goal was we want to try
to get to a Sweet 16. It's a program that had never been to a Sweet 16, and
that was kind of like, hey, we'd like to make consistent appearances in the
Sweet 16. And now we've gone to three Final Fours. I don't think anybody ever
thought that that was possible. And we're going to enjoy it. We're going to
soak it in. And then tomorrow night, we're going to come out to play. I can
promise you that.  
  
But I've talked to my SID. I want Nick to figure out in 11 years how many
teams have made it to the Final Four? UConn's been all 11. So there's one team
that's gone 11 straight. How many actual programs have made it to the Final
Four in 11 years? Because it's not a great number. So it's definitely a
difficult task to do.  
  
Q. I can't tell you how many times over the past two seasons post-game
press conferences a coach has said we just didn't have an answer for McCowan.
How do you deal with that? How do you approach that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's one of those things where it just is what it is. I was
fortunate enough to coach Teaira at the UA team when she was a part of that a
few years back. Just a wonderful person. Just a big heart. And then when you
get her out on the floor, she's a competitor. She competes. So it's not a
matter of we don't have an answer for her.  
  
At the same time, we've got some pretty good players that they're going to
have to adjust to. So it's a matter of we've got to try to go with our
strengths. We know what they're going to do, and that's go to their strengths,
and we've got to figure out a way to possibly slow them down the best we can.  
  
You aren't going to stop anybody. At this time of year with the teams that are
playing, everybody's really good. You aren't going to stop anyone. It's just a
matter of can you slow somebody up in order to get the advantage? I've said it
all postseason, seeding doesn't matter. It's all about momentum. And it's
momentum during the game, not the momentum you have going into the game. But
once that game starts, when you get on a 6-0 run, can you turn that 6-0 run
into a 12-0 run?  
  
You go back, and you look at our four games coming up to this, there have been
stretches in games where we've gone on a 14-2, a 16-2 run, and it's what
creates the separation. It's what takes a four-point game, and all of a
sudden, it's an 18-point game, and now it's an uphill climb.  
  
So we've got to make sure we take advantage of the momentum when we get it,
and then when they're on a little bit of a run, we've got to figure out a way
to stop it.  
  
Q. Jeff, some of the Mississippi State players earlier said they feel
like they're in an advantage because they played in a Final Four last year.
How do you think your girls will handle tomorrow night's stage, and how has
their approach been so far?  
JEFF WALZ: The approach has been great. The thing about it, it's going to be a
great environment, and we're fortunate enough for our home games also that we
have a great fan base. So I don't think our kids are going to be surprised or
a little in shock of the crowd tomorrow night.  
  
We had a great turnout at Lexington for our regional semifinal and final game.
And then when that game gets going, they don't know what game you're playing.
They don't know if it's the first game, the last game, or whatever. When the
ball starts going, as a player, you are just playing. You aren't thinking,
man, this is the Final Four.  
  
So I'm not worried about that at all. I think our kids are loose. I think
they're excited and know it's going to be a great challenge.  
  
Q. Two-part question for you. First, how was it riding in the sidecar
last night of the police escort?  
JEFF WALZ: It was absolutely great. That's one thing, I kind of was joking
with them when we came to practice yesterday and said, hey, I'd like to sit in
that on the way back. Roll out of practice, and he's got the jacket, helmet,
and the gloves. I'm in. Yeah, I'd like to actually do it tomorrow on the way
to the game.  
  
Q. The second question, you kind of alluded to it or discussed a little
bit, but what you've done in 11 years at the school getting three Final Fours,
I don't know how many other coaches have done that in their first 11 years at
a program. I don't know how many McDonald's All-Americans you've had, but I'm
guessing not a roster-ful of them. What can other coaches take from you to
build their programs in the same way, where in 11 years you're a three-time
Final Four and two-time championship playing program?  
JEFF WALZ: You know, we were fortunate. I say this all the time. When I took
the job at Louisville, I took it over, and it was a good program. It was
solid. Tom Collen had done a really nice job. Tom didn't get fired at
Louisville. Tom took the Arkansas job. So I had the opportunity to inherit
Angel McCoughtry. Now, we also worked really hard at changing the culture,
changing expectations, changing what they have to do.  
  
Because I'll never forget, in my interview, the players had the opportunity to
talk to me and ask me questions, and Angel asked me, What are you going to do
to get us to a Sweet 16?  
  
I said, Well, Angel, I'm not playing. I can't play for you. What are you going
to do? And she kind of looked at me, and I said, It's about building a team.
You guys have known that Coach Colin took the job at Arkansas a week ago,
right?  
  
She's like, Yeah.  
  
I go, Which one of you have called the freshmen that have just signed, so
they're seniors in high school, to tell them everything is going to be okay?
Not one returning player had reached out to the incoming freshmen because they
just didn't think about it. They didn't realize it. And I'm like, that's your
problem. You've got each other right here, so you're comfortable with knowing,
hey, we're going to find a coach. We're going to be good. But you've got
incoming freshmen that signed -- and I know everybody says you sign with the
school. No, you sign because you build a relationship with the coach at that
school. The coach leaves, and now they were fractured some, the freshmen. They
didn't know what to expect.  
  
And that next day, on my second day of the interview, Patrika Barlow comes
running up to me, and she says, Coach, I called all of them, and they're so
thankful, and they're excited.  
  
And that's kind of how things started with us, was getting the players to
realize it's their team. It's not the coaches. We do our jobs at giving them
guidance, putting in game plans, but they have to be the ones that invest in
it.  
  
And it started on that day, and we have just continued to build and build and
build. And it's been a remarkable 11 years with some wonderful players that
have bought in to us and believed in what we could do. And I've said, I mean,
we're sitting here right now with Myisha Hines-Allen as our only senior, and
we can say as a staff that everybody that's completed four years with us in 11
years has had the opportunity to play in a Final Four. We're proud of that and
looking forward to a great weekend.  
  
Q. Jeff, if my math is correct, there have been 15 teams in the last 11
years that have made the Final Four. But my question is after what you did
with Marie Gulich last week, does any of that apply here? Obviously, size is
similar, but what about skill?  
JEFF WALZ: They're both really talented. We're going to have -- Teaira is
probably stronger as a low post player. Marie, I love the finesse of her game.
She could post up at times. She had a nice little step back. So their skill
set was a little bit different. We're going to have to do everything we can,
it's no secret, to try to get Teaira as far away from the basket as we can,
make her score over us, but then you've got to turn and box her out.  
  
What she does so well is she might miss it, but then everybody else takes a
step to the basket. Well, she takes a step with you, and she just rebounds the
ball over you. It's not a foul. She's just taller and stronger, and she
rebounds it and puts it back up and in. We've got to limit the number of
offensive rebounds and second-chance points that she's able to get.  
  
Q. Hello, Coach. You talked about how similar these two teams are going
in. You've spoken about how you and the players are trying to stay loose, this
is just another game, but the stakes are different. So when it comes down to
that game, if things are maybe a little too loose or too tight, what aspects
of the culture that you've been able to build are you and your coaching staff
going to really lean on to get the team focused and stay on track with the
game plan?  
JEFF WALZ: That's the one thing, I'll tell you. We're enjoying it now. The
kids are enjoying this. But I can promise you, like when we just had our
practice, our kids are focused and dialled in.  
  
Tonight I want them to have fun. I want them to enjoy it. I don't need them to
be sitting in the room all stressed trying to figure out, what are we going to
do?  
  
We know what to do. We're 38 games into the season. As I say, we're good at
what we're good at, and we're bad at what we're bad at. It's not going to
change now. So we just need to keep doing what we do.  
  
Tomorrow's game, they're going to come out and have a good warmup, and we're
going to approach it like we have for the last 38 ball games. The stakes are
the same as they were in Round 1. If you lose, you're finished. So the stakes
aren't any different, and that's one thing that I've talked to our players
about. Every game in the NCAA Tournament has the same ramifications. You lose,
you're finished.  
  
And now it's the same thing. It's just now you're down to four teams. It's an
unbelievable accomplishment. I'm really proud of these young women.  
  
Q. There are four teams here that want to play for a National
Championship. Would you rather be in a Final Four in which UConn has won a
couple in a row or in a Final Four in which UConn didn't win last year?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what, the great thing about it is when the draw comes out,
everybody's like, You want to be opposite UConn. That's a lie. That's the
worst thing you could ever have happen. How many National Championship games
have they lost? You know the answer? Zero. When they lose is in the semis. So
you want to play them in the semis because he can't coach that game very well
(laughter). You know, he gets tight. He gets nervous, and he can't perform.
Then finally in the championship game, he lets Chris do it, and he's 11-0. He
gets all the credit, though.  
  
So you want to be on the same side of the bracket. This stuff of being on the
opposite side is bad business.  
  
I got a good question. That was a great question. Thank you, everybody.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll start with an opening statement from Coach and
take questions for the student-athletes. On the dais for UConn, head coach
Geno Auriemma, student-athletes Kia Nurse and Gabby Williams. We'll take an
opening statement from Coach Auriemma and then take questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Can you just replay the one I did Monday after the South
Carolina game?  
  
They're really -- by the time you get to this point, there really isn't a
whole lot that anybody can say that hasn't already been said by every coach,
every player that's here. It's all redundant.  
  
Everybody's happy to be here. Everybody's excited to play. Everybody respects
the other teams. Every game's going to be difficult. Lots of great players in
the tournament. So all that is absolutely true.  
  
We deserve to be here, just like the other three teams do. We've earned the
right to be here, and we're going to play a great team tomorrow night. If we
play better than they do, we're going to win, and if they play better than we
do, they're going to win. It's no more complicated than that.  
  
We're going to go to practice after this, and we're going to prepare and get
ready and come out and play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hi, good morning. Gabby and Kia, I was in that locker room with you
guys last year after the Mississippi State game when a lot of you guys were
talking about wanting to remember how this felt and bringing it forward to the
next season. Do you want to tap in to how you felt in that locker room last
year when you take the court?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, yeah, I think that's something that is not easily
forgotten, something that you shouldn't forget and you can use to a certain
extent in the right way. But I think at the same time, as we step on the court
this time around and we go out, we're focused on what we need to do to execute
and be successful offensively and defensively against the Fighting Irish.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, just what Kia said. We're just going to be
focused on tomorrow. I think we've been trying to tap in to that all year.
It's not something we're just going to bring up just at the Final Four. It's
something we've been remembering throughout the entire year.  
  
But it's a completely different game plan tomorrow. We're just going to focus
on having a good practice today.  
  
Q. For both of you, do you think, as a team -- now, some teams come out,
and they can play with a lot of -- when they're really emotional, they play
better; and when they're not really emotional, they don't quite have that
energy. In some ways, you guys are kind of the opposite that you're better off
when you're just calm and not a real emotional team?  
KIA NURSE: I would say to a certain extent we always come out with a type of
emotion, and you can see it in a lot of the plays. You can see it in a lot of
the celebrations we have, celebrating each other's success. But at the same
time, there's a fine balance and a fine line between being a calm and under
control team, controlling the tempo to what you want it to be in order to be
successful with your game plan.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I don't know. I don't think it's necessarily that. It's
just the right kind of emotion. It's not having no emotion or having emotion.
It's just having the right kind of emotion. Like she said, as long as you can
be emotional and excited for your teammates and celebrating and passionate
about what you're doing, but if you have it under control, then you can use it
to your advantage.  
  
Q. For both you guys, you played Notre Dame back in December. It was a
really good game. They were up double digits in the fourth quarter. You came
back and won it. I remember after South Carolina, you played them, and it was
a 25-point win. What do you learn from that? I'm sure this one was fresh in
your mind. They gave you a pretty good challenge. What did you learn from that
game that will help you tomorrow?  
KIA NURSE: I think there's a number of things. Every time we play Notre Dame,
they come out and give a good fight. They compete, and it's a competitive game
for a full 40 minutes. So for us, it's a matter of learning from what we could
execute better, what we could have been better defensively from that game, but
also understanding that we're at a different point in the season, and
hopefully we've cleaned up a lot of those little things we wanted to be better
at.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's a team that we're very familiar with each other.
We've played each other a lot throughout these years. There's nothing we can
do that's going to surprise them. There's nothing they're going to do that's
going to surprise us. We've just played them so many times.  
  
So like Coach said, whoever plays better tomorrow is going to win.  
  
Q. Gabby, the game against Notre Dame was kind of a tough game for you.
You weren't feeling well. I mean, it was a little bit of a struggle. I'm just
wondering if -- how much that game -- sort of you came out of that saying,
hey, I don't want to go through that kind of thing again?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, that wasn't a fun game for me. Just trying to put it
behind me and just, you know, let the game come to me tomorrow and just be
fresh, have a fresh mind, and just be ready for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll take questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. There was a stretch a few years back when this will be the fourth
meeting of the season between you guys. It was the 16th game in four years.
You can probably call their plays for them and they can call your plays for
you. Is this easier now in a sense that you played them once this year, but it
was three months ago, and it isn't the fourth time? There isn't this extra
rivalry crap that we bring up for you.  
GENO AURIEMMA: I spoke with Muffet last night at an event for the four teams.
We talked about exactly that, that -- she said, I don't even think about you
guys anymore until it's time to play you, whereas before it was a constant. No
matter what else was happening, you knew there was a possibility that you were
going to play each other four times, and it just -- you're right. Like 16
games in such a short period of time, to the point where now it does,
obviously, seem way different.  
  
It does seem easier, I think, on the coaches to not have to constantly be
confronted with Notre Dame this, Notre Dame that, Connecticut this,
Connecticut that. We have our players competing against their players for
Player of the Year, or whatever the case may have been back in those days.  
  
But they're not going away. They've been around for a long time. We're not
going away. So in one sense, I'm thrilled that it's at a whole different
level, but she knows and I know we're always there and they're always there.
The neat thing about it is after every game in December now, I just say to her
all the time, I'll see you in March. Because I know, if I see you in March,
it's going to be in the Final Four. So that's cool.  
  
Q. Geno, could you talk a bit about Crystal's evolution. I think last
year you were saying for her, the basket is a rumor and that kind of stuff.
Obviously, she came back with a lot of confidence this year. What sort of
changed? And I think you were saying the other night, when she is feeling the
worst with her shin splints, is it literally that she can't practice?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, she doesn't practice. I mean, there was -- I bet you it's
been a month where we go to practice -- well, when's the last time we played
South Carolina before the other night?  
  
Q. Early February?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Okay. So from February 1 until now, it's been off and on the
whole time. If we're working on something half-court, she'll come out, and
she'll be involved. The minute we start going up and down, she's over on the
bike.  
  
So it's really difficult to maintain any sense of the rhythm that you're in,
that you need to be in. And I was really -- I mean, I felt for her because
going back to November and December, there wasn't any guard in America playing
way better than her. She was unbelievable in what she was doing. I think she
would have been able to sustain it. Unfortunately, it doesn't play out that
way.  
  
But where she was the other night, that's the kid that we recruited. That's
the kid that I saw. We saw glimpses of it last year in the Baylor game as a
freshman. And after the game, she's being interviewed by all of you. The room
was full. Big game, national television. And she's like, yeah, I like to think
I'm a big game player. I'll never forget that quote. I didn't realize she
meant one big game a year, you know (laughter).  
  
But that was kind of a glimpse of this is what I can do. This is where she
gets an opportunity to prove that.  
  
Q. Geno, over the past decade or two, if you want, how have you seen the
women's game change, evolve, and how have you adapted to that change?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, it's interesting that it goes in cycles, and
there's ebbs and flows to the game. There was a time when the Final Four was
limited to certain schools. It's like college football, you know. Like the
preseason top 7, four of those teams are going to the playoffs. You kind of
knew, all right, these teams are going to be at least in the final eight and
probably get to the Final Four. And then every once in a while, you'd have
somebody sneak in, and then it would be right back to all the No. 1 seeds, and
they were always the same. And then somebody would sneak in.  
  
And then all of a sudden, two years ago, you had three teams that had never
been there, and you go, wow, maybe this is the future. And now we're right
back to four No. 1 seeds. Except two of the No. 1 seeds are not your
traditional Final Four teams in the last 15 years.  
  
So the game has changed where more people have access to the Final Four, more
people have access to the regional finals, the regionals. So that means the
game has grown, and it's grown in every part of the country instead of just
certain parts of the country, like it used to be when I first started. It
still has miles to go, long way to go.  
  
It's our job, I think, to help push it in that direction. And all you can do
is hope that the kids coming out of high school really appreciate all the work
that's been done to make it possible for them to have an opportunity to play
in this environment. Our first Final Four, we played on a college campus, and
there was 8,500 people at the game and one TV station. People see you walk
around town and go, Where you visiting from?  
  
Oh, we're here to play a Final Four game.  
  
What's that?  
  
You know, so it's come a long way in some respects, but we've got so far to
go, which is kind of exciting, to be honest with you. And the level of talent
is off the charts. Way off the charts.  
  
Q. Geno, what was the most exotic trip you guys took in '85 and '86? And
number two, following up on that, you guys have played in all four corners of
the country this year. You played in the middle of the country. I think you
went to Italy preseason. I think you might have played in Canada. How has that
helped prepare this team for like a tournament -- for what you face in a
tournament?  
GENO AURIEMMA: My first year, what would be the most exotic trip? Pittsburgh?
You know, it was like back in -- we were like revolutionary war. We have to go
to Ft. Pitt and fight off the French and Indians or something, I don't know,
back in the day. And we bussed everywhere, and everyone threw $10 on the table
and said, Okay, how much can we eat with that total for the whole team?  
  
It seems like almost another century ago, and now this year we're in Europe
for ten days in August, we're at UCLA, then we fly up to Oregon and then we go
to Nevada. We're in Florida a couple times. We're in Texas a couple times. We
go to Chicago. I mean, it's ridiculous.  
  
I think in some ways the players were really innocent back then. So every
little thing was a big deal. And today, I don't know what fazes them. I don't
know what makes them go wow, except this does. So all that stuff that we do, I
think our kids appreciate it. But they've come to kind of expect that. But
when they get to this, that's when it really pops for them. So all those other
trips are great, but nothing compares to this.  
  
Q. You were just talking about how far the game has come. Every year
about this time of year, we read or hear from somebody about how far the game
has not come, what's good for it and what's not, even though they may not have
seen all that many games. How do you deal with that? What goes through your
head when you read and hear that kind of stuff?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, when I see somebody weigh in on our game, that would be
like me weighing in on and doing a 30-minute piece on ESPN on curling. I don't
know shit about curling. I know it looks cool on TV. I don't know nothing
about it. So the same people could have won curling for the last 50 years, and
I have no idea.  
  
So there's people that have never seen a women's game, have never talked to a
women's basketball player or women's basketball coach, and they have an
opinion at this time of the year, and their opinion usually involves
Connecticut. So how are we bad for the game when we made you pay attention
even that much? And you never used to pay attention. The fact that you're
giving it negative attention, well, you took time out of your really busy day
because no one else will talk to you, to comment on our game. So that, it
makes me like kind of, yeah, you're as stupid as I thought you were.  
  
Then the younger me wants to respond publicly, or privately, and then me, my
age, goes, Why would you respond to that? So I just hold it in and just kind
of move along and wait for a guy I'm friends with to ask me so I can tell him
how I really feel.  
  
Q. Two questions. How many times have you explicitly asked your kids to
tap in to that feeling they had in the locker room after Mississippi State
last year? And do you make an effort to try and bring something new to this
experience for the kids that have been here a few times? Do you try to find
something, an angle or something, so it's a new experience in some way?  
GENO AURIEMMA: The Mississippi State game for me ended when the buzzer went
off, and I never gave it another minute's thought. There's only been a couple
times in practice this year when I brought it up, and never in the sense of
trying to motivate them or try to elicit some kind of motivation about revenge
or anything like that.  
  
If we had lost three straight times in the semifinals in the Final Four and
those kids had never won a National Championship that played in that game,
maybe my response would have been way different. So for me, it began -- it
ended the minute the buzzer went off.  
  
For our players, God bless them. I love every one of my players. They're like
the nicest kids on the planet, and when they tell you, yeah, we'll never
forget how we felt. Seriously. They couldn't remember what time we said
practice was this afternoon. So when we play the game tomorrow, it will be
something that they will remember. But up until now, I haven't seen one shred
of evidence that, wow, they're carrying this around them.  
  
When we lost in 2001 to Notre Dame, and Shea didn't play, and Svetlana didn't
play, and we had two All-Americans sitting out due to injuries and we were up
a bunch because we lost, when Sue and Dee and Asia and Tamika and Swin, when
they showed up September 1, the first day of school, the look in their eyes,
and every day that I saw them walking around campus, in my office, at
practice, in the locker room, there was a look like somebody every day is
going to pay for what happened last year. You could feel it. I don't get that.
I don't see any of that.  
  
Q. Geno, we didn't really talk about it on Monday in Albany, but you've
passed Wooden's record for Final Fours in a row with 11 and passed record of
overall with 19. I know you hate talking about history from that standpoint,
but do you still carry the Wooden book around with you in your briefcase?
Perspective-wise, 11 straight Final Fours is something no one has ever done
before, and 19 total, what does that mean to you as a coach?  
GENO AURIEMMA: That book that I had in my briefcase, I happened to be reading
it at the time, and I happened to be carrying it around, and I put it in my
briefcase. I would read a little bit of it at a time and kind of look at it
every once in a while. Some of it was because it reminded me of a bunch of
stuff when I was a kid in high school, playing basketball, and watching them
play in the NCAA Tournament. It almost had nothing to do with where I was at
that point in time as a coach and where their program was and all that.  
  
And it wasn't until almost after the fact that I started to really pay
attention and started to go, man, I can't tell you how many things are in this
that they did that we did and are doing. The players that they had, the
players that we have. The circumstances that they were winning under, the
circumstances that we're winning under. God rest his soul, I'm glad Coach
Wooden never had to go through the nonsense he'd have to go through today if
he was doing what he did. Everybody just left him alone and said, yeah, he's
the greatest coach of all time and that's the greatest program of all time and
they left it at that.  
  
I gave that book to a friend of mine who really admired Coach Wooden, so I
don't have it anymore. And all these other records and all this other stuff,
it's when I'm reminded of that stuff, it really makes me incredulous that that
could happen. It really does.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering, you know, we talk about it just about
every year when you guys are here, just people seeming to chirp up and saying
that you guys are boring or that it's bad for the sport, and I know some
people say it to a smaller degree when it comes to people like the New England
Patriots or Alabama football. But just what is it about great teams, and
especially great teams in women's athletics, that people just want to slander
them for whatever reason? Is there any -- do you have any thought process on
that at all?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, the easy answer is when you don't understand something,
you either have two choices: One, just want to learn more about it. Don't
comment on it until you do; or, two, you automatically don't like it. So you
have to comment that you don't like it.  
  
The other easy answer is we live in a sexist world, that no matter how much
you want to pretend that we're not, pretend we've made progress, pretend that
things are way better, every opportunity that that segment gets to take a shot
at a women's accomplishment, they're going to do it. They're going to do it.
And the interesting part is it doesn't happen that much, almost never, in
individual sports.  
  
I've not read too much about Serena being bad for women's tennis. Last time I
checked, she wins most of them when she's healthy and ready to go. I've not
read too much about Roger Federer is really bad for men's tennis. The only
time he doesn't win is when he doesn't win, which is not often.  
  
I remember when people, when Tiger was just destroying the PGA field and
people were saying that guy's terrible for golf. No one else can compete.  
  
So it's directed at us specifically, women's team sports, and especially
college kids, not even pros, and it's directed at them. And to me, like, what
do you gain by that? The natural reaction is you want to respond and lash out
and come back at them. And that's probably the worst thing that you can do,
but I know it's hard not to.  
  
So the way we respond to it, how we deal with it, we just say, look, this is
what we do for a living. We coach as hard as we can. We get our kids to do
stuff that's really hard to do. We get them to do it better than anybody else
has done it ever, and those kids are entitled to the kind of success that they
have, and people should appreciate what they do. Plain and simple.  
  
Q. Geno, you talked about how the game has changed certainly over the
last 15 years or so. Every few years, you'll say to us it gets tougher and
tougher, something about the kids or whatever. Yet maybe the game has changed,
maybe the kids have changed to some degree, but the level of excellence and
the consistency over such a period of time doesn't change. Can you put your
finger on why you've been able to do that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Again, there's easy answers to all of these questions, and I
could go and give you the same easy answer that those people we were just
talking about would give you and why they're bad for the game. It's because
every single player coming out of high school goes to Connecticut. No other
good player goes to any other school in America. I don't know how Walz and
Muffet and Vic got here if we have all the best players. So Connecticut has
all the best players in America. Everybody else we play against is a terrible
player. That explains our success. That's the easy answer.  
  
The true answer is we get the kind of kids that fit exactly what we want, what
we do, and how we do things. That doesn't mean they weren't the best players
coming out of high school. For sure, they were. But we've been very, very
fortunate, for the most part, to get those kids that come out of high school
and they want to be coached the way I coach, and they're not afraid to walk
into our building, look up at the walls, see those names and see those banners
and go, I got this. I'm not intimidated by it. What else can I say?  
  
Q. Hi, Geno. Could you tell me a little bit about Kia's personality. She
seems to have such an adult-like presence for your team. How much of her
personality has really evolved over four years? Did she come to you as a
pretty polished person?  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, when you grow up in the family that Kia grew up in,
one, you'd better grow up fast because everyone in that family is high
intensity, high achievers. You've got a mom that played in college. You've got
a dad that played professional football. You've got a brother playing in the
NHL. You've got a sister that played college basketball. So you'd better grow
up fast.  
  
And the other part is you also understand what it's like to be the other
person for a long time in your family. And when she got to Connecticut as a
freshman, it was she's the other kid on the team.  
  
When you think about the iconic players we had on our team when she got here
as a freshman, it was like probably being in her own family. Everybody ahead
of her was a superstar in their own right. And it was for her, hey, I've grown
up with this.  
  
And little by little, each year, she's been able to take on a little bit
bigger role, but she's never forgotten that it's still about how do you play
your role to the best of your ability and not try to be something else. So she
makes more shots now than she did. She's more confident now than she used to
be because she knows she's earned it.  
  
She came to the sidelines in the Notre Dame game freshman year at Notre Dame
in a crazy, crazy environment, and she would just take the ball and put her
head down and go to the basket, either score or get fouled, and she was
playing like way above her years as a freshman. And walked over to the
sideline, and I asked her a question, and she looked me in the eye, and she
couldn't speak. Literally, she's like that. And I went, by the way, you're
playing great. I'd hate to see if you're playing lousy.  
  
And in her mind, like I can't believe I'm doing this. This is my first year.
I'm playing as good as, maybe even better, than the superstars that I admire.
Well, now she doesn't look like that anymore. Like, I belong here. I'm one of
the older guys. This is what I do. I've earned it. I'm thrilled for her. She
deserves it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have
today.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thanks, everybody.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, welcome to today's women's Final Four head
coach media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the Louisville Cardinals head coach Jeff Walz.
Louisville is participating in its third Women's Final Four, after appearances
in 2009 and 2013. With that, I'll ask Coach Walz to come on and provide an
opening statement.  
  
JEFF WALZ: I appreciate this. We are honored to be a part of the Final Four
with three other fantastic programs, and just our players are excited, the
staff is excited. It's a lot of work that goes into this, and as everyone
knows you've got to be playing your best basketball at the right time, and we
feel we're playing pretty well right now. Looking forward to a great challenge
in front of us in Mississippi State.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Stephanie Norman. She's obviously been
there with you the whole time. I'm just curious what makes that dynamic with
the two of you effective and has over the years? And the same way that Geno
was asked for so many years about C.D. leaving, have you ever thought you were
close to Stephanie leaving?  
JEFF WALZ: First, I'll just start with Steph and I, our friendship. It's been
11 years that we've worked here together. We knew of each other before she
became part of the staff 11 years ago, just from all the recruiting, all the
travels that you do in this business. But it's not as though we were, so-
called, real good friends. Then when I did get this job that was someone that
I contacted and asked if she would be interested. She was looking for a new
opportunity at that time. It's been a great 11-year relationship.  
  
I consider Steph a friend. I considered her family a part of ours. It's been
great. She knows what I'm looking for. We work extremely well together. She
knows how I like to handle players, the type of players that we're trying to
recruit. She understands it. She has a family of her own. She has two
children, I have four, and sometimes you've got to run and take care of family
things and we cover for each other.  
  
It's just been a terrific working relationship. I'm not foolish enough to
think that Steph could not go get a job whenever she wanted to. She's one of
the best recruiters in the business. She's excellent with Xs and Os. She's had
some opportunities. Some people have called her. She just hasn't felt like
it's been the right opportunity, the right school.  
  
We've had great success here and she enjoys winning. She loves to win. She
knows she has a ton of freedom to do what she wants when it comes to
recruiting, and even basketball. I count on my staff a great deal. I want them
to have the confidence to be able to give their two cents and give their
opinion. And as I tell them all the time, hey, I'm willing to listen to
whatever you all suggest, as long as it works.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, when you took the job at Louisville, obviously
they had some experience in the tournament, but nothing to the extent you've
seen since you got there. Did you envision this level of success when you took
over the program? I'm sure you want to achieve great things and go far. But to
do what you've done in the time that you've been there compared to what
happened before you, did you expect this level of success?  
JEFF WALZ: I actually -- when I took the job here, I was just grateful to have
been given the opportunity to be a head coach. I'm forever indebted to Tom
Jurich. When Tom was here, he was the athletic director that hired me, I had
applied at several other smaller jobs throughout my years, and could never
even get an in-person interview. So when this opportunity came about and they
reached out, I was like, hey, I'll take the job.  
  
I can remember 11 years ago sitting in the Marriott downtown Louisville and
Tom offered me the job, and he asked me, "What will it take?" And I said,
"What do you mean?" He said, "What kind of salary?" I said, "I don't care. Are
you offering me the job?" I said, "Yeah, I'll take it."  
  
So I took the job, accepted it. Had a press conference before we even knew
what a salary was going to be because I just wanted to get this opportunity to
be a head coach. I would never take a job without the chance to think we could
do some special things.  
  
But to have the opportunity to play in four Elite Eights and now be in three
Final Fours in 11 seasons, I wouldn't say that we thought that was going to
happen. But as we've continued to build this program and recruit some special
players and special families, it's been neat to see it develop and grow
throughout the years.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, as you mentioned Tom hiring you, obviously it's been
somewhat of a tough year for the men's program. How has it been -- what has it
been like? You share practice space with them and such, but just continuing to
do what you do while also seeing your counterparts on the men's side go
through some tough times this year. What's that been like for your program?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we're fortunate. We're in the same building, but they have
their own practice facility. We have our own practice facility. The men's
players are fantastic. Just wonderful young men. They'll stop by, swing by
through the office. I've seen most of them this past few days that have come
out and congratulated us. Their staff has come over to congratulate us.  
  
You know, we all support each other. It's what it's about in college
athletics. There is going to be some change that is going to be made here on
our men's side. I wish David the best because I enjoyed the relationship that
I had to get to know him over the past few years, and their entire staff. I
mean, it's the tough part of the job, but it's been good here.  
  
The men's program has been fantastic to us. I had a wonderful relationship for
ten years with Coach Pitino. I consider Coach a friend. I wish him nothing but
the best. I'm looking forward to seeing him hopefully get back in the game,
because I think he's good for the game, and he's a fantastic coach. I wish
David and the entire staff nothing but the best.  
  
Q. Your match-up with big Teaira McCowan, the 6'7 " kid, there are not
too many people that can match-up with her. How difficult a task do you think
that will be?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I'm hoping Vic decides to drive the bus and makes a wrong
turn somewhere. So if we can have that happen, I'll feel much better.  
  
No, the thing about them, Teaira and Victoria, they get most of the attention
on that ballclub. But you've got to have five, six players that can play and
score at this time of the year, and that's what they have. So, sure, you've
got T averaging 18 points, about 14 boards a night. Victoria's actually close
to 20 and 7. It goes down. Just phenomenal team, and that's what it's all
about.  
  
So we're going to have our hands full. We know that. We're going to try to
come up with a plan and figure out what we can do to try to slow them down.  
  
You aren't going to stop them. That's one thing I can tell you for sure. There
is no stopping Vic and that offense, and the way his kids can shoot and shoot
the basketball and score. So it's going to be can we score? And that's one of
the things that we're going to talk about today and continue to work on. Our
offensive efficiency has to be very good in order for us to win and compete on
Friday night.  
  
Q. One thing you said about the balanced scoring, that's one thing that
you've had going for you lately. I know you've had a run in the tournament and
you've been playing really, really well. You've found the right mix of your
players and they're scoring. How do you feel about that going into this
game?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I really like how we're playing right now. I like what we're
doing at the offensive end. I like how we're sharing the basketball, we're
making the extra pass. We're really getting downhill towards the basket,
trying to get tempo, and that's what we have to continue to do. I don't want
bad shots, but I do want the ball moving, I do want us playing quick.  
  
Q. Every team has an identity. Just wondering, the people of Columbus,
what are they going to see from the Cards? What do you guys hang your hat
on?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you're going to see a ballclub that's going to come out and
compete. That's one thing we containing a lot of pride in. We don't ever look
past the game in front of us. We look at that next game, which is, for us, the
Mississippi State game. We're very fortunate that we play our home games and
we average close to 9 to 10,000 every single night. And I tell our kids every
time before we go out on the floor, it's our job as coaches, as marketing
people to get the fans to show up. It's their job to make sure they want to
come back. So they take a lot of pride in that.  
  
It's not always the scoreboard because we've lost some games at home. It's not
just beating somebody, it's how you play. I think what you'll see on Friday
night is a group of young women who will go out there and play hard for 40
minutes.  
  
I tell them all the time, don't worry about the scoreboard. The scoreboard
will normally take care of itself, if you give great effort and execute for 40
minutes.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, you're known for your defense, and so is Mississippi
State. What are the concerns when you have two teams that just go after it and
press, and really get after it defensively? Is it the offense doesn't drop
off? You talked about efficiency. Is that, as a coach, when you have two
scrappy teams, the offense you have to keep a special eye on that?  
JEFF WALZ: No, I mean, I'm not really concerned about that. I know everybody's
saying, hey, we both guard, we both get after it. Vic's averaging 82 points a
game right now, and I think we're in the mid to high 70s. So I could just as
well see an extremely high-scoring game on Friday night, because I know Vic's
probably saying the same thing to his crew that, hey, we have to score. We
have to continue to score in order to win.  
  
You look at his four NCAA Tournament games, they're 95, 71, 71, 89. So they
continue to put points on the board, and that's what we're going to have to
try and do. We'll obviously guard and so will they. But I think it's going to
be try to focus on scoring the ball.  
  
Q. You've kind of discussed already the match-ups. You've never played
this team before. Maybe you could talk about what are the differences between
the playing styles of your team out of Mississippi State?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I see a lot of similarities in the way we both play. We're
both trying to get the tempo of the game going. We both like to push the ball.
We're willing to shoot the three. But at the same time, we are looking to try
to go inside out.  
  
Now I don't have Teaira in there at 6'7", but I've got four players that play
in the post fourth that might not necessarily be the back to the basket, but
we can make post moves when needed. We like to face-up, shoot it from 15 to 18
feet. So it's going to be different challenges for both teams.  
  
But I think the guard play is extremely strong. Like I said, we both have the
ability to knock down threes. I just think it's going to be a great basketball
game.  
  
Q. You've had such a momentous season this year. Did you see that coming
into the season, and what do you think contributed to all the Cardinals coming
together the way they have this season?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think first off our locker room is as good as it's ever
been. We have everybody that's actually excited for each other. There is
nobody just kind of out for their own. If things aren't going well for them,
they're going to try to get a teammate to jump on their bus. We're all in this
to try to have the most successful season as we can.  
  
You can just go back and look at some of our games. You look at some of the
shots that Asia Durr makes at the end of quarters, and the bench is jumping
off the bench to come congratulate her.  
  
Then I go to our ACC Tournament, where Asia played well, but she did not make
first team or second team All-ACC Tournament. And when they're passing out
those awards and we're on the stage there, and they announce Myisha Hines-
Allen as the tournament MVP, Asia was the first one to give her a hug. Asia
was the first one to congratulate her because these kids don't care. All they
want to do is win.  
  
Everybody knows there could be somebody else each night, and that's what makes
it as special as it is because they truly care about each other.  
  
We haven't necessarily had it to that degree in the past. Now I think with the
players that have decided to be here and want to be here, it's remarkable. My
life has been better. I've been able to go home and enjoy my family. I don't
have to worry about what somebody's going to do or what they might not say.
It's just been good, good character people. It's remarkable. It's just been
one of the most enjoyable years that I've had.  
  
I tell people all the time. They think I'm crazy. The year we went 14-18 here,
and I had Shelby Harper as my point guard who was a walk-on, that was one of
my enjoyable years. I tell you, in the top two or three.  
  
Just the character of the kids and winning games, that's why I say this -- and
I want to make sure I said it, it's not just all about winning 35, 36 games,
whatever our record is -- because that 14-18 year, I have as many fond
memories of that team as I do this team.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, how does the potent back court match-up with
Mississippi State's defense?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I'll tell you that about 9:00 on Friday night I'm hoping that
our offense can handle their defense. It's going to be a great basketball
game. We all have strengths. I know what Morgan Williams can do on the ball. I
know Blair plays unbelievable weakside defense. She takes as many charges as
anybody I've seen on film.  
  
They're just a really, really good basketball team. They're very well coached.
They make it difficult for you. But we're going to come in with a game plan
and try to relieve some of that pressure and see if we can't take advantage of
a few things.  
  
Q. How much of a factor will Asia Durr have on this game coming up?  
JEFF WALZ: I hope a lot. The more factor she has, the more influence she has,
the better it is for me.  
  
Q. You guys played one of the great games against a great center a few
years back with Brittney Griner and Baylor and beating them. I'm not asking
you to give me your whole game plan against Teaira McCowan, obviously. But
when you're facing a good player like that, you have very good post players,
but somebody with that strength and who is that big, do you sort of go in
saying we have three or four different things that we're going to try and say
we'll see how they work and have those adjustments ready? Is that how you
approach somebody who comes with that much size and strength?  
JEFF WALZ: Yes, you have to in my opinion. You know, if our option A works,
fantastic. You know, we can stick with it. But if option A does not work, you
have to have plan B.  
  
I laugh all the time. I tell my staff I always have a plan A and a plan B. We
were either going to be in Columbus playing in a Final Four or I was going on
a ski trip Thursday. So I just cancelled my ski trip yesterday because we're
going to Columbus to play. So it's just the same way that we coach.  
  
If plan A is not going to work, you have to have plan B. And with as talented
a player as Teaira is, we're going to most likely have to have a plan C also.  
  
Q. If I could follow up on that just about the plans. You're known as a
great strategic coach, but in the past few years, and even the last year or
so, there's been more data available in terms of advanced stats, different
things you can look toward. How much have you utilized that to increase your
preparation, or has that meant anything?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what? I really haven't used much of that. I know there is
a lot of it out there. A lot of it is way over my head. I just found out one
of our local reporters said he had a friend that's at MIT that does all the
stats for men's and women's basketball and said, our regional semifinal and
final game, we never let either team go on more than a three-point run, which
is pretty impressive. Knowing with the three-point shot, they never made back-
to-back baskets in two consecutive games.  
  
Now I don't know if that's true, but that's what he told me, which is
something I'm going to be able to go relay to our players today when we
practice, just about the effort they gave and the focus. Because at this time
of the year, I tell everybody, it's all about momentum. It's not about your
seeding. We're all number one seeds. It's all about momentum, and momentum
during the game. Do you let yourself -- if you get the momentum, are you able
to go on a 10-0 run or do you get it to a 14-0 run, or is it something where
it's 4-0, and you've got to breakaway and you make a bad pass, and it goes out
of bounds and now Mississippi State gets the ball and comes down and scores.  
  
So we've been very fortunate these four games where we've had the momentum on
our side that we've really run with it. And that's what we've got to continue
to focus on.  
  
Q. I asked this of this team this year, which has been very important,
but may not get some of the attention of some of the other aspects of
Louisville, the guard play of Arica Carter, and Dana Evans this year as a
point guard. Just talk about what they mean to this team this year?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, Arica and Dana have done a fantastic job for us. I think
that's one of the biggest differences also from last year's team to this
year's team. You know, Taylor Johnson and Briahanna Jackson were our point
guards last year and did a fantastic job. Defensively they were probably
better right now because they were seniors, fifth-year seniors. But
offensively is where things have changed for us.  
  
Arica Carter is shooting close to 40% from three. Dana Evans is able to
penetrate. Has a great pull-up jumpshot. Has the ability to knock down threes.
So because both of those are able to score, I think it's really put more
pressure on the defenses.  
  
Q. As a quick follow-up, one of your assistant coaches, Michelle Clark-
Heard named assistant coach at Cincinnati. Your thoughts on that?  
JEFF WALZ: Just really excited about Michelle. I knew she had worked there.
And Michelle and I have been friends for 20 years. She's done a remarkable job
down at Western Kentucky, how she brought that program back into winning
conference championships, playing in the NCAA Tournament. And now having
worked in Cincinnati before and being originally from Louisville, it keeps her
close to home and family. But will give her a new challenge.  
  
But I expect Michelle to do extremely well. I just think she's a wonderful
person and will do great at Cincinnati.  
  
Q. When you think about Mississippi State and the job that Vic Schaefer
has done, what stands out to you? And how is he thought of within the
profession?  
JEFF WALZ: I think Vic's very well liked. I can just speak for myself, I think
Vic's a great guy. I think he does a fantastic job. I actually consider Vic to
be a friend, someone that I can pick up the phone and talk to. I'm hoping to
get a chance to see him tonight and visit with him.  
  
They're just very well coached. He's done a fantastic job recruiting. We
actually recruited Victoria Vivians also, and he did a great job of getting
her there. Then he's done a remarkable job of recruiting around, and that's
what you do. You fill in pieces. He's really filled in his pieces well.  
  
It should be a great basketball game. All these games should be outstanding.
We know we're going to have to play our best. And we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. How would you describe Vic's personality?  
JEFF WALZ: Vic, I think he's outgoing. I think he's got a great personality.
He enjoys life. He's someone that's going to make the most of the moment. I
think we have a lot of similarities.  
  
We put a lot of time, a lot of hard work and dedication into what we do. But
at the same time you want to make sure you enjoy it. We're getting the
opportunity to go back to our third Final Four here in 11 years. It's not
easy. I'm going to make sure my players enjoy every second of it. I want to
make sure my staff enjoys every second of it.  
  
We'll be ready to play, there is no question about it. But there is no sense
to sit in your room or sit in a hotel and not get a chance to soak in what
Columbus has to offer, especially as your host city for the Final Four.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about how this is going to be your first time
playing Mississippi State. I'm wondering what that does to your coaching staff
who is already under a time crunch, and I'm assuming hasn't been getting much
sleep this tournament and stuff like that. But how does that change the
process and preparation for you guys?  
JEFF WALZ: No, it really doesn't change anything, because we had the same
situation with playing Stanford and then Oregon State. We hadn't played either
of those two teams before, so it was a first.  
  
So it was just a matter of breaking down film. We all jump in this together.
We'll break down as many as we can. Look for tendencies and look for things
that we can hopefully try to attack. But it's fun. It's the fun part of the
job. I say it all the time. In 2006 when I was on staff at Maryland and we won
the National Championship, it was an awesome experience. But at the same time,
we played North Carolina in the semis who we had played twice during the
regular season.  
  
Then we played Duke for the championship, which we had played three times, I
think, because I think they beat us in the ACC finals or semifinals that year.
Sew sometimes it's exciting when you play somebody you haven't played, because
it is a fresh set of eyes and new scout and new challenges.  
  
Q. I was curious about Myisha Hines-Allen. I know when she signed out of
high school, you had to check in with her daily to make sure he was staying on
top of school. And there were questions about if she played hard all the time
and if she knew what that meant. What was her path from that point to who she
is now?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's been a remarkable journey. She is an absolute joy to
coach and to have a part of our program. She'll go down as one of the best
players that's ever played here. She had 2000 points and 1000 rebounds, and
you're looking at Angel McCoughtry is the only other player to have done that.
When you're up there with her, that's pretty good company to be hanging with.  
  
It has been a journey. You go from somebody that out of high school we had the
challenge of academically, work ethic-wise. But she wanted guidance. She
wanted structure. And when she got here, she's really flourished.  
  
As the years have gone on, she's gotten better. She's gotten more focused. Now
she's playing some of the best basketball that she's ever played, and that's a
testament to her. She's been on our AD honor role, which I believe is a 3.0 or
above for six of her seven semesters that she's finished. She's in her eighth
semester right now. We're hoping she can repeat that.  
  
This is a kid that had to get focused and get dialed in to be able to get into
college, to be able to play. And now with the structure that we've been able
to give her and the support, she is thriving both in the classroom and on the
basketball court.  
  
Q. Obviously you played UCONN this year. UCONN, it's the team that's
between you and two possible National Championships previously. But as you
look at them, is what Geno has done and what they've done, have they been good
for women's basketball, or have they sort of like taken away from everybody
else? What is your view on that?  
JEFF WALZ: They're absolutely great for women's basketball. My only question
is when Alabama goes to play for a National Championship, are you all calling
down there and asking them if they're bad for the game because they beat the
crap out of somebody 66-30 starting off the year? They sweep through the SEC,
beating the tar out of everybody. Do they call down there and say, man,
they're bad for the game? No.  
  
It's just what everybody does because nobody wants to see somebody, I guess,
have excellence like they've had. Actually it's getting to a point now where
it's like, guys, should he just lose to make all of you happy or what? They've
done a remarkable job. Give credit where credit is due.  
  
No, it's not bad for the game. Nobody was saying when John Wooden was winning
10 in a row and all that stuff that UCLA was bad for the men's game. It's
really just a shame that people can't enjoy and appreciate how good they are.
I mean, it's pretty darn impressive.  
  
I mean, they show up every single night. He gets great players, which, I mean,
it's what we're all trying to do. But what is more remarkable is how
consistent they play every single night. So, no. If anybody thinks they're bad
for the game, stop watching the gym. Go try to watch a paddle board game or
something, go watch checkers, because if you can't appreciate it, then, please
don't even cover it.  
  
Q. How high is that bar that everybody's trying to get to? Obviously,
when Geno got into it, it was Tennessee everybody was chasing. Have you seen
just the women's game elevated by chasing that bar, so to speak?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, of course. There is no question about it. We had a great
ballgame at their place. We came out, stunk it up in the first quarter,
continued to battle and fight. I think we lose by 12 or 13. They had a great
game in the Final Four last year with Mississippi State.  
  
So it's a great challenge. It's fun. We're all sitting here, as you said,
we're sitting here with two runner ups that I would have loved to have had a
National Championship. But I'm not sitting here going, man, I wish UCONN
didn't exist so we could have won. Well, somebody else may have beaten us.  
  
So it's just a credit for what Geno has done and how he's continued to build
that program. I admire it and respect it.  
  
Q. You all played them as tough as anyone. But what do you remember from
them back in February that sticks out in your mind when I bring them up right
now?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, they score. They score the basketball. That's what I tell
everybody all the time. In order to beat UCONN, you have to score the
basketball. Their defense is as good as it is because their offense is so
good. You go on a two-minute, three-minute drought, and they've scored 8 to 10
points. So because they're able to score it as well as they do, that puts
pressure on your offense, just as much as their defense puts pressure on you.
So at times you've got to figure out a way just to slow them down so you don't
have as much pressure on yourself to score every possession.  
  
Q. You were talking about Dana. The one thing I remember about Dana
coming out of high school is she was one of those kids that was all score,
score, score. She had to do everything for her team as far as shoot the ball.
What kind of things did you instill in her to get her to be more of a pass-
first point guard? And on the defense, she does a great job.  
JEFF WALZ: You know what? She has been a joy to coach. I've got a great --
I've built a great relationship with her. I keep telling her she has a chance
to be an elite point guard at this level, and it is different for her.  
  
She averaged 36 points a game last year in high school. Now it's about
teaching her about efficiency. Teaching her, hey, I want you to be able to get
to the point where you're getting 16, 17 points a night. But with that being
said, I want you to do it with taking 15, 16 shots a game, and that's the
difference.  
  
In high school, when you're the player sometimes and you have to do that, you
have to score in the 30s, well, you might be taking 25 or 30 shots a game. You
know, that's kind of what I like to show our players is don't just look at how
many points somebody's scoring, but look at how efficient they're able to do
it. Because it doesn't impress me if you can score 25 points a game, but
you're taking 41, 42 shots a game. I could do that. Well, you probably
couldn't. I've seen you play (laughing). You know I'm kidding.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Good morning, everyone. Really want to first start by just
talking about how proud I am of my kids and our team. Obviously very hard to
do what they have been able to do this year. They have had the target on their
back from day one, just talking about last year and what they were able to
accomplish; as the year went on this year, being undefeated for 32 games was a
big challenge and they handled that like a pro all year long.  
  
The one game we did lose, we lost to the better team that night. South
Carolina is obviously very good and Dawn does a tremendous job, her and her
staff. Just wasn't our night. Wasn't that we weren't ready. Wasn't that we
weren't prepared. Just it wasn't our night.  
  
But these kids have had two pretty big bulls-eyes on their back all year long,
and have just really handled that, unlike any time I've ever coached. It's the
best offensive team I've ever been associated with in 33 years. To have four
senior guards, the leadership that they have provided has been out standing,
and their maturity, really, is beyond anything, again, that I've ever
experienced as a head coach.  
  
In particular Teaira McCowan inside is a double-double machine. She has had an
incredible year. She's had 26-double-doubles this year; she's had had 30-20
games, numerous 20-20 games and here and Tori are both very deserving of their
All-American status that they have earned.  
  
Point guard play has opinion tremendous with Morgan and Jaz, it's allowed us,
people don't realize, we're redshirting three-time Gatorade Player of the
Year, Myah Taylor, who came in as a point guard and that's the luxury we have
with two great point guards in Morgan and Jaz.  
  
Just really excited, again, to get back to Columbus. Again, so hard to do to
see these kids have the success they have had. I'm just really proud and happy
for them.  
  
I'd be remiss without mentioning my staff. Johnnie Harris, my associate head
coach came here to Mississippi State. I would not have come here without her.
She has been named the Assistant Coach of the Year by the WBCA. Carly Thibault
bow has been named one of the 30-for-30 coaches. Dionnah Jackson-Durrett, my
other assistant, who is on our staff and does a tremendous job.  
  
So I'm just really blessed with what I think is the best staff in the country.
They do a great job preparing these kids, and help develop them. That's been a
secret to our success. I think anybody that's followed us over the last six
years, they know our recipe is recruit, retain and develop and I think we've
done that.  
  
We have no McDonald's All-Americans but we have kids that fit in our system,
they play extremely hard. They are committed. You know, I think the other
piece that people don't realize is we had a team GPA of 3.4 in the fall.
Really proud of our program and where we are and excited about the
opportunity.  
  
Obviously you have three other great, great programs, great teams, great
coaches, in the Final Four, and we are just proud to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the All-America awards and what
Victoria and what Teaira and what Morgan have meant?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, they are very well deserved. I'm really happy for
them, proud of them. Again, I think it shows a tremendous commitment on their
part, my staff's part, with those players.  
  
Those student athletes are very deserving. Morgan, as our point guard for four
years here, she's really playing well right now, too. And again, she gets
pushed every day by Jaz in practice, and they have made each other better.  
  
You know, Victoria, to improve your shooting percentage 13 percentage points
from two, and I think seven from three, from junior to senior year, is really
astounding. Typically, the most improvement you make is between your freshman
and sophomore year, but she's really taken off, playing with so much
confidence right now. Had a heck of a regional in Kansas City, her and Teaira
both were MVPs. I've never heard of that, co-MVPs of a regional, and both of
them were deserving. I commend the people that voted on that for giving it to
both of them because they both were outstanding.  
  
Obviously Teaira, I've said it all year long, the kid does it night-in and
night-out, 27, I think. You would know better than me but I think it's 27
double-doubles in the Southeastern Conference with two and three people
hanging on her.  
  
To be able to do it consistently over the course of the season, is really,
really difficult to do. We had a heck of a non-conference schedule, as well,
and just so proud of her and her development. And I say this all the time: I
still think she's got -- she can go a whole lot further. I think her
development is still way out there, and she just can become even more
dominating, if that's even possible, which it is in my mind, you know, with
another great summer and a good fall.  
  
Q. That stat you mentioned earlier with the assistant coaches, what
parts of you, either personality-wise or basketball-wise, does each of them
kind of balance out, and in particular, how did Dionnah become part of that
staff?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, my staff, is incredible. We are all so much -- first
of all, we're family. They don't work for me. They work with me. We work
together. They embrace the grind. They embrace the process. It is a hard-
working -- they are so committed to our student athletes. Their attention to
detail is spot-on.  
  
I mean, we are all so much alike in terms of competitiveness and making sure
that we cover our bases. We have everything, you know, not wanting to be
surprised by anything in our preparation, and then the recruiting piece, they
are just bulldogs, for lack of a better word. They are bulldogs when it comes
to recruiting.  
  
Again, just really blessed to have this staff, a mixture of experience and
youth; and at the same time my youth is mature beyond its years, just again,
the work ethic that this group has is amazing. I've been able to surround
myself with people that have the same goals, the same drive, the same vision
that I have, and that's the secret I think to any company, any program, is
you've got to surround yourself with people that are better than you in some
areas, you know that, have a drive and embrace the grind.  
  
There is no time in our day. There's no -- in other words, there's no 8:00 to
5:00. It's daylight to the next day. I mean, it's just the way it is. I just
appreciate them so much.  
  
I was able to hire Dionnah a couple years ago. I got her from George Mason,
came highly recommended to me, and you know, her and Carly both have been
tremendous additions. Johnnie and I have been together a long, long time, and
you know, we're family. I mean, she's done a heck of a job developing Big T,
and as a post coach does so much for our program.  
  
She's that assistant that when I'm gone, if there's got to be a decision made,
she knows which decision it make and which one I would make. She's tremendous.
I can't say enough about Johnnie, what she means to me personally as well as
professionally. We're family. That's the best thing I can say about her.  
  
Q. A little more on Teaira, if I could. I can remember when she was a
younger player, you talked about just how there was so much to sort of build
on with the raw potential of her. As you said, we're seeing that now. When you
look back, even at the history of the last, I don't know, ten, 15 years of
women's basketball, do you see her starting to really compare to some of the
great centers that we've seen in the game, the great true centers, and what do
you think are the things that she's most developed so far in her three years
with Mississippi State?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: I think the thing that's really impressed me about her is
just how hard she plays the game; in particular, her pursuit of the basketball
rebounding.  
  
She just -- there are times when I thought over the weekend, there were times
when she just would not be denied, and she has really become that -- that Bill
Russell-type, who understands angles and shots when they are coming off. She
just has a tremendous nose for the ball. Her pursuit of the basketball has
really become I think a staple for her.  
  
It's hard to get a body on her and it's hard to move her. You know, her
strength, I think is really another dominating factor in her game. I think the
thing that as the year's gone by now this year, she's developing that skill
set.  
  
Her touch around the rim, her ability to get to her spots, and score from
them, in more than one way. That's still coming and we still have a lot of
work, in my mind, to do there, but just to be able to watch her develop her
skill set; her free throw percentage, for instance, she started off the year
in the 30s. She's now in the high 60s, but if you look over the last five
games, she's at 80-something. She's done a tremendous job there improving her
touch, her face-up game and her range.  
  
I'm proud of her. As you know, those post players, they do all the dirty work.
They are down there, you know, leaning, rubbing, getting shoved around and a
lot of their development, too, is not just the physical piece but after you do
all that and you run the floor and a guard misses you on a post-up, you know,
you can't get upset about that. You have to turn right back around and go back
and do it again and hope the next time, they don't miss you.  
  
That's the mental possess that a lot of the big kids, post players, men and
women, sometimes have a hard time dealing with, and she's been just a champ
and a pro.  
  
Q. When you took the job, what did you envision this program being?
Obviously it had not been a powerhouse. What was it about Mississippi State
that you thought, I could get it done here?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: My vision is exactly what we're experiencing last year,
this year. I believed this could happen. I believed that we had the blueprint.  
  
Again, part of that blueprint was Johnnie coming with me. You know, her
knowledge of the game and her knowledge of what it takes in a program. That's
such a broad -- there's so many things that go into developing a program. I
didn't believe I was brought here to have a Top-25 team.  
  
As I told Scott Strickland, my athletic director then, I wanted to come here
and build a Top-10 program. There's a difference between Top-25 teams and
Top-10 programs. Programs are there every year. Year-in, year-out. You pick up
a preseason pole, you're looking for a certain team in the Top-10. You don't
know where they are going to be but they are in the Top-10. Those teams 17-25
are fluid. One week they are in the pole, the next week they are out, the next
week they are not receiving votes, the next week they are receiving.  
  
That's not what my vision was. I envisioned us building a Top-10 program here,
and again, I believed we could do it because of the people, because of the
administration. Our facilities are incredible, and it's a beautiful part of
the country.  
  
Again, I'm not from Mississippi. I don't think I've been in this state other
than to recruit the No. 1 player in the country one year and then I had to
play here three times out of six years when I coached at Arkansas. So other
than that, I had never even been through the state, but it's a tremendous
place, tremendous people in this state. And we have a beautiful campus.  
  
I can't tell you how many times I've had recruits and parents here and their
parents have told me, "Coach, we had no idea this was here." I think I've lost
six kids in six years who have actually been on official visits here.  
  
But again, the only piece is, I had to have the right staff. We had to have
the right people here that would be committed to our mission, and again, we
didn't panic. That first year, when we went 13-17, that may be the best job in
coaching I've of done. I didn't think we'd win three games and we won 13, won
five in the league, and so you know, we didn't panic. We just went would work.
We went recruiting.  
  
That first recruiting class wasn't highly ranked. I think they were ranked
35th and maybe seventh in the league of 14 teams, but they were kids that fit.
They fit our style of play. They fit what we desperately needed here, which
was a competitive spirit and toughness. We just didn't have that.  
  
So it's been fun building it.  
  
Q. You're going to get a variation of this, I'm sure, all week. You're
the only team that's beaten UCONN in a long time. How much relevance is there
to that, and even though you beat them last year, you didn't get the ultimate
prize which I'm sure drives you.  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: I think every year is new and different. Our mission this
year is unfinished business. Our kids have embraced that. I'm sure
Connecticut's is similar. They want to get back and have that opportunity
again, and they have been driven by that.  
  
I think you could see last night, they are very focused and playing at an
unbelievable high level. I mean, they are so, so talented, so good, so well
coached. You know, they are just -- they are on a mission, as well.  
  
I think we've both been probably fueled by what happened a year ago. For us,
we've now got to get ready and play a very, very good Louisville team that's
extremely well coached, great players. We're both from very good conferences
and so you know, that's our challenge this week is trying to get ready for
them.  
  
But I'm sure that everyone has their own motivations to get to where we are
right now, and I think it's, you know, I'm glad I'm one of the 1-seeds that
made it. I would have hated to have been the one that didn't. All four 1-seeds
made it and now we are all motivated to try to get to the last game of the
year.  
  
Q. Every team has an identity. You're coming to Columbus. What can you
tell the fans, the city, what is Mississippi State's identity? What are they
going to see?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Our kids, I think they are going to see a very -- a team
that typically all year has been able to score. We shoot it extremely well.
We've got four kids around the perimeter that can really shoot it. We've got
the big bookend inside in Teaira.  
  
But I think past all that, you're going to see a team that plays extremely
hard. You know, someone wants to describe you as an individual player or your
team, as a tough, physical, aggressive basketball team, you'd probably like
that.  
  
I think a football coach would like it if they described your football team as
a tough, physical, aggressive team; you'd like that, I think in any sport.
Well, that doesn't say anything about your skill set.  
  
I think for us, we've really tried to embrace that. It's part of our program.
It part of our DNA of who we are. We have a saying in our locker room: It's
not what we do but how we do it that separate us from the rest of the country.  
  
This team has really prided itself on work ethic, attention to detail, and I
think you're going to see a team that has tremendous chemistry, and they love
playing the game. They really have a lot of fun playing a game. They have been
a blast to coach. I think anybody that has seen us across the country knows
that. Anybody that hasn't seen us, I think they will be impressed by how hard
these kids play.  
  
Q. You talked about your shooting. Has the women's game followed along
with the men's game where spacing, three-point shot is becoming sort of more
and more important? Do you embrace that or do you approach it a little
differently?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, this year's team certainly has. I've never, like I
said, this is the best offensive team I've ever had. They are just really,
really talented. We can space the floor and shoot it at four shots and then
again it's hard to get help off anybody to deal with Teaira inside.  
  
So we have, we've embraced it. Really, again, it the first team I've had like
that. Last year's team was more defensive-minded. I've complained a lot about
this year's team defensively, and yet we averaged in the Southeastern
Conference, we held people to 55 points a game and something like 39 percent
field goal percentage defense, which isn't that great. But the points, I do
like the points allowed.  
  
Offensively we've averaged, 82, 84 points a game all year. Our point
differential in the Southeastern Conference was 24 points in 16 conference
games, which is unbelievable. It's off the chart.  
  
Last year's team was 13, when we went 13-3, it was 13 points. So year's team
is obviously offensively much more skilled and talented. So we've certainly
embraced the four at one end for sure.  
  
Q. I was just going to ask you, you talked about having a bulls-eye on
your back and how proud you've been of your team for getting through the
season and winning all those games, looking at a program like UCONN which is
in its 11th straight Final Four, you hear that number and you think of how
hard it is just to get to two. What does it say about UCONN's program? What do
you think about that streak for them?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, again, it's a level of excellence never before seen
in the game of basketball, not just women.  
  
I think what Coach Auriemma and his program, his staff, have been able to
create with their student athletes is outstanding. It's an incredible run, and
it's not like it's going to end any time soon, I don't think. They are
obviously extremely driven and highly motivated. They have done it every year.  
  
So if and when it ever does -- when they retire, which obviously I don't know
when that will be, but if and when that run ever ends, I don't think it will
ever be seen again. I mean, it's just -- they have just been incredible. They
are to be commended for it. It's an incredible feat, and trust me, I've lived
it for the one year here, and they have done it forever, it seems like, just
forever.  
  
Again, I have so much respect for them, knowing how hard it is, and they just
do it every year. I mean, they just crank it out every year, do it every year
at such a high level.  
  
Look, they are not just winning. He said it last night. It's not just about
winning for them. It's how they win and how they play the game, and that's
what I've tried impart on these kids here in our program. It's how you play
the game and how you respect and honor the game, and I think that's where he's
at with his program and how they coach. It's how they play. I think that's the
piece that gets lost in all this is the way they play the game and dominate
the game, in all facets, not just one.  
  
You know, they talk about their offense and how good it is, but let me tell
you, they are really good defensively, trust me. I got held to 38 one time.  
  
Q. You talked about not having McDowell as an All-American, and we've
had that discussion before, but when you picked Morgan William out of the
crowd, what make made you pick Morgan because she seems like the glue that
runs your show.  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: No question. She's really been special and what a blessing
to have had her here these last four years.  
  
You know, we saw a kid that provided who we are: How hard she plays; she's so
quick, athletic, fast, long, but really just plays the game like a bulldog.
She's just tough, hard-nosed, competitive. That kid played with a broken leg
her sophomore year. Most kids would have turned it in and sat out six weeks.
She played through it.  
  
It's just been a blessing for me and our program here for four years. Love her
like my own. She rooms with Blair. They are roommates. You know, just a
special, special kid. But we saw a kid that fit what we needed and we've had
some -- I've been a part of some great point guard over the years, but that's
where it starts, really, for me, and for us is you've got to have great point
guard play.  
  
You have no chance in the Southeastern Conference if you don't have great
point guard play, and she's really provided and been a steady player there
game in, game out, day-in, day-out in practice and year-in, year-out.  
  
Q. To follow up, do you think your girls like Victoria and Teaira, and
even Morgan, not being selected for All-American teams out of high school, do
they use that as motivation?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: I don't think there's any question; you and I both know,
people get all caught up in putting a number by some kid's name, and it
affects in how they are judged in so many opportunities. Not just in what
college thinks they are good enough or recruits that, but even past that
whether it's representing your country, or even at the next level.  
  
These kids have all had opportunities to make some other teams while they are
here, and they have not been chosen. You know, for whatever reason, these
kids, they have tremendous pride. I do, too.  
  
It's disappointing and disheartening because I know who they are and how hard
they work. I know what kind of basketball player they are and I know what kind
of teammate they are. I don't think there's any question that, you know, these
kids belong. They have proven it and I'm happy for them. It can be a little
bit frustrating.  
  
Q. Just curious, we've talked a lot on this call about your team, but
talking about the matchup that you have ahead of you, what do you make of the
challenge that Louisville presence and what do you think you guys will have to
do to get to the title game?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, they are really good. They are awfully talented.
Obviously Jeff does a tremendous job. We're going to have to really play well.
They have obviously got one of the greatest players in the game right now and
Player of the Year in the ACC. But they have also got the other players around
her.  
  
One of my questions yesterday in our staff meeting: Okay, we know about Asia,
but who else is capable of going off and really hurting you, and of course, we
all knew the answer, but it created an opportunity for us to have
conversations about that because they are very talented at every position.  
  
The thing is, Jeff's going to do a great job. He and his staff are going to do
a great job not only getting them ready but having them prepare for the things
that we do and we do well. You're going against a complete program. You're
going against an incredible staff. You're going against great players. They
have had a heck of a year as all four teams have had. But just you're going to
have to be an your A Game and because they are really, really talented,
really, really special.  
  
Jeff, I know Jeff well and I have a tremendous amount of respect for the job
he's done there at Louisville.  
  
Q. Doesn't look like you've ever played each other before.  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: We haven't. We saw each other that first year when I was
year. I think we saw each other in Puerto Rico or maybe Puerto Vallarta that
we played a tournament together and didn't play each other, of course he was
very good then and we weren't very good.  
  
I think that's the thing this time of year. We had never played UCLA either.
Typically I've got a file that's three inches thick on every team I play, and
even the TV people made a comment about my file on UCLA. Well, we just haven't
played them very much, or any. The same will be true with Louisville.  
  
I have had the opportunity to watch them play. I've made a point to watch them
play during the season because I have so much respect for Jeff and their
program and like watching how they play the game. They are similar to us in a
lot of areas.  
  
You know, I have seen them play, but it is a unique deal when you don't play
somebody or haven't played them before. To play them on this stage, on a
national stage, you know, it will be unique.  
  
Q. I know you haven't had a lot of time to break down the Louisville
squad yet, but what are some of the things that you all are thinking you need
to do offensively and defensively to compete with the Cardinals?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, you know, No. 1, I think they are really good
defensively. I think they play a lot like us in some of the things they like
to do. Obviously you're dealing with an All-American in Durr that's just
really hard to deal with.  
  
Again, you have to be careful. If you take your focus away from someone else,
there's someone else on that team that can go get 20 on you if you blink.  
  
So you've got to be prepared for a total, total team, and so for us, we've
really got to pay attention to detail. We've got to understand the scout.
We've got three days to do that.  
  
And then defensively, I know he's -- I've gone back and looked at historical
things that he's done in the past with certain teams that might be similar to
us, and so again, it's just going to be real important that we -- I call it
coaching against a ghost. I'm always worried about what somebody might do.
Well, that's what I'm worried about here because what he might do, he's done
before. But just because he hasn't done it in the last ten games doesn't mean
he won't do it against us.  
  
So that's what makes a great coach, and a great staff, is whatever they have
got in their defensive package or offensive package, that's what you're
constantly worried about. I think they are so multiple in so many things they
can do offensively and defensively, it's what makes them a great team, and
Jeff a great coach.  
  
Q. This nickname, Secretary of Defense, obviously you guy take a lot of
pride as being a coach who stresses defense. What are the pillars of that
philosophy?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, over the years, it's been a pressure, our ability to
pressure the basketball and take away things that people want to do.  
  
You know, it's become increasingly more difficult to have that philosophy, but
we haven't changed. Back when three, four years ago, we had some little
changes and some emphasis in hand shaking and things like that, if you notice
across the country, there's a lot more zone being played.  
  
I remember calling Johnnie in that day, saying, you know what, we are going to
coach better and teach better. We've built a fan base here based on how hard
our kids play, our toughness, our competitive spirit and I just don't think
that we'd have the fan base we'd have right now if we were standing around in
a 2-3 zone, and that's not to knock that. It may be great for someone else,
but it's not what we hung our hat on around here, and I don't think -- I don't
think we'd have 10,000 people come to see us play every night if that's what
we were doing.  
  
But it's what's been successful for me as a coach is our pressure man, and we
pick up full court, we press the whole game. We just try to wear you down. You
know, we've been really fortunate to have some great players here that have
been able to provide that type of intensity. They embrace the fact that you
have to play so hard.  
  
Q. One question about Teaira McCowan. What difference does it make to
have someone so talented and so tall? How much does that change the dynamic of
everything?  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I'll answer that with just one simple comment. You
can see the impact Teaira McCowan has on our team by how badly we missed her
in the championship game of the Southeastern Conference tournament when she
had two fouls in the first, you know, four, five minutes. I sat her down the
entire first half pretty much and we're down 11 at the half, and we can't turn
it around and make the comeback.  
  
You see firsthand the impact she's had on our program. She's very impactful.
She impacts the game both ends of the floor. It's not just the shots that she
blocks. It's the ones she alters. It's the times that you think you're going
to dribble penetrate and you look up and there's six, seven standing in the
lane and you go, you know what, I think I'll turnaround here and get back out
in the perimeter.  
  
She obviously cleans up a lot of our mess when we miss shots. She's a very
impactful player for us.  
  
Q. Watching the game against UCLA, there was a point in the third
quarter when Teaira thought she blocked a shot and she was called for a foul,
and the official -- Teaira, I observed Teaira muttering under her breath,
"that's not a foul," and Victoria, crossed the lane, come over from the left
block to the right block, kind of, you know, calmed her down a little bit. You
talked about Victoria's maturation as an offensive player, but can you talk a
little bit about her maturation as a basketball player, as a teammate? No
disrespect to her; I'm not sure she would have done that earlier in her
career.  
COACH VIC SCHAEFER: No question. I think this entire senior class, I told them
back in August, and I've shared this with you all: The two things that would
at the point us from this day, from the opportunity to be in the Final Four,
would be our maturity and our leadership. Those were the two question marks I
really felt like this team had and that we needed to address.  
  
You know, seeing Toro do that really speaks volumes for her, her maturity, and
her leadership. You know, it's an emotional game. I've got emotional players.
You know what, I'm an emotional coach, so we're all passionate about what we
do and how we do it. That was a great opportunity that Toro took upon herself
to lead.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 27, 2018

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coach media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish,
Muffet McGraw.  
  
Notre Dame is making its eighth Women's Final Four appearance and seeking its
second national championship.  
  
I'll ask Coach McGraw to do a quick opening statement, then we'll take your
questions.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Thanks, Rick. It's so great to be back heading to the Final
Four, especially with this team. It means so much to me to see them rewarded
for their incredible year of handling adversity, just being relentless in
pursuit of their goals.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thank you so much. We'll take questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. What is your identity? Every program has an identity. What do people
coming to these games expect to see in Columbus?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I would say that our identity has really been on offense.
I would prefer it was not the case. I think we're a pretty up-tempo team and
we've been scoring a lot of points.  
  
Q. There's this idea of adapt or die. There's a perception that Notre
Dame, UConn, peanut and butter jelly sandwich for decades. I would assume that
is not accurate. As a program, you have to adapt. You are not the same team
doing the same things you did 10 years ago?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No, absolutely not. We are a much different team. I think we're
much more of a balanced team, much more of a high-scoring team. I think we
played a little differently than we did 10 years ago, playing a little bit
faster.  
  
We've always been pretty guard-oriented. I think offensively we have been
running the same offense for about 10 years. I think we've perfected it a
little bit more. I think we've added some things, put in some new wrinkles and
adapted to each team, done different things to suit the players' strengths.  
  
Q. Obviously you have a really good rivalry game coming up. From your
perspective, how has this rivalry evolved from the days of the Big East where
you only see them a couple times a year now compared to three or four times a
year like you would?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, that was definitely a lot of fun being in the Big East,
playing them. I know two years in row a we played them four times. Just really
created a great rivalry. We had some good games during that rivalry.  
  
Lately we have not played as well, and they've definitely been the ones that
have dominated the series. For us, I think it's always been an exciting game.
I think we are a team that wants to compete, and we are going to go in and
play the underdog role this time.  
  
Q. Do your players like that underdog role? Is that something that helps
them come out with a little bit more fire?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know because we haven't been in that role enough this
year. I think most of the games that we've been in, with the exception of
probably the ACC final, we were supposed to win. I don't think this team
really cares if there's a target on their back or what they are.  
  
But I think it's great for us to know there's no pressure on us, that this is
a game where we're the underdog. We're going to finally be wearing our dark
uniforms, so I think maybe that will make us feel a little different coming
out.  
  
Q. Of the 12 assistant coaches who are in the Final Four, all but one
are women. I believe that's the second year in a row that's the case. With
your experience in this sport, your involvement with the WBCA, is that reason
to be encouraged? Is it too small a sample size to be meaningful as far as the
opportunities that are available right now?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would love to see more female head coaches. I would also love
to see a little more diversity, especially African American women as head
coaches.  
  
I do really appreciate the fact that Geno hires all women on his staff. I'm
not sure if the others are all women, but I think it's so important that they
do have all female staffs when it's a male head coach.  
  
Q. With someone like Niele on your own staff, what conversations do you
have with her about her future, what might be down the road for her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's got big things in store. She's a rising star. I think
she's going to be the next great coach coming up the ranks. Every year picks
up a little bit more. She never stops learning. Every time a job opens, I'm
pretty sure she's going to get a phone call. Hopefully they wait till after
the season. I'm afraid I'm going to lose her every single year.  
  
But she has such big things in store for her. I couldn't be happier with her
development, and her contribution to our team. She's the one that does the big
scouts, she's in charge of recruiting. Really she does it all. She definitely
is going to be a head coach very soon.  
  
Q. Can you talk about all the injuries, things y'all went through this
year. Also, how much does this season mean to you to get back knowing you had
all the adversity?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think just to start out without having Brianna Turner,
you lose an All-American. She changes the game when she's in the game because
she can block shots, she's a defensive presence, she can do so many things.
Initially we at least had time to prepare, What will we do without Bri? Then
we got Jessica Shepard. That eased the pain of that a little bit.  
  
When you lose players throughout the season, Mikayla Vaughn, Mychal Johnson go
down before we even started, there's our best defensive guard gone. Then
Mikayla, not having Bri, we had that athletic post that could block shots. She
was coming along. We lose her.  
  
Then to lose Lili Thompson first game of the ACC, she's playing point,
starting in point, coming off the bench at point, giving Marina especially a
chance to play her normal position. We had to retool yet again in the midst of
a game to figure out could Jackie Young play some points. Marina is going to
take over the job full-time, how is her improvement to be.  
  
I think the key to our success right now has been Marina. I'm not even sure
what the word is. She learns so much. You see her directing so much more now
than she did before.  
  
Q. How gratifying is this for you, with all the injuries you had, that
your team had the resilience to get back to the Final Four?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We keep shaking our heads. I think I'm kind of torn between
crying and laughing. It means so much. There's so much emotion because of what
we've been through. The resilience of this team, how they just are relentless
in pursuit of their goal. They didn't ever quit or question whether or not we
could do it.  
  
Just to have that experience of getting to the Final Four, you need to have
those experienced players to keep your program going. Now we have freshmen who
have been to the Final Four. That's going to help us in the long run.  
  
Q. If you had one word to define your team, what would it be?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would say 'resilience'.  
  
Q. When you took over, you had a blank canvas. I remember the John
Wooden days. He had the pyramid of success. When you took over, what are some
of the building blocks that you envisioned to make this what it is?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I've learned a lot, changed the blocks quite a bit over
the years. I think when you start out, you just want to get good players. You
don't really care about anything else. I got to get the best players I can
get. I learned that lesson the hard way.  
  
I would say that our building blocks now are about our culture. It's about
having high-character kids who care about each other and care about winning
more than themselves.  
  
I think it's an unselfish attitude that this team has. They're a team of
workers. They love being in the gym. They love being together. I think that
kind of team-first attitude and the chemistry of our team has definitely been
the most successful team that we've had. Certainly over the last 10 years
that's been our focus, is trying to find the right fit more than the talent.  
  
Q. Was there ever a time this year with the injuries that you thought,
Can we take any more? Was there a turning point where, This is going to be
okay?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was definitely the former. I think when Lili Thompson went
down, that really changed everything. Not having the point guard that could
handle pressure, that could run the team, that had a great mind for the game,
just really poised, had the experience. She had absolutely everything that we
were lacking at the time. That was a blow. Happened on New Year's Eve.  
  
Then I think almost the next week or so, Jackie Young got a broken nose. We
didn't know if she would be able to play because we couldn't get a brace on it
in time. She had to have it on. The training room put together a brace they
found, a 20-year-old thing that some baseball player wore at one time. It was
horrible, but she played through it.  
  
That almost broke me, when I didn't know if Jackie was going to be able to
play. I just kept thinking, How much more can we take?  
  
About a month later, Kathryn gets elbowed in the eye. Her eye is shut. She
can't see. She's out for that game, possibly the next one. When you only have
seven, every little thing that happens in practice, you just worry.  
  
But I think kind of the turning point was really the Tennessee game when we
came back from whatever we were down, came back to win that game against a
really good team.  
  
Q. You've played UConn so many times, 47 times. In particular the game
at the beginning of this season where you had the lead going into the fourth
quarter. I know the personnel changed because you lost Thompson. Are there
things you take specifically from that game along with all the experience you
have against them going into this Final Four?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think that game really helped our confidence (audio
interruption).  
  
RICK NIXON: Muffet, if you could start over again, you dropped out a bit
there.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, it was a long answer.  
  
I think we gained a lot of confidence from the game at Connecticut. I think
both teams have made some changes (audio interruption) and both playing the
same number of people, so...  
  
Q. You mentioned the recruiting aspect, realizing things like character
and the fit of a program sometimes can be bigger even than a certain
athleticism you might be looking for. Geno talked about how you guys a lot of
times may recruit the same players because they're looking for that, too, the
player who wants to go to a program. Could you compare how often you have gone
for the same players, and how important is that in what both of you have
accomplished, to get that type of player?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We both love the same kind of player. We compete against each
other constantly (audio interruption). I think Geno has the same kind of
approach. We have both passed on some really talented players. It's
interesting when you see UConn is not recruiting them either. Maybe we were
right in what we were thinking.  
  
Q. I believe you're one of two programs to beat these UConn programs
multiple times in a row. Are there any lessons you can take from one victory
to lead into the next, to be able to beat this program multiple times in a
row?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Kayla McBride is someone that always played well in that game,
had the most success. (Audio interruption). I think we might have won six of
eight. I'm thinking of calling them back, see if they can (audio
interruption).  
  
RICK NIXON: Muffet, you dropped out.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Did you get my answer?  
  
RICK NIXON: Maybe the last portion again.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: To come back with Skylar, get the most success against UConn if
we get them back to be on the bench, to come join this game.  
  
Q. Are there any kind of things in all your experience against them that
you know a team specifically needs to compete against them?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I mean, they're just such a tough matchup because everybody can
score. They can score from the perimeter. They can beat you on the block. I
don't think there's any (audio interruption) we see coming in. We're going to
have to play the best game of the year.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks, Muffet. It's been a busy 24 hours for you. Appreciate you
jumping on the call today. We look forward to having you in Columbus in the
morning.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Thanks.

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's women's Final Four head
coach media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the UConn Huskies, Geno Auriemma.
UConn will be playing in its record 11th straight women's Final Four in 2018,
and be playing for a record 12th National Championship. At this time I'll ask
Geno for some opening remarks and take your questions. Geno, I'll turn it over
to you.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. Well, it's been kind of a whirlwind for all
four of us coaches, I'm sure. But this is the day that all the players, all
the coaches, when the season starts, this is what you're trying to do. You're
trying to put yourself in position to win a National Championship, and to go
to the Final Four is the step that you need to take.  
  
We're very fortunate that we've had an opportunity to do this. I think the
field is maybe the strongest I've seen in a long, long time, maybe ever. And
the fans are in for a treat. I don't know if the coaches are, but certainly
the fans are in for a treat.  
  
We're pretty excited to get going and that's about it. That's about it.  
  
Q. Aside from maybe changing the business attire from maybe a little bit
more formal to casual formal, Coach Walz, what's helped him transform that
program in such a relatively short amount of time?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Wow, he's been there a long time. I don't know if it's a short
amount of time. It seems like he's been there forever, from our days in the
Big East. It kind of took off right away. It didn't take very long. We played
them in the Final Four when he had Angel and that crew. Then we played them
again.  
  
So he's certainly set himself apart from a lot of other college coaches and
has done a remarkable job there. The record speaks for itself. The
accomplishments speak for themselves, the attendance change, everything. He's
one of the best coaches that we have in the game. I don't think any of us in
the business are surprised that he is where he is, and I would expect them to
be a factor on a regular basis.  
  
Q. What makes him so special?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Angel McCoughtry, Asia Durr, you want me to keep going? It's
the same thing that makes the rest of us able to do what we do. He has the
ability to recruit good players, good people to come into Louisville. He
coaches the hell out of them. He demands a lot from them. They play in a way
that's enviable. I think a lot of young coaches should watch how hard they
play and the intensity level that they play at.  
  
They're not easy to play against because they do a lot of different things.
He's just a really good basketball coach. You put a really good basketball
coach with really good players, and you've got something going.  
  
Q. You've had the same four people together as coaches now for, I think,
nine years. What is the value to you of that continuity? And what
conversations do you have with Shea and Marisa about their future aspirations
and what role you feel you can play in that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I agree 100%. There's a lot to be said for having a
coaching staff that's been together where everybody understands what the
expectations are, everybody's comfortable working together. That's not to say
that it's a piece of cake every day. But I think the players and everyone else
benefits from that kind of continuity. We had a lot of continuity before Shea
and Marisa came. C.D. and I have been the two constants.  
  
As far as their future, I think every coach has their own idea of what the
future is. You could say that most coaches that are assistant coaches want to
be head coaches some day, but not all of them do. Some want to be head coaches
earlier than others, sooner than others. Others are more patient. Everybody is
on their own timetable as far as I know.  
  
We talk a lot about what's in store, what is the future and when is an
opportunity -- the right opportunity, because certainly they are presented
with opportunities on a regular basis. I'm one to encourage when the right
opportunity comes along to go. Sometimes I might say go and they say no. And
sometimes I might say I think you should stay, and I've had coaches go, nope,
it's time to go. So I think each coach is following their own path.  
  
Q. You've had the better of the rivalry by a lot with Notre Dame, but it
is still a great rivalry in terms of some of the great players and great games
you guys have had. Can you kind of put that in perspective what that rivalry
meant to you and what you think it's meant to women's basketball, especially
over the last several years as you guys have had so much Final Four success
and appearances?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I remember when Notre Dame first joined the old Big East.
We kind of felt like it's just a matter of time, you know? It didn't take all
that long, but from the time in 2001 where we lost to them in the Final Four
to today, I mean they certainly had their moments where they haven't been
Final Four contenders.  
  
But that's been, I would say, in the last 10, 11, 12 years. That's been rare.
So when we play Notre Dame during the regular season now, it always seems to
be a match-up between Top 5 teams in the country. And they have a slew of All-
Americans on their team, and so do we.  
  
As you know, they've got a passionate fan base and so do we, so it makes for
great rivalry. Rivalries start going in ebbs and flows. We beat them a lot for
a long time. They won a National Championship in 2001. Then we kind of had our
way for a long time, and then they kind of had their way for a couple of
years, three or four years it might have been, when Skylar was there.  
  
It's been because of the magnitude of the games, the regular season, and then
because we've played so many times in the Final Four that the games take on a
huge significance every time we play. That's what rivalries do. That's how
they're born, and that's how they are sustained.  
  
Q. Geno, I have a similar question, I was going to ask about the rivalry
and you talked about what it meant to you. How do your players respond to it
on a little bit bigger of a stage, much bigger stage being in the Final Four,
but do they embrace it? Do they like playing, like you said, those really big
games in particular?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think if you -- when you come out of high school and
you choose to go to Notre Dame or Connecticut, you're saying I want to play in
big games. You're making that decision. I want to play in big games. I want to
play on the big stage.  
  
We recruit a lot of the same players, so we've got players that they've
recruited. We've got players that we've recruited. I'm sure they stay in
touch, and they're friends. Everybody knows everybody anymore in college
basketball.  
  
So there is tremendous anticipation when we play them. I'm sure there is from
our end, and certainly I'm sure there is on their end. That's what the players
want. That's what our players want.  
  
It was difficult when we were in our other league, in the same league
together, because we would end up playing each other four times some years,
and that's not always good. So now that we're not in the same league, it
doesn't seem as intense, but it's still there, believe me. It's there, and it
will come out Friday night. That rivalry will come out Friday night.  
  
It's because there is so much mutual respect, I think, off the court. The
coaches and the respect we all have for each other, the rivalry is a healthy
one. It's a good one.  
  
Q. I was talking earlier with Vic and Jeff, and I was asking about the
identity of the teams and that led to an interesting discussion about both
saying what's most important is how you play the game. I'm curious, I know
it's kind of been a man that of yours. What does mean to you? How do you
define that? Is it playing it the right way? What is the core of that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I always get a kick out of that because I hear people say that
quite a bit. Hey, Connecticut, or like you just said, Louisville or
Mississippi State or Notre Dame, whoever say, wow, their program, they play
basketball the right way. I'm thinking, well, how many coaches know that
they're playing basketball the wrong way? You know? I don't know that there's
a right way and a wrong way to play.  
  
I think every coach makes a decision that this is the way that I see the game.
This is how I see the game being played. This is what's comfortable for me.
This is what I believe in. This is what I know, and this is what I'm going to
teach my team.  
  
If you're winning, then, you know what? They play the game the right way. If
you're losing and everybody feels sorry for you, you know, they play the right
way, but they're just not very talented. And if you're winning, everything's
great. Everybody admires you. Everybody admires what you do. I see it all the
time. As soon as somebody's winning, they become a way better coach than they
were when they weren't winning as much.  
  
So I think if you asked the coaches in the Final Four and they were honest,
you would say what is the secret to your success? Well, we all have really,
really, really good players. And anybody who says they don't, is lying. For
all those people that say, well, Connecticut gets all the best players, so
it's not fair.  
  
Well, last time I checked none of our four schools would be at the Final Four
if we didn't have great players and lots of them.  
  
So we're fortunate, all four of us, to coach really good players. When you
have really good players, you can get a lot of things accomplished that maybe
other coaches can't get accomplished. So it looks like we're doing things the
right way.  
  
Now, don't get me wrong, there are some teams you watch and you just go what
do they do at practice? Because it just doesn't look good. And when you watch
our four teams play, even though we have, I think, somewhat different styles,
you can tell it just works. That's why we're all going to be in Columbus.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, I guess part of this is if you're winning by 30
points, 40 points, human nature would be kids cruise, whatever. Maybe that's
where how you play the game matters is score becomes secondary to execution or
whatever. Maybe that's part of this too?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Right, right, yeah. Yeah. I've never believed that the final
score is going to be indicative of how you played. To me that's never the
issue. To me the issue is are you getting the most out of the kids that you're
coaching? Are your kids able to respond to what you're coaching them to do,
and do they compete? I appreciate when people say that about our team.  
  
Hey, if you play against Connecticut, they compete, and they compete every
possession. That's a great compliment to our players.  
  
Q. Just wondering, I was talking to Vic Schaefer earlier today, and he
was talking about how difficult it is to make it to back-to-back Final Fours
and just the target on your back and everything like that. Obviously you guys
have now made it to 11 straight Final Fours and just wondering how you've been
able to handle that, the pressure, the target, whatever you want to call it.
Why UConn has been so successful and the kind of sustained success?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, that's kind of what we have to deal with every day. I
think you have to try really, really hard to recruit the kind of players that
are ultra competitive, that are not satisfied with just being really good,
that they want to be great, and that they want to be coached really, really
hard. They want to -- they want to be part of something really special.  
  
You come to Connecticut, and you look up on those walls when you come to our
practice facility, and you look around and you go, all right, well, I'm going
to be here four years. Well, what in God's name can I accomplish that hasn't
already been done?  
  
If you're in awe by that, or you're intimidated by that, then you're not going
to be successful here and we're not going to be successful.  
  
So we have a hard time recruiting those kinds of kids because there's not a
lot of them around. We've managed to -- our staff has managed to get those
kids year in and year out. It's not easy. You know, people talk about this and
that and yeah, you win by this many, and you're bad for basketball and all
that. That's the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard, you know? There's a
lot of really, really good teams out there, and there's more good teams than
there ever have been.  
  
It is harder to get to the Final Four than it used to be. South Carolina just
found that out this year, like we did in 1991. Then we found out again in
1995. It's not as easy as people think. When your fan base and your players
all come to expect -- it's like a right of passage that you go to Connecticut,
you go to the Final Four, I mean, that's the most dangerous way to think ever.  
  
We have to fight every day, everybody, the expectations. Even though we know
they're there and even though we've created them, it's -- if Vic thinks this
is hard, wait till he sees what it's like the next three years.  
  
Q. Following up on that, have you ever thought about getting a target
tattoo put on your back (laughing) ?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah (laughing). The two things I've thought about
getting, a target tattoo on my back and a sign saying don't ask me why I don't
coach men's basketball. If I could do away with a couple of those, I'd be a
happy camper.  
  
Q. Just the continuum of it, when you were growing up, you and I are
exactly the same age, we have exactly the same birthday. So I was going to ask
you this: When you were growing up, who was that team -- I'm not talking about
Tennessee later in coaching, but who was that great dynasty team that you
looked at and wondered how do they do that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: UCLA. UCLA.  
  
Q. What stood out about UCLA in your mind then? Go ahead. I'm sorry.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Obviously I was at an age where I could appreciate everything
they were doing, because you were just captivated by them, everything about
them. You know, the way they played, the uniforms they wore, the way they
looked on the court, their unbelievable accomplishments, the air about them.
You could feel it across the TV set.  
  
I remember my buddies and I would talk all the time about which would you
rather do? Would you rather go to a Division-I school and play 30 minutes a
game and probably never play in the Final Four? Or would you rather go to UCLA
and know you're probably going to win a National Championship, or come close,
but you might not play as much? And that was always an interesting point of
conversation with guys.  
  
I always thought what in God's name must it be like to be in that program
every single day? I'm sure the New York Yankees were like that. I'm sure the
Boston Celtics were like that. I'm sure that the Montreal Canadiens were like
that. So there's been a lot of examples of that stuff.  
  
But for me, it was UCLA.  
  
Q. And the answer -- in the answer to that question, what is it like to
be in that seat?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, now I know why John Wooden retired at still a young age
because it's, in some ways, it's exhausting. It really is.  
  
Listen, as I'm saying this I'm going, man, you know, it's going to be 5,000
coaches at the Final Four this week, and they're going to read it and say,
"Yeah, I wish I had your problems." I get that. But I tell you what, you wish
you had my problems for like one year. You don't want to be in this position
for 25 years because it's -- it takes a lot. It takes an unbelievable staff.
It takes knowing that you have to get a certain kind of player every year.  
  
Believe me, after all these years, I'm still amazed that it turns out the way
it does. So the hardest part about being in this seat is trying to convince
yourself that, hey, it's okay if you don't win a National Championship.  
  
Now it bothers you if you don't, but I keep repeating what my mother said last
year. "It's okay if you lose. You don't have to win all the time. You win too
much. That's why people hate you" (laughing). So I try to keep that in mind
every once in a while.  
  
Q. Follow up on that, just real quick, this team in particular, if you
look at just your season, I would think a moment of truth was at Texas when
there was a huge crowd there, biggest crowd they'd had in 10, 15, 20 years,
everybody's out to get you. It's a close game, and Crystal Dangerfield hit
those two free throws near the end to put you guys back up comfortably. But
was that the moment of truth for this team from the standpoint of facing a
challenge? Samuelson gets a black eye or swollen eye coming out of it and
stepping up? If you understand what I'm saying, does that game stand out to
you -- I don't know if turning point is the right word -- maybe the apex or
the corner?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think it was certainly one of them. Yeah, I think it was
certainly one of them. Again, the environment, the quality of the team we were
playing against. We struggled a lot of the game. But as I'm sitting on the
bench a lot of those times I'm saying what is the worst thing that comes out
of this game if we don't win? We go home and we've got another game to play,
and we're actually better off for it because we'll have a pretty good
understanding that, hey, during that situation, this didn't work.  
  
So I always want to win, and I'm glad we pulled it out. But I think the bigger
moment, to be honest with you, even though it wasn't on the road, was the
fourth quarter. The whole second half, but mostly the fourth quarter in the
Notre Dame game. Gabby was on the bench the whole second half, and Lou was on
the bench most of the fourth quarter. And we had some guys step up and make
some huge plays to beat a really, really good team, a great team, actually.  
  
So I think that day I wonder if we had been on the road, would we have lost
that game? I don't know. But we were at home, and we needed some players to
make some huge plays that don't necessarily make those plays. That made me
think, okay, we have some other things going for us other than just the
players that everybody says are the best players.  
  
Q. You mentioned that this was one of the strongest fields in a long
time. I was wondering, when you have four one seeds, four teams with six
losses combined, I know it's going to be harder to play these teams, but in
some ways is it easier to prepare your team during the week knowing that you
have to be that locked in?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yes and no, yeah. Yes and no. It is easier because you know
you're playing a great team, and you better be ready. There better not be any
stones left unturned. Every kid better be on their best behavior. And whatever
they've been doing all year long, they better do it that well and better. So,
yeah.  
  
The harder part is you can do all that and still get your ass beat. And
knowing that, it's kind of like, oh, my gosh, we could do everything right
this week. We could prepare. We could do everything. We had everything taken
care of, every contingency, we've got everything. We're ready to go, and then
go out and still get smacked.  
  
So that, you know, there are some other years where you go, okay, look, if we
do A, B, C and D, there is no way we can lose. Well, that's not happening this
week.  
  
Q. Just as a quick follow-up, of all the Final Fours you've been to, one
where you kind of learned that lesson about the harder part that you just
mentioned?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think there was -- there's been a couple times,
actually. It's funny because it did involve Notre Dame both times, that I can
remember. The one in 2001 where we were missing two first-team All Americans.
We were missing Shea Ralph and Svetlana Abrosimova. And we went out there and
we're up like 13, 14, 15 in the first half. It's like, yeah, we've got this.
Then they came back and beat us, and beat us good.  
  
So that kind of reminded me, hey, you don't have this. You don't have anything
until the buzzer goes off. That's number one.  
  
And then one other incident happened. We played Tennessee one year in the
Final Four in Charlotte, and the game went into overtime and we lost, and we
said, hey, you can do everything right, and we did. We did everything right
that night. I wouldn't take anything back that we did. Our guys played as well
as they're capable of playing, every one of them, and they beat us.  
  
So, believe me, everybody remembers the 11 National Championships. I remember
all the other stuff.  
  
Q. My question is sort of along the lines of a previous question, so I
guess building off of that, you previously mentioned that this was one of the
toughest fields out there of course you have four No. 1 seeds facing off
against each other, Louisville of course facing Notre Dame. I don't know why
I'm drawing a blank. I was just looking at the other teams coming out of the
other region?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Mississippi State, Notre Dame, and Louisville.  
  
Q. Thank you for reminding me. You see a lot of brackets being busted
for the men's basketball team where you have an 11 seed and a 3 seed. How do
you think having four No. 1 seeds really affects not only the level of
competition for your team, but also the viewership experience? Do you think
really the team is really more excited about facing this high level of
competition?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, two years ago we went to the Final Four, and we were the
only No. 1 seed. Then three teams, according to the experts, came out of
nowhere. So it's starting to happen.  
  
This just happens to be one of those years where the committee got the No. 1
seeds exactly right, and those guys played exceptional basketball. Some of the
upsets happened along the way, but not enough to derail the number ones.  
  
As far as the fan viewership, you're getting a chance to watch the best teams.
Again, some people are going to agree and some people aren't. I was watching
Nevada, I think it might have been Nevada and was it Loyola?  
  
Q. Loyola Chicago?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, so you're watching teams that upset other people. Then
you're watching Kansas state play Loyola, and people are saying, wow, you know
there's a lot better teams out there and that's what people want to watch. You
can't have it both ways. You can't have the excitements of the upsets and the
excitement of Cinderella and then say we only want the best teams.  
  
So this just happens to be one of those years where the four No. 1s, the four
best teams in America are playing for a National Championship.  
  
From a fan standpoint, I think it's tremendous because there is a pretty good
chance that every single game is going to be competitive, ultra competitive.
To me, how exciting is that?  
  
I talked to one of my players this morning, and I said, how you doing? She
said, I'm excited. I said how excited? She said this is the most excited I've
been. She's been to a bunch of Final Fours and won a National Championship. So
this is a big deal to all the players.  
  
Q. Coach, this is your 11th straight Final Four. Would you see your team
as maybe each year being different where after winning a National Championship
or losing a Final Four you look at it as a clean slate moving on to the next
year? Or do you view it as sort of a cohesive unit where going from year to
year you're taking a lot of lessons that you've learned from the previous year
and sort of building off of them as you try to create another team with
players leaving and more players coming in? Would you consider it more of a
process that sort of bridges gaps between teams over years? Or do you look at
each year as sort of a clean slate?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No, we start every year brand-new. I really don't care too much
about what happened in the past. I know other coaches have a philosophy,
maybe, but we're not one for slogans and rallying cries and redemption tours
or any of that other nonsense.  
  
What happened last year, happened last year. Whether we win the whole thing or
whether we lose, that's insignificant to what's going to happen this year.  
  
I don't hold on to losses going forward, and I don't carry wins around with me
saying, well, we won in the past. We should win even more this year.  
  
So every year for us is a brand-new team. I don't care if we have everybody
back. It's a brand-new team, a brand-new start. We've got a lot to prove.  
  
Q. I remember in last year's Final Four when Morgan hit that shot, you
had a smile on your face, and you later said that everything happens for a
reason, and something along the lines of course that shot would go in. What
else were you thinking in that moment? Why was that your reaction?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, one, I've always known this, and it's common sense. The
more you keep winning, the closer you're getting to your next loss, because
you can't win forever. So for anybody to think that we're going to win four
National Championships in a row and then five and then six, and then seven,
it's ridiculous. For anyone to think that we're going to win 300 games in a
row, that's nonsense.  
  
So the way that game was played out -- and we botched that last possession
that we had. We did a terrible job coming out of that timeout coaching-wise,
playing-wise, everything. And they come down, you just know. You've seen too
many games, and the law of probability, you know, this shot's going in.  
  
Then when it went in, all I could do was smile and go, of course. How could it
end any other way? It's time. It was time. And that just happened to be the
time. That was the moment. That was the kid. That was the shot. We've won
enough for me to understand there is another side to this.  
  
So that whole time, as soon as it was over, yeah, I get this. I know exactly
what happened and why. Let's move on.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Alexis Jennings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34741)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
UCONN 94, South Carolina 65  
  
COACH DAWN STALEY: We got beat by a really good UCONN team. Obviously we
didn't have enough to compete in the way that we would have liked to, but now
all is well in women's basketball.  
  
Q. With all the accolades in your career and all the records, how much
would you trade it to give it another go and have another year?  
A'JA WILSON: I would love to but at the same time, I think I've served my time
at the University of South Carolina and the NCAA.  
  
I have had a great four years. I wouldn't change anything. Coming to South
Carolina was the best decision I've made at a young age. Of course, it's all
fun and I hate to see it come to an end but at the same time, I wouldn't trade
anything for my time that I had at South Carolina.  
  
Q. They were hitting everything in the first half, and I'm guessing the
scouting report didn't say they were going to shoot 90 percent from behind the
arc. You see that, you have to think, okay, this may not be our night and they
are just hitting everything.  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, it was just the way the ballgame was going. We could have
tried anything but they were shooting pretty well; great, from three-point
line, and that was one of our kind of keys was just defend the three-point
line and we had a little trouble doing that. At that point, you just have to
give everything that you have and leave it all on the court.  
  
Q. When you first came here, did you envision anything like two Final
Fours and National Championships, three Elite 8s? This program had 13 wins,
and combined in the NCAA Tournament, you had 15 over the four years. Is this
how you pictured it going?  
A'JA WILSON: Oh, man, not really. I don't know exactly what I was thinking,
honestly. I just knew Coach Staley has done such a great job with this program
and I wanted to be part of it. I couldn't have written this out or couldn't
even imagined this as a young girl, but it's definitely been a blessing to be
coached by Coach Staley and I've learned so much from her and just so much
from my teammates over the course of my four years.  
  
If I could have called it, it would have been great, but I didn't. I think
that's what makes it a lot of fun is it's been a journey. I've been through
the ups and downs of everything. I've had a blessing to just compete in the
NCAA, and make it to the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 and two Final Fours and National
Champions.  
  
There's a bunch of girls out there that dream to do that, and I was part of it
with a South Carolina team that no one believed we could do any of it, at all.
We were the underdogs. So just to be part of something and show people that it
can be done, it's been a blessing.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked A'Ja. You guys defend three-point line but when
they hit 90 percent in the first half, did it feel like they were having a
night and not much you could do to change that?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I agree with her. When a team is shooting well like that,
it's kind of hard to adjust. You can try everything like she mentioned but
they were just hot, simply.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you made a decision about your future about next
year?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: No, I have not.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what Dangerfield to you guys tonight?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Well, she made wide-open shots. They were practice shots,
with her feet set and no one really around her and then if you watch them in
warmups, those are the kind of shots that they hit.  
  
Certainly we didn't do a good job of staying close to home to her. We kind of
dug ourselves in the hole by helping off too much.  
  
Q. How proud are you of this team that you were able to make it this
far?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Super proud. Super proud. No one had us probably here, and
the way that our team performed all year long under adversity, couldn't be
more proud of our players and the way that they have handled themselves and
the way that they did not succumb to, woe is me and why does it happen to me.
They just played it out, and we found ourselves in a place in which only us
believed that we could be here.  
  
Q. First half you shoot 56 percent and you're down by 21. Do you just
shake your head and not really know what to do?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I mean, I thought we, are to the most part, stuck to
our game plan. When we shoot the ball that well -- I think our turnovers
killed us in the first quarter. We didn't have very many of them. I'd rather
have 27 of them tonight and win, versus just 13.  
  
But UCONN makes you pay. You've got to pick your poison. If you dig in too
much to help in the paint, they are going to kill you on the outside. If you
over play on the outside, you know, they are going to backdoor you for wide-
open layups.  
  
It was that kind of game in which we could not control it, especially early
on.  
  
Q. You said a lot about A'Ja over the last couple weeks, I'm sure, but
now that her career is finally over at South Carolina, just what she's meant
to you and this program and to women's basketball?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: It's bittersweet. I wouldn't want her to have another year.
Selfishly as a coach -- you have to let her spread her wings and fly in the
WNBA and overseas. She's done so much for our program, our state, our
university, and all the little girls that grow up looking like her; she was a
poster child for inspiration and a beacon of hope. I want her to go to Las
Vegas and do the same.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, you obviously had the program on the trajectory
already, making the NCAA Tournament several times, before A'Ja got here. Where
do you think the program would have been if A'Ja had not made that decision?
How pivotal has that been in you getting to the point of where you are
today?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I don't know. I can't really answer that. Obviously
we were on a trajectory of being a really good basketball team and program.
It's like asking where UCONN would be without Diana Taurasi. That's kind of
unfair.  
  
A'Ja was an integral part of taking our program to the next level. There won't
be a whole lot of A'ja Wilsons left in our game. I'm just really fortunate
that I got a chance to coach her for four years, and knock-on-wood, for very
few injuries.  
  
Q. UCONN actually out-rebounded you guys, which I don't think anybody
expected to happen. How important do you think that was to the outcome?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Not very important. I don't think rebounding was a real
factor. The three-point, the open threes, really opened the game up for them.
For the longest, we were out-rebounding them, but there aren't very many
rebounds when we shot 50 percent and they shot 59 percent. It's not very many
rebounds to get once teams are shooting that way.

_Albany, New York_  
  
UCONN 94, South Carolina 65  
  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I've always said, today is the hardest day; in all
of the games that you play, today is probably the hardest. The next hardest is
the one you play on Friday night.  
  
To get back to Final Four, I mean, every team starts their season and says,
that's our goal, to go to the Final Four. So for us, it's an opportunity to go
back to where we felt like we didn't really give our best effort. You know, we
lost to a really good team, but it happened in a way that was really, really
disappointing, and I know that we were really anxious to go back and put
ourselves in that same situation, and see how much we've changed since last
year.  
  
So I'm excited for our team and I'm thrilled for these two up here, and what
they did was pretty remarkable.  
  
Q. Yesterday I don't think you were asked one question, and here you are
tonight with a performance that really set the tone for your team. Can you
talk about the last two days for you?  
CHRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: The last two days, Coach was just really telling me to
be aggressive. Make plays for myself, make plays for my teammates. Right
before the game started, Coach pulled me to the side and told me to get back
to what I was doing earlier in the year. Tonight, my teammates did a great job
of finding me when I was open and I was able to knock those shots in early.  
  
Q. When you look at kind of your game by game, it seems like you come
out stronger in the higher-pressure games. With that being said, do you almost
consider yourself a big-game player?  
CHRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: I would like to say that some of the times, most of the
time I can't, but tonight I was able to say that. My teammates was able to
find me when I was open and I was able to knock those shots in. I really
wanted it for our team and we really wanted to get back to the Final Four and
we came out with great energy.  
  
Q. Did you expect to get back here?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I don't think we expect anything as far as we're just going to
get here. You know we look at the game ahead of us and we take it one game at
a time and one practice at a time. These kind of things, they just kind of
come.  
  
I don't think we -- like Coach said out there, we are not entitled to
anything. We have to earn it.  
  
Q. Coach said how you guys want to get back here; has that been on the
minds all season that you want to get back there -- redeem isn't right word,
but get further than you did last year, when you probably could have gone to
the championship game?  
CHRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: Yeah, I think we didn't want to look too far ahead
because we knew that if we were just focused on getting back to the Final Four
game from the beginning of the season, something else could catch us off
guard. We just took it one game at a time.  
  
I don't know, redemption, I don't know if it's the word but I think we
definitely have something to prove, I think not only to the rest of the world,
but to ourselves, as well.  
  
Q. I think around your fourth three-pointer, you started running back on
defense. You almost looked surprised that you were so hot. Were you that
surprised or did tonight surprise you at all?  
CHRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: I don't think I was surprised. I think it was just
excited. It may have looked like shock, I don't really know. I was just
excited. We were going on a run at that point and things just fell in and it
felt good?  
  
Q. Last season, going into the Final Four, everybody remembers that shot
that AK took over you. Did that play any motivation? Do you even think about
that going into the final four this year?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Well, I don't have much of a choice but to think about it
because it's brought up in almost everything that I do, so yeah, I think about
it all the time. But I can't -- I can't take anything back. All I can do is
just look forward and see if, you know, what I can do going into Friday's
game.  
  
Q. You guys looked like you were really enjoying passing the ball to
Chrystal. Was that fun, just like driving and dishing to her and watching her
make those shots?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I was trying to keep an eye out for her because I knew
she had a hot hand. It's fun to watch your teammate go off like that. She was
having fun with that. She's very different on the court than off the court and
she's very serious on the court. So to see her crack a smile and look over at
the bench, it gave energy to the rest of us.  
  
Q. By virtue of the role you've had on this team this year, and last
year, really, as well, you've done a lot defending opponents bigger than you.
Is that your comfort zone? Do you prefer to defend the 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, or are
you hoping the matchups that people are like 5-11, 6-0?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It's not my comfort zone to guard people that are that much
bigger than me, but it's helped me get better. Definitely playing A'Ja these
last couple years has definitely made me a better player.  
  
I definitely do feel more comfortable guarding people on the perimeter, but
the fact that I've been able to do this the last few years, I think is going
to help me at the next level.  
  
Q. I think this is the only time this year and maybe for a long time
that anybody shot 50 percent against UCONN.  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I brought that up in the locker room. Not to them, but I
just commented on it.  
  
Q. They shot 50 percent and you guys won the rebound battle. Can you
comment on both those things?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, some of the shots that they got, I would hope they
would shoot 50 percent. Like they would get layups -- they had a couple guys
on their team arguing who is going to shoot the layup this time; there was so
many layups available to them.  
  
They spent a lot of time on the shot clock trying to get the ball to certain
spots, and you know, we traded a bunch of threes for twos, and you can't make
people miss all the time. They are good players. But to actually outrebound
them the way the game first started, I thought we were going to get killed
inside. But we said, two things had to happen tonight: One, we needed to keep
the ball out of the lane, either on the dribble or on pass, and we didn't do
that. And we had to keep them off the boards so they didn't get a lot of
second shots, and we did a great job of that. They didn't get a lot of second
shots because they didn't miss many.  
  
Q. I think yesterday or the day before, you said at this time of the
year there's a number of players who might be able to carry your team. Was
Chrystal one of the players on your list?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: That woman there in the dark blue shirt in front of you,
is she part of the media or is she just playing on her phone? (Laughter).
That's my wife, by the way.  
  
I've often said and I think it played out tonight, I've often said that if you
have a certain culture that you've established in your program, and obviously
you have enough talent, that's generally speaking, sufficient to get you to
this weekend. But then to get out of this weekend and to win next weekend,
your team generally is not necessarily going to be that -- what gets you
there. It's going to be an individual or two, like these two, that have
spectacular performances that separate themselves from everybody else. And the
reason we won by so much is our team played great. But even had we not played
or shot the ball as well as we did, the way those two played would have been
enough to get us to next weekend. Just individual brilliance on their part,
and that's what you need at this time. A'ja Wilson didn't have enough help.
She was really good tonight.  
  
But individuals move you past this point. We had a couple of them, three of
them in the locker room today after the game, just to remind everybody that
they are not as good as they are when green, s stewy and Tina Charles came in.
But it's having those kinds of players play for you on this weekend that
allows you to keep going.  
  
Q. Could you expand on the thought of this redemption tour that you're
back there; you said you're anxious to get back to the Final Four after what
happened last year and the disappointment. Okay, now you're back the in Final
Four -- you can't take back last year, but you win the game -- okay, that's
what you're supposed to do. Dawn said in her thing that now all is right with
women's basketball because you guys are back in the Final Four.  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: You know, somebody asked me at the beginning of the
season, you know -- and it's usually media people, both inside our building
and outside our building, like, hey, is there going to be a team; are we going
to make tee shirts this year?  
  
I said, no, I've never been, that. There's no theme. There's no rallying cry
that's going to reverberate through the entire season that's going to carry us
back to the Final Four. I don't buy any of that stuff.  
  
What I do think, is these kids are pretty good at -- somebody said it back
there; they are pretty good at understanding when it's a big, big game. And
they generally show newspaper big games. This year, every single one. That is
what you need more than a slogan.  
  
So what happened last year, you can't take that back. You know, Mississippi
State deserved to win, and South Carolina deserved to win a National
Championship. That's ancient history now. When we go there and we play Friday,
whoever we're going to play, we can go in there and be beside ourselves about
trying to redeem ourselves from what happened last year, and it won't matter
if we don't play great. I'm glad we're going back there, but that's that.  
  
Q. One number jumps out to me, 36-0, it's just extraordinary. You don't
see that very often. How do you generate this consistent quality of play from
your team?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: As I said, I don't know if it's one particular thing, you
know. We have a really -- we have a really good group. You know, we try to
recruit a certain kind of kid. We were talking about this the other night at
dinner; that to get consistently the results that we get, you have to have
super competitive individuals that -- and it's something that they have to
learn when they come to Connecticut; that every day is a competition.  
  
Every day, you're competing, and that whenever you settle for just being okay,
then all of a sudden, we're not Connecticut anymore. If we take a day off in a
game; if we just decide we don't feel like it; and don't show up one night and
get beat by a team that has no right to beat us because we have way more
talent than them, we wouldn't be Connecticut anymore.  
  
You have to recruit those kids that if we were playing a crossword puzzle,
they would want to win; a card game, they would want to win. You know, all
right, everybody line up; they've got to be first in line. And that's what
allows you to stay where you are because it's pretty hard to do better than
what's been done at Connecticut.  
  
Q. You look at the macro view, A'Ja making the decision to go to South
Carolina, how did that change in a lot of ways what's happened over the last
few years, and someone that has done what she's did, overlapping with your
success and still managing to succeed as much as she did?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, a lot of programs struggled during the stewy era,
and there may have been more teams winning national championships if stewy had
gone to some other school. But there are players that become program changers.
I remember when we got Rebecca Lobo, it kind of changed the perception of our
program and it changed where we were able to go and who else we were able to
get.  
  
So sometimes it just takes one player. Especially if it's a local player like
A'Ja was. So she obviously made the right decision and their basketball
program has gone from being good to being great to getting the kind of crowds
that they get and to winning a National Championship and a couple Final Fours,
you know.  
  
She's left a pretty impressive legacy at South Carolina. So wherever the
program goes from here on in, they will always refer back to her and what she
did.  
  
Q. Last year, even though you beat the upcoming teams like UCLA and
Oregon, you still were concerned, and everybody in the media was looking like
they didn't get it but then when you went to play Mississippi State, you had
even stated that you weren't surprised that that happened. Do you have type of
those similar concerns going into this Final Four or different concerns, and
why?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I've always thought that you can go to a Final Four
and sleep easy, if you know that there's nothing that could happen that can
derail your team. And believe me, I've coached a bunch of those teams that as
long as we showed up on time, we were going to win because we were just that
good.  
  
What always worried me last year is we were able to overcome a lot of things
and a couple big things that if we were ever in a situation that we faced that
and didn't make shots, that what happened, would happen. And it came to pass.
A big, physical strong team that made shots and made it difficult for us, and
we missed shots.  
  
So we went right away down 16, but then we're Connecticut, so we outscored
them by 21, you know, and then go up five, and at that point, really, it's
like we almost realize, I don't know that we're going to be able to keep doing
this. They were just too relentless, and we just couldn't get shots to drop
and I think some of our guys, the moment was too big for them, because we had
a lot of role players playing big roles.  
  
A lot of guys during the Stewy era, were just kind of hanging around, being
great supporting actors and actresses, and now all of a sudden, they say, hey,
step up. We didn't have it in us. There's no shame in that. We did that to a
lot of teams.  
  
And now going in, I still worry about the size difference. I mean, we're the
only team in America that starts, that, brings a 6-6 2-guard off the bench. I
mean, our post players are what they are, you know. We have a 6-6 post player
that is a 2-guard in waiting or 3-man.  
  
What was your question?  
  
Q. (Off-mic) Are you getting a nun?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Am I getting a nun? All the nuns that I knew -- there
were a couple that liked me, too. I was a good Catholic boy. My wife will tell
you that. I followed orders, I wasn't a rebel rouser. I didn't get in trouble.  
  
But that didn't mean you'd out of times a lot of class, like this; and if you
talk to somebody in line, the crossing guards, the nun is behind you and you
don't even know it and you get whacked in the back of the head.  
  
I think today's kids miss out on so many great experience that is we got to
experience, and every time I see Loyola play and I watch her, I go, man, I
knew a lot of women just like her. And God bless them, because they teach you
the right thing at the right age. They are worth their weight in gold, those
women. I have so much respect for them. I might try to find one, though. I
might go back and make a phone call to where I went to school and see if any
of them are still hanging around. That would be pretty cool.  
  
But we're a state school, so I would get ten letters going, all right, now we
have to have like a nun, a reverend, a rabbi, you know. We'd have to have --
everybody would have to be represented, so it would get too crowded on our
bench. The NCAA wouldn't allow that.

_Albany, New York_  
  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Excited to be a part of the Elite 8. We're looking forward
to the challenge of playing a really good UCONN team. I just hope there are a
lot of people in the stands to create an atmosphere like they did on Friday
morning -- on Saturday morning.  
  
Q. A'Ja, I read your place in the players tribune that was released
yesterday on your battle with dyslexia. Why do you feel this was the time to
release that and how important do you feel that piece is now?  
A'JA WILSON: I just kind of felt like it was the right time to release is.
This is a period in my life -- this is where my collegiate career is slowing
coming to an end, and I just felt deep down in my heart that it was okay for
the world to know what I was battling with.  
  
What was the second part of your question? I'm so sorry.  
  
Q. How important do you feel that piece is for others to know?  
A'JA WILSON: Oh, man, it's lifted a lot of weight off my shoulders for people
to understand, and I think it's a great feeling because it now shows people I
am still human.  
  
I think people tend to get caught up in the Basketball A'Ja and not understand
that there's a whole other side that they have never really seen or met
before. I think it's a great feeling for people to now understand that it's
real. It's real, such as mental illness, such as a learning disability.  
  
Some people out here, they don't have a clue what we go through. So to show
that side of me and have people see a different look and always see there's a
different side to a student athlete, I think it's something good. I see the
Tweets people they say and they go through it, as well, and it's also good to
know that you are not alone in it.  
  
Q. It seems like even though you guys are the defending national
champions, all eyes are on UCONN, and they are the favorites. Does that feel a
little disrespectful?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't feel like it's disrespectful. I feel like we've been the
underdogs this whole season and my whole four years here, honestly, so it's
not a different feeling from any other game. We're just blessed to be here
playing in the Elite 8 and we're just going to stay with it. I think it's more
about us than anything and we make it about us. So it doesn't really matter
what's going on on the outside world. It's really just what's going on in our
circle.  
  
TYASHA HARRIS: Like what A'Ja said, I like being the underdog because I like
proving people wrong. We just have to stay within us and stay focused and
locked in.  
  
Q. Last year there were comments that said that because you didn't beat
UCONN, the title didn't mean as much. When you heard that, what was your
reaction to it?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't know about the other two, but I just laughed. You can't
take my banner away from me. You can't take my ring away from me. You can't
take away the journey that we took to get there. I really didn't pay it any
mind.  
  
TYASHA HARRIS: I laughed, as well. Everybody took the same path and everybody
had to fight through each game one by one, and we just happened to make it to
the last game. We still have the banner and ring to prove it, so that's it.  
  
Q. You've pretty much accomplished everything but the one thing you
haven't done is beat UCONN. A, is that a stat that you really look at which
how personal is tomorrow's game and how much do you want to accomplish that?  
A'JA WILSON: I can't really look at it. I don't think it's very personal. I
mean, this is just another game. This is another game that I would like to
win. I mean, there's nothing much more to it. I don't really look at the
opponent in a different way. Just staying within my system. I'm lucky to be
playing alongside of these great girls and just enjoy my collegiate career.  
  
Q. For Ty and Bianca, 26 turnovers in your game yesterday, that won't go
well against UCONN, so what is the plan to change that?  
TYASHA HARRIS: We have to just be conscious of where we're passing the ball
and know where we're going to pass it before anything happens and just be
aware, and not be lackadaisical while we're doing it. But if we do turn it
over, we have to defend our turnovers and try to make it dead ball turnovers
and not live ball.  
  
BIANCA JACKSON: For me, just making sure passes. Know where I'm going to go
with the ball before I pick it up and look out on the whole court before I
make a decision where to put the ball.  
  
Q. How are you looking forward to your rematch with Gabby Williams in
particular? She was guarding you most of the game last time out.  
A'JA WILSON: It is what it is. It's a matchup, of course but honestly it's not
something like, oh, can't wait but at the same time I'm not going to overlook
Gabby. She's a great player and great defender and very athletic. I'm going to
take it in, do what I can and trust my teammates.  
  
Q. UCONN beat you by 25 back in February. How has this team improved, so
that won't happen again on Monday night?  
A'JA WILSON: How have we improved -- I think -- I think we have a lot more
contribution from everyone. I think everybody's confidence has increased and
just the growth of this team has gotten a lot better since February. I think
the SEC Tournament kind of really showed that and that's good. We need that
going in, especially being in this tournament and not necessarily playing
against UCONN, but just in this tournament as a whole.  
  
I think we just grew as our confident. I think our young ones really have
grown up in different ways mentally, and that's what you need. So I think the
biggest thing is just our growth. Our growth is something that we've really
grown.  
  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I agree with A'Ja but last game I feel like we didn't utilize
our post presence and coming off a game like yesterday against Buffalo, I feel
like we have the confident now going forward and we can use that and that can
be another key to get the win.  
  
Q. Doniyah, when you guys were going into the SEC Final against
Mississippi State, everybody is saying, Oh, they are undefeated and
Mississippi State is going to win, and your strategy, you were preaching you
wanted to keep the score close and make them uncomfortable and put them in
pressure situations. How is the strategy similar for tomorrow night's game?  
DONIYAH CLINEY: I think we just play within our system. It's not really like,
you know, just make them uncomfortable as like Mississippi State because
there's two different teams.  
  
Obviously Gabby Williams is not as tall as Teaira McCowan, but she's more
athletic. So we just have to be smarter and like just move A'Ja, maybe make
her come to the high post more or just keep her in the paint because obviously
she has the height advantage. Just be smarter.  
  
Q. Bianca, when you came in, sometimes freshmen have to wait their turn
but you were put right into the game and have played a lot this year, did you
think that you would play as much as you have this year and how do you think
you've done?  
BIANCA JACKSON: I came in with the mindset that I wanted to be able to play
and do -- to put myself in a position to be able to play this year. Even
though I had some injuries that put me in the spotlight coming in starting as
a freshman, but I think I did pretty well this season. You know, I feel like I
held my own and.  
  
Q. Bianca, I had a question for you also. What's it like to grow up with
your parents both coaching, and do they give you a lot of advice or how is
that relationship?  
BIANCA JACKSON: In my household it was basketball all the time, both coaching,
that was pretty much the topic of conversation all the time. My mom used to
coach me during my high school game, she would coach me all the time.  
  
Now that I'm in college she kind of steps back sometimes. But night before the
game, she will call me and say, "I want to talk to you about a couple things I
think you need to work on." It's good. They are in my corner. They are here
for me when I'm feeling down or when I need to be picked up. They are always
here to support me, so it's good.  
  
Q. A'Ja and Alexis, 12 national championships between these two
programs. Does it feel kind of like a National Championship atmosphere? Does
it feel like the premiere women's college basketball matchup to you guys?  
A'JA WILSON: Go ahead, Lex.  
  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: You got it.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, you've got the defending champs versus the ones been
keeping the trophy in the case for a while. It definitely does feel like one
of those games and I think Albany has a great atmosphere. It's a lot of blue
up here.  
  
But to see just a packed house like this, it shows how the growth of the game
has changed and that's something that we want and if UCONN and South Carolina
is a big game matchup that brings people together to watch the game, hey, we
are going to do our best to stay within our system and play it.  
  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I pretty much agree with A'Ja.  
  
Q. Tie, going off what we're seeing right now, you're known for having a
lot of fun off the court. You joke around a lot. But when does the fun kind of
stop and when do the game faces come on during tournament time in?  
TYASHA HARRIS: This is for me, right? The fun part, we start -- once we -- it
doesn't really stop but we hide it a little bit. But Coach Staley always tells
us to have fun and just enjoy the game, because you don't know when it's going
to be your last. Any time can be just unpredictable. We try it lower it down
once we step into the court, but as you could see, like right before we run
out, we also dance. It doesn't really stop.  
  
Q. Alexis mentioned it a little bit about the last UCONN game where she
didn't feel the post game got going outside of Asia. After coming off such a
big game where the post did well against Buffalo, how do you plan to exploit
that momentum going against UCONN?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Our plan is always to go inside first and continue to go
inside first. We make that an emphasis to get the ball in the paint, and that
won't stop. Now that we're playing, we're playing, Alexis will get the ball,
Alexis got to finish; A'Ja will get the ball, A'Ja got to finish; Kiki's going
to get the ball, Kiki's got to finish. We will continue to pound it in, and
they have been extremely productive for us all year long. You go where the
numbers say to go, and it points to going inside.  
  
Q. Simple question but I don't know if it's a simple answer: How do you
beat UCONN?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: You've got to play the game. You've got to play the game.
He's an amazing guy -- I've got to tell you this story because I was walking
out after scouting UCONN yesterday, and I guess a UCONN fan, he started
yelling at me, like, you know, you're -- Monday -- like giving me the thumb's
up. I actually think it was a Gamecock fan and I turned around and almost give
him thumb's up. So I don't know why this came to me, but this came to me.  
  
I said, "On Monday night, you're going to believe there's a God," and that's
what we're going to go with. That's what we're going to go with.  
  
Q. How concerned are you with the turnovers yesterday and is your team
maybe not as sharp as it was during the conference tournament? Does that
concern you going into such a big game?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Well, we actually are very consistent with conference
tournament in that we turn the ball over a great deal. I think, yeah, you've
got to raise your eyebrows because it's not that, you know, they are this
really -- turnovers that we can control.  
  
It's not like we were being pressured. It wasn't like all game long. They were
sitting back in a sagging match-up zone and we just played too fast. We just
need to slow down, keep our composure and find the hands that the ball should
go in.  
  
I think sometimes we get overzealous and we try to force things. We try to go
a little bit quicker than we want to go, because we see where there are lanes
to exploit. So hopefully we'll slow down a little bit and take better care of
the ball, because if we don't, we'll get ran out of the gym.  
  
Q. Through the years, coming up as a player, then your long friendship
with Tonya, seeing Geno through a prism, and you've worked with him through
the Olympics and you got to deal with him up close and personal. Can you talk
about your view points over the years and what you saw?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: You hear stories about Geno. Obviously I worked with him
last summer and also had a chance to work with him in the 2000 Olympic Games,
and Tonya used to work for them I think for 16 years. So you hear about all
these stories about how he has a great basketball mind, and he definitely
does. He has an incredible mind for the game. I think there's great
opportunities to learn from him.  
  
But at the same time, that's his style. You have to take some of the good that
you can implement with your team, but that's his style. That's not really my
style but it works for him and I think he's done a great job with just owning
college women's basketball, and hopefully we can cut us a slice Monday night.  
  
Q. In A'Ja's piece that released yesterday, you talked about how you had
her read Scripture in front of the team. Why do you feel that was good for her
to do that in front of her peers and colleagues and what was it like for you
to read that piece?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I think with anything, I try to hit my challenges head-on
and I try to bring that type of mentality to our players. I think A'Ja, in
dealing with dyslexia, you always think that you're less than; you always
think you're a little bit different than everybody else because you don't pick
up on things as quickly. Your processes are just a little bit different.  
  
I wanted her to face one of her challenges head on, and reading our Scripture
for each and every game, and she got to the point where -- she made mistakes
at times, and A'Ja will tell you that she laughs at a lot of mistakes that she
makes when it comes to dyslexia, and we laugh with her.  
  
But we also are there to encourage her to continue because she is a beacon of
hope for someone else, a beacon of hope not just as a talented, skilled
basketball player, but also as someone that deals with dyslexia every day.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Chrystal Dangerfield's development as a point
guard for UCONN? What do you see that you like from her?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: What I see that I like is she's under Geno's spell, and
when you give yourself to your coach, you're going to look a lot better than
what you think it should look like.  
  
So I think she is is someone that's extremely talented, probably more talented
than what you're seeing, but she's learning another side of how to play the
game, so she can have longevity in our sport once she becomes a professional
basketball player.  
  
Q. Did you see Felisha's comments yesterday about how difficult it is
for African American coaches to get a second chance, and your thoughts on
that?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I did see her comments, and she nailed it. I think
any time you're in this profession as an African American woman, man, you have
to be successful out the gate. If you're not successful, you have to go back,
and fortunately for me, I didn't go through the ranks of being a grad
assistant and assistant coach up through there. I was given an opportunity
because somebody saw something in me that I didn't see in myself.  
  
But for other coaches who have assisted for so many years and got the
opportunity, like Jolette Law who is on our staff, she was an assistant for, I
don't know, 12 to 15 years, and then she got an opportunity at Illinois. It
takes awhile to get a program off the ground, especially a dormant program,
and people want you to be great, you know, from the start. It takes a very
long time. It takes patience. It takes an AD that has that patience. When I
got the job at South Carolina, the AD was Eric Hyman, and he was like, "It's
going to take you at least three years, at least three years."  
  
I didn't believe him because I just feel like, if you work hard and you do
things the right way, things are going to happen for you quickly. And he was
very right because he knew what was there. I think when you take over a
program, you know, you've got to know what's there.  
  
Basketball coaches, you've got to know what you're going into, and you can't
think you're invincible to having bad seasons. It has to be the right fit and
you have to have people in there who believe in you and have the patience
enough to give you an opportunity, and if you fail -- because most coaches
have failed.  
  
If you looked at all the coaches, both black, white, you know, and any other
ethnic group, they failed at some point. And they probably have gotten
opportunities. Those things don't happen a lot for African American coaches.
But, you know, Felisha, she is probably the poster child for that, and I'm
glad that she was given an opportunity to right the wrong, because nothing
worse than losing a challenge and not being able to regroup and win that
challenge.  
  
I hope that my success is a beacon of hope for other black coaches and also a
beacon of hope to other ADs, to see that given an opportunity, you can win a
National Championship like we did.  
  
Q. You mentioned not only this year when you played UCONN, but the past
year you played UCONN, how crucial it is to keep them from going on a run, not
score eight or ten points in a row. Have you mentioned that again to the team
as they prepare for this one?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, UCONN makes you pay a lot of different ways. If you
turn the ball over, you know, they are going to make you pay. If you miss a
shot and it comes off the rim, they are going to rebound and push it and make
you pay.  
  
If you make a basket and you are slow to get back, they will make you pay. So
there's a lot of different ways in which they make you pay. I think our
players are very aware of the style of play and what UCONN does best.  
  
I think it also helps that we've played them over the past few years, and you
can't just play them one game and think you're going to have success. You have
to have the experience of playing them in a lot of different ways, at home,
away at their place, and then we're playing on a neutral site, something that
we haven't done. Hopefully this is the trick.  
  
Q. Based on what you've seen through UCONN with your earlier matchup and
your scouting what challenges does UCONN present to you?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: They are just a team that's on a mission. I think they are
probably more hungry than they have ever been because they didn't win a
National Championship last year.  
  
But also, that also puts them in a place in which you know is unfamiliar to
them because they are used to being the defending National Champions and I
think someone asked one of our other players a question about doing what we
did to Mississippi State, which is to keep it close and put them in unfamiliar
situations that they haven't been in a lot this season.  
  
You have to put them in those situations. You have to keep the game close and
hopefully, you know, something else kicks in to where they are not as sharp as
they normally are.  
  
Q. It seemed like yesterday you were running with some combination of
three forwards on the floor a lot, and Lydia was talking about being more
comfortable as a guard and just being in the perimeter like that. How much,
especially given how size is one of the areas where you have an advantage over
UCONN, how much are we going to see that on the floor tomorrow?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: We've been playing the big lineup ever since the SEC
Tournament. I think Lydia is getting more and more accustomed to playing on
the perimeter and she gives us speed and she gives us another passer, another
ball handler. And she's fearless, as fearless can be. We will definitely play
that lineup at some point and utilize her quickness and her ability to take
people off the dribble.

_Albany, New York_  
  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: There's really not much to say at this time of the year.
After today, you know, there will be two teams already going to the Final Four
and two teams tomorrow, and we're one of them. So we're in a great spot. We're
in the spot where we wanted to be when the season started.  
  
But it's not, obviously not easy. It's never easy when you get this far
because there are no easy games and there are no easy teams. So I think every
team that plays this weekend understands that, and I think we have a team that
has enough experience and has been through these a number of times and I feel
good about where we are right now.  
  
Q. Gabby, I just want to know, you guys are No. 1 undefeated but they
are the reigning champions. Which team do you feel has the most pressure going
into tomorrow's game?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think we do. Obviously there's pressure both ways but for
us, if we come short of it, it's a disappointing season. I think that just
goes with the 30 years of history that this program has that we've built up;
that we've set such high expectations every single year.  
  
Q. What did you do in the last game against South Carolina against A'ja
Wilson that worked so well, and maybe what are some things that you maybe
didn't do so well that you'd like to accomplish this time?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I think we just really tried to play team defense. Gabby
actually guarded her for a lot of the game.  
  
But like I said, really just trying to limit their post touches and limit how
many shots they get, like second chance shots and their rebounds and things
like that.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, it's always a difficult thing guarding A'Ja,
especially with the height difference. But I have the advantage of being
quicker than her, so as long as I just keep her out of the paint, easier to
handle her.  
  
Q. How much do you lean on your seniors before a game like this as far
as advice?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think it's really big for us to have our two seniors
out here really leading us every game. I think we're at the point in the
season where, you know, before the game, I won't necessarily go ask one of
them what to do, but during the game, I look to them and you just see, when
they are calm and they kind of are controlling the pace and everything, we all
kind of follow suit after that.  
  
CHRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: I do think they do a great job of being our emotional
leaders and when things do get out of control, they get us together and make
sure that we're on same page.  
  
Q. You guys beat them by 25 earlier this year. Why should people think
anything would be different tomorrow night?  
KIA NURSE: One thing that was brought up yesterday is we like to think that we
are not the same team that played in February, just as any team that plays in
this tournament is not the same team that was playing in February.  
  
So every game that we go into, every practice that we go into, every session,
it's a matter of what do we have to do for the game in front of us; try not to
think back on what happened last time and understanding that everybody gets
better as the season goes on and it should be a good game either way.  
  
Q. Seeing how USC has turned the ball over a lot recently, is that a key
point going into this matchup?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, definitely. I think we want to take advantage of
every opportunity we get, if we can turn them over, and we're pretty good in
transition off of turnovers, and that's what we aim to do every single game.  
  
Clearly we expect them to be on top of their game, but if we can get out in
passing lanes and disrupt their offense, that's beneficial for us and we'll
definitely take advantage of it.  
  
Q. You've never lost to South Carolina and seems like they have been
chasing you as a program for years now. How much confidence do you have coming
into a game like this when almost every single game with South Carolina hasn't
even been close?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I don't think any previous games really matters to us right
now. We're just looking ahead to, you know, the game tomorrow, what we have to
do. Focus on our scout and everything like that.  
  
Yeah, I mean, they are hungry. They want to win. I don't think we are going to
look at it as, oh, we beat them before so of course we are going to beat them
again. That's not how it is at all. We have our game at hand and we are just
going to focus on that.  
  
Q. There's a lot of hype around this game. Does it feel like a National
Championship almost?  
KIA NURSE: I would say in a sense, when you get to this point in the season,
every game you play is a do-or-die situation and your season is on the line.
With that understanding, the tournament itself and understanding that there's
an elimination at hand, you have to come in with a certain focus, a certain
intensity and a certain energy in order to give yourself a chance to have an
extended season.  
  
Obviously there's a lot of noise around what's happening in our game and we
kind of have to go into it and execute it the same way we would execute any
other game and any other game plan.  
  
Q. What specific challenges does South Carolina present to you guys?
You've seen them each of the last two years. What are some of the things that
when you're looking at game tape, that you think are the things that are a big
challenge for you guys?  
KIA NURSE: I think they do a good job of pressure within the full court. They
get out. They use their length and their athleticism to their advantage, and
as well, they try to use their inside game as much as possible. Obviously they
have a talented front court and they try to work very well together, but we
have a lot of faith in our front court to help that out.  
  
Q. The way the game played out February 1 and the way you guys kind of
met that moment so emphatically, I'm wondering, was that a point in time in
the season where you kind of realized the potential of your team even further?
Was that a major step forward for what you thought your team was capable of
this season?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't think there's any one game that defines
your season for either good or bad. I think it's one game. We were in a really
good frame of mind and we knew exactly what we needed to do, and we made a lot
of shots. You know, I mean, that makes everything look great when you knock
down shots, and, you know, we're the same team that played yesterday and
missed a lot of shots.  
  
I know how good we are and I know how good we've been, and that was a game,
but so was the game at UCLA and so was the game against Louisville, and you
know, we've had, some moments this year where you look and you say, wow, I
think that we have a really, really good team.  
  
But again, like these guys just said, this is March, and things are different
in March. We proved at their place that we are really, really good. The
problem with where we are and where this tournament is, is you have to prove
it again. And if South Carolina beats us tomorrow night, nobody is going to
write a headline in a paper, "South Carolina goes to a Final Four, but don't
forget they lost in February at home." Nobody is going to give a damn about
that game. It's all about tomorrow night.  
  
Q. They have five players who have played in championship games. How
important is it on both sides to have two teams that have players who have
been there and done that at this time of year?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Obviously experience is huge when it comes to being able
to perform in a big moment on a big stage. It truly does help to have been
there, and the team we're playing tomorrow night has been there. They won a
National Championship last year, so they know how to win. They know how to win
tomorrow's game and they know how to win the next two games.  
  
We're not playing a team -- like last year, we played UCLA and Oregon, two
teams that have never been in that situation. It is a unique scenario that
you're playing against a team that has been where you've been. So I don't know
that there's an advantage either way.  
  
Q. I think I've asked you this question, ten of the last 11 years you've
made the final four. You always say this game someone on your team steps up to
help carry you there.  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Correct.  
  
Q. Do you have a thought in your head, hey, I think this person might be
the one to have that game to get us there?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I don't know. That's a good question. This time, as
opposed to the other times, there's been so many instances where I've sat here
and everybody sitting in front of me knew pretty much, 90 percent of the time,
where the ball is going to go and who is going to do what.  
  
But we do have a somewhat of a balanced team, and we have players that are
capable of carrying us for stretches. I don't know that we have anyone that is
going to be asked to do it the whole game and carry a bigger load than anybody
else. Most of the games that we've won, really good games this year, have been
team efforts. There hasn't been, you know, one player -- maybe that's why
nobody is talking about any of our players being national Player of the Year,
you know. We've relied more on our team than any particular individual.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the challenges that South Carolina presents,
and is it more than just their front court?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't think you win that many games and get to
this point by being somewhat one-dimensional or limited.  
  
Yeah, I mean, you can go in there and say, well, you know, we'll do a great
job on their front court. They have got other good players. They make shots
from a lot of different places on the floor. And when they miss shots, they
offensive rebound as well as anybody in the country.  
  
I think it would be foolish to think, okay, if we -- if we take this away from
them, then we're definitely going to win. It still comes down to, you know,
you have to score, and you have to come -- it comes down to you have to score.
I mean, I could be wrong, but most of the times, our defense gives us a chance
to win the game. I don't know the last time our defense let us down --
actually, I do remember when our defense let us down.  
  
We were at Stanford a couple years ago when we scored 80-some points and lost.
That might be the last time where defensively, we just played the way that --
we should lose. You should lose that game no matter what. But since then, our
defense has been really, really good and it's just a matter of, can you make
enough shots to win the game, that night.  
  
And as anybody who has played in these games will tell you, it's not easy to
make shots at this time of the year. Every kid starts to -- if you're not
careful, starts to think -- you know, this isn't January or February where if
I go to 0-for-10, I go to practice tomorrow and work on my shot. You go
0-for-10 tomorrow, you work on your shot the next five months.  
  
Q. Over the years, you've seen Dawn, built Temple, South Carolina,
worked alongside you on the last Olympic staff. Can you talk about just
watching her through the years and what you thought she really possesses or
any special qualities?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: It's one of those stories, I think Felisha was talking
about it yesterday, about young coaches who need an opportunity to coach and
need an opportunity to show what they can do.  
  
Dawn was start enough to do it at a place where your mistakes aren't going to
be to be scrutinized every day, so she was able to learn how to coach at
Temple. She was probably learning to coach the whole time she played, you
know, when you play a lot of basketball. And that doesn't mean you've played a
lot of basketball, you're going to be a great coach. Although, every kid that
I've ever coached on the Olympic Team thinks they can coach better than me,
but that's just the way those people think.  
  
But she did it the right way. You know, she went to a place and learned how to
coach, and then when the opportunity came to coach at a place when you could
win the National Championship, she's made the most of it, taken advantage of
it.  
  
You know, if it was easy to win a National Championship, there would be a lot
of coaches in America that have done that, and there weren't. So it's hard.
She's had a pretty good balance of, you know, how to put her team together
recruiting-wise and their style of play. I think if you look at the last ten
years, whatever, be pretty hard-pressed to find anyone that's come as far as
they have since she took over at South Carolina.  
  
You know, she's done it the right way. She didn't fall into this. She's earned
it.  
  
Q. Two things. One is, if you go all the way to the last game, you will
have played Duke, South Carolina, maybe Notre Dame, maybe Oregon, maybe
Mississippi State. That's a lot of teams with a lot of caché. Do you just pull
out the one-game-at-a-time philosophy at this point? Because looking at the
big picture, that's kind of a lot. And also, what were you talking to Chrystal
about?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: What was I talking to Chrystal about? I just reminded her
that if she gets ten steals tomorrow, she'll move up to fourth in our starting
lineup, and she was arcing with me, but I know I'm right. It's my daily dose
of getting on someone's nerves. I can't go for more than an hour without doing
that.  
  
Some roads are not as challenging as others, at times; it seems that way in
the NCAA Tournament. Other times, it seems very, very daunting. You look back,
and they are all difficult. What's going to be happening in the future is the
really good teams are still going to be really good, but there's going to be a
lot more surprise teams, like what you saw in Buffalo, Central Michigan and
teams like that, because Oregon State showed up a couple years ago and they
are back again, you know.  
  
So what seems like, well, they don't have a lot of pedigree; well, any more,
it's not going to matter because all you have to do is win, get hot for six
games.  
  
But there's been times when I've looked back on our NCAA Tournament run, and I
think to myself, if we had to do this over again, I don't think we could do
it. It's kind of -- I mean, our first National Championship in '95, our last
four games, we beat Louisiana Tech, Virginia, Stanford and Tennessee. And you
look back and say, well, do you think you could do that again? Probably not.
But you don't realize it at the time because you're just trying to beat that
one team, and that's kind of where it is today.  
  
I mean, we can't worry about who may be around next week. I mean, our world
begins and ends tomorrow.  
  
Q. Gabby just sat up there and said, "Hey, the pressure is on us."
There's a lot of athletes that sit there and come up with a lot of compromised
answers. Do you like hearing one of your athletes just go, "Hey, the pressure
is on us."  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Because she's telling the truth. I mean, what are you
going to sit up here and make something up and pretend? There's no games you
ever play at Connecticut where the pressure is not on you.  
  
To me, those teams that sit up here and those players that sit up here and go,
there's no pressure on us, we have nothing to lose. Yeah, you do, you're going
to lose the game tomorrow, if you talk like that. And most really good coaches
and really good players, they don't try to avoid the pressure. They don't
pretend it's not there. It's not there. And it's especially there at
Connecticut. It's there the day you sign your letter of intent. It's there the
day you show up on campus. It's there every day in practice, and every game
you play.  
  
There's no getting around that. So when you get to a game like tomorrow, you
know, this idea in people's mind: We're playing the defending national
champions. Yeah, we won 12 of those. So everywhere we go, when people play us,
it's, "We're playing Connecticut." That's what our kids live with every day,
and the interesting part about it is they manage to be great in that
environment.  
  
It's remarkable, I think. When you come to Connecticut and you realize there's
nothing that you could do in your four years that hasn't already been done, I
mean, unless you go undefeated all four years.  
  
Q. You had mentioned before, the comments yesterday that got a lot of
play. I'm sure you've seen them now.  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I recruited her when she was in high school. I'm
old, huh. She played for Barb at Syracuse. She's a great kid.  
  
Q. Jamelle Elliott, a former African American who was let go, having
success at Temple so far, do you think it's not fair for African American
coaches to not have a chance to get hired if they don't succeed the first time
and get fired; that want a chance to do well and if they don't, they may not
get another shot?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that, that may or may
not be the right time, I don't know.  
  
I've been through a lot in my coaching career, you know, in the 30-some years.
The way it goes, I think, is things go in cycles, and athletic directors and
presidents, they look for the flavor of the month, you know. So what's popular
these days: What can I do that's going to make me look good in my athletic
department; or what does my president want me to do.  
  
I've had athletic directors call me and say, "Can you recommend five people
for the job?" And I'll give them maybe some names and I'll go, "Well, my
president told me I have to hire this." Like even before going in, they have
already made a decision: This is what I have to hire, not I want to hire the
best coach; I want to hire someone who can help us win. I want to hire someone
who can build a program. I almost never get that.  
  
So a lot of kids like Jamelle and Felisha, and Barb will tell you this, as a
former coach, a lot of kids get jobs they are not prepared for. Why? Because
it looks good. So they are put in situations where they can't win. And then
five years later they are fired, and go, see, I told you. Well, they had no
chance right from the beginning, so nobody wants to give them a second chance.
It's stupid.  
  
That's why I was talking about Dawn. You have to go to a place where if you
screw up, it's not going to kill you. And, you have to be in a place where
they support you and they will give you the opportunity, and then you've got
to perform.  
  
But even if you do all that, there's no guarantees. And if you're good, you
will get another opportunity. No question about that. And Jamelle will get
another opportunity. Just like Felisha got another opportunity. Unfortunately
too many young assistant coaches, doesn't matter what gender they are, what
color they are, it doesn't matter. They take jobs where they can't win, just
to be a head coach. You're not going to like them any more after you take the
job.  
  
"But I need a job."  
  
"Well, okay, then take the job." And it doesn't ever work out.  
  
So, it's -- you know, I was lucky, when I got the job at the Connecticut in
'85, one, they just wanted to make sure I have five guys on the court, and
that was going to be a W for us. So if you take a job today in a big, like BCS
school, the demands are huge in some places, and you've got to perform.  
  
And at other places, you take a job at a place like that, they don't care.
They just want to go, like, listen, I've got a head football coach who is a
pain in my ass; I've got a head men's basketball coach who is a pain in my
ass. I don't need another one, so don't bother me. I'm not giving you anything
more than what I have; just leave me alone. Am I right, Barb? Right.  
  
I'm lucky that I've been at a place where -- well, even at Connecticut, after
we won the BIG EAST regular season championship, I said, "Can we get
cheerleaders at our game"?  
  
"No."  
  
"How about five guys that play the flute?"  
  
"No."  
  
"This is New England. Can we get a guy with a drum?" (Laughter).  
  
"No."  
  
You need to be at a place where they are going to give you what you need and
as you get better, they will give you a little more to be successful. But I
think sometimes coaches are so anxious to be head coaches, and athletic
directors are so anxious to hire what it going to look good, that too many
mistakes are made on both ends.  
  
Q. When Dawn was on your staff with the Olympics, is the conversations
with her or any of the other assistant coaches, specifically on your team and
how to win or do guys get philosophical and talk about basketball in general?
And if so, are the things that you helped her with and like maybe Apollo Creed
in Rocky, did you tell her not quite everything?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think every coach is somewhat suspicious. To me,
I couldn't care less. You could ask me any question and I'll tell you what I
think. And most coaches are kind of set in their ways.  
  
So with the Olympic Team, with my staff, I was fortunate the last time around.
I know exactly how Doug thinks and he knows exactly how I think. Obviously
I've known Cheryl for a long time and her success speaks for itself at the pro
level. I was as much picking her brain as anything else.  
  
And with Dawn, I think it's more of a -- her style is more by, she wants to
watch and she wants to see and she wants to take things in and study it. There
isn't a lot of, hey, how do you do this. She wants to see how you do it, and
then learn from that.  
  
And to me, you know, I'm trying to study everybody. That's just the way I am.  
  
Q. When the subject of pressure came up, she finished by saying, "If
not, you know, our season's this or that." Given you are the State of
Connecticut, things get cumulative. So it won't be just a question of the way
one season, the way last year ended. Does it add to it or is all that in the
past?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, two years without winning a National Championship,
I'll probably have to move from my house. Too many people know where I live,
and we'll be like 70-2, and somebody will be out to get me; I'll have to
change where I go to the store, all that stuff.  
  
Yeah, Connecticut -- well, first of all, if we don't win tomorrow night,
there's not even any going back to Connecticut. The expectation level is so
high, so high. But we created it, so I'm not -- you know, believe me, I'm far
from complaining. I'd rather have that than some of the scenarios I described
earlier where nobody cares. But it's unlike any place you've ever been.  
  
I want to go down and sit down with Nick Saban and say, how the hell do you do
this. It's a different world. It's a different world.  
  
Q. A lot has changed since that first meeting. Specifically, A'ja
Wilson's play. When you see her, what's special about her, and do you believe
your team is going to be facing probably the best player in the country right
now?  
COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I mean, I've been fortunate enough to coach a bunch of
those players, so I knew what the other teams were up against when they were
trying to figure out how to play against, you know, whether it was Stewy or
Maya or any of those people.  
  
When you're getting ready to play somebody like A'Ja, I've been batting it
back and forth. There's no easy answer. You can't say, well, let's not let her
do this. I remember back in the day, people said, Bob Cousy could only dribble
with his right hand. Yeah, but he's going to go wherever he wants to go and
there's nothing you can do about it.  
  
There's thing things that A'ja Wilson does that you could say, "Well, we need
to do something about that." Well, you can talk about it all you want. You
still have to be able to stop it.  
  
Each year she's gotten a little bit better at figuring out what you're trying
to do and has an answer for it, you know, with each time that we've played
them, I've been able to see a difference.  
  
But it's still going to come down to her supporting cast, too. I don't think
you're going to go into any tournament and play against us and think that one
player by themselves is going to win the game.  
  
So for us, we've got to do a great job on her, but their supporting cast is
pretty good.

_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on the victory.  
  
COACH DAWN STALEY: We're excited to be moving on to the Elite 8. We played an
an incredible Buffalo team that took a long time to get control of the game
and that was due to the way they played us. I'm extremely proud of our players
staying resilient, not playing their best basketball but they did enough to
move on to the Elite 8.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about the size advantage?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: You know, I just feel like we just did what we do best. You
know, we have four good post players. We just used our advantage, you know.
We're all back to the basket type of players and we like to get in, and once
we got position on them, it was just focusing and finishing at that point. I
think we did a good job with that tonight.  
  
A'JA WILSON: I think everyone kind of knows that's our bread and butter and
that's kind of our go to, getting in the paint, whether we are dribbling or
using our size inside, that's something we're blessed with and we used that
very well. We all bring something to the able to it's hard to stop us in ways.  
  
Q. You seem like an extension of Dawn out on the floor. How do you think
about that and do you view it that way?  
A'JA WILSON: Man, thank you for saying that. Coach Dawn Staley, you feel me?
(Laughing).  
  
I don't know, I just feel like my energy really helps my teammates and that's
the biggest thing and that's my goal and whether it's just screaming at one or
screaming at everyone or putting the ball in the basket. I feel like that's
how I operate to help my team and I really try to use that in every possession
that we have. Because I mean, we -- that's how we roll. That's how we have to
get hype. We have to let everyone know everything is going to be okay and push
through when times aren't in the game. That's my role in this team and I try
to embrace it anyway I can. I don't know if I'm trying to be an extension of
her because she yells more but I definitely try to help my teammates out in
any way.  
  
Q. You talked about how the fourth quarter, you've been in close games
throughout the season, but you've turned it on. Seemed like today at the
fourth quarter, especially what happened at the end of the third, seems like
there was no life on the bench to start the fourth. What changed? What
clicked?  
A'JA WILSON: It's just us. That's just us. I think we all really kind of came
together and said, you know, this is us, and even before the game, I told my
team that losing the Sweet 16 is not a good feeling, and I did not want them
to have that feeling.  
  
So we were going to do whatever we can and whatever we could in the game to
pull out the win. We came together and set the tempo and got the momentum back
the way we did and stayed within our system, and we executed pretty well.  
  
Q. You had two points in the first quarter and picked it up in the
second. You had a few games that it takes you awhile to get going. What
changed for you in the second quarter?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I don't feel like it takes awhile for me to get going. I feel
like I contribute in other areas if I'm not scoring. I play defense and
rebound and I just do the best that I can.  
  
I did have a slow start tonight, but I picked it up. I just did what I needed
to do for my team tonight and that was just focusing and finishing at the rim,
and I appreciate my teammates who were giving me the ball.  
  
Q. There were moments in the game, I sensed, and correct me if I'm
wrong, that you were getting pretty frustrated, missed some lay-ups, maybe a
couple fouls that you didn't necessarily want to pick up, turnovers. How much
did they frustrate you and what did they do to frustrate you?  
A'JA WILSON: Honestly, I don't think it was them that really was frustrating
me. I think it was myself. I really kind of got -- this whole tournament I've
really been inside my head a lot. We were just talking about it on the way
here; I feel like I'm defending myself and I'm blocking shots of my own, and
that's really not good.  
  
It's going to come. It's going to click. Yes, there was times in the game I
was very frustrated at my game, I was very frustrated and I felt like I wasn't
contributing to my team the way I should, and I can't stand that feeling. I
hate it. And they really helped me lift up and they lifted my spirits. They
might not know that, but they definitely do.  
  
I don't think it was necessarily anything Buffalo did. They are a great team
but I think it was more myself than them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the feeling of getting back to the Elite 8 again,
and also what you thought of the crowd here today?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I'm excited to get back to the Elite 8. Obviously I don't
know a whole lot of people outside of our camp thought we would be here today,
but it's always good to prove others wrong and be odds beaters.  
  
I thought the crowd was terrific. Obviously it didn't favor us but just the
atmosphere created here, I thought everybody that organized getting people in
the stands did a great job of filling it and it felt like a postseason place.
It felt like a berth to the Sweet 16 and to the Elite 8. So a lot of energy
was in the gym. I take my hats off to the organizers. I thank the MAC for
doing a great job at getting people in the stands.  
  
Q. Some of the turnovers, especially early, was that just a result of
their pressure or were they trying to force the ball into the post?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I just thought we played too fast. I think our team was
anxious to play. We've been working on Buffalo for four days, and you know, we
saw ways in which we could be effective and we just played too fast.  
  
I don't think they were speeding us up because they were sagging. It was us.
A'Ja walked like five times. That's uncharacteristic of her. It is
characteristic of the last few days' games in which we've turned the ball
over. We've got to figure out a way in which we limit those turnovers and turn
them into at least shots at the basket.  
  
The way we were shooting the ball today, we would score at least half, or even
a quarter of them, and I think we would feel a little bit better about getting
control of the game a little bit earlier.  
  
Q. You've seen all kind of games in the southeast conference on your
schedule. How did all that experience help you today when things weren't going
right early?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I mean, when you play in the best conference in the
country, you sometimes won't play your best basketball for one reason or
another.  
  
But it was familiar to us. I don't think we're playing our best basketball. I
don't think we're playing, you know, as well as we played two weeks ago in the
SEC Tournament. I think the long break really was a disadvantage for our team.  
  
You know, I probably fought myself because I gave them more time than I
usually give a team off, just because I thought we played -- we don't have a
whole lot of depth and we needed to kind of rest and recover. I think they
looked pretty good from a physical standpoint, but from a -- just the
chemistry and the cohesion is not there. But at some point, it wasn't there
during the season when we played some other SEC teams, but we found a way to
win the game. I know there are a lot of other teams that would love to be in
our position and winning ugly and continuing, rather than losing pretty.  
  
Q. Apologies if you've already addressed this. But in regards to playing
Buffalo now and having played them, what impressed you about them, what do you
think about their future, and maybe becoming someone that comes to the Sweet
16 more than just once?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I think they are a great, well coached basketball team,
that they play for 40 minutes. They always give you their best, and when
you're playing against someone's best, a lot of times, they impact the game.
They have got a great quality point guard. They have got a shooter. They have
got post players who understand their role and play them to a T. That's why
they find themselves always in basketball games and winning a lot of those
basketball games.  
  
My hat goes off to them. Felisha does a great job with her team and she had
them ready to go today.  
  
Q. When you hear A'Ja talk about that she's fighting herself and you're
in the midst of this, you know all to well what it is to be the centrifuge of
a team. What are you going to tell her and what have you done in the past to
sort of get her right the way you have done in past seasons?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Basically you just talk to her. You don't get her
overthinking because she's already overthinking. You get her to familiarize
herself with what she does best.  
  
You know, she's by far the best player in the country and she has to get back
to feeling the best, and not invincible, but surely, taking a glimpse down at
the "S" on her chest because shears been Superwoman for us, and not playing
her best basketball. She ends up 20-13, but I'm hoping sooner or later, Monday
night, she gets back to playing like A'ja Wilson.  
  
Q. How comforting is it to see Alexis be engaged early?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I'm extremely proud of Alexis. You know, obviously Alexis
does a lot of, you know -- she's our bull. She's the physicality. She plays a
lot of physicality. I don't think we get her the ball enough, especially when
she has two feet in the paint.  
  
When she does, she's pretty efficient, like she showed today. I'm glad that
she gave the contribution she gave us today. Kiki is playing tremendous
basketball, Lele on the perimeter gave us a bright spot in the second quarter.
It's going to take that kind of effort from multiple people in order for us to
continue in this Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the win. Thank you for being here.

_Albany, New York_  
  
UConn - 72, Duke - 59  
  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Just obviously a strong, tough game for us. I think I like
our turnovers. I think that's good. I hate the fact that we're out-rebounded.
I think that's really bad. And I think that when that happens, good things can
happen for the other team, which they did.  
  
I'm very proud of our team. I like our team a lot. I think we've handled a
lot, a lot of adversity, and we've had some excellent leadership, and playing
our best basketball in a lot of ways at this time of year, which has been
great.  
  
We're just going to have to keep battling, keep getting after it a little bit,
be more consistent with our rebounding. I love that Erin had eight. I love
that Nay had eight. But there's a big drop-off after that, and you see they've
got 12 and 11 and 7, so that kind of -- that certainly helps the game. We need
to get to the free-throw line more. We did not. And got to credit some good
defense by Connecticut. Like I said, I'm really proud of our team, and I
certainly hope Connecticut does well.  
  
Q. Lexie, you guys I think had 13 in the third quarter and they held you
without a point for the rest of the period. Is their defense that tough to
play against, or was there anything they were doing special that caused
problems for you guys?  
LEXIE BROWN: No, I just think we missed a lot of easy ones, some lay-ups we
missed, some wide open shots we missed. I think their defense was solid, but
it wasn't something that we couldn't handle. I just think it was just us
locking in offensively and knocking shots down because I think we were getting
enough stops, just needed to convert a little bit better.  
  
Q. Coach P talked about turnovers and eliminating turnovers today with
only 10. You had seven steals yourself. How proud are you of the way you kept
those turnovers down to 10?  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, it was something we've been talking about all week, not
turning the ball over, fuelling their transition offense. I think I had the
most turnovers actually, so I'm really proud of everybody for handling
themselves offensively even with their pressure. I think we had two in the
second half total, so that's awesome for us, something that I wish we could
have built on for future games, but I think that's something super positive to
end the year on.  
  
Q. Lexie, just wondering, in light of the way you were able to manage
the game and turn them over as much as you were, what do you think that says
about your ability to do that at the next level?  
LEXIE BROWN: I just think I've worked hard on defense. Growing up I wasn't the
most athletic person, so I learned angles, reading people's eyes, passing
lanes. I think I'll be able to translate that to the next level because
defense is not something everybody wants to do, and I love it. It's something
I'm super proud of myself for.  
  
Q. Nay, your third game in the NCAA with 20 or more points; is this just
the beginning for you?  
LEAONNA ODOM: You know, my teammates gave me the ball in perfect position, and
luckily I was able to score, so it could be a beginning, and I'm looking
forward to next year.  
  
Q. Faith, what does it mean to have Nay for another year to see the
potential that she has given that what she produced these past three games?  
FAITH SUGGS: I think it's about time. (Laughter.) I'm excited. We're all
excited. I told her next season, I'd better not see a game where she's 20
under. I want to see it every time. She gives you energy, she keeps going, and
no one can guard her, so it's exciting.  
  
Q. What did it mean having Lexie as a leader, and what has she meant to
you here at Duke?  
FAITH SUGGS: Lexie has been great. She is the most competitive person on this
team. She may get annoying and you may want to fight her every second, but
she's someone who teaches you how to be competitive. She really is. When she
plays defense, you feed off of it. Her energy, her steals, it's just really
fun to play with somebody like Lexie, and anybody in the future is lucky to
play with her.  
  
Q. Lexie, I know you only had a couple years at Duke, but put into
perspective what your career was like there and how proud you were to put on a
Duke uniform the last couple years of your career.  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, coming to Duke has been amazing. The relationships I've
built these three years here have been incredible. You know, basketball has
been so much fun, I mean, playing with people like Faith and Nay. The list can
go on. This is the most fun I've definitely had playing college basketball.
We've had our ups and downs, and I think we handled it as best as any team
could have handled it, and then taking things off the basketball court, being
at Duke has been life-changing. I mean, the people I've met, the connections
I've made and people that I've run into on campus, at basketball games has
been incredible. Definitely something that I'm super -- I mean, the decision I
made is something I'm super happy with, and I wouldn't change it for anything.  
  
Q. For all the players, I was wondering, now that you've played South
Carolina and UConn, I wonder if you could sort of size up for all that A'ja
Wilson has accomplished in her career she's 0-4 against UConn and never been
within 10 points. Do you think South Carolina can beat UConn, and if so, what
would they have to do?  
LEXIE BROWN: I think they can beat UConn. I think we could have beat UConn. I
think that people just need to not play the UConn on the jersey. Of course
they're a super talented team, super competitive, but Asia is probably one of
the most competitive players that I've played against and I've watched, and I
think she can carry that team. They feed off of her energy, and she's a super
energetic player.  
  
I'm definitely rooting for South Carolina, but you know, UConn is a great
team, and if they win it, it's only because they deserve to.  
  
FAITH SUGGS: I agree with Lex 100 percent. I think for them to beat UConn, I
think that they need to stay together. Playing a team like that, you can have
moments where you have emotional lapses, you break away from each other, but
Coach P says when things don't go right or not perfect, you stay together and
you trust one another, and I think if a team can do that, then they can beat
them.  
  
LEAONNA ODOM: They just need to play together, play hard and focus on
themselves as a team, focus as a team to play together, and I think they can
win.  
  
Q. You guys cut it in the first half to seven but then they held you
without a basket or a point in the third quarter. Was it something they were
doing defensively or a combination of things? What was the offensive lapse?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: I think you've just got to be prepared for all 40 minutes,
and I think as you make runs, Connecticut is very good about responding to
that, and I think you've just got to keep going and have the immediacy and
intensity and the smarts that when you're making a run -- I mean, I know we
got a little bit faster when we were making our run. We did some very good
things, but we also turned the ball over and did some things that you can't
do. Or maybe took a quick shot or something that you want to make them play
defense longer.  
  
When you've had that much success as the Connecticut team has over years and
years and years it gets passed down, there's that confidence of they keep
coming at you, and you've got to be ready for it, and you've got to be ready
to make the stops continuously, and I think that we did in circumstances, but
we couldn't get it consistently across the board. And that's what you have to
do because they're going to keep coming at you. They have too much experience
not to, especially with Gabby and Nurse. They've got too much experience.  
  
Q. Curious, I spoke to Lexie briefly about it, but what kind of player
you see her being at the WNBA level, and same question for Rebecca Greenwell,
who's projected to be drafted this year?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Yeah, Lexie is a great player for the next level because
she's so diverse. I mean, first of all, she's going to play both sides of the
ball for you, so you're just not signing offense or defense, you're getting
both, and she's going to get that done. She also can play the point or the 2
-- she's a little small for the 2, but she can still do it. She can still get
it done because she's such an excellent shooter. She's got a work ethic and a
commitment to the game that goes back to when she was just a little girl with
her dad, and I think there are no limits to what she can do with those kind of
great players around her. Obviously as you know there's fabulous players in
the league, and for some teams she's really just a lot of things, and they've
got their roster limitations, right, so you've got to get a lot with each
person that signs, and I think she'll be terrific in the right place and learn
a lot. I don't think she'll mind being a rookie and learning the ropes a
little bit, being taught by the older players. But I just think that's
fantastic, and she loves the game. Very passionate about the game and
committed to the game, so that's a great thing.  
  
For Becca, just as a sharp shooter, again, around excellent players where she
can spot up and really be a difference maker off the pass, that's her game,
and she brings intangibles because she does work so hard. She'll take
advantage of any opportunity given to her and be really committed.  
  
So the two of them are pretty special that way relative to work ethic. Their
talents are different, but they're very special players, and I'm hoping for
both of them that they can find something exciting for them in the future.  
  
Q. Coach, from the very beginning in Italy to now, how proud are you of
this team and the way that they've been able to accomplish with all the
obstacles that they've been through?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Who would have thunk it? When you think about Italy and
having everybody healthy and the way we played without Becca, Bego or Lexie in
that very difficult game against a pro team, it was extraordinary, and then to
see what we had to go through through the year, I just think -- not to mention
a special visit from a Chinese coach who taught us a great deal, as well. It
just goes on and on and on. It's been an incredible year at Duke. I'm very
proud of the team. It's not been perfect. Those three point guards had to sit
through this and see it, and they're all coming back.  
  
So they're excited, motivated, and I think everyone is willing to take the
lessons.  
  
But again, we don't have 35 wins, but we have incredible stories and
incredible opportunities to be brave, and you need to be brave a lot in life.
I think we all know that as adults, and this team got a lot of those lessons.  
  
Q. You guys, seven points in the first minute and eight points in the
last minute of the half. How difficult does that make -- you can't minimize
that damage going into the second half and it's an eight-point game instead of
a 20-point game?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Yeah, and it's a problem, too, because I had to burn a
time-out to get everyone to calm down. Just again, they're a team that plays
with terrific runs, and you look at their rebounding second shots, they got
into transition and that spells the game pretty quickly there. They're in
terrific shape, they can play forever, and yeah, I thought it was problematic
for sure. The runs were. I felt good about coming out of the first time-out. I
thought we did settle down. I thought we did play, which was great. But that
was for a quarter, and it needs to continue.  
  
Again, I'm very, very proud of my team. I can only say that for what we've
been through, and Connecticut is a great team, and I know they were all
speculating here.  
  
As far as I'm concerned, the team that beats you in the tournament is the one
that needs to win it, so I don't know if I share all this dialogue to my left.
I hope Connecticut does well, and I'm sure they will, but that's just how I
feel about things.  
  
Q. It's easier said to prepare for Connecticut. How did you simulate and
prepare the athleticism, the quickness, in practice to get ready for a team
like Connecticut?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Yeah, that's a great question, and I think actually it's a
advantage to play them at the time we did relative to having more prep time.
We have a heck of a scout team at Duke if you'd like to check them out.
They're pretty good. So we had them for two full days in prepping for
Connecticut. I think it's very difficult playing them because you had no time.
You played and there's no scout guys coming in, and that's all you've got. And
so I think that getting exposure to the transition speed, physicality, of
course, and finishing with contact in those things. I definitely think it's
much harder now in the second game. It just is. And you can say, well, we've
played against them before and that type of thing, but I still say it's
difficult, a difficult thing to turn around very quickly.  
  
Q. What was it like playing in the Sweet 16 with three grad students?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: We are a smart team in the Sweet 16. That's what we are.
Just so proud of them. Again, the story, I know, guys, it's not basketball,
but it's never going to happen again. It's history making. Three women in
graduate school at Duke playing basketball, two of which are the go-to
players, and Bego could have been if we could have had her longer. We only get
her for one year, which is very sad. So no, we're very proud of that story.
It's very hard to balance the workload that they have in a business school,
and I think it's really interesting how the business school got around them
and came to the games, and they had all these smart signs. They weren't just
your basic signs. But I thought that was great. We're very proud of them, and
I'm sure it will never happen again, so I just want to say we did make history
for any history buffs out there, but we're very proud of them.  
  
Q. You mentioned briefly UConn's seniors and what their experience is
like. Can you just talk a little bit more about Gabby Williams, 15 points, a
dozen rebounds, six assists today? She did a little bit of everything.  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: She always does. I mean, I don't know her personally, but
she seems just fabulous. She seems low maintenance, wonderful to coach, always
goes hard. I think I'm going to echo Jay Bilas. Jay Bilas loves her, talks
about her all the time, about just a wonderful player in women's basketball.
I'm going to go with him and be on that club, the Gabby Williams fan club,
because I think not only is she so consistent, but she just doesn't bat an eye
to anything. She competes at an Olympic level of focus, and obviously I'm sure
she's learned a great deal from Geno and his staff. But I'll tell you what,
she's a very special player. They just don't come around very much, and she's
the closest thing to Maya Moore to me without the outside shooting as much,
but still with that body type and the way she's consistent. She's very clever
and very good, and she was a big problem for us.  
  
Q. Wanted to give you a chance to clarify, you were asked about comments
you previously made about Azurá Stevens by the Duke Chronicle, and you said
you were completely misquoted. I saw the Chronicle today posted audio
consistent with the comments that were made. I wanted to see if you had any
clarification you wanted to make about that?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: No, again, it's all out of context, and I don't think this
is the time for that. I think we're very proud of Azurá, and she had a
fabulous game, and she's been doing extremely well. It would have to take too
long to understand what the points were there, and I'm not going to go into
it. I'm simply going to say that -- again, Azurá is a special player, and
she's improved a great deal. Her inside game is getting stronger and stronger.
Obviously we miss her. Obviously we would have liked to have had her on our
side, but those things happen. Again, we'll move forward and they'll move
forward. I can't go back to that stuff. I don't appreciate it, so I won't.

_Albany, New York_  
  
South Carolina 79, Buffalo 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a tremendous season. Will you provide
opening comments forked audience in regard's to today's game.  
  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I'm so thrilled to go on this journey with these
young ladies. What fight, what character. They were so down and they just kept
coming and believing and leaving it out there. Just really over the moon when
it comes to these young ladies. You know, we certainly feel the pain of
losing. You can see it in our eyes. But what's going to be remembered is the
journey to this point, the sisterhood, the Fox Hall, the bus breaking down,
taking Ubers to the game, and we found a way; my husband had to step in and
then he had to go to work and we were telling him to quit his job.  
  
So much laughter, the silly songs, so many things we did, and right now, these
competitive young ladies, they are going to struggle for the next day or 24
hours. But when it's all said and done, we're going to be just so proud.  
  
Q. Coming into this game, you talked about seeing how you measured up.
What did you learn about yourselves? What did you learn about this group today
and this game?  
CIERRA DILLARD: I learned we never stopped fighting. We always have the never
die attitude and we buy into what Coach says and that's what got us here and
what got us here to the Sweet 16. I believe we gave South Carolina a fight and
I believe we gave the audience a good game.  
  
Q. Coming from Australia all the way to Buffalo to see this thing
through, I'm sure it hurts now but where is your level of pride and how proud
are you of this program?  
STEPHANIE REID: Honestly, I couldn't be any more grateful to call Buffalo my
second home. I've had the best three and a half years here. I'm so grateful to
Coach Jack. I'm so grateful to all the staff, past and present, that have been
there, that have pushed me to where I am today.  
  
You know, it's never fun to go out on a loss but only one team gets to do that
at the end, to finish on a win. It's hard, and it's hard to know that I'll
never put this jersey on again and it's hard it know that when I untie my
shoelaces, it will be the last time as a Buffalo. But I'll always be part of
this program and I'll never let them play a game that I'm not watching, if I
can be there or watch it from Australia or wherever I am. It was just Buffalo,
is the best second home that anyone could ask for. I'm so grateful for the
opportunity to go there, to have Coach Jack transform me as a player, but also
a certain. This is the most phenomenal woman that I have ever met, and I
guarantee you, that's not a lie. She's more than just a basketball coach. She
is -- she is a life coach and a phenomenal woman. She wants us all to be
phenomenal women, and you know, one day, when I grow up, I hope to be just
like Coach Jack, as strong and amazing as she is, because she completely
transformed my life in the last three and a half years, not just my basketball
skills, but my whole life, and I'm forever grateful for that (tearing)?  
  
Q. A basketball question. Might help.  
STEPHANIE REID: Thank you.  
  
Q. You've carried this team through a lot of wins. Did the reality of
their size, did that just catch up?  
STEPHANIE REID: I mean, they they were quite large, and when they played three
bigs, it gave us a big challenge on the rebounding. That was a good move.  
  
But you know, I think that they are going to remember us, and that's what we
wanted to do. You know, if we -- win or lose, we want them to remember who we
are and to know that they played Buffalo for 40 minutes and we didn't stop
fighting at any point. We fought all the way to the end to the last second and
that's what we take pride in.  
  
Yeah, they won the rebound battle. Yeah, they were huge. But we have big
hearts and we went out proud of who we are.  
  
Q. What's it been like to be part of this journey this year to get to
this point? What does your run this year say about the team and the future?  
CIERRA DILLARD: The future's bright. Coach has done an unbelievable job with
this program, in six years to go from what it was to what it's now, and the
hard work of not just us but but the work that the other coaches and the other
players -- to see it transform and see it in their eyes and how happy they are
and the work they put in helped build the foundation of Buffalo and see what
they are doing now is unbelievable and it's great to be a part of.  
  
Coming from UMASS and coming from one of I think, basketball, personally, one
of my lowest points in my career to be here on this stage, to be with my
family and my sisters, it's amazing. It's a dream come true. People dream
about this when they are little, to play on an NCAA basketball court and to
play in an NCCA Tournament.  
  
I'm a competitor, yes, but to think about that, we are 29-6, and we made it to
the Sweet 16 and we put Buffalo Buffalo in people's mouths, the name in
people's mouths, it's great to see and witness, let alone be a part of.  
  
Q. When you think about what you've seen, the Atlantic 10, to be able to
go in and at times dominate that conference, do you think we've gotten to a
point where mid-majors have a seat at the table when it comes to who ends up
going far in the NCAA Tournament on an annual basis?  
CIERRA DILLARD: Oh, without a doubt, I think mid-majors have a part in any
NCAA Tournament or any NCAA-based, type thing, whatever.  
  
In college, it's the hard work that the coaches put in, the hard work that the
players put in. We get used to pour five coaches, mid-major schools -- it's
just college, it's just players and coaches who are willing to put in the hard
work and who are willing to put in the heart to get to where they need to be.
We shouldn't be like, oh, they are a mid-major and not give them everything
they deserve. We deserve everything we've worked hard for in the season to be
here at this stage. We've put in a lot of success to be here, too. We beat
some unbelievable teams to get here and we played a great game tonight.  
  
I believe, yes, mid-majors should get everything they deserve and everything
they work hard for.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the specific challenges, having played against
Wilson, the challenges she presents?  
CIERRA DILLARD: Well, she's 6-5. I mean, she's an unbelievable player. I think
our posts have their hands full but they have done a great job of, you know,
helping her get difficult shots.  
  
I think we lost the rebounding as a team, and it's not any one player or any
two players. But you know, she is -- I don't know how to explain it, but she's
just a great player. Like she's an amazing post player who can finish and who
can dish and everything, and I give all the props to her. She's the reason why
they are national champions last year, and Dawn Staley has done an
unbelievable job with that program. She's an amazing coach and she have a
great group of girls who are really, really good at basketball.  
  
But, you know, I think that Buffalo did an unbelievable job of staying with
them and we gave it all. And Coach, as long as she knows that we gave it our
all, I think it will make her proud that we gave it our all.  
  
STEPHANIE REID: She has contagious energy and I think that's something she
brings to her teammates. Everything Cierra said is true. She's a great, great
player and she's got a very bright future ahead of her and Dawn Staley has
done a fantastic job with that program. But something she brought was her
energy and she gave that to all of her teammates and she puts her teammates in
success. That's pretty hard it do from a big. You don't see that very often,
so I give her credit for that, too.  
  
Q. (Off mic).  
STEPHANIE REID: I don't know, because the guards usually have to have the
leadership role on the court, but you can see, she possesses a leadership role
on that team, and you know, she definitely has energy that's so contagious to
her teammates that it puts them in a position to be successful?  
  
Q. You guys shot a lot better in the early two games, particularly, the
USF game. It appeared that you were getting open. Is the misses, is that how
it goes or is it because of how big and quick they were?  
CIERRA DILLARD: Well, it's basketball. You can't make everything. But I think,
you know, just getting loose in the game; it's a different stage and Coach
does a great job of telling us, just stay loose and you getting open shots and
you take the shots you're supposed to take. We worked on them all season.  
  
It's no time to question, oh, am I rushing or am I not. We're going to take
the shots we've been making all season and we're going to miss and make, and
that goes with the game of basketball, I think. That's just how it goes.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the shooting percentage and were
those the shots that you wanted to get and they just weren't falling? Were
they making you rush shots? Offensively wasn't as good as before.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: It's a different stage, different time. One thing
about shooting, it's going to come and go. I thought our defense was great. I
thought we really -- they turned the ball over 26 times, the seventh-best team
in the country.  
  
So our shooting, with the shots we usually take, they don't go in all the
time. It's unfortunate that on this stage they didn't. But you guys didn't see
how great Stephanie really is, because she really tried to make it happen for
us. Those shots that A.J. takes, she usually makes. It's definitely one of
those things.  
  
Q. How much do you think you frustrated them? Because they didn't look
very comfortable.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: We hit those wide open shots. If we would have
just frustrated them, we would have won. We really had them right where we
wanted them to be. You know, there's a plan for all of us. My thing that I
tell my players: Just don't get in your own way. We really didn't get in our
own way. We had the best shots. We had our best opportunity. We turned them
over. We got frustrated down low. We stayed -- we stuck our chest out and we
just kept coming.  
  
It was very important for the world to see Buffalo, chest up, rise up, stand
back up when they knocked us down. We were over matched. They are a very good
team. But like I said yesterday, we just want to be on the court with the very
great teams like South Carolina and Florida State and South Florida to find
out where we measure up. I think we measure up real nicely. I think our
future's bright.  
  
Q. As far as I can tell -- with Summer, you played even with them. How
much of a factor was her foul trouble in this game?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: That's the most frustrating thing for me, to see
the fouls she received. Had she been on that court, she made a difference. She
made an absolute difference. And I just don't know, I need to watch the film
because I've been wrong before, but a couple of those fouls, just changed the
trajectory of what we were doing, whether we were making the shots or missing
the shots, but she was the one getting touches and tips and keeping the ball
alive for us.  
  
I just felt, you know, you almost feel like your player was being picked on a
little bit. She was so frustrated. She was so hurt. Her playing 23 minutes was
just -- it's like playing A'Ja 23 minutes. She's ours on the inside and I just
think that the more we're on this stage, the more people are going to know who
we are and therefore, we're going to get -- maybe not right now, but I just
thought Summer was great. She's only a sophomore, guys. She's going to be a
fantastic local player from Buffalo and I'm so, so proud of her.  
  
Q. This was the most double-digit seeds to advance since 2000. You put
together a team in a variety of ways, transfers and overseas and other players
locally like you were just saying but how much deeper do you think the talent
pool is than even ten, 15 years ago, and do you think this is the new
normal?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: It's my only normal I know. I don't consider
myself a mid-major coach or a major coach. I've been on every stage. I've
worked with USA Basketball and won Gold Medals. I look at talent and character
first and I look at academic standards and then I say: Let's coach the team,
the kids, where they are.  
  
I just think that Loyola is making the same statement and the only thing I saw
with somebody like them being 11-seed and doing what they are doing, and why
not us, too, why not now.  
  
I just don't know if it's the new normal or not. I think that when I go into
some of these homes, I don't look at, Dawn Staley's been in this house, so I
can't go. I don't know how to think like that. And maybe I'm naïve, but I
think kids want to play for people and they want to go to a school to learn
and they want to be -- they don't talk to the buildings; they talk to the
assistant coaches.  
  
We are got a fantastic staff and organization and I think I'm a pretty cool
lady myself. I think we get players based on who we are, and then we tell them
about our unbelievable academic standards at Buffalo, it's a win/win. I think
the next players on this stage, they see the people that don't pick them at
that major level, we're a destination now, too.  
  
Q. I was wondering did what South Carolina was doing in the paint catch
up in the end? In your opinion, what was the reason why they ended up pulling
away?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: You tell me what the problem was and you ask me my
opinion -- I don't agree. I respectfully don't agree. We were down about I
five, the ball goes to Cassie and the ball slips out of her hand. Nobody
defended her. Nobody blocked her shot. Nobody stopped her. It slipped.  
  
We had another opportunity to score and had a sustained run, and I thought we
were in great shape. I thought that we could have ran but we needed to reward
it. We needed to finish on that shot because that drains you when you work
that hard and you get that ball six feet from the basket and it slips from
your hard.  
  
No disrespect to them, but we don't think that because you're bigger you're
necessarily better, and there are times you're going to be rewarded for the
success because of your size. I stayed with them for 40 minutes -- and they
have done that. Were they great inside? 52-30, yeah, they got us there. Could
we have still won? I think so. I have to think so because I'm the head coach
of the Buffalo team.  
  
Q. That run you were talking about, you were down 55-50, you had a
turnover, a missed shot and then a blocked shot and they didn't score in that
sequence, either. If something different would have happened during that
little run, could the game have been different?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: You know, you only want to hope, maybe. But I just
think that there's a plan for us all. I think that, you know, we've left it
all out. We could not have done one extra thing. These young ladies fought. We
were down by two with 1.1 second at Columbia University. We have a play, we're
going to layup, we win.  
  
We lost Stephanie against Nebraska on the road at a neutral site, my freshman
guard steps in and we beat them. We had so many wonderful moments as a team
and as an organization. We fought hard. We lose an AD, we get a new AD. We got
no managers. We've got a lot of reasons why this team should have stopped and
we would have had an excuse.  
  
We have not had an excuse since the beginning and we will not have an excuse
at the end. The better team won. South Carolina beat us, whether we had runs
or mishaps or what have you. How they beat us, that's for everybody to argue.
They were the better team today. I wish them the best of luck in the next
game, but I cannot be more proud of the resiliency of this group that we call
the University at Buffalo Women's Basketball Program.  
  
Q. Just to what we were speaking about earlier, because, like you said,
there aren't just these huge dividing lines between majors and mid-majors any
more and there are more opportunities for success, do you see an opportunity
for women of color to get more leadership opportunities, and do you view this
as a way to help bring to light the fact that there aren't enough women of
color getting the leadership positions?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Wow. I have some really amazing colleagues that
look like me. I have so many friends that had an opportunity and they lose
their opportunities and never be coming back up at all.  
  
It took an African American woman to notice me when I lost my job at Indiana.
Had she not noticed me, Danny White would have never known about me; and
because she spoke to him and I was able to present myself to him, I was able
to get this opportunity to bring this -- from where it was to where it is now.
I hope my colleagues don't get frustrated and never comeback. There's a
Gillette laws on this staff from South Carolina and we used to go up against
each other when she was at Illinois; a Cincinnati coach who played at a high
school gym and at the end was asked to leave.  
  
I'm saddened by it. I understand the problem. I know that the majority of
women basketball players look like me. I think that these young women, if we
really care about them as people, that they will have role models that look
like them. Because they are going to play four years for whomever, and then
they get an opportunity to go in this world, and they are not going to find
anybody that looked like them, and they are going to have to figure out how to
navigate at a different level.  
  
I hope that if these coaches that see me who resurged themselves or herself
into another opportunity and try to make the most of it, I hope they get
encouraged and understand: The fight isn't going to easy. It's necessary. It's
necessary not just for you and your sadness and you and your fire and you and
your woe-is-me.  
  
The fight is for the next young lady that needs a person who looks like her to
rise above and to be coached up and create a foundation so that she can become
the coo, the CFO of something very big. It's important that they stay in the
race and keep fighting. We see them. You're out there. Keep fighting. Go
forward. Thank you for that question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, Coach. Congratulations on a terrific
season.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

### [Napheesa Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33298)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
UConn - 72, Duke - 59  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: I was telling the team before and after the game that with each
game that you play in the tournament, it gets progressively more difficult to
do what you normally do. You have to be able to figure out how to win a game
whichever way the game is being played.  
  
Today wasn't one of those games where you just run up and down and shoot 25
threes and everything goes great. You have to grind it out against a good
team. That's part of what this tournament is all about. So I'm proud of these
guys because we had to do a lot of things today to win the game, and our
defense was fabulous, and then these two guys here were really, really good at
both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, Coach talked about your defense, just the effort
you guys put forth on that end of the court to shut down their guards and what
pride you take in playing a really defensive game.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think at the beginning we were a little lazy with our
press and kind of giving too many lay-ups and open threes. I think once we
slowed down, started forcing some tougher shots, making sure it was harder for
Brown and Greenwell to catch the ball, and just kind of got into our rhythm.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I think there was a lot of times during the games where we
were really, really good at our defense, and then there was a couple times
where we slipped a little bit, but I think overall, we did a great job,
especially keeping Brown and Greenwell, guarding them with one and a half
people, really staying on them. I think we really did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Can you address at the end of the first half there, kind of staying
close and scrapping and a couple threes and then you hit that jumper at the
end of the half and showed a lot of emotion after making that shot?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think the beginning of the game we got off to a quick
start, and then it was almost like we didn't expect them to start back like in
the Sweet 16. I think we were just trying to win the game a little too quickly
and all at once, so at the end of the second quarter, I think we just started
taking it one possession at a time and started building our momentum, so that
was kind of a good way to go into halftime.  
  
Q. Gabby, there were situations where they were making little mini-runs
at you, closed the gap a little bit. Is it up to you and Kia to keep things
calm on the court?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think so. You know, just kind of regaining control of
the tempo, make sure that they're playing at our pace and we're not playing at
theirs because when they start to go on those runs it can be really easy for
us to get caught up in it, then that's when things get out of control and they
start gaining more momentum. It's kind of us to regain it.  
  
Q. In her presser five minutes ago, Coach McCallie compared Gabby to
Maya Moore. What does that kind of comparison mean to you?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Maya Moore without the outside shot. So just throw that in
there. Make sure you know.  
  
I mean, it's a huge honor to even be in the same sentence as her. I think it's
-- I don't know, I would never call myself Maya Moore, but that is a huge
compliment.  
  
Q. What is you guys' mindset going into this game against South
Carolina?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I mean, the last time we played them, we kind of got out to a
really early run. I don't think any of us are expecting it to be that easy. We
know they're going to put up a fight. They don't -- A'ja doesn't want her
career to be over, college career to be over on Monday. We know they're going
to put up a fight, and it's going to be a battle.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, like Gabby said, it's the time of the year where
everyone is fighting for their season, so it's going to be a good game
regardless. So we know that they're going to come out with their A game and
we're going to come out with ours, and like she said, we're just going to play
as hard as we can and see what happens.  
  
Q. Gabby, having seen Lexie today and I know you've seen Jordin Canada a
few times, hoping you could give me a sense of what the differences are, the
challenges you're facing both offensively and defensively?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think Brown is a little more physical. She's a lot stronger
and can get her way to the basket in a more physical way, and I think Jordin
is just so quick, and is probably one of the best finishing guards, I think,
in the country. They both have great outside jump shots. I mean, especially
watching what Canada did last night against Texas was really impressive. So I
mean, they're similar but very different builds, very different games.  
  
Q. You've been in this situation numerous times. You control the X's and
O's. How do you control the emotion of your team going forward, being that a
lot of these top-ranked teams have been knocked off in the NCAA?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, that's one of the -- I think that's one of the
few things that the players can control is the emotional state that they're
in. I think sometimes players get a little -- you want players to be
emotional. This is an emotional game, and obviously you need that to be
successful. But I think sometimes players get overly worked up for a game, and
then they play a little too quickly, a little too fast, try to get too much
done in a short period of time. The only thing you can control is your
approach.  
  
Today we didn't make a lot of shots that we normally make, so you can't
control whether the ball goes in or not once you shoot it. But you can control
the approach that you take on in. And when you're dealing with kids at this
age, it's not the easiest thing in the world. So you've got to practice it all
year long. It's not something that you get to the tournament and you go, hey,
we need to be in control of our emotions. You've got to work on that from day
one.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit specifics about what you wanted to
accomplish against Lexie Brown today as far as limiting a certain number of
shots or where she was taking from -- I know you were switching like crazy.
Just kind of elaborate what your goals were with her today.  
GENO AURIEMMA: We get asked a lot about -- coaches do, anyway, about what's
the match-up going to be, who's going to guard so and so, as if one person is
going to have to guard that kid that entire game. I don't know any really good
player that can be guarded by one player. I mean, that's what makes them
really good. You need a lot of help.  
  
So we try to -- whether it's Lexie Brown or whether it's Asia Durr or any
other great guard that we've played against, it's your team that has to do a
good job defensively, so everybody has got to be aware where she's going and
just be on the same page. You know, when are we switching, which way are we
forcing her off ball screens. And it becomes a team thing rather than just
give her to, say, Kia, you guard her. I mean, that's a little much to ask.  
  
She's really good with the ball, and she's really, really -- like Gabby said,
she's a tough kid. When you've got to make kids work really, really hard, it
starts to wear down after a while, and I thought she had to work really hard
for the shots she did get.  
  
I thought our team just did a great job defensively on her.  
  
Q. Considering how close they played with you guys in the first quarter,
what type of adjustments did you have to make after that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I mean, there aren't really a lot of adjustments that you make
based on the score, you know. If we hold somebody to 14 points in a quarter,
we think we did a pretty good job. Then we try to figure out, all right, what
are we not doing on the offensive end that's causing us some problems. And
tonight it happened to be when do we make that wide-open shot that we got, off
the first pass, second pass or third pass. And when you're our guys, they get
very anxious. So if you're not careful, you come down, and it's one pass and a
shot. Well, that's great when they're going in. But sometimes you have to --
you have to wait a little bit and move the defense a little bit, so if the
shot doesn't go in, you have a chance to offensive rebound.  
  
And I thought we settled down a little bit in the second quarter, and I think
that was the big difference.  
  
Q. Geno, a lot was said about the Duke guards and their experience.
They're both fifth-year seniors. Can you address Gabby and Kia got an awful
lot done today, their experience and how that helped you today?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah. We're fortunate that our two seniors are two of the
better defensive players in the country, you know. So when we have really good
match-ups for them and we have a pretty good understanding of what we want to
do -- you know, we know we can count on those two every game. Gabby is going
to play great every game. I say that, and we have a game Monday night.  
  
But she plays at a certain level every big game, and Kia is just one of the
toughest competitors that we've ever had at Connecticut.  
  
I mean, knew going into the game that Duke wasn't going to be able to score a
lot of points on us. I mean, they averaged 60, I think, something like that,
during the tournament. We knew that we could do a good job defensively. We
were just worried about will we make enough shots. We made just enough, I
guess.  
  
Q. Sort of piggy-backing on that question a little bit, it's rare that
you've had seniors that are that good defensively and maybe not as good on the
offensive end. Talk about the two of them, just what they've brought to this
program for the last four years, they may not be the flashy players but doing
things you need to be successful.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, certainly there's nothing flashy about Kia. She's just a
hard-working basketball player, and she takes great pride in her conditioning
and the way she competes, and has been able to play on a lot of great teams
while she's been at Connecticut, and hasn't really had to be that offensive
player that a lot of our seniors end up being.  
  
And Gabby is -- you know, she's offensively -- I don't know what the word is.
She makes the easy plays, and she makes the really difficult plays, and I
don't know that there's anybody that has been able to do what she's done at
both ends of the floor: Make really difficult plays defensively look easy, and
then on the offensive end, just pass the ball to a guy that cuts for a lay-up.
I mean, that's easy, but some people make that look hard. She's unique in a
lot of ways.  
  
Q. I know you've talked about Lexie before, but after seeing her play
and her getting seven steals against you guys, how do you see her as a pro
prospect and playing at the next level?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I know everybody has been talking about her as being one
of the best guards in the country. I thought she was when she was a freshman
and a sophomore at Maryland. You know, I thought she was one of the better
players in America. And I'm sure the next level that she goes to she'll be
able to handle herself great. She'll have a little more help on the floor, you
know, so there will be more good players that can score, so that'll take some
of the pressure off of her to have to do everything in some ways.  
  
But all the things that guards do, I mean, she's good defensively, she gets
into the lane, and she's got great range on her threes. I would -- at that
next level that she's going to, there really is a tremendous need for really,
really, really good point guards, and I think she'll add to that for sure.  
  
Q. Given that your margins of victory have been in the media lately,
let's say that, somebody is going to look at this score and go, oh, my God,
they only won by 13, what happened? How would you respond to that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: That it's not as easy as we make it looks sometimes. This is
not easy stuff. This idea that, well, they have all the best players, of
course they should win every game by 40. I don't know, but that young lady
from Duke will probably verify this, but every single kid in Duke's starting
lineup was probably first-team All-American. So when you're playing against
pretty good players, you shouldn't be able to win by the numbers that we win
by sometimes, and certainly not in the NCAA Tournament. That makes no sense.
Not at this stage of the tournament anyway.  
  
But after the Quinnipiac game, somebody said, you know, it was just one of
those games, we had to grind it out. I don't know if people talk about
25-point games as a grind it out, but that's kind of where we are. That's the
world we've created, and we're just doing our part to make women's basketball
a little more competitive. You know? There's probably a couple dopes out there
that were waiting for a 60-point win so they could weigh in, right, so we're
just keeping them at bay for a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Leaonna Odom for Duke scored 22. What did you see out of her play
today?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I thought she did a terrific job of getting in the lane
and causing us a lot of problems. You know, we were spending so much time
getting out on Rebecca Greenwell and Lexie Brown that there were a lot of
places to dribble the ball to, and she took advantage of that.  
  
You're not going to beat a really good team like Duke and think that you're
going to take everything away from them. You're going to have to give up
something. You've just got to choose, okay, this is what we're willing to live
with, and she took advantage of it. She's really good around the basket. She's
really athletic. I'm sure she starts making jump shots, she'll be really,
really a handful for everybody. But I think she's -- she's only a sophomore,
right? Yeah, she's got a great future.  
  
And you know, it's nice to know that there's a defensive player or a great
athlete coming out of Mater Dei instead of just guys who shoot the ball, so I
was happy to see that. I was starting to lose my faith in Catholic schools.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 23, 2018

  

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

### [Tyasha Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33304)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by A'ja Wilson and Tyasha Harris. Congratulations
on getting to the Sweet Sixteen.  
  
Q. Ladies, you kind of were in this situation last year with a lower
seed getting to the Sweet Sixteen like Quinnipiac. What is the main difference
between Quinnipiac and Buffalo?  
A'JA WILSON: I think Buffalo's a lot more aggressive. Any shot's a good shot
to them. So that's kind of hard to defend because you never know when the
ball's going to go in the air.  
  
They're quicker, but I think something very similar is their energy. They're
just happy. They're happy like we all are just happy to be in this situation,
so I think that's always good, especially in March.  
  
But we all know anything can happen in March. So we have to be on our A-game
and play our best game, we can't slack off at all because they are a lower
seed. But at the same time, at this point we've all worked harder to get here.
So it doesn't really matter the number of the seed, it's just the team.  
  
Q. Earlier this week you were joking about how your call time and
shootaround was so early in the morning for Saturday. What has prep been like
this week? Are you guys getting up earlier just because you've known the game
time for a while, or how is the preparation for this game?  
TYASHA HARRIS: (Indiscernible) I think we'll have a good practice today, but
just being locked in and focused, you know, and the conversation that we have
with Coach.  
  
Q. A'ja, this is your last NCAA Tournament. Do you feel any pressure to
play your best game every single time you take the floor? And Coach mentioned
you guys don't have to play a perfect game, you just have to make more plays
than the other team. How does that help you handle your performance as well as
the team?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't think it's a lot of pressure. I think all four years I've
always tried to play my best game and play it like it's my last. That's how
you love the game of basketball, so you take it all in.  
  
So definitely I'm kind of sad this is my last NCAA Tournament. But I'm making
the most of it and enjoying the moment.  
  
When talking about Coach and when she says those things, I think it helps us
out. I think we get hard on ourselves when shots aren't falling or we're
making turnovers. But at the same time, if we're just making more plays and
having fun, it overlooks those situations and it really calms us down. We're
like, okay, of course we know we're not perfect. But at the same time, you
want to play perfect basketball for your coach. But we all know that's not
possible. So for her to have an understanding like that, it's a great feeling
for us. I think it relieves pressure off of us in those situations.  
  
Q. A'ja, just want to follow up, you were talking about fun, and you
mentioned Buffalo playing happy. Because you can get focused on you want to
take it seriously, but how important is that fun element and joy element to
remember in the game?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I think it's very important. Like you said, sometimes you
get really caught up in the moment and you kind of miss out on the moment that
you're in. I think all 16 teams are very, very lucky and blessed to be in this
situation. So we're definitely going to take it all in stride.  
  
But for us, it's very important for us. I take a lot of pride in just having
fun. Whether that's yelling, I don't care if I'm by myself, I'm still going to
yell. If I get an and one, I'm going to yell, and if my teammates get an and
one, I'm really going crazy. That's just part of the game. If you love the
game, I just love seeing my teammates succeed in any situation. Whether it's a
an assist from me, an assist from Ty, anybody. I think it really translates --
I was about to say transform -- I think that really translates into the
offense and defense of it all. So definitely having fun is a huge, huge deal
in this game of basketball.  
  
Q. Did I hear right, you have a 5 a.m. shootaround tomorrow
potentially?  
TYASHA HARRIS: 5:20.  
  
A'JA WILSON: That's when we have to be in the gym. Imagine what time we have
to wake up.  
  
Q. A'ja, obviously your relationship with Dawn is well known and you
joke around all the time. But four years now, how does it come together that
you are as close as you are? Every coach is close with the players, but you
guys have fun every time you're together it seems?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I think we really kind of formed this relationship, I
think, over the summer. She was my coach for USA, and it was kind of us one-
on-one. I think that's when we really became close. Coach Staley's a coach
that you can talk to her about everything, and that's what I really enjoy
about her. She's like my mom away from my mom, honestly. I guess we're all her
daughters, so she treats me like a daughter, I treat her like a mom. We argue
a lot. We probably argue more than we have fun. I'm glad she sees the have fun
part more. But we probably yell at each other. She fusses at me a lot. But who
wouldn't want that? She's a great person to be around, and I just love her as
a coach.  
  
Q. Do you feel that as each round continues and the competition gets
better, that you have to get better? Or is it just today and trying to beat
this team?  
TYASHA HARRIS: We actually talked about this earlier today, Coach was like
just focus on today, Friday, we're not even playing, just focus on details,
and once Saturday comes around, just focus on Buffalo. We're just going day by
day, game by game. I don't know if we have to get better. I think it's more
just playing in games (Indiscernible) and just enjoying every minute of the
game.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Ty had a great answer, good job. Gosh, they grow up so fast.  
  
Q. When you chose South Carolina four years ago, did you even have a
back-up school? Was UConn your second school or not? What was the choice? And
I'd like to ask you a follow-up.  
A'JA WILSON: I did not have a back-up school. My final schools were USC, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and UConn. That was my list, and they were all pretty
equal.  
  
I don't know. I really didn't have a back-up school. It was really just kind
of South Carolina was just the best fit for me, and my family, of course, had
a huge role in that. My parents helped me out in that situation.  
  
So, yeah, no back-up school, honestly. It wasn't like a number two. It wasn't
like choices between this and this.  
  
Q. Was it Dawn that attracted you most, or was it a chance to build your
state school that hadn't been a great power into a great power?  
A'JA WILSON: I think it was a mixture of both, honestly. Coach Staley was
recruiting me when I was on the bench. She didn't play at all. So I kind of
always recognized that she was always there for everything. She really went
out of her way. She wasn't really the coach that was like call me, text me,
blowing up my phone. So I kind of enjoyed that. Also just watching her change
the program around, I really wanted to be a part of something like that. It
just so happened to be in my hometown.  
  
Just to be a part of that and just to change a program and be in history books
now, it was something that I really wanted to be a part of. It's tough to
change a program around. Like Coach would always say, there have been SEC
teams that probably hated coming to South Carolina in the past. It was like,
man, we've got to go play South Carolina? There's not even a hundred people in
the stands. But now we're a powerhouse in the SEC. This is us.  
  
So just to be a part of it and just of the journey and just being in history
books like that, that was just a great thing.  
  
Q. You were saying you and Dawn argue. I know after games you guys do
have those many conversations. What are those conversations like, what are
they about, and how have they made you a better player?  
A'JA WILSON: They'll just be about anything. It could be me apologizing for a
bad play that I had or just saying you've got to double-double tonight. Or
stuff like that. It's just the many conversations that we have, I just take a
lot of pride in it because it's something special. It's very rare that you
come across a coach that just is so open like she is. She's really open and
honest with everything that she does. I just really enjoy those conversations,
because they're coming to an end, of course.  
  
Oh, my God, I'm going to miss her so much. But at the same time they really
help me out because she knows the game so well. She tells me in not just a
coaching forum but in a parent forum where I can really understand that. And I
really appreciate those things that she's done, taking the time and talking to
me. Because it's kind of tough. Sometimes I feel pressure, but she definitely
is always there to kind of say it's going to be okay.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

### [Faith Suggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35183)

### [Lexie Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26967)

### [Rebecca Greenwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28343)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the student-athletes for Duke University.
Joining us are Lexie Brown, Rebecca Greenwell, and Faith Suggs.
Congratulations on advancing to Albany.  
  
Q. Rebecca, you're pretty well known around here for a shot you made
three years ago against Albany in the first round NCAA game. I was wondering
what you remember about that shot, and how much you remember about that
game?  
REBECCA GREENWELL: Yeah, I remember that game pretty clearly. My freshman year
we played a tough Albany team. We battled with them all game long. I got lucky
towards the end and hit a three-pointer that put us up one and we ended up
getting the game.  
  
But that was such a fun environment to play in, especially as a freshman. So
if something ever happened like that tomorrow, I'd be all about it. But I'm
looking forward to tomorrow. We have a tough game coming up. We have to be
focused and ready to give it our all.  
  
Q. Faith, for you, obviously the toughest opponent you can come up with
tomorrow. What is the mindset going into the game on Saturday?  
FAITH SUGGS: It's just another game. Another day to get better for our team.
I'm really excited along with Coach P. and our teammates to get this
challenge, and hopefully make a good outcome. But each day is about getting
better with our team, and hopefully playing six games.  
  
Q. Lexie, obviously defense is a key for you. What do you do
individually and collectively as a team to try to slow down your opponent?
Tomorrow, in particular, but in general also.  
LEXIE BROWN: The main things we have to do is get our game plan. Every game is
different. We've got to defend different players differently. We just have to
lock in, do what we practice all week. Specifically for tomorrow just know
personnel, know tendencies, a lot of ball pressure. Just try to get them into
their rhythm offensively. Their offense is so fluid. So anyway we can
interrupt that would be helpful for us.  
  
Q. Rebecca and Lexie, I asked Crystal Dangerfield do you look at it as a
challenge playing against a back court tandem and tremendous experience you
have and talent, and she said without question. What do you guys think you
have to try to take away from them? You can't take away everything, but if you
needed to take away one thing, is there something in your mind that may be
more so than something else? Rebecca?  
REBECCA GREENWELL: Sure, they have a lot of weapons obviously. We just need to
have more possessions than them, that's going to be key. Also, defensively
just getting stops. It's going to be hard to focus on just one player, so I
think it's going to have to be a team effort.  
  
Defensively we have to have great ball pressure, try to get some deflections
and really be able to control the tempo out there.  
  
LEXIE BROWN: I think another important part for tomorrow is to up their
transition game, and that's going to rely solely on how we take care of the
ball. I know they're a solid defensive team, and they sometimes tend to wait
for another team to kind of give them the ball. So if we can our live ball
turnovers or slide ball turnovers to be more specific, then that will shut
down a large part of their offense.  
  
Q. Your team has depth, ten players with ten minutes or more on average
per game, even though you've been bitten by the injury bug a little bit. How
important is a depth against a team like Connecticut?  
FAITH SUGGS: I think it's very important. You never know what's going to
happen in the game. To have bench players come off and give energy and provide
defense and rebounding is really key to winning a game.  
  
Q. Rebecca or Lexie, you're going to face a player tomorrow in Azura
that you know quite a bit about. Will that be strange or will you make an
attempt to talk to her after the game?  
REBECCA GREENWELL: I'll attempt to talk to her after the game. I don't have
any bad blood with Azura. She's a great person, a great player. We know her
game really well, so I think that will play into our favor a little bit. We
know her tendencies. But we don't have bad blood. So I'm excited about the
opportunity to play her.  
  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, there is no bad blood. I didn't play with her at all. So
there is nothing really to have to feel any type of way about. She's been
having an amazing season. It's been really nice to see her thriving in her new
environment. And it's going to be a lot of fun playing against her tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

## March 23, 2018

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Albany, New York.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could share your thoughts.  
  
DAWN STALEY: Excited to be a part of the Sweet Sixteen, playing Buffalo, and
doing it here in Albany. We got in yesterday, city seems pretty popping,
though I haven't been a part of it, but just coming from the hotel to here and
coming into the arena, just getting really excited about what's going to take
place tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. Is it kind of a tough adjustment to be playing so early tomorrow
morning at 11:30 instead of an afternoon or evening tip?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we had a few days in between having a late start on Sunday
and now. We practiced a little bit earlier yesterday just to make sure that
our bodies can adjust to playing early. Once you know, and we knew in plenty
of time to psychologically prepare for it. So I think our players, they just
said today, it seems like a really long time since we've last played. So
they're champing at the bit to get out there and play a little bit.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Buffalo, and are they a team that can play with a
little less pressure because they're the lower seed?  
DAWN STALEY: I think from sitting where I sit and you sit, we could probably
say yes. But this is about history for them. It's about us continuing to make
history for our program, and it's a bid to go to the Elite Eight. I think we
all want to continue to play. We all have aspirations of winning the National
Championship.  
  
When the ball is tipped up, I think it's anybody's game at that point. I don't
think our kids are playing with any extra pressure. I think the pressure is
what you put on yourselves. Obviously we hope to put a little bit of pressure
on Buffalo with our defense and ability to kind of control the tempo of the
game.  
  
Q. With all the top remaining teams having tall post players, do you
think that may be the determining factor of who will eventually win the
National Championship, is how the bigs play? Could you also talk about the
evolution of Azura Stevens' game from being a perimeter player to an inside
player?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I would say this, in order for you to win and continue to
win in this tournament, it's guard play. There is somebody that has to get to
post the ball. Obviously, they do have to dominate when they get it. But I
think with probably any team it's determined by what the guards do. Not
necessarily shoot the ball. They have to facilitate, and they have to
understand what's a good shot, what's a bad shot, where the ball needs to go.
So the decision-makers are the guards. For post players to have great games
you definitely have to put them in positions to be great and to be dominant.  
  
As far as Azura, I think Azura has shown that she can play on the perimeter. I
think what Geno and his staff are doing is they're showing her where the
higher percentage shots are. I don't think they're taking that ability to
shoot from the outside away. They're just adding to what she already does. I
think it's a great segue into having a great career and some longevity after
her college career is over. So in the pros, she'll be more of a complete,
versatile player.  
  
Q. In terms of straight seeding, you're counting the position last year
where Quinnipiac was a lower seed that got to the Sweet Sixteen, how different
is Buffalo from Quinnipiac where they basically get a game in their
backyard?  
DAWN STALEY: I think Buffalo was more, probably, your traditional style, where
they have their point guard running the show and distributing and facilitating
and scoring. Quinnipiac is more of a system, like a positionless team. I think
Buffalo has great guard play. They play extremely well together. They make the
extra pass. They know exactly where they want their shots to come from, and
they're just relentless in transition, going to the boards.  
  
So they're a lot different makeup than Quinnipiac. But we're looking forward
to it. We're looking forward to the challenge. We're looking forward to
playing them in somewhat a home-court advantage. It should be an exciting
game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about A'ja's development through her career, and more
specifically this year and what she's added to her game this season?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, with A'ja, every year she's gotten better and better, just
from a skill set standpoint, from a leadership standpoint, and for
understanding what she needs to do, when she needs to do it.  
  
I think with A'ja, we've just kind of expanded her ability to bring the ball
up the floor, just put the ball in her hands. Obviously, she was surrounded by
a lot of great players in her first three years. Now you're seeing her play,
take her game to a higher level knowing that she doesn't have as much talent
as she was surrounded by in previous years. Good players make adjustments, and
A'ja's made an adjustment to carrying our basketball team and doing it at a
very high level.  
  
Q. Two questions, first big picture. There are two 11 seeds still
playing. You coached for a while at a mid-major school, Temple. Is it the
natural development that there are some other teams, mid-majors advancing this
far? Second question, Champ didn't make the trip for you, any reason you
didn't feel like bringing him up here to Albany?  
DAWN STALEY: First question is I was at a mid-major. The struggle for me was
to make the tournament and then advance through at least the second weekend of
the tournament, and you need talent. You definitely need talent. I think ten
years ago when I was at Temple, you really couldn't get the talent. I think
mid-majors are getting more talent at their respective schools by way of just
recruiting a little bit better, recruiting a little bit differently, and also
just getting the players that could play your style of play as a coach. And
you're seeing some 11 seeds and maybe watch, you know, Central Michigan and
Buffalo. If you pay attention to them, they play a certain level above other
mid-majors, in that they spread you out, they're super selfless, they play
well together, and they're well-coached. When you have those combination
working for you, you advance. It's not by surprise.  
  
As far as Champ, Champ is a warm-climate puppy, so that's why he didn't make
the trip.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if you know, but have you gotten a pretty good response
from ticket sales, people from Columbia who might be coming or USC fans in
this area that might be coming to the game?  
DAWN STALEY: I have not. I think on Twitter I got a couple people that said
they got their tickets. A couple people are from this area. We just need a few
of them because they can get pretty loud no matter where they are. So we
should have a good amount of people in the stands cheering for us.  
  
Q. The fact that you have these higher seeds, 11 seeds coming in and
knocking off people, is that good for the women's game, maybe creating more
excitement? Like we've seen with the men's tournament every year, a lot of
people like to watch for the upsets?  
DAWN STALEY: I think it is good for the game. I think anytime that you can
show some parity in our game on any level it's always good. The fact that
Buffalo and Central Michigan are here, playing in the Sweet Sixteen, gives
other coaches hope to keep on coaching. It gives them a little boost of energy
to know that it could happen. It can happen. You can get out of the first week
and on to the second week and compete at the highest level.  
  
So I'm happy for the parity that's very apparent in the NCAA Tournament on our
side, and the men's side as well.  
  
Q. To follow-up on Doug's question. You said mid-majors were recruiting
a little differently. Could you sort of expound on that a little bit,
please?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, if you look at Buffalo, they have a lot of international
players on their roster. Sometimes you have to go that route in order for you
to get some quality players. Because when it's all said and done, you think
it's a fair game, whether you're coaching in a Power Five or a mid-major, but
when it comes down to it, it's not. To be able to play for a Power Five
school, it's always greater in most people's eyes.  
  
So some coaches prefer to go a different route, and it's worked for them.
Obviously, if we could recruit internationally. I would welcome international
players on my team as well. It seems like that's the route we need to go,
because we keep losing out as well, even being a Power Five school.

## March 23, 2018

  

### [Stephanie Reid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35179)

### [Cassie Oursler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35180)

### [Cierra Dillard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35181)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hey, guys, for all three of you, has this sunk in at all that you're
in the Sweet Sixteen now, a chance to move on farther, you're playing four
hours or so from Buffalo, and you probably have a lot of fans tomorrow that
you're still playing basketball in the middle of March or end of March?  
CASSIE OUSLER: Yesterday I was going through the sports channels, and there's
no women's games playing. So I think it hit me then also because there are no
games to be played except the ones that we're about to play. So I think that's
pretty cool.  
  
CIERRA DILLARD: Well, a little bit, I think after the games of USF and Florida
State kind of hits you what you've done. But Coach does an amazing job of
keeping your mind focused on what's going on next. We've just been locked in
on playing South Carolina, and focus in on Buffalo. Focus in on what we're
going to do to prepare for the game.  
  
STEPHANIE REID: Yeah, after the last win at Florida State, the next morning
you kind of wake up and you wonder if it's still a dream. Then it kind of
sinks in over the week. Now we're really focused on the game tomorrow. We're
really excited to be here. It's really exciting, obviously. But we've got to
get focused and compete at this stage.  
  
Q. Stephanie, Felisha was talking about how when recruiting
international players, the assistant coaches weren't always truthful with what
Buffalo was and how cold it was and snowy. So I was just wondering if you had
a funny story about that. And, two, how did you learn about Buffalo and what
convinced you to decide to go to school there?  
STEPHANIE REID: Well, firstly on the weather, Coach Cherie. It doesn't snow in
Buffalo, apparently. Yeah, fun fact for the world. Doesn't snow in Buffalo. So
that was a shell shocker itself. Like in December, like late December so I got
on the plane in Melbourne, and it was 100°, then I got off at 0 with one pair
of Brown Ugg boots that I still wear to this day that are salt stained to the
core.  
  
It was funny to get off the plane, and everything was white. When my family
came, they came in they came in February that year, and they didn't know it
was a lake, they thought it was ice. Because they didn't know there was
actually water underneath it. I didn't know that until when did it start
snowing, April, maybe? So that was a bit of a culture shock.  
  
But I learned about Buffalo. My coach back home, he knew about Cherie
personally, it's kind of cold there, but never told me anything like this.
When I got in contact with Coach Cherie, I loved how she was, with her
exclamation points, 100,000 per message. It's just that excitement. When I met
Coach Jack, every word that came out of her mouth just seemed so inspiring,
and I never met anyone like that. Buffalo was the only school I wanted to come
to.  
  
When I found out that maybe it was possible I wasn't coming here, I didn't
want to go anymore. I had planned my life out in Melbourne. I was like I'm
going to work. I'll play at this league, and I'll just play in Australia.
Because I didn't want to go anywhere else. When I finally found out on my way
to school, I had to pull over and tell Coach Cherie. She said, you know, we
want you to come with your best friend, Courtney. I said yes, without even
telling my mom. I couldn't hold it in. I was on a FaceTime call or Skype call
with Jack at school, and my teachers were wondering what I was doing. I had to
tell them this was a bit bigger than school at that point. And I said yes. I
didn't even tell me family. I told them after I verbally committed that that's
what I was doing.  
  
This place is too good for my eyes. Now it's a destination. So I'm pretty
grateful I made the opportunity to come here.  
  
Q. Cierra, Coach shared with us the Red Lobster story from last night.
Mostly that you were laughing. That's such a part of your group, but can you
talk about how that impacts the way that you guys play and the way that you're
able to come to these big moments and not be fazed? How has that helped you?  
CIERRA DILLARD: I think it's just staying true to who we are. Like Coach said,
we're a quirky group of girls, and we like to have fun and embrace everything.
Yes, Red Lobster is my favorite restaurant. When she said we were going there,
it kind of took me, overwhelming, because I just love Red Lobster. You know,
just spending another day with my sisters and having -- continuing the time
that we've had and along with knowing that a lot of other teams don't get the
time to share like this, it makes me amazed, and it makes me happy. It showed
-- I think it shows the chemistry that we have off the floor.  
  
That's what got us here today on the floor, because of the chemistry that we
have. You know, we make jokes and we're going to laugh and embrace the moment,
but on the floor, we're serious. Coach knows that it's fun, and that's what we
go by. That's what she instills in this program. We just embrace every moment.
We love to have fun, we love to laugh, and we love to enjoy each other's
company. Like we said, a lot of us are not from the same country.  
  
So these are some of the last weeks we're going to be spending together? Of
course not, because we're all going to -- ten years from now we're all going
to have a little team trip, something like that. Or maybe meet at Red Lobster
again (laughing).  
  
So just having fun. Just embracing the moment. Embracing this amazing
opportunity, because we don't take this lightly.  
  
Q. Cassie, obviously there is no secret anymore about A'ja Wilson's
game. Everybody has seen her play at this point. What is the game plan to try
to stop her from having a huge day?  
CASSIE OUSLER: Just she's going to get hers. We do know that she's an amazing
player. Our goal is just to make every single shot difficult. Just defend like
I've never defended before. Obviously our guards are going to make the guard
passing even harder for her to get the ball. It's just really going to be a
group effort. Yeah, just make everything hard for her. That's the goal.  
  
Q. Cierra, you just have to beat the defending National Championship and
perhaps UConn. Are you guys so loose that, you know, this moment's not too big
for you? There is a sense that you have nothing to lose and you're playing
with house money and all that. What's lying ahead of you here?  
CIERRA DILLARD: I think it's the same mentality we've been using the last two
weeks. I think going into the USF game we were considered the underdogs. Going
into the Florida State game, we were considered the underdogs. Going into the
South Carolina game, we were considered the underdogs. So I think it's just
natural -- a natural feel that we are the underdogs and we are going to
continue to focus on Buffalo. I think that's all we can do and all we will do.
It's been working so far, just focusing on Buffalo. Focusing on our game plan
and staying true to who we are. We can't look forward to any other game
besides the game that we're going to play on Saturday. Just focusing on what
we do and focusing on how we play and our identity is what we're going to do
and what we have to do.  
  
Q. Cassie, you mentioned early in the week you've seen South Carolina
play a lot, and I imagine these other teams. How do you go about watching
these teams as a fan a month ago to now being a competitor?  
CASSIE OUSLER: Our coaches really prepared us for that. As soon as we finished
last game, we were ready for this next game. So instead of watching it for
entertainment, you figure out their tendencies. Once you see their specific
tendencies, it's like a whole different game rather than, wow, that's a good
move. You know exactly what she's probably going to do every time.  
  
So just looking at it from that perspective is a whole different viewpoint,
and our coaches just really prepare us well for that.  
  
Q. Steph, going back to the MAAC tournament, you were asked about the
MAAC team selections and maybe being slighted by not being a First-Teamer, but
now being an 11 seed and being considered a, quote/unquote, Cinderella in this
year's NCAA Tournament, it's not like you guys are winning these games by
luck. You're blowing folks out. Do you feel slighted at all to still be
considered an underdog in this tournament with how well you guys have played
all season and even deep into the tournament?  
STEPHANIE REID: I think we honestly embrace the underdog title. You know, if
the prognosis for our games is always that we're going to lose one, whatever,
and then we go in and beat them by 20, that's exciting. We like to be
considered the underdog, because you go in with no expectations. People that
have the expectations we're going to win, we just believe in ourselves. That's
something we've embraced from the first day of June running. Coach Jack's
always instilled in us that no one needs to believe in us but ourselves. We're
a foxhole. We're 14 deep. Our coaches believe in us, our athletic trainers,
our media staff. Everyone in our foxhole believes in us.  
  
We've embraced the underdog. The reigning national champions, they have all
the pressure on them. We don't have that pressure. We just getting to in and
play free, and that's pretty exciting. That's what we've been doing the last
two games. There was no expectation for us to win. We like that. That's okay.
You can join us. We welcome you with open arms. After every win, we welcome
the fans that want to come and support us now. We're not going to turn people
away. If you didn't believe in us at first, that's okay. But we're going to
keep proving every single day that we're a team that this country should
believe in. We are a team that fights for everything we have. We lock our 14
horns and we go in and we fight.  
  
That underdog title is kind of fun, because you get to do that without that
expectation. You just go in and do your thing. You do it your best, and leave
everything out there every single game. We all know every game could be our
last for our seniors. We leave everything out there every single time. I mean,
we love doing that.  
  
Give us the underdog title. We love it. We'll own it. We'll embrace it, and
we'll fight for 40 minutes and see where that takes us.  
  
Q. Cassie, Coach suggested that you guys would try a tickling approach
on A'ja Wilson. Will there be any tickling, and what stands out to you about
South Carolina?  
CIERRA DILLARD: She said what?  
  
CASSIE OUSLER: Yeah, we're going to tickle her (laughing). Well, if she's
getting her points, we'll try anything. As a whole they stand out because, I
mean, they won a National Championship last year, so that's a given. They do
have a talented bunch, but I think we match up pretty well with them, and
we're going to fight like we always have been and give it all we've got.  
  
STEPHANIE REID: She said tickling.  
  
Q. Your family, especially your brothers, have been very entertaining
all year. We've heard them be vocal encouragement for you. But with that high-
character and loud voice, what's the conversation been from them the last
couple days leading up into this one?  
CIERRA DILLARD: Well, it's been still loud and vocal. We have a family group
chat, and it's been blowing up. It's been crazy with messages, and it's
actually during the game where I don't see it until the end where I just have
300 messages after the game. But it's weird because they're all together. So I
don't know why they're texting the message when it's a watch party at our
house together.  
  
But, no, I have an amazing, amazing support staff. My family's been everything
to me. They're the reason why I play basketball. They're the reason why I
actually came back to New York and I'm able to play in this amazing program,
Buffalo. Not just my family and my immediate family and my brothers and my
sister and my mom and my godbrothers and all those, but Buffalo is a family
itself. We have an amazing support cast. It's overwhelming sometimes because
of how much support we get from the town of Buffalo. How much we get from
around the country who are Buffalo alums. Buffalo has an unbelievable fan of
people that support us without a doubt. It's great to be able to be a part of
that family. It's great to have that support cast where they love the fight
that you give. They love the success. They love the amazing people that you
are. That's what it is. I think we are able to be who we are as young ladies,
as basketball players, as student-athletes. Whoever we are, they love that. I
think that's what helped us get here to the Sweet Sixteen.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 23, 2018

  

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kia Nurse and Gabby Williams. Questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, what do you know about Duke so far? Their a
talented back court, but what have you seen on film from them? You haven't
played them in a few years now. You haven't played Duke since I think 2014?  
KIA NURSE: Obviously their back court is very talented. They find each other
extremely well, and their three-point range is obviously deep and effective. I
think they do a great job with their zone. They're long, they try to use their
length to their advantage, so it will be interesting.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, they have two really, really talented guards who
are going to be hard to stop offensively. But defensively they like to push
the ball. They're really aggressive at the trap, so we're going to have to
really take care of it tomorrow.  
  
Q. I asked Coach this, 25 straight years that UConn's made it to the
Sweet Sixteen, you guys in the last four. Buffalo's here for the first time
ever in school history. Do you appreciate that other schools don't have the
same success that you guys have, and sort of take it for granted outside of
UConn that you guys will make the Sweet Sixteen every year, but to see some of
the new faces out there that you may not play or know that have their first
experiences, does it make it fun to see other teams getting there besides you
guys?  
KIA NURSE: I think it's a great experience, the Sweet Sixteen itself, and just
being here. The environment is always fun. I think for teams that are coming
here for the first time, when we were freshmen and we were in this building
for our first time, it's kind of eye-opening and it's amazing. You are
grateful for the experience and you appreciate it.  
  
In terms of us getting here as much as we do, I think that's just a testament
to Coach Auriemma and Coach Dailey what they've done, the legacy they've
built, and the people who came before us to give us the opportunity and build
us into what it is.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, she pretty much said it all. But it is cool for us to
see teams be here for the first time. Think it's also something for the teams
who are at the top. It's a reminder that this is anyone's game and anything
can happen. So I guess it kind of humbles you a little bit that you've got to
kind of watch your back.  
  
Q. You two ladies were here three years ago in Albany. I believe you
beat Texas and Dayton. I just wondered what your memories might be from having
been here three years ago.  
KIA NURSE: Well, the Dayton game was a memory in itself. Obviously they played
a really good first half. Then we played Texas and we played them really well
and we came out, and that was exciting. I think the end part of it is you get
a trip to the Final Four. If you can have that as many times as you can,
that's probably the best experience that you want, and hopefully that's how
this one ends as well.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I don't know. I blocked out like 90%. I just remember the
excitement of the tournament because at that point we had only heard talk
about it. You think you were ready for it after everything you've been
through, you've played 30-plus games, and there is nothing really to prepare
you for this atmosphere.  
  
Q. Kia, I think if you were to stop anybody randomly on the street in
any city across the country and ask who won the National Championship in
women's college basketball last year, 99 out of 100 would say UConn if they
didn't follow the game closely enough. With that not being the case, how do
you guys resist that complacency that maybe comes with the expectations of
this program?  
KIA NURSE: Well, I think every single time we end up in this situation, and
every time March comes around, we hope that throughout the year, throughout
the season we've prepared ourselves in every way possible. Seen as many
defensive executions that we need to. How do we create as many strengths for
ourselves and how do we hide our weaknesses as much as we can.  
  
And we just have a great leadership of our coaching staff who will not ever
let us be complacent in anything that we do. Whether that be the practice that
we have that day, the game that we're playing. And even if we win by a lot,
it's not a complacent win if we didn't play up to our own standards.  
  
I think that's something that prepares us for this tournament, prepares us to
go into every game with the understanding it's not a cakewalk, it never will
be, and we have to earn everything that we get.  
  
Q. Talking about complacency and avoiding that, how does it help to see
a team like Buffalo? They've never won a game in a tournament ever, and
they're kind of happy to be here. But did that kind of wake you up a little
bit to not take it for granted?  
KIA NURSE: Absolutely. I think one of the best things about having a team like
Buffalo in this region is that everybody has to wake up and smell the roses.
Like Gabby said, this is anybody's tournament. On any given day, if you come
out and don't play your top game or play with respect towards your opponents,
anything can happen. And Buffalo has shown that time and time again throughout
this tournament.  
  
Q. Gabby, your coach was just talking about Central Michigan and
Buffalo, if 11 seeds win a supposed mid-major, he thinks that's good for the
women's game. How do you see that?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think it's good for the game, too, because, like I
said before, it kind of makes the top teams kind of watch their back a little
bit. You don't realize that it's not just about your talent, but it's about
the way you compete, but it's about the way you work. You have more teams with
the combination of talent and work ethic, and I think those mid-major teams
winning games like that reminds the whole country of that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the excitement three or four years ago. Does it feel
like the last four years have flown by? I mean, coming full circle, coming
back here for a Sweet Sixteen, wow, it feels like 20 years ago it was last
year, but it's like, wow, it was just last year we were here doing the same
thing?  
KIA NURSE: Every day I look back and think that freshman year was yesterday,
and I'm still kind of learning the ropes, but not anymore. This has been full
circle. Coming back here, coming back to this facility. Different hotel this
time, but definitely things have flown by so fast, and I think that's why when
we're sitting in the circle before practice, you can look at the freshmen and
you can see, oh, you know, this year's gone by really quickly, and you feel
like you have forever in freshman year.  
  
Then you get to your senior year and it goes by in the blink of an eye. Those
four years are the best four years of your life. But you have to understand
that they go by so quickly that there's no point in wasting any time.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 23, 2018

  

### [Joanne McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34727)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on making it to Albany and the regional.
Would you give an opening statement, please.  
  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Yeah, just our team is a special team. It's been an
amazing ride thus far. Really had great trip to Athens playing two very, very
different teams. Belmont was a very tough team for us for a lot of reasons,
because we play from the outside in. Then Georgia was tough in their own right
because they played more from the inside out.  
  
Then, of course, Connecticut does just a little bit of everything. So we're
excited to be here. Got a great group. I'm proud of the team in terms of
handling our injuries. We've lost three point guards, Kyra Lambert's out,
Haley Gorecki is out, and Mikayla Boykin is out. It was devastating to lose
Haley and Mikayla because those came at different times of the year.  
  
I also want to say that we are the only team I've ever known to have three
graduate students in the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. That is a Top 10
business school. And Bego, Lexie and Becca have had to navigate the waters, an
incredible academic experience while being pushed on the court as well.  
  
So we've had a lot of interesting challenges this year, and obviously a great
challenge of playing the best team in the country by far. But we're excited
and happy to be in Albany.  
  
Q. If you could talk about the teams you faced being very different. In
the UConn game, Saint Francis stayed true to who they are and was a difficult
game. Quinnipiac changed their approach to control tempo and kept it
competitive. So are you somewhere where you think, listen, this is who we are,
but we have to tweak things a little bit? Will that be your approach?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: I think you have to -- I played Connecticut before, I
think once beating them. I think I'm 1-9 or something pathetic like that. But
I will say that you have to respect the talent and ability of the team you're
playing. And I mean respect it properly so you can plan properly. I would
never try to run with them. They're basically a WNBA team. Sometimes I wonder
if they're getting ready for that season, the way they played this year.  
  
No, possessional basketball is incredibly important. To me it's just playing
basketball the way it should be played. Move the ball around, look for your
best opportunity, and take it and get after it. But certainly I would suspect
the ball would have to be in our possession longer in order to be successful
against a team with so many great players that can do so many great things.  
  
So I'm a coach that believes in doing whatever it takes. We played all man
against Belmont. Every minute of that game was man, because we couldn't find
these shooters that were everywhere, I mean, just absolutely everywhere. We
played match-ups against Georgia for different reasons. I believe you put your
student-athletes in a position to be successful, regardless. I think it's
important to have a program philosophy. I respect that. But you play to win.
You play to win. You play to be successful. You've got to handle that, and
best I can tell, possessions are extremely critical. Live ball turnovers might
be the stat of the game of this game, live ball turnovers, and certainly
rebounding. We rebounded okay in the first couple of games, but nothing to
brag about, and I think that will be substantial as well.  
  
Q. When Azura transferred, you made remarks critical of UConn accepting
transfers. Do you still feel that way?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: I did not make those remarks. That's what the media wrote.  
  
Q. So you were misquoted?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Oh, completely. Completely. Completely. I guess that
happens sometimes. All I'll say is I'm very proud of Azura. What she's done is
amazing. She's a very, very good player, and she's going to be a big headache
for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk a bit about how her game has evolved over the last
couple years?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Oh, gosh, stronger. She just works hard on her game. She's
a very committed student-athlete. What I can see from film and that type of
thing is her inside game. Her presence on the inside, what she's doing now in
terms of paint points and paint opportunities is very, very significant, not
to mention her defensive presence.  
  
She's a special, special player. She's doing a very hard thing. It's hard to
be new in any program, and I think it's hard to be new in a program with such
great stature.  
  
Q. Can you address what you've gotten out of Odom in the postseason.
She's averaged about ten points a game during the regular season. She's over
20 during the NCAA Tournament. Where has she shown the most growth?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Nay is again, sophomore, developing, getting better and
better by every game. I think she's beginning to understand how she can
control the game at times with her shot selection, with her rebounding, with
her defense. I think it's just a matter of experience. She's constantly
gaining more experience. She plays with a great deal of confidence. And I
think at times she's deferred a little bit in a way that's not good to players
like Lexie and Becca, and I think she's learned that's not a good idea.  
  
If we're going to play at the highest level, everyone's got to bring their
A-game, their specialty, bring what they can do. And I think that's what she's
really getting into is bringing what she can do. I'm excited for her, because
she's very, very athletic, and might be one of the most athletic players in
the country. Certainly you'd have to argue she was in that category.  
  
Q. You talked about how you have three grad students on the team and how
impressed you are with them. How about as players, how much does it help you
to have a back court that has that much experience as well as talent?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Oh, they're terrific. Fifth-years -- the thing about it
that's interesting is Becca is the true fifth-year. She's been in our program
that long. And she's gotten better every single year, whether she's coming off
the pass, off the bounce, or defense or rebounding. When we're at our best,
Becca is rebounding. She's a terrific rebounding guard. So to coach her and be
with her all of the years has been phenomenal and just an amazing experience
because of her competitive nature.  
  
You feel a little bit cheated with Lexie, because as she came in, you had the
sit out year. This is really only her sophomore year relative to playing in
our program. So you feel like, oh, you get pretty excited about it. We've
tried to -- she's been amazing in terms of what she's done in such a short
period of time. I'm really struck by her beating Alana Beard's single season
steal record, because we all know who Alana Beard is, and that's pretty
impressive for her to be the kind of All-American who plays on both sides of
the ball like Lexie does.  
  
So, yes, I've been spoiled with some tremendous back court mates, Splish-
Splash, whatever they call them, that's a media thing. But to me they're just
really two good players and they work very, very hard, and they're both
competitive. I know they're going to be ultimately challenged. Connecticut
defense is not talked about as much as it should be because there are so many
other things to talk about. It's a terrific defense, and it's going to be a
big problem. The way they go after Lexie and Becca, trapping, denying, things
of that nature.  
  
So we're going to have to be very patient, and Lexie and Becca are going to
have to be patient too and allow us to work things a little bit and not try to
force things, because the defense is excellent.  
  
Q. As a basketball fan, how fun would it be to be at this regional given
the schools that are here and seeing the match-ups that we see?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Oh, gosh, I'm sort of partial to women's basketball
overall. I think it's a fantastic time of year in women's basketball, and
there are so many great teams.  
  
I have to give a shout out to Felisha at Buffalo because she was one of my
assistant coaches back in the day. She helped recruit the team that we went to
the Final Four with at Michigan State. So to see Buffalo get here under
Felisha's leadership has been a remarkable thing. I've just been talking to
her the whole time, and here we are at the same regional. I was kind of hoping
I'd bump into her, but I guess we have different schedules.  
  
South Carolina has recently been so fabulous, they won their title, and it's
just amazing what they've done. Of course Connecticut's the best there's ever
been. So it's an interesting regional. I just think for a lot of reasons
people would want to come out and see the games and support women's
basketball.  
  
Q. This might be a bit of a reach. I know it's a different year and
different players, but can you look at, say, tape from last year's Mississippi
State-UConn game and say, you know, with the talent we have, here are a couple
things that they did, we might be able to exploit these types of things?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Fair question. Tough answer for me because we can't create
what they created. The full-court pressure that they created is a very good
thing and something that is pretty important, I think, if you're going to be
successful against Connecticut. Just that sheer, in-your-body pressure. The
taller player, I'm forgetting her name right now, the center for Mississippi
State, having that kind of height to be a presence around the rim, there are
some really key qualities there.  
  
Vic is an amazing coach, and he's done incredible things. If you look at his
journey from what happened to -- I mean, it's an incredible story, really. I
think I couldn't look at that film and totally get a lot relative to things
that we do. Some ideas, yes. What's evident when you talk to anybody that's
been successful against Connecticut ever, and it's a pretty small club by the
way -- talking to Tara or Vic, it all goes back to turnovers, possessions,
ball control, playing precisely. That's obviously a very important piece of
it.  
  
To their credit they try to get you out of that, and they run and do the
things that they do. You know, it's great for women's basketball to have that
level of excellence. It really is. It takes it to another level.  
  
I know the whole John Wooden thing and all the championships and all that. But
I think it makes people see what the game can be at the highest level. I think
for the rest of us, you're motivated by that to see how you can keep chipping
away.  
  
I'm sure Vic in that first meeting never thought he'd beat Connecticut, right?
I got to believe that's what he was thinking at that time. So my point being
that it's really, really -- you can't have the moments that we had last year,
that incredible game, you can't have those kind of moments without a team
being superior and dominant, and that's exactly what's happened. Of course
Connecticut continues to be and they have been this year, and nobody's really
done much of anything against them this year. I mean, that's what makes those
moments possible. I think fans get excited about that. I think it's great for
women's basketball. For us it's the ultimate challenge for us. We've got to
really come together with a special team game.  
  
Q. This is 25 straight years for UConn in the regionals. How impressive
is that? Is it good or bad for women's basketball if they're so dominant?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Well, that's incredibly impressive. Not really surprising,
but very, very impressive just because their success has been so
extraordinary. I think it's excellent for women's basketball. I think the only
thing we have trouble with is where we play, the neutral court versus the home
court versus the regional. Because we've got to draw fans. I think eventually
that would be the next step. Our tournament is being more neutral where we
play.  
  
But right now we've been trying to grow that, and that hasn't totally happened
yet. But I think it's pretty extraordinary what they've done.  
  
Again, I'm not surprised. I've seen Connecticut through the years. Even when I
was at Maine we played the team that made their first run. I thought we did
well in that game, FYI, by the way, for the record, way back in that Maine
game. I was also part of -- I saw the beginning of Connecticut when I was at
Auburn. Auburn years ago -- years ago Auburn came up to play, and that was
before Connecticut was really hitting the scene, and we lost that game. It was
a very big game. It was prior to all the big stuff that Connecticut did. So
I've kind of seen this and been able to witness this whole thing. It's
remarkable.  
  
Again, there is no question it's great for women's basketball. That would be a
very odd belief system. The better you are, the better things are, the more
challenge there is, the more competition, the more you're trying to aspire to
the higher level, yeah, that's better. That's certainly better in life. It's
something you welcome. I mean, it's just something you welcome is to get that
opportunity to play against that kind of team.  
  
I guess I answered your question. Yes, pretty impressive. I'm sure they'll do
many impressive things in the future.  
  
Q. I was there when you showed up at Auburn to do your interview and did
it when they were in the Final Four.  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: That's right. Gosh, Mel, we're getting old, man. We're
getting so old.  
  
Q. You just talked about the neutral court, the home court. Do you favor
what Debbie Antonelli has been pushing about playing a whole Sweet Sixteen out
in Las Vegas?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Well, I don't know. Gosh, I'm not a Vegas girl. I don't
know much about Vegas. But I will say it's hard because when you can get the
amount of fans that will be here tomorrow, how do you walk away from that?
That's a really, really good thing. But ultimately you'd want to be on neutral
something. I don't know if it's Vegas. I don't know if it's Tampa. I don't
know what it is. But ultimately you'd like to do that because that's where the
equal opportunity comes in.  
  
Excellence is excellence, and there is no argument to the excellence, but
that's where it gets a little bit tough is the environment.  
  
I don't know when women's basketball is ready to move to that, and there's
been a lot of discussions about that. Perhaps they will, and I think that
would probably make the ultimate tournament to have that kind of setting. If
we could draw the fans, get the support, and forward women's basketball from
that.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 23, 2018

  

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on advancing. If you, please, provide
some opening remarks and then we'll open it up to questions.  
  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Absolutely. As God as head of my life, I'm grateful to
be here today and be with a great group of young women to tell our story. I
just want to give a shout out to our commissioner of the MAAC, thanking him
for all he's done for our conference and letting him know that we're with him
in his time of sadness.  
  
Q. We all know what A'ja Wilson is capable of and how good of a player
she is. What is the game plan for trying to stop her from having a huge
game?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Tickle her (laughing). Everyone's tried everything else,
and she still averages a high double-double. So our plan is someone go low,
someone go high, but nevertheless, we're into the tickle motion. You can't
stop someone as good as A'ja. Let's be honest. I'm on a committee, and I voted
for her to be Player of the Year.  
  
It's a wonderful thing. It's a team sport. It's going to take all five of them
for 40 minutes. But she's a special player. No disrespect to what she's
capable of doing. We are not going to stop her. We are comfortable
understanding that, as we were comfortable understanding that we were not
going to stop the young lady at Florida State. But if we can all show up and
do our small part, we can have a chance to have success in the game for 40
minutes.  
  
South Carolina is a special team. We have to play them ten times. I've got to
lean on the fact that they can probably get us by nine of them. At 11:30,
we're going to find out how much we can do against one of the best teams in
the country.  
  
Q. All you have to do is beat the defending champions and then perhaps
UConn. How do you convince your players that this moment is not too big for
them?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: You know, before South Carolina became a national
champion, there's a young lady that was head coach at Temple who hoped that
she could become something significant as well. She took over a team that
wasn't already established, and she built something from nothing to something.  
  
In order for us to find our way, we have to take steps. It's a big step, for
sure. One thing that we're not going to do is put our focus on South Carolina.
We've not put our focus on any team that we've ever played. We're going to put
our focus on the foxhole that we're in, the 14 young ladies that believe in
our vision. We're going to fight really hard to make Buffalo proud, make our
university proud, make our families proud. Most importantly to leave it out
there so when we look in the mirror we can make ourselves proud.  
  
Q. You just mentioned having the opportunity to tell your story. How
would you sum up your story?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: You know, fight. I come from a mother who raised five
children, retired, making 36,000, she shared with us that we have no choice
but to be significant in this world.  
  
She did everything with a smile. She tithes every single week, and for some
reason she found money to tithe and always have enough money for our family.
So if she can do it and become, we have no choice, because at least we have
four other people, my brothers and my sisters. So nothing is too great for us
because we saw a lady become, and she raised five great children.  
  
So as big as the mountain may seem, all we do is ask God for the strength to
continue to take the step. We've got the strength to take the step, we can
keep climbing. So that's what we do. We do it every day. We do it through
success. We had great success. My college coach is in the back right there and
she pushed us to a strong foundation. We do it through failure. Last job I
failed. You just keep moving. If you give us strength to take the step, I'm
going to keep trying to climb.  
  
Q. Earlier today Dawn was talking about how mid-majors have been
recruiting better and recruiting more creatively. She talked about you
recruiting international players. Can you sort of talk about that strategy and
how that may be necessary when you're trying to recruit against these Power
Five schools?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: You know, I never looked at myself as a mid-major coach
or mid-major team. I looked at myself as a coach going after people that want
to tell their story. I thought about that when I was an assistant coach at
Boston College and Syracuse and Michigan State. When I was the head coach at
Hofstra and Indiana, I never told them that we're in the mecca of a conference
or team at Indiana, nor did I tell them that Hofstra was not as big as a St.
John's in the state of New York. We just promoted what we had. We were in New
York. We were in the mecca of the world.  
  
At Buffalo I thought we were a hidden jewel, a program that had no success in
women's basketball, and we could be the first to make it happen. Are you
interested? Will you try to come and help? And the young ladies that said yes
were clearly young ladies that didn't have a lot of people saying we want you
too. So together we became. We fought.  
  
We have a system we call CAB. I didn't want to bring players into our program
without understanding their character, their academics, and their academics
will precede their basketball. And we thought we could coach people that had
character and academics, even if they didn't have strength in basketball. We
thought we had a great coaching staff in Cherie Hogg and K.C. Carter and
Kristen Sharkey and Karin Moss that we can develop. Those young ladies said
yes. They stayed in the fight. They kept fighting with us, and here we are.  
  
Q. Did you tell international players where Buffalo was and what it was
about?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, I told the truth. I have a coach that isn't always
so truthful. Her name is Cherie Hogg Cordoba. She was telling the Australians
that it didn't snow. They had two choices. They could have looked and saw that
there was snow everywhere. No, she didn't say it didn't snow. She said it
didn't snow a lot. Which Stephanie and Courtney came for an entire winter.
They never knew we had lakes and little ponds behind the dormitories.  
  
Then I think around June when the snow melted, they were like we didn't even
know it was winter out here. I tell you, I'm good, but you've got somebody
that's on the fence about truth on my staff, and I'm not going to say her name
out loud (laughing).  
  
Q. I know you and Dawn go way back. Do you have any good, funny stories
or whatever from back in the day?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I don't. But it's an honor to see you, sir, you've done
so much for women's basketball. But to me Dawn has always been really serious.
I don't know her personally, per se. I just know she's a fighter. I know I
watched her as a player when she was at Virginia. Consistently get to the
Final Four. I know that she's a ferocious competitor and winner. When you're
that way all the time, I might have never saw her laughing. I just saw her
compete and trying to win.  
  
Q. With the big moment, I know we talk about your stories being fight,
but you've also talked about being goofy and really enjoying and having fun.
How do you balance? How do you balance that this is a big moment, but you also
want to have fun and bring the little bit of swagger you guys have?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I think our kids call it quirky. They're so smart. They
come up with these words that's like sophisticated, but it's just silly and
we're quirky.  
  
We laugh hard, we laugh a lot. But they absolutely understand once we cross
that blue line on our court, we pay attention totally to what their dreams
are. They want to win. They want to tell their story. They want to become WNBA
players. They want to play overseas.  
  
They say I have two personalities. I'm mom, fun, and loving, but something
happens to me and us when we cross that line and we recognize that we're in
the battlefield for something bigger than basketball. It's our story to be
told. So it's just kind of something that happens. Sometimes it doesn't
happen, and we just right away get on the line, let's go, let's run.  
  
Sometimes we go through drills and they're not going hard enough, I just jump
out there and show them this is how hard we're going to go. And at 51, in my
mind I'm still thinking that I'm that college player that played for Coach
Jacobs, you know, and making some Hall of Fame stuff. My body is telling me
no. I'm up there trying -- this is how you make the lay-up. And it won't go
in. But they get the point that I'm trying. If it's going to have to be, it's
going to be me. If it's not going to be you, you want me to come out there and
do it? Because I will. So they get that piece. It's kind of weird because they
thought I was coming after the person and just come after the player
relentlessly. I've just been that way all my life. I brought in 14 players
that understand this quirkiness.  
  
Q. Coach, what has the reception been back in Buffalo from the city and
the school? And are you expecting tomorrow to pretty much be a home game for
you guys?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I don't want this to be taken any other way, but this is
just who I am. Everywhere I go I think we're in a home game. We're in Florida,
we're in Arizona, you have to think you belong there. If you don't, you are
going to be a visitor. If you're a visitor, you can be asked to leave at any
time. So we go there with that understanding.  
  
It was really nice to see the governor tweet out that he's proud of what we're
doing. It was really nice to see our mayor get excited. It's really amazing to
see the Buffalonians. I mean, we know how crazy our Buffalonians can be when
they go after those Buffalo Bills and those Sabres. Have that same group of
blue-collar people really be proud of what we're doing. It's just so humbling,
so exciting, and we want to leave it out there for them to really continue
that pride.  
  
Q. After you win two games in the tournament as an 11 seed, does the
confidence start building, or is it like when is this going to end kind of
deal? What is going through your team's minds as they prepare for the Sweet
Sixteen? Most people probably didn't think you'd be here.  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, we always thought we were going to be here, we
just never got here ever since I started coaching 28 years ago. That's the
expectation. That's the mindset. So many coaches that really have the same
kind of mindset, we were blessed to take this another step.  
  
But I'm not smart enough to know about 11, and 2, and 3, and 5, those numbers.
That doesn't mean anything when the ball goes in the air. If that's the case,
somebody forgot to tell Loyola, and somebody forgot to tell Jim Boeheim. So we
say, you know, in 40 minutes anything can happen. We want something magical to
happen. We've been creating magic since June. Our oneness, our sisterhood, our
fight, our stubbornness to quit. The coach pushed so hard, and if you get on
the barrel and let it all out of your body. I say you, go see the trainer? No,
Coach, I need to finish this champion, we've got 12 more to go. In order to be
a champion, you've got to do 15 of them. I'm at 12, and I cannot stop. I have
to do it all over again the next day.  
  
So the fight has been predicated since June. To think that it's a weirdness
that we're winning, we've been winning in preseason. We've been winning in the
summer. The expectation is to win all the time. If you don't score more points
than the next team, I'm hoping that the win could be something that you look
in the mirror and say, you know what? I left it out there. There was nothing
else left. Therefore, we continue to win.  
  
Q. My question is following up on that. When you're hearing people
calling you guys a Cinderella team, you're not a Cinderella team because
you're not winning at the buzzer. The way you've handled yourself. Does it irk
you when you hear you're being called that? But you're not. You've proven
you're one of the top teams in the country. How does that make you feel?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: It makes me feel like they saw me dance before. They
know I can dance, and I think that's a compliment, you know? I'm teasing.  
  
I don't let anybody's expectations of who we are become our significance. It
never has before. I've never looked at other people's success and said, oh,
man, I'm so jealous. Nor did I say there's never going to be a time that we're
not going to become, because the work ethic never changed.  
  
So we don't care. No disrespect to somebody that thinks this is a fluke. We
don't really get excited where they say, yeah, we should have done this. We
just stay locked into our sisterhood and our family. I have 14 great kids that
I'm just trying to extend it as long as I can. To have this opportunity here
late in March, to be with these young ladies and to sit in that restaurant
last night. They can go anywhere they want to have dinner. These young ladies
want to go to Red Lobster, a chain restaurant. And they sat in that restaurant
and they laughed so hard that Cierra and Stephanie are reduced to tears.
Everybody just started laughing. Nobody knows what they're laughing at to this
day. I said, Coach, take a picture of this.  
  
These are the moments that mean more to me than a ball ever going in the hole.
They're never going to remember how far they went. I don't know how far we
went at Syracuse, but I do know 30 years later we still get together with our
coach in the summer and go on vacation and tell stories that I know, for a
fact, never happened. But we tell them so much it's now like they did.  
  
That's what I pray for this team, is that they create these stories and these
fun times. Things that are more important than the ball going in the hole to
remember for the rest of their lives.  
  
Q. I know you talked a lot this week about the MAAC and you guys at
Central Michigan. Is it sort of the hidden gem that no one outside of women's
basketball knew what the MAAC was, and here we are having two teams still
playing and they're doing well? They're not just winning at the buzzer, but
they're winning handily on the road?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: We lost to Central Michigan in the championship game,
and some people thought that we blew it. I'm like, you need to guard Presley
for 40 minutes, the kid that can hit half-court shots. And they have Frost who
can rebound with anybody in the country. She can jump about five inches off
the ground. She's six feet at best. Her timing is the best I've ever seen, and
that is the strength I really love to my heart. I'm like I just hope that
people can see what we went through. I think that Sue would say the same thing
about a few of my players and the things that we've done.  
  
To have this opportunity where the world can see us and what we really are
about in the MAAC Conference, including Toledos, the Ball States, Ohio a
couple years ago who got left out who were 26 and something and didn't get an
at-large bid four years ago. I am so grateful that he chose us to tell the
story. Because we're not really just fighting for Buffalo and saying look how
great Buffalo is. And she's not just talking about Central Michigan. It's an
entire MAAC Conference. We have a guy named Ricky Stokes who is our
commissioner for women's and men's basketball who played at Virginia, a big-
time player. For him to be in the MAAC for so many years, he saw something a
lot earlier than we did. I think now I pray that everyone would just take
teams and just say this team's RPI, this body of work, this boom, boom, boom,
they belong because that team without a name on it, oh, it's Buffalo. Oh, it's
Central Michigan. Oh, it's the MAAC. We're not there yet, for sure, because I
know names got to be in so women can get the respect and the fan base and all
that stuff. But in this crazy dream of mine, I still dream that you can just
by the creative work, not the complexion of the name or the conference.  
  
We're on our way. We're just not there yet.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 23, 2018

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could begin with an opening statement.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Obviously there's not a lot of teams left in the tournament.
We're like everybody else, we want to get started tomorrow, and everybody
hopes to be playing again next weekend.  
  
But there's a lot to do before now and then. I think we've got a really good
mix of teams here. It's a really interesting mix. And it's good to be back in
Albany, and I'm anxious to get going.  
  
Q. This regional, you've been 25 straight years to the Sweet Sixteen. I
know you watch the men's side a little bit, and there's chaos, so to speak.
Does it make you appreciate it more that you're able to do this year in and
year out, to get this far and further as opposed to -- seen the upsets that
have maybe gone on other parts of the bracket or maybe the men's side?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, yeah. I mean, I am surprised. After all, we have the best
players. Every All-American that's ever played high school basketball has come
to Connecticut, they don't go play anywhere else. So we're just fortunate
there is no competition out there for us. Sometimes we just feel like we
should just skip the first two rounds and go right to the regionals. It's so
easy, right?  
  
But it isn't until somebody reminds you and says how long you guys have done
this and you just look back and -- yeah. It's even more of a reminder how
important it is or how much it means, because each year you see teams stumble
a little bit. You have to think at some point in 25 years you would stumble
once or twice.  
  
But it's been a remarkable run through a lot of different players and a lot of
different scenarios and at a lot of different places. When I watched the rest
of the tournament, Harris as well a couple years ago when we got to the Final
Four and there were three teams that had never been there, I thought that that
might be a culmination of this is what we've been talking about. This has been
the growth of the game. To go from 1991, when we made the Final Four, we were
the first team from north of the Mason-Dixon line to make the Final Four. To
now you've got what's happening today. I just think that's remarkable. It's
been a lot of fun to be a part of.  
  
Q. Obviously with Azura, I was looking up, she had 16 in the game at
Hartford when you guys beat Duke. You said after the Quinnipiac game -- I
think Karl asked if you would speak to her about this, and you said yes. Have
you had a chance to speak with her about the game and just try to get her to
keep her emotions down?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No, not in any kind of depth or anything. I think she's been
gone there from there. This is her second year out. I would think it's natural
that you would have some kind of emotional connection. But my message was
simply I don't think they're going to feel bad if they beat us, and you're
going to do whatever you need to do to help us win. There's plenty of time for
all the other stuff, but not when the game starts.  
  
Now watching her practice the last couple days I don't see any of that, but
you never know.  
  
I said, hey, they've been really good since you left, so maybe they're happy
that you left. So I try to do whatever I can to get her going.  
  
Q. Your impressions of Duke scorers Lexie Brown and Rebecca Greenwell?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Probably the same impressions that everybody else has. Two
really, really good kids. I've had a chance to be around Rebecca Greenwell a
little more than Lexie Brown. But having played against her when she was in
Maryland, you watch them play, and they're really, really good. They do a lot.
They're the heart and soul of that team. They play well together, they
complement each other great. They're able to sometimes single-handedly win
games for them.  
  
I think it's going to be a challenge for us to contain both of them, and we're
going to have to just pick one of them. But they're both really, really good,
and I'm looking forward to seeing them up close.  
  
Q. Having two fifth-year seniors as your guards, how much does that play
into what they're able to do?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, there's no substitute for experience. I mean, obviously
talent, but the fact that they've played a lot of basketball, they've been in
a lot of different circumstances. Yeah, you're not dealing with inexperience
here. You're dealing with talented kids who understand what they have to do,
and there's nothing easy about what's in store for our guards tomorrow.  
  
Q. Napheesa has obviously raised the level of her play in the NCAA
Tournament. Odom has doubled her scoring average from the regular season. Do
you see similarities in what they've been asked to do for their teams and how
they've been able to elevate the level of their play?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I do. I've seen a big change in a Napheesa. They're
really good players. They know when it's time. They know. They're able to
summon up something that a lot of players can't. I think everybody on Duke's
team knows that Lexie Brown and Rebecca Greenwell have to play great for them
to win. Everybody on our team knows we need great performance from Napheesa if
we want to do what we set out to do.  
  
So the really, really good players, they know what time of the year it is, and
they come ready.  
  
Q. You've talked -- I think it was in January maybe after the victory at
South Carolina, you said we keep meeting moments along the way, we'll be ready
for the big moments. These are kind of the big moments now with the season
funneling down. Where's your team mentally and emotionally with the urgency of
the situation, the importance of these games?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think you always think that you're prepared. I mean, you
always think you're ready. We certainly had a lot of games where we've had to
do some things that tested us. We've also had a lot of games where we weren't,
but I think the real test is always why you're doing it.  
  
Coaching a team and playing in the NCAA Tournament is kind of like investing.
They give you perspectives and you have to make sure you read the fine print
at the bottom, you know. What's it say, past performance is no guarantee of
future success, right?  
  
So no matter what you did in November, December, January, you still have to be
able to perform tomorrow. Whether you're ready to do that, you don't know. All
you can do is go through your schedule, do what you have to do. So, so far
we've answered every challenge, and I've got to believe that, win or lose
tomorrow, there's no guarantees, obviously, but it won't be because we're not
ready for it.  
  
Q. The remarks that Joanne made a couple years ago when Azura came to
UConn, is that something you'd bring up with her or not or just let it
slide?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't think the comments that she made were, in a way, in any
form derogatory or anti-Connecticut or anti-Azura. I never took them that way.
I think what she was saying was there was some validity to that. I think she
was saying it's unusual for a team like Connecticut to have someone transfer
in, and it's true.  
  
So I just thought of it as that's just the changing world that we live in.  
  
We've had kids move on to other schools from our place, and there's lots of
kids that move on from other schools, and this one just happened to be a
really, really good player that wanted to make a change. So I didn't take it
in a bad way, no. Not at all.  
  
Q. Geno, we haven't seen you since Jamelle got fired. I was just
wondering if you could talk about your reaction to that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Obviously I was surprised. I mean, if you were going to fire
her, you should have fired her two years ago when they were able. Don't wait
until they build the program back up and finish fourth, the highest they've
ever done and the best they've ever done, and then say, okay, we're going to
bring in somebody new now that they have a pretty good team to coach.  
  
I just thought it was bad timing. And there's a lot of deeper issues that are
going on there, believe me, that go beyond someone getting let go.  
  
Losing your job in this profession, that's expected, you know? If you're not
any good and people want to get rid of you, that's fine. But the way it was
done and when it was done, given the circumstances -- but then again, knowing
what I know, I'm not surprised.

### [Victoria Vivians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28376)

### [Teaira McCowan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30397)

### [Morgan William](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30442)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Mississippi State - 89, UCLA - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will introduce the Mississippi State Bulldogs, Vic Schaefer,
Morgan William, Teaira McCowan and Victoria Vivians. Coach, your quick opening
statement?  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: You're going to have to wait until I finish circling and boxing!
First of all, I want to congratulate UCLA on a tremendous year. I've been up
two nights with visions of Jordin Canada and 25 running up and down the floor.
Monique Billings, the other night, we played those guys two years ago in a
scrimmage in October. Cori has done such a tremendous job with that program.
Those kids have developed so much.  
  
We really challenged our kids. We talked about transition defense and the
importance of rebounding. I challenged all our kids. We outrebounded them
39-33 and they absolutely outrebounded Texas the other night and UCLA played
so hard. But giving glory to God for No. 36. 126, is that right, Brock? 125?
They have now lived all year with a bullseye on their back. That's hard to do,
y'all. Then they added another bullseye as they went through the year
undefeated.  
  
We've had a very difficult regional, and these kids are special. This entire
team has been very, very special. To be able to handle that night-in and
night-out in our conference is just extremely hard. Then to do it with our
postseason, with the teams we have had to go against, I just take my hat off
to them. They're really incredible. To be where they are, to do what they've
done is really, really difficult to do.  
  
I just can't be more proud of 'em. I was really worried today, y'all. I got
four seniors and I don't have the words, whenever this comes to an end, I
don't have the words. These seniors have meant so much to our program, to my
career, to me personally. I'm so glad the good Lord gave us another week.
These kids have worked their hearts out, and they deserve it. I think they
will be on a mission. We talked about UCLA being on a mission today, and I was
proud of what Victoria said the other day, our vision, our focus, our
intensity hasn't changed since last year. We're even more intent on trying to
do what we didn't get done a year ago.  
  
Proud of our kids today. How about our fans? Made this arena really special
for both teams. Great environment for TV as well as for both teams. Again,
boy, it was a special day for these Bulldogs.  
  
Q. Victoria, I noticed that you guys came together with about 20 seconds
left and walked arm-in-arm up the floor. I don't know if that's a thing you
guys are done all year but where did it start from and what was that feeling
like to walk arm-in-arm with 20 seconds left when the game was over?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: In the huddle the ref was like we need to go ahead and go,
and I was like, y'all, let's form a line and walk and talk. Because they were
trying to hustle us up and get to the free throw line so I was like, let's
walk and talk.  
  
Q. Ladies, congratulations. Victoria, can you talk in the fourth quarter
about the isolation plays, how you wanted to attack and particularly that
backdoor play where they found you on the bounce pass for the second time
after the first one didn't work out so well?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Coach called the play and he asked me were they hugging me
and I said, yeah, they were trying to deny me the ball and if they do that the
backdoor is going to be wide open the first time was my fault because I didn't
go through and the second time it worked fine. Coach was saying they couldn't
guard me. Just go try to get a bucket and lay it up, and fouled, scored both.  
  
Q. Jordin Canada stole the ball and had that layup and made it a 6-point
game then you guys call a timeout. What did you say to each other?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: That we were fine and we didn't need to get rattled. We've
been in that situation before where we kind of got rattled. We didn't get out
of our bodies and get rattled. So we were fine.  
  
Q. Teaira, could you talk about how your early season schedule prepared
you for your postseason? Specifically how a competition like the Cancun
Challenge where you play multiple games in one city prepares you for a
situation like this weekend where you have to play two games in one city and
for Columbus where you could possibly play two again?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: This season we faced everything that we're going to see in the
NCAA Tournament where is we're tied or it's a close game or it's a blowout,
but we still have to execute. This game, yeah, it was a close game but at the
same time we maintained what we were supposed to do. Our mindsets were we're
good, we got this. So we didn't veer off from anything that we haven't done
all season.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you address the fact that whenever they got close there
was always a big shot that the team hit and maybe that kind of builds off of
what Teaira was saying about you guys didn't get rattled, didn't get out of
your body. I liked that. That was good. Talk about the poise and the
confidence you guys had in answering their runs?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Every time you get a huddle, it is four seniors in there and
then it is T. And we were talking about gotta execute this play and then get a
stop. So stop score, stop score. We executed plays. Went back down and got a
stop, and I felt like we kept building and kept repeating and that helped us.  
  
Q. Teaira, did you see Coach's leap there and pump fist after you
offensive rebounded Morgan's miss and put it back?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I didn't see it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Good luck next week. Questions for
Coach?  
  
Q. Congrats, Vic. You've talked about how good this team is offensively
and it's interesting if you go back two years you guys had a rough game
offensively against UConn. Talk about the evolution with a lot of the same
kids because Cori complimented just how good your execution was today.  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, we scored 38 points that day. That was kind of rough!  
  
Yeah, we're different. We're just different because of our skill set, because
we've got kids that can stretch it and shoot it and you've got the big piece
inside where you just can't double on her. If you do, we can play through her,
Michelle. A lot of times you can play to a big kid and heats it, it either
goes in or that's it. We can play through T, and she is really good at that.
You double her, well, she is going to find where it came from. She has had
enough experience now, she has seen every defense you can possibly do to her.  
  
Now you have Morgan who has decided she is excited about scoring and that adds
a dimension that we probably haven't had consistently all year. I thought Jazz
came off the bench and gave us huge minutes and did a great job. We're
fortunate at point guard to have that kind of point guard play; but Teaira, 23
and 21. I mean, the kid is incredible. I just thought you all four of those
seniors, Blair makes two big threes today, makes a big one when they had cut
it to 6. They leave her open. She knocked it down from 23 or 4. That was a big
shot. That's where they were coming off of T. They came off that set, left her
open and she made 'em pay.  
  
This group is hard to guard. There is no question about it. I've walked off
the floor sometimes and said I see what it's like to have Golden State because
this group, they can all score it.  
  
Q. Going off of Blair, early in the third quarter she may have let
Japreece get off a couple of threes. I saw her tell her politely she needed to
get over that. What was that like to see her respond the way she did?  
VIC SCHAEFER: That kid, she is just special. She's done it all her career. She
takes coaching, probably takes it a little harder from the coach than the rest
of 'em. She is a pro. She knew it, and it was an adjustment she needed to make
and I need to do remind her of that. Don't worry. I'll get chastised more from
that from my fans when I get home than anything else that happened today. They
don't like it when I coach her like that.  
  
Q. Vic, your coach stayed on until halfway through the second quarter.
You must have liked what you saw. What did you like about your team?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Evaluation was on our board today as one of the thoughts so now
I'm being evaluated for my coat, how long it stays on. I just had a real
confidence today y'all. I had a devotional this morning before I went to
shootaround. The TV crew made a comment this is the most chill we have seen
you. I just had a confidence in this group. I was very concerned that could,
because I respect UCLA and Cori Close so much and her staff, you're always
concerned about, you know, what if it is the last one.  
  
But I didn't feel that was going to happen today. I just had a real confidence
today that I got the better team. I just felt like they were ready to play as
they have been all year long.  
  
We got beat by a really good team back in the championship game of our
tournament. They played better than us. But it wasn't that we weren't ready to
play or any of that. It just wasn't our day, but these kids have been ready
every game. All year long. I just really felt good about the day. I really
felt good when our kids wanted to walk to half court and shake their hand and
they turned and went to the locker room. Our kids, we usually like going and
shaking hands at the half court and apparently that wasn't the protocol today
in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So that kind of rubbed our kids wrong to be honest with you. I don't know if
that was planned or that was something that was supposed to happen but our
kids noticed it.  
  
Q. Blair hit three big three-pointers. How critical do you feel like
those were and how is she able to come in the clutch like that? Seems like
when you need her to she makes those big shots.  
VIC SCHAEFER: She did. Again, just happy for her. I know how hard she has
worked to be in the position she's in. To see her take advantage and be
prepared. That kid has worked her tail off all her career for that moment. To
see her be able to answer the bell in that moment, it's just really rewarding
as a coach. It wouldn't matter if she is my daughter or not, you got kids that
have worked and prepared to be in that moment; again, she is the poster child
for everything that's right with kids staying the course and competing and
fighting and getting better, not fleeing. I know her parents. Her daddy is
really proud of her. Because I know had he has rebounded a lot for her over
the course of his life and he's proud of her for making those shots as well
and they were big ones. The one where they cut it to 6 was really a big one,
no doubt about it. She made that one from the top of the key and she made one
from right over in front of the bench.  
  
Q. The SEC is ripe with competition?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, it's a nightmare.  
  
Q. Some of the most skilled teams in the league and the AP top-25 poll,
7 teams including your own were listed. How does that in-season competition
that you guys face game-in and game-out help prepare you for the games like
this in the tournament?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't think there is any question when you go through that
gauntlet you're prepared for anything that comes down the pipe. I am glad you
brought that up about the AP. We lose 1 game to the number 8 in the country
and we drop from 2 to 4. Our kids noticed that. We lost one game. Is there
anybody else in the country that's lost one game, but we dropped to 4. Again,
hey, no problem but I think our kids wear that a little bit.  
  
Again, the league is absolutely a nightmare but that's the fishbowl we choose
to live in. When you do that, you gotta get ready night-in and night-out.
That's the thing that's really remarkable about this team. Their average
margin of victory in 16 SEC games is 24. Last year when we went 13-3. It was
13 and I thought that was off the chart.  
  
This team's average margin of victory in our league was 24, which is
unbelievable. Again, I think that's how special this group's been every night.
Every night they've been ready. Hard to do.  
  
Q. After the game you went over and gave the band high fives. What has
their support meant to you and your team in this tournament?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Our band and our cheering squad and all our fans, they're the
best. Look, if we weren't here today that arena would have been empty. It's
incredible how our fan support has grown and mushroomed to where it is today.
We love 'em. We cherish them and appreciate them so much. They've come to
Kansas City and by the way this has been a great place, so many good people
that have really gone out of their way to make this a wonderful place for the
regional.  
  
They've come here. They've spent three, four days, spent their money, taken
off work; and so for me, I'm cognizant of that. I would hate to walk out of
that arena tonight not only for my kids but I hate to look at any of my fans
in the eye and know that we lost that game, because I know what it means to
them.  
  
You know, when we lost the one game you would have thought the sky was falling
in Starkville. Just the way it is right now. But for us right now, in answer
to your question, is they are very special, all of 'em are, fans, band, cheer,
the whole nine yards. Again, it's not like that in most places. Mississippi
State is very special for women's basketball. It's also very special in a
broad term for our fan base. They are passionate. I'm telling you, passionate
about their university. It's what makes it so, so special and a great place to
be.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations and good luck at the Final Four.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

## March 25, 2018

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

### [Kelli Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28324)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Mississippi State - 89, UCLA - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the UCLA Bruins, head Coach, Cori Close,
her senior athletes, No. 3, Jordin Canada, No. 23, Kelli Hayes and No. 25
Monique Billings. Coach, your thoughts?  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think I've said this before, but this is the hardest time
to put words to what's in my heart. It's just really difficult to, on the one
hand get through your disappointment because we believed and expected to win
and at the same time there is no way to reflect the depth and pride of my love
to the young women to my left as well as our entire program.  
  
It's hard right now because we are so sad. I didn't want to stop coaching
them. I wanted to have a chance to coach this group for another day but the
reality is that they have had a historic season. I've asked them all year to
have an "I will" mentality and to put the team above themselves and at every
turn they have made the right choice.  
  
I love 'em. I'm proud of 'em, and there is nothing that could happen today.
Mississippi State is a great team; they executed at critical times, and I give
them a lot of credit. They're a really good basketball team. I couldn't be
prouder of the foundation, the culture, the way they have represented
themselves on the court as amazing basketball players but as students, as
givers in our community. They have set the tone for what UCLA is all about.  
  
Q. Maybe each of you, you've all commented at various points that you
came to UCLA to start a legacy. Do you feel like you've done that and maybe
you could talk about that?  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, of course, we have definitely left a legacy here at UCLA,
just the things that we have accomplished over these past four years is
something that we will always remember.  
  
Regardless of the results tonight, that overpowers this loss. As much as it
hurts we can't really overlook all the things that we've done for this program
and that's why we came here. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm just proud
that I was able to start something, create something with the girls to the
left of me and the players that I played with, past and present. It's truly
special and something that I can't take for granted and I will always
remember.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I definitely agree with Jordin. I would say we put our
mark and stamp on this program. We created a legacy that was already here but
we added on to that and built. For my teammates in the years to come I know
that knave a lot more to keep building toward. I think we set the foundation
for that and they have good things to look forward to.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: The word "legacy" is a powerful word. Most people think
of it as banners and winning tournaments. Yeah, those are great. But legacy is
the person that you've become and the growth that you've made and our team has
done that and we've done that. The past four years we've been here we built
that legacy with our program and ourselves, it's that's part of a legacy. It's
not always wins and losses. It's how you impacted people on and off court and
we've done that. You can see little boys and little girls looking at us and
adults, and how we have impacted these lives. That is part of our legacy that
we've left on people. It's really exciting to see that with these girls.  
  
Q. Jordin, can you address Mississippi State's defense, particularly in
the first half when you fell behind by 16 and the second part of that, how you
kept attacking and didn't let up in cutting it to six late in the game?  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I mean, Mississippi State's game plan was to pressure us
and try and get the ball out of my hands and Japreece's hands and I thought in
the beginning of the game we kinda had a little lull where we couldn't run
anything or execute on the defensive end. In the second half we calmed down a
little bit and we knew that we were going to get back in this game if we just
continued to attack and run our offense and run the floor and push the tempo.
I thought we did a good job, better job, in the second half of doing that.  
  
Q. Monique, I was wondering if you could tell me what going up against
Teaira McCowan was like? I know it was a big focus coming in and on the boards
she was a bull and a handful tonight?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Yeah, she is a monster and I knew that coming into the game.
It's tough playing against really big girls but I fought. I tried to do the
best that I could and tried to take her off the boards and tried to box her
out and I definitely had my hands full. It was a challenge. Much respect to
her.  
  
Q. Jordin, I know you won't use it as an excuse but can you describe
what happened to your elbow and how it was feeling in the second half; and for
Kelli, after the game I saw you comforting Michaela. What did you tell her and
what was that moment like for you?  
JORDIN CANADA: I remember going to the basket and my arm got caught in between
two girls. It was obviously very painful but our athletic trainer and our
doctor think it's a sprained elbow. Just have to go back next week and get
MRIs and x-rays and make sure that's exactly what it is or better. I didn't
try to let that affect me. I tried to play as hard as I could in the second
half and gave it all I have.  
  
KELLI HAYES: I think it was Lauryn. I was just comforting her and you see
upperclassmen and you want to represent our program well and we have a close
relationship with Lauryn and I know she wanted it bad for herself and for us
and I know it is hard up there and as an upperclassman it being my last
collegiate game I wanted to feel for her. But at the end of the day I'm going
to be there for her and I wanted to be there for her as a role model.  
  
Q. Jordin, you guys went, I think, six and a half minutes there to start
the second quarter, missed late shots and weren't able to get a bucket to get
down. I thought you were getting quality looks. You were getting in the paint
and not able to convert. Is that how you felt? Was Mississippi State playing
good defense or just a little unlucky there?  
JORDIN CANADA: I thought we executed our plays pretty well. We just couldn't
make shots. At the end of the day that's what it comes down to. In the second
half we stayed poised and didn't let they are pressure get to us, but we
couldn't make that's and that's what it came down to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Schaefer didn't make a lot of shots tonight, but she had two 3s that
were real daggers. Can you talk about the impact she made?  
CORI CLOSE: You are exactly eight. She hit really timely 3s. We cut it to six.
We had good rotation and we had overrotation on helping on someone we
shouldn't have and left her open at the top of the key and she delivered. Like
Jordin said, when you have those opportunities you have to be able to step up
and make shots. She really did and I thought that was the biggest dagger but
she had one in the third quarter that I thought was just as timely. She is a
really good player and I've watched her since she was in high school. You can
just tell she has a level of confidence about her. She stays really steady and
you can tell she is a rock for their team.  
  
Q. Coach, their defense in the second quarter you had a lot of good
looks at the basket but it looked like they were either denying or just
getting up and make being things uncomfortable. How did that compare to other
teams who have tried to do that to you?  
CORI CLOSE: Not many have and that's why we weren't able to adjust as quickly
as we would have liked. Honestly most people in the Pac-12 zoned us this year.
So we've been the biggest pressure-oriented team in you're conference over the
past year. I do think that threw us out of rhythm. We were running our plays a
step outside of where we wanted to. When we did get the shots we wanted we
knew we were going to get high post shots we knew Mo was going to be able to
get jumpers and those didn't go down. Some doubt crept in and at halftime
that's what we talked about. Your focus has to be on the present possession
only, period.  
  
That's you're only responsibility is the focus on being present and playing
your very best for the sake of the team that position. I thought they really
lived that in the second half. Vic Schaefer has always been a great defensive
coach. One of the best in the country, no doubt about that. He's passionate
about it and their kids play reflecting his passion on the defensive end. We
didn't execute and maybe take advantages of some of the mismatches we thought
we had but credit to their pressure. We weren't able to move the ball and take
advantage of those as smoothly as we would have wanted to which would have
created some better rhythm and some higher-percentage shots.  
  
Q. Coach, with Jordin's elbow being what it was, what do you think of
Japreece's performance off the bench and taking on a role there?  
CORI CLOSE: I think Japreece has had a great NCAA Tournament and I think it
should give her confidence moving forward. She loves Jordin so much. She have
a very special relationship and I know that there was probably no person
quicker to tears than Japreece in our locker room and part of it is, as has
already been said, she was fighting so hard for Jordin. I think she can hold
her head up high and I thought these were her best games of the year for us,
on the offensive and defensive end.  
  
Obviously Jordin, I can't say enough about. She's got the heart of a lion. She
was in pain the entire game and for her to end up with 23 points, 8 rebounds,
5 assists and 1 turnover in visible excruciating pain, she set an example of
toughness for Japreece Dean to walk into going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, Victoria Vivians is so good off the dribble as well as
shooting from the outside. Can you talk about how tough that is to guard her
this year especially in that crunch time? She took the ball into the hoop.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah, but it took their whole team to get her the touches in the
right spot. They ran the backdoor play on the left. We were hesitant, played
off and then she was able to loop back into the top of the key and get to her
right hand drive. We knew that was coming, but they're disciplined especially
in the crunch time situations in getting it to the person with the hot hand
and she was hot from the jump.  
  
Credit their entire team for getting it in their player's hands in a place to
be successful; but, you know, she was really good around the basket, even when
we took away her right hand drive which is what she likes to do best. She spun
back and got herself to the free throw line. She is a really good player. I
had a chance to watch her at USA Basketball this last summer for the U-23
tryouts and she is a talented offensive player.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the legacy that this team especially the senior
class leaves?  
CORI CLOSE: Hard to put into words. It's something that unless you're around
our program every day it's hard to understand. But it's not just the wins are
easy to trace, the record, three straight Sweet 16s, first time in Elite Eight
since 1999, on and on and on. But for me, the legacy that is deepest is the
way they've bought into our uncommon transformational experience. We really
wanted them to be, we say "I am woman" and it's about you are more than a
basketball player. It starts as a person. Then as a student, and then as an
athlete. They have bought in and built a culture that we say there is only two
things that will be with you the rest of your life from this experience and
it's who you become and who you impact. I don't think I could have asked any
more of those three seniors about who they have become and how they've
impacted people.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you all very much.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Mississippi State Bulldogs, Coach Vic
Schaefer, student-athletes, Blair Schaefer, Morgan William, Roshunda Johnson,
Teaira McCowan and Victoria Vivians. A short opening statement from Coach
Schaefer.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Wow, well, again, just proud of our team, proud of our kids up
here. These four seniors have been very, very special to our program.
Obviously last night I thought we played really well to be honest with you. I
think I said that last night. A lot of respect for Wes and his program at NC
State and those kids. I think I said it last night but I'll say it again, we
always talk about Tori and how good she is and we frame that with her
offensive game, last night she took a kid that's averaging a double-double in
the ACC and held her to 5 points and 3 rebounds. A lot of times Tori doesn't
get credit for her defense but she did a great job last night on Nelson and
that was a big key for us in the ball game.  
  
Looking ahead to UCLA and what Coach Close has done with her program, we
scrimmaged them two years ago in Dallas in late October and I told her in the
hallway to see the development she has had with those kids in basically two
seasons is really good, really remarkable. Those kids, I'm sitting there
watching last night and I have a lot of respect for Texas and I just thought
UCLA really dominated most of the game. I thought position-by-position they
were just really, really good.  
  
Again, you've gotta give Coach Close and her staff credit and those kids
credit. We're going to have our hands full. They are fast, quick, long,
athletic, cover a lot of ground, they forced 21 turnovers last night which led
to 31 points. We will be ready. We had a good practice last night. We're
excited about the opportunity. We run into these great teams a lot and I'm
excited to see our kids play again. That being said, that fast enough for you?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan then Victoria, last year you were the team that made the big
breakthrough to get to the national final and this year the roles are
reversed. Do you see any similarities with UCLA? It seems like they're like
you were last year, the young, hungry team that's hungry for that
breakthrough. Do you see any similarities?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Yeah, I believe so. I know the NCAA Tournament they're trying
to get to the Elite Eight and to the Final Four so I can see them trying to
get into the Final Four.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Yeah, they got the energy. They are coming in and they're
hungry for it. But don't come in and knock us down. We have the same energy
that we had last year, so it's just who is going to win.  
  
Q. Blair, the length, athleticism, the quickness that Coach referred to,
what challenges do those present to you and are they similar to any team that
you guys have faced this season off the top of your head?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: They have a lot of athleticism and height. I think it makes me
have to be more on my game, I have to be focused on boxing out and going to
get them on the perimeter, not letting them come in the paint and box them out
in the paint. I feel like we have played a lot of athletic teams this year
SEC. The SEC has a lot of length as well so hopefully that experience in the
SEC will carry over into tomorrow.  
  
Q. Teaira, last night you mentioned one of the things that might have
impacted your play last night was the seniors and playing for them. How much
is that driving you in the postseason? You've played well and been sharp it
seems. How much is that driving you to send them out winners, and not play
your last game with a loss?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Even last year I did it for my seniors and each year I do it
for my seniors. Seeing where the program was and where it is now I don't want
to let them fall short of what they should get. They should get the best,
which is a National Championship.  
  
Q. Morgan, you've played a lot of great point guards through your career
and this season, from what you have seen of Jordin, how does she compare and
what are they are strengths and what challenges does it present for you
tomorrow?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: First of all, she is a point guard overall, offensively and
defensively. She won Defensive Player of the Year in the Pac-12. She has a
great offensive game, improving each year, probably the best point guard that
I will go against this year.  
  
Q. Morgan, Roshunda and Blair, UCLA has mentioned they want to push the
pace. They're expecting a track meet. How does that impact the way you play
out there knowing that they want to push the pace?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: If it's going to be a track meet we need to get behind it. We
need to book every time and easy layups. So we can run a track meet but we're
going to be pressing, too, in the meet. So see who lasts longer.  
  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: I don't think we consider it a track meet, I think it will
go in our favor and if we run and execute plays then we will be fine.  
  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I agree. I feel like if we talk like we have all year,
communicate on the floor and use our leadership and just being seniors, that
previous knowledge that we have had over this four years, if we use that and
communicate throughout the entire game I feel like we will be fine.  
  
Q. Blair, when you were growing up you watched your dad obviously
building that program with Texas A &M with Gary Blair and the way the fan base
mushroomed in College Station and going to Starkville you've seen the same
thing and been a part of it as a player. What has it meant to you to go to a
city like that because you can compare it to what you saw happen with the
Aggies?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I've gone from being a fan, from watching A&M to being a
player. I get two different vibes, you love being in that atmosphere and
cheering on great team and now being part of a great team and having that fan
base as well it's such a special experience and to know that I've been able to
build a program with these amazing seniors and Teaira is something that I will
never be able to replace.  
  
Q. Victoria and Blair, how have you all grown together as a team and how
did your one loss help you if it did?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: We've grown a lot. I feel like every player has grown in
their own significant way but we have grown as a team. Our chemistry is great
and we do a lot of great things with each other and I feel like the overall
the team is great and from the loss of South Carolina we know what to expect
now. If one of us is not shooting well or the whole team isn't slating well to
attack the basket. We know what to do in a situation like that.  
  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I feel like over the four years we have gotten better
individually because we go against each other so hard every day. When you go
against great players you don't have another choice but to get better. I feel
like that's been a blessing and the loss to South Carolina just really opened
our eyes to how stagnant we were. The fact that that was our one game this
year that usually -- if one person is not shooting good we have another person
that's hot and no one could make a bucket. I think we learned that driving and
attacking is an option and we need to focus on that every game and not just a
few games.  
  
Q. For Morgan, we're about at a year anniversary of you having an
awesome game last year with 40-something points that was special to you on the
anniversary of your father's passing. How often do you think back to that game
and the high you had from that game and have you thought about it at all on
this trip?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Social media reminds me. People tell me about it. But, um, I
think about it. But, you know, it's a new year, new game, whatever happens,
happens. Whether I go off or I don't. I know whatever the team needs, that's
what I will do. If they need me to get ten assists, I will get ten assists, no
points. So that works. Yeah.  
  
Q. Teaira, Monique, I'm not sure of the exact match-up, but she has the
possibility of going against you. She is athletic, quick. What match-up
problems does that present if that's the match-up for tomorrow?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Running the floor when I'm rebounding and she sprints out so
knowing that my teammates have to sprint back and help me until I can get
there and her counter moves she has. I have to stay down and not go for the
first one or the second one or the third one, maybe the fourth one but I have
to stay down and contest her very well, hands straight up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Vic, I found it being that last night you were asked about the Ole
Miss game from earlier in the season. Would you go as far as to say that was a
turning point for you guys? How much of that enabled you guys to get here, if
anything at all?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't know the significance of that particular postgame other
than, you know, you win by 20 and most people are, you know, everything is
hunky-dory and for me it wasn't. Again, I think that goes back to playing for
me and playing at Mississippi State. It's probably not the easiest thing in
the world to do. We don't apologize for being demanding.  
  
I think all these young ladies will tell you, the rest of 'em in the locker
room, I coach the same way from the first tip until the last second of the
game. I was coaching Jazz last night to manage the game late and y'all know
I've gotten on that last five that's come in and not closed out a game
properly, giving up an 8 or 10-0 run after we've held somebody to 40-something
points and they go out there and "slop it up" give up 10 points in two minutes
and look like death warmed over. I think there is a level of expectation, a
standard that we try to hold everyone accountable to. So, you know, that
particular night it was just one of those nights where I think we need to do
address some things.  
  
Q. Coach, you've played a demanding schedule, in conference, out of
conference, what team reminds you the most of what you're going to face
against the Bruins?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't know. That group I watched last night, boy, they do so
many things well. Cori has done a tremendous job with them. They play with a
high rate of speed. Their point guard dictates how they want to play.
Sometimes she is that bull in the China cabinet that's going, going, going,
and Cori is over there trying to pull back the reigns a little bit. That whole
team is really good and I think that whole team plays like that.  
  
From their length, their athleticism, their size, it really four spots on the
floor. Pretty unique team. I walked out of here last night going, now, did I
read that right? Where they finished in the Pac-12? Because, you know, they
just really looked good to me. I have so much respect for Texas. I see them a
little more than I see those teams on the west coast. Again, watching it in
person last night I was just really impressed with how UCLA played and
dominated the game.  
  
Q. Vic, you mentioned after the Oklahoma State game that the team was
kind of having a problem finding their second wind in that game. Are you
concerned at all facing another team that likes to run the floor like that? Do
you feel like they have found their second wind?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think we're okay. Again, we were concerned going into the
Oklahoma State game with how they wanted to play and get up and down. I
thought we took that away from them. We're going to have to be obviously
really good tomorrow as well, and do a good job in a number of areas,
transition defense being one of 'em. Again, I think there's some things that
you can do to handle that. We've just got to go out and execute it.  
  
Q. Vic, these two programs I think have things in common but then things
completely different. She is building a program in one of the biggest cities
in America, in the world! You're in Starkville and there is a smaller
population base there, but there are advantages of that, too, I think, just
the feel of the whole state feels so close to this team. Talk about how you
have used that to your advantage and how much Victoria coming there and being
a Mississippi kid impacted that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Absolutely, I do think in our state you're either a Bulldog or
you're the other school up north and there is nobody in between. There is no
love. There is no straddling the fence. You don't drive by a house and they've
got this flag and this Bulldog. I'm just telling y'all. It's unlike anything
I've experienced. If there is a house divided, there is a road between it.  
  
The fact of the matter is with this success of this team and this program I
have seen and had so many people that wear the other color of the school
compliment me and our kids and what they've been able to do. It's a sense of
pride. I think people have no idea about the great state of Mississippi and
the state we live in and what a tremendous place it is. The people in that
state are what make it so special. Doesn't matter what school you support.
It's who they are. It's really been, for me, someone that's not from that
state. I've enjoyed it. It's been fun building it at Mississippi State.  
  
Victoria was a huge part of what we've done because she gave us credibility.
When we first got there and you're talking a vision, until you can get
somebody to buy into that vision and give you a little bit of credibility, a
national kid like Victoria, you know, it sometimes can be a challenge.
Victoria, she not only changed our program, she obviously impacted my career,
both professionally as well as personally. Just a wonderful kid. If I can't
find Victoria Vivians in Starkville, all I gotta do is call the house because
she is an hour and 15 minutes away in Carthage, probably eating grandma's
cooking, going to church and enjoying being around her mom and dad. That's
lost a lot in today's world with kids.  
  
For me, I respect her even more for that, because I'm a family guy. Family is
something that we talk about a lot at Mississippi State. It's something I
believe in so Victoria has impacted our program, I'm going to lose about 300
season ticket holders, because when she comes -- I'm surprised nobody has
robbed a bank in Carthage because there is nobody there to keep them from
doing it when we play on game night. It's really been special.  
  
Q. The match-up against Oklahoma State, the second game you guys did a
good job of changing some things in terms of the tempo of the game. I know
their personnel is different from UCLA's. But how much does that adjustment
that you guys made against Oklahoma State particularly against Goodwin and
containing her, how much does that give you confidence that you can do that
tomorrow night?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sure. I think it gives you something to hang your hat on and you
know you've had to do it before. Look, we've gone against some great point
guards in the Southeastern Conference. Jordin Canada is really good and she
really dictates, again, their whole demeanor, their tempo, the kid has a lot
of confidence. She plays with a lot of swagger. It's hard to have swagger
unless you're really good, unless your skill set is really good. She's got a
good skill set. For us, we will have a game plan and it's one thing to talk
about, practice for one day, it's another thing to go out and execute it. But
with four seniors, we have had to do it before.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the match-ups between Morgan and Jordin and Teaira
and Monique and how you see that and what you think your kids are going to
have to do to get the best of their kids and where Victoria is going to fit
into the scheme?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sure, I think Victoria plays multiple positions for us and, you
know, hopefully for them they're going to have to figure out who is going to
try to guard her when she's at our 3B guard or if she is at the 3 guard. I
think that's what's been the beauty for us this year is to be able to go with
Chloe at 4 who can stretch and you shoot it, play Tori out there, a lot of
times that can be a mismatch or player at 4, 3B as I call it and that's a
mismatch.  
  
As much as everybody is worried about our match-ups with them, I think that's
an area right there that you can really, it's going to be an advantage for us.
Those two match-ups at point guard and 5, I don't think there is any doubt
that's going to be the key to the ball game for either team. I think you have
two great ones at point, two great ones inside and it will be fun to watch
those kids go at it and compete against each other.  
  
These types of games and these types of match-ups make our game great. When
you get this match-up in an Elite Eight game, again, I watched 'em last night
and to me UCLA just really, really looked good. They looked good in a lot of
areas. Their execution was good. Obviously their inside game was really good.
I thought they got on the boards and got after Texas which I really could not
believe that could happen to a big, strong, physical Texas team. So I think
those are two match-ups that you pointed out that are going to be big for
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at UCLA, they're similar to how you guys were
last year. They're hungry. They got over the Sweet 16 hump now they're looking
to get to the Final Four, but Victoria said don't count out our hunger. How
have they been balancing getting back to the championship, even though you're
on the other end of the spectrum as the 1 seed trying to use that motivation
to get back to the Final Four?  
VIC SCHAEFER: So far, Tom, I think we've handled it pretty well. We're 35-1.
We've taken the bullseye from last year of getting to the National
Championship game to the bullseye, adding another bullseye this year of being
undefeated for as long as, for 32 games. These kids have worn it all year
long. Cori has done a great job. She's been there for seven years. We've been
at Mississippi State for six. I think our paths, as far as the trajectory of
our programs are similar in those years. Her and her staff have done a great
job. I think our kids at the end of the day, I've stopped worrying about 'em
being ready because they've been ready for 35 of the 36. The one game we
didn't win, it wasn't because we weren't ready, we played a really good South
Carolina team that night, they executed better than we did and they beat us.  
  
For this team, this group, these seniors, the thing about them, they know
what's at stake. They've been in this game before. That, I think, gives me
confidence, probably gives them a little confidence, too, to understand what's
coming down the pipe and how to respond in certain situations.  
  
Q. Coach Close mentioned that hunger and watching you all in the run you
made last year inspired her a little bit to say, hey I think that's what we
want to be next year. When you hear a power 5 coach say that, how does that
make you feel personally?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, again, I think there is parity in our game now. It gives
anybody hope when you can go out there and beat a No. 1. Number one, we had to
beat the best player in the game in Plum. Then we had to beat Baylor who rolls
out seven or eight All-Americans, looks like a WNBA team. Then we have to roll
in and beat a team that's won 111 games on the biggest stage in my industry.  
  
I think anyone can use that and use it with your kids. For us everybody wants
to talk about that game in the semifinal. It's one game. I didn't have to play
them best out of seven. We just had to play one night, one game, execute, do
our job. Again, for us in that game it was personal because of what had
happened the year before. For anyone else, right now, they're just trying to
get to that point and get to that game. Again, sometimes you have to go
through something rough, not bad but just rough or uncomfortable to get to
what the success is, something better down the line. We had to go through
something really rough in that Sweet 16 game against that team to get to 365
days later to experience something very special. That's life!  
  
You go through rough patches in life that get you ready for better things, and
I believe that with all my heart. I believe the good Lord puts in you those
positions and what a blessing to have a chance 365 days later for redemption.
That's the piece that a lot of teams don't get. They have not gone through
that heartache yet. They don't understand what it felt like to walk off that
floor in Bridgeport humiliated. Probably the lowest point of my coaching
career. Am I going to walk out of there and go to the bar and stay there seven
days? Or am I going to learn from that and maybe put me a reminder with the
number 60 on my desk, 60 in the locker room, 60 in the weight room, and fuel
that, use that as fuel?  
  
So I think that's where we were, and, again, a unique perspective and unique
situation. But I think our game has provided us with so much parity. I think
there's a lot of people that can make a run.  
  
Q. You have two point guards that you are able to split so much time
between for the last two games seems like Morgan has taken over those minutes.
What has gone into the thinking in giving her back those minutes?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Morgan has played better. She doesn't look tired. Nothing
against Jazz. She has played well all year long. I just think Morgan is in a
groove, playing extremely well. But you know what? Tomorrow night, it's all
about feel with them, as far as me coaching those kids and I've done that
their whole career. Anybody that's done their homework knows when Jazz is
playing well, Jazz is going to play. Just so lucky and blessed to have two
great point guards. So that's kinda how that will go tomorrow night and we'll
see how it goes.  
  
Q. Vic, big picture, what does it mean to the sport and what kind of
impact does it have when programs like yours are able to build up and reach
the level that that old guard has stayed at for so long?  
VIC SCHAEFER: So just to clarify, programs like mine? Give me the
clarification on that.  
  
Q. When you build it up, to being a top national women's basketball
program?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I'm going to respond to that and say we are now. Obviously where
we came from, you know, they had a little bit of success and then had fallen
on a couple years of hard times and then to go from 13-17 to 22-14, 27-7 to
28-8, 34-5 to where we are now at 35-1, I think it gives anybody hope. But I
think it also isn't easy. This didn't happen just because we all come into the
office every day 8-5. I got a staff that grinds. They work their tails off.
They understand the importance of every little thing that we do.  
  
We talk about coaching the little things. Well, they are also as coaches doing
the little things. It's so hard to do what we have done in the period of time
that we've done it in. I think that's the thing. I had a blueprint when Scott
hired me but I don't know that the blueprint was, hey, you're taking over a
program that's coming off a 14-16, six seniors are on the way out the door off
a bad 14-16 team. You've got no kids that are eligible of the three that you
signed and by the way you're playing in the biggest, baddest conference in the
country. And we had, what, one SEC player on that group? We developed two more
but we had a nice Division III team that they left us. No disrespect to those
kids. They were great kids and they played their hearts out.  
  
We had to do a massive overhaul. At the end of the day it's rewarding. It's
hard to do, but there is a process. We didn't panic when we went 13-17. We
knew what that looked like. We didn't panic the next year when we went 5-11
again by the way we went 5-11 in the SEC that year. I thought we would win
five games total. I didn't coach those kids any different than that same team
that won a National Championship in 2011. We demanded from them just like we
demand from this group now. No different!  
  
I think the next year you go 5-11 again, but you're 22-14, you're in the NIT.
Then you just keep growing. You've got to recruit. You've gotta stack classes.
You can't have one good class then go two and three years and then you have
another good class. You've got to stack classes. Victoria, Mo, Blair, that
class backed up the first one, Bre, Ketara, Dominique and Chinwe.  
  
You stack those classes then back that up with Teaira and Jazz. So we've done
that every year. The next class was ranked 19th. The class we got comin' is
ranked 10th. So that's the process of how you do it.  
  
Again, I feel like we weren't hired to bring them a top-25 team. We were hired
to bring them a top-10 program. Programs are there every year. Every year when
the preseason poll comes out you don't look for them below 10. Where are they
in the top-10. That's why you're looking. You're not down here in 17-25. 17-25
is fluid. Those teams are in and out all year long. Receiving votes one week,
No. 23 the next, back to receiving votes, all the way out. That's not what I
felt like I was hired to do. I was hired to bring Mississippi State a top-10
program. To do that, it takes so much time, effort, energy, focus of everyone
involved.  
  
But it also takes an administration that goes, you know what? He thinks it's
important. We need to give him the opportunity to do it. I think that's the
beauty for me and for us, is that they've given us the tools. They've
supported us to allow us to go do our job and it's hard to do your job you got
handcuffs on.  
  
I think at Mississippi State, they took the handcuffs off and said, hey, it's
important, here you go. Go get it done. And I think we've done that. It's very
rewarding, and, again, you gotta give these kids credit, you gotta give them
credit for our fan base. That's part of building a program, not just the X's
and O's and not just the wins and losses. It's 10,000 people in that arena,
what, four or five times this year, selling out both regionals. It doesn't
happen that way most places.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow night.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs!

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay we're now joined by the Bruins from UCLA. Coach Cori
Close, her student-athletes, and starters, Jordin Canada, Lajahna Drummer,
Kennedy Burke, Kelli Hayes and Monique Billings.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you all for covering our sport. It's huge for us to continue
to grow our sport and we need you all to do that, so thank you for what you
do. I'm excited to be able to coach this team for another day. We have been
very consistent that we want to earn another one, earn another day to be
together, earn another chance to compete. So we feel privileged and very
hungry to continue to have the opportunity to earn another day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordin and Monique, the men's basketball program has a tremendous
history, they've been for the Final Four 18 times. What would it mean for you
guys to break through and get to a Final Four yourselves?  
JORDIN CANADA: It would be great, obviously, UCLA has a lot of history.
Wanting to be a part of that would be a tremendous honor and blessing, but we
have to focus on getting there. We just gotta make sure we follow the game
plan and hopefully it will happen.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Yeah, it would be a dream come true. That's something that
you think about when you -- when you are a little girl watching basketball, or
when you commit to a school that's something that always comes to mind. So it
would definitely be a dream come true, but I agree with Jordin it's the steps
that we have to take to get there, first.  
  
Q. Monique, I think you've had a look at Mississippi State already but
when you think about trying to defend them on the post, where does that
process start and what's going to be the plan to try to hold your own
tomorrow?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: We talked about in film today playing early, playing low and
just being able to use my advantages as a post, which is, like, speed,
quickness, and, yeah, just playing at a high tempo.  
  
Q. Lajahna, picking up on that, I'm assuming to defend McCowan it's
being to be an all hands on deck situation for you guys. Is there anybody you
have played that's comparable in the Pac-12 to what you see from her on film?
Do you expect her to be the biggest challenge you guys have faced in the paint
this year?  
LAJAHNA DRUMMER: In the Pac-12 we have a lot of people who are her size. We
have definitely had a good amount of practice. I would say Gülich is probably
her size so we're set. We have had a lot of practice.  
  
Q. Jordin, how do you plan on match you go up with Morgan William?
That's going to be a fun match-up for a lot of people and Monique, three of
you have been here three times before, how is this year different from
previous years?  
JORDIN CANADA: Morgan William is a great point guard. She leads her team very
well. Just trying to use my advantages and my strengths over hers. I know it's
going to be a tough match-up, so just trying to focus on that match-up and
trying to focus on that.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: This year has been different for us because we made it over
that Sweet 16 hump that we were stuck at for the last two years, so now we
need to make it over this Elite Eight hump and just keep it going.  
  
Q. Kelli, how did your senior experience help in the Sweet 16 yesterday,
help you gather your team?  
KELLI HAYES: Well, my senior experience has been culminated for the past three
years, not just this year alone so using my experiences as a freshman,
sophomore, junior and now a senior, building that momentum into this year.
It's been a growing process into being the person that I am today and being a
leader that I am with this team and it's not done yet. It's something that
I've been growing and with the help of my teammates I wouldn't be where I am
today and our program wouldn't be what it is now without my maturity and
growth. So it's been cool to see that growth develop in myself as well as how
I've been able to impact the team in other aspects.  
  
Q. Ladies, question for Jordin and then if Kennedy could give her two
cents. Leading scorer, leading assister. We in the media love labels. I'll let
you give us the label that we can use for you. Scorer, assister, and then for
Kennedy, how does the team view Jordin as the engine that drives it? As one of
the engines? What role do you guys see her playing?  
JORDIN CANADA: Well for me, I don't want to just be labeled as a scorer or an
assister. I see myself as an all-around player. It's not just about the
offensive end it's how I play on the defensive end as well. I would say I'm a
basketball player. Honestly, I love playing on both ends of the floor and
that's what I'm all about and that's how I play. It's not just about offense.
It's about defense as well so I'm an all-around player.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: I would agree with her. She is not only a scorer but she gets
it done on the defensive end. She is a great teammate, a great leader for us
and not only can she do it on the defensive end, she can drive to the basket
and no matter how big you are she will take it to you.  
  
Q. How about Monique and Kelli, everybody up there is a Californian even
Coach Cori Close and there were years when California players didn't
necessarily stay on the west coast. Monique and Kelli, if you could talk about
your decision and the idea of, I'm sure you guys could have both left the
state and decided to stay there and build a program that hadn't been to the
Sweet 16 in a long time.  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: There were a plethora of decisions of why I chose to come to
UCLA as well as my teammates but that is definitely one of the reasons to be
from California and the first to do something special at a program that wasn't
necessarily on the map and that's what we set out to do, that was our mindset
from day one. We knew it wasn't going to be easy but we wanted to change the
minds of people who maybe thought west coast basketball was soft or whatever
because that's not the case.  
  
For me, I say actions speak louder than words and I think that's something we
have exemplified throughout this year and throughout our fours years of being
here at UCLA.  
  
KELLI HAYES: Yeah, I would second what Mo had to say. During the recruiting
process of course you flirt with other schools and other states but for me I
really wanted to stay in California, Stanford, Cal, USC or UCLA, and out of
those four schools every school has a legacy. But to me UCLA stuck out and I
wanted to be part of a legacy and create and that's something we have already
done even though our season isn't done and if I wasn't a stupidity would I
want to be at UCLA, the answer is yes, it's far away for home but close enough
for my parents to come to every game and that's why my teammates and I stayed
because we wanted or families to be able to support us here at UCLA.  
  
Q. Kennedy then Lajahna, obviously the first Elite Eight since 1999 on
the precipice potentially of something that's never been done in program
history. How do you compartmentalize that and not be overwhelmed by the moment
and stay locked in on the task at hand because Mississippi State is an
experienced team and it's not going to be an easy out?  
KENNEDY BURKE: Honestly, it starts with today's practice. Just how we were
focused on film today and we have film later on tonight and we have to just
really focus on their personnel and then just know what we need to do to win
this game.  
  
LAJAHNA DRUMMER: For me personally I would just say Coach talks a lot about
being present. So I would say that's probably the most important thing for
myself and my team. So as long as we continue to be present and focus on
what's in front of us, I think we will be in good position.  
  
Q. Kelli, I know Coach has a very good relationship with Coach Wooden
and she has talked about him a lot. Are there any specific pieces of advice
that she has given you that remind you of Coach Wooden that she has taken from
him and given to you guys?  
KELLI HAYES: One, she preaches a lot to us is character, your character and
who you are on the court as well as off and how that's been constantly
reiterated for us, the things we do as lifestyle givers as people that care
about one another. That is replicated onto the court with us and how we treat
one another is how we treat our opponents, not in a sense of we're going to be
nice to our opponent but in a sense where we're going to treat them with
respect and challenge them through grace.  
  
So it's something she has talked with us about, our character, and how we
develop our game in practice, before practice, after practice, that's part of
our character and who we develop as people and as basketball players.  
  
Q. For Lajahna and Kelli, how have you changed as a team and personally
over the last month?  
LAJAHNA DRUMMER: So as a team I would say, usually when we have adversity in
front of us, we kinda, like, sink down to it. But I think over time we've
accepted it and then we've accepted the challenge and come to move on. So I
feel like we're not just going to feel sorry for ourselves anymore. We've come
to accept the challenge and tried to move past it.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: Going off of what Laj said about adversity, we joke about it
all the time in practice. Coach will throw a drill at us and say well you guys
are going to be down 3 in this drill and we're like, what? Okay, bring on the
challenge. So we joke about adversity but yet you can see us overcoming those
in game settings. As outsiders, you guys don't know what goes on in our
practices but we know what we've done and what we've conquered and all that
adversity that we've been put through is no longer adversity to us. It's being
able to conquer and strive and embrace those challenges so it's no longer an
issue or obstacle to us that we were coming across that we have done and
executed and it's something that our team has grown at and something not
everyone has been able to see every day. But we know we've done it every day
so it's been cool on to see that with our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a great season. Kennedy spoke about
leadership qualities with Jordin. What would you have to say about that?  
CORI CLOSE: We say a lot. She is the captain of the ship. We go as she goes,
in so many ways. One of the things I was proud of her last night in her
leadership was her poise when things weren't easy for her. Her panic button so
to speak when she was less mature was to take it all on herself and she was
poised in running the team. She does affect, I challenge her in every film
session and we will go through the possessions and say were you or were you
not affecting every play and I believe she is capable of doing that, the
screens she makes, the passes, the shots, on offense, on defense, away from
the ball, her communication to move the pieces around. I think that's what an
elite point guard sees themselves as is doesn't matter how it shows up
statistically. They know how they've influenced every play and that's what
being the captain of the ship for us in Jordin Canada is her ability to affect
every play whether it shows up in assists or scores or not.  
  
Q. Cori, can you reflect on what it's like to build a program in
literally the entertainment capital of the world where there are so many
things going on and to try to build a fan base and engagement with fans? It's
very different in Starkville, obviously it's completely the opposite. Doing
that and what I asked them about that California connection. You've recruited
successfully in the state.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah, I think that the first part about building a culture and
building in that city, I think it has to be bigger than entertainment and I
think that's how we've tried to do it. We're trying to build a sincere and
genuine engagement with our fans and I think that's why we've been so
consistently about 20% improvement every year in attendance. This year for the
first time in program history entered into the top 25 in the country in
attendance.  
  
It's been very steady. I think the people that come to our games don't just
come for the entertainment of one particular game. They are truly engaged in
the journey of these young women. Not only is it supporting our young women
but our young women in a consistent basis being involved in our community,
being seen as representatives on a larger scale of as student-athletes. Kelli
referenced it as lifestyle givers. I think you engage people at a deeper level
when you are viewed as that. We don't run from wanting to be role models,
every player on the team chooses a word every year that they want to
exemplify, and Monique Billings is legacy. It's not about her in the record
books. It's about inspiring another young girl to want to do what she did just
like someone inspired her. I think we have been very intentional about that
and our players have bought into the opportunity that they have not only to
build a culture and a program but to inspire and grow the game in Southern
California.  
  
In terms of California recruiting, we're fortunate that in those years we were
building a program we had great talent in the state of California. I think
their families deserve a lot of credit. A lot of kids not don't want to stay
home and share the experience with their families and they come from really
special families and I'm really grateful for that. I also think I've got to
give credit to the Pac-12 networks. We have more TV exposure on linear
television than any other conference in the country for women's basketball and
I think that's been a major piece, the exposure we can promise recruits.  
  
I think it's been special. I think that we have a place with so much broad
tradition for athletics at UCLA but nothing had been done for women's
basketball and I kept saying I'm looking for a courageous uncommon woman that
wants to come and create something for the first time, that wants to do
something that hasn't been done and not take the baton from somebody else but
to build a foundation for years to come and that's exactly what they've done.  
  
Q. As you guys try to go to your first Final Four and have that
breakthrough you have to go through a team that had its own breakthrough last
season. Is there anything you can take from last year to help you guys out?  
CORI CLOSE: First of all, I have so much respect for Vic Schaefer not only in
how he's built the program from a competency on the court but in the way he
invests in the lives of his student-athletes. I think they play for each other
and for him in a really cool way. I think you can see their hunger last year.
I could see it. I became a fan watching their hunger to have that break
through and their hunger to represent their school and the person on their
right and left and the feeling of responsibility in that and I talked about
that in film today. You have to have that deep hunger and belief that you want
to keep playing with each other and for each other. I think that also it just
starts, it's hard to believe for the first time.  
  
I think what they did in building that in their program last year was
remarkable. I think that's something we've been seeking to do is to believe
internally, really deeply before anyone on the outside could even suspect.  
  
Q. Coach, last night you got a little choked up talking about Nan Wooden
calling and telling you that she thought her dad would have liked watching
this team play. What is it about this team that she was referring to? Why do
you think she believes that, that Coach Wooden would feel that way and go on
what it feels like to have her say that?  
CORI CLOSE: I think it's humbling and I think it takes a village to build a
program. It takes a village to raise a head coach. I feel like I've been
raised up by significant people, the people I played for, the people I coached
with. I was an assistant for 18 years and Coach Wooden is one of many people
that selflessly invested in my life and in my career. I think when you have
someone like Coach Wooden you respect so much that his daughter would say that
"Daddy would like this team and Daddy would be proud." I know what she's
referring to, she's referring to team basketball, that we're willing to make
the extra pass. It's all about the team play more than it is about the
individual play.  
  
It's about defense. I know that he really valued. He loved to press. He really
brought that to bear at a high level at UCLA. That's what she referred to is
the selflessness, how hard they play and how we defend and share the ball.  
  
So I think, you know, that's what he did. He built teams that obviously became
more and more talented as the years went on and they won so many
championships, but it was always about the unit more than about the
individual. Doing something linked together that you could never do by
yourself. If we can represent UCLA, that's what wearing those letters across
our chest mean is that we represent something bigger than ourselves. In order
to continue to walk in that legacy you have to be concerned about how you link
together more than what you're doing on your own path.  
  
Q. A lot of times coaches say that when they're in a tournament
situation there is not that much time to prepare for the next opponent,
they're just going to sort of hope what their strengths are help them get over
that next game and that short window and then you have other coaches say we're
going to spend every single hour looking over the game plan. I was curious
what your take is, what your decision making was there?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, our conference prepares this way every week so this is very
familiar to us. I do think that's a tremendous advantage, that a quick, one-
day prep is nothing that unusual. It's not just the players' mindset but our
staff knows how to prepare that way on a quick turn-around. Our video team had
everything broken down by the time I got back to the hotel last night I had so
many things and tools on my computer for me to work on. It's really a team
effort but it's one that we do all the time.  
  
In the format of the Pac-12, I do think, like I said, was a great advantage.
But I do think that sometimes you have to know the personality of your own
team. I do think sometimes you can overprepare with the team. What we do
internally as a staff is not always what we share with the team. We're
prepared on the bench for so many different things, but this particular team I
made a real big mistake the very first game of the Pac-12 at Stanford and I
overcoached them, flat out. I gave them too much information and instead of
playing to our identity which is focused freedom and being long and athletic
and free and versatile, we were thinking too much. I think every team a coach
has to know their own team and how to put them in positions to be successful
and sometimes we as coaches and I as a coach make mistakes in that. But at
this point in the year I think we know who we are and when we play at our
best. We're just trying to do the same thing we have been doing throughout the
Pac-12 season, trying to prepare at a high level with the different styles of
every single game and the game plan that needs to have adjustments and try to
use that to play to our strengths.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned breakthroughs and it took your team three tries
to get to the Elite Eight. What lessons did they learn to make that step? How
can you apply that to trying to break through to that Final Four tomorrow?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think that, you know, there's a lot of lessons. I think
learning from every experience that has come before. Kelli referenced that.
That it's not just the last few weeks or the last, even this year. It's a
cumulative maturing that has taken place and to try to use every experience.
One of our core values is choosing to see everything with a growth mindset. We
can turn whatever circumstances come our way as an opportunity to learn and
grow. When you choose that and sometimes it's a hard choice you have this
cumulative affect of experience that truly does build into something different
and better.  
  
I think we are in that position. I think, you know, every part of previous
years have created different lessons. I think having faced Texas in the Sweet
16 before and then in the scrimmage there was familiarity to that. Knowing how
to take things away. But, you know, also, I think it's just about, last year
we were playing at a very high level at the end of the year. We had a bad seed
because we had two bad losses and that affected that we had to meet UConn in
the Sweet 16. We talked about that throughout this year. It was so important
that we put ourselves in a position to get the kind of match-ups that we
wanted to make those next steps, because we felt like we were playing at a
higher level. But we ran into that crazy buzz saw UConn. So the reality is
choosing to use every experience and not brushing them to the side, but truly
embracing those and trying to use them as opportunities to learn and grow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you very much for your comments. We'll see
you tomorrow.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you all.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Mississippi State - 71, NC State - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Mississippi State Bulldogs, Head Coach
Vic Schaefer, his three student-athletes, Morgan William, Roshunda Johnson and
Teaira McCowan. Coach your thoughts?  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: This team and these kids continue to set records at Mississippi
State. I'm just proud of them. Hats off to North Carolina State. Wes has done
a tremendous job with that program. Those kids had our attention. They
certainly had mine, but I thought our kids were special today. We were
concerned about McCowan. She is a double-double machine and to hold her to 5
points on three rebounded, you have Victoria Vivians in here because she is
not only a great athlete but she did a great job on her defensively, as well.
I thought Mo controlled the whole game, 8 assists, 1 turnover, two blocks. She
made sure I knew she had two blocks today and Ro coming in after dealing with
what she has had to deal with last couple of days and playing solid for us and
it was dominating, as she has been all year, 11 out of 11 from the field, 15
rebounds, and 1 steal. Proud of our kids. We will have our work can you tell
on the for us on the winner of this next one. To be where they are and do it
the way they've done it, again, I thought our pressure bothered them, I
thought it wore 'em down. You look at the second half, 28 in the third and 38
in the 4th and that's typically what happens when we play people. We wear 'em
down, our press bothers them. We may not get a steal off the press but we're
making that point guard work extremely hard and, you know, for them, Ealey was
2 for 8 and 4 turnovers. We tried to wear her out. Proud of our kids, proud of
our effort and it's on to the next one. The name of the student-athletes you
want to answer?  
  
Q. What is it about this time of year that brings out the best in you?
Michelle pointed out 11 for 11 ties an NCAA record. Last season you really
exploded, you just exploded again tonight. What's it about this time of
year?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: This time of year you lose and you go home and you basically
start over so my team and my seniors the four that I got I'm trying to make it
the best it can be and go as far as possible.  
  
Q. For all of you, seemed like the second half you were able to
eliminate a lot of their second shots and be able to convert on the other end.
In what ways do you feel like you stepped up your defensive game the second
half and limited them to one shot on their possessions?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Keeping them from getting the back doors and helping and
making sure that my teammates didn't get beat on the backdoor was a main key
for the second half. Then whatever she shot I boxed out and looked at my girl
and made sure she wasn't going in and pursued the rebound.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think we attacked on the defensive end just like we
said on the offensive end and we let our defense roll over.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I agree with what they said, came out in the second half
and tried to punch first and it starts on defense and then you take care of
defense it helps the offense.  
  
Q. Morgan, you guys got up 17-7, made a run, took a lead. What's the
experience as the point guard? What was your mindset when they made their
run?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Game is full of runs, we're going to make a run, they're going
to make a run but they make a run we need to get stops, too. We made stops so
that's good. It's basketball. It's going to be a game of runs.  
  
Q. What was it like getting out there and get a chance to be with your
teammates after what happened and where you were yesterday to get a chance to
get on the floor and play for four quarters?  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: It felt really good. I knew I had to come back here and be
here for my team. I felt like I left it all on the floor either way and I feel
like we completed the mission.  
  
Q. Morgan, Coach said that you controlled the game. This is the second
consecutive game in which he said you've done that. Is it similar to Teaira
with you, that you're taking your game to another level?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like it's March, do or die. I don't want to talk off
court and thinking I didn't play hard enough and do this for my teammates and
I didn't execute and take care of the ball. Going out there, giving it my all
and see where it takes me. Doing good for my teammates, I'm proud of that.  
  
Q. Teaira, NC State was saying they were trying to double you in the
first half, front you in the second half. I know you've seen every possible
defense. Talk about how you have evolved in taking whatever the defense gives
you or sometimes take it when they don't give it to you?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I knew I couldn't let them double me so whenever I felt the
double team coming I had to hurry up and do my turn before they got there and
got set in order to double team me and when they would double team I would
find my shooters, and if they missed I would go in and get the rebound and
when they front me. I would ask for it with my high hand and my teammates
delivered me the ball in the right hand and I was just going up.  
  
Q. Teaira, NC State was referencing your strength is something they
might have seen on film but they really didn't realize it until they got out
on the court and dealt with the it. Is there a point where you feel like, I
can overpower them on pure strength and get to the basket at will?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: A lot of teams say I wear on them so at the beginning of the
game teams are giddy and going and the end of the game is when I always get
'em, either way it's a lose/lose.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Vic, I know you mentioned you had heavy hearts about Ro and her
situation with her grandfather. How have y'all tried to be there for her the
last couple of days and what was it like getting a chance to see her get out
there tonight and score 12 points and have a pretty good game?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sure, it's real life. Really gotta credit her mom. Her mom and I
visited. I wanted to make sure that her family knew I was all for whatever
they wanted her to do. That's bigger than basketball. So we wanted to support
her if she wanted to be if he funeral, that's where she needed to be. But her
mom was really good. I told her this is real world, real life. Your team needs
you. If you want to be at the funeral then we're going to get you on airplane
and get you to Kansas City. She came in late last night, film was over but she
had a chance to hug her and let her know how much we care about her. That's
tough, grandparents, that was the first person I really lost in my life and it
about yanked my heart out at 15 years of age. This was someone that was very
dear to her and we wanted to support her in whatever she wanted to do.  
  
Q. What are the chances that you would be 35-1 and going into the Elite
Eight if Teaira had developed into an All-American this season?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Come on. First of all, great post in the paper today.  
  
Q. Appreciate it.  
VIC SCHAEFER: I saw that. Yeah, T is, again, I said this the other day
multiple times you saw the value of Teaira McCowan when we lost her in the
tournament championship game. She cleans up a lot of your mess, she cleans up
your missed shots, your dribble penetration that you give up, blocked shots,
altered shots, turn around and get out of there, you know, so her value to our
basketball team is -- you can't put a price tag on it. Tonight I loved the
look in her eye tonight. There was some times where she wasn't going to be
denied.  
  
She does wear on people. I've heard that many times before. I've heard 'em
say, you know, Coach, we just couldn't move her. We've worked hard with our
guards to give her the ball in places where she needs it. We've missed her a
ton this year. We've got to do a better job. We've worked on that. And Mo and
our guard play have done a much better job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of alluded to at Stark Vegas the other day talked
about basketball and you expected to see maroon tonight. What do you think of
the atmosphere?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Love our crowd, our people, our Bulldog fans are the best. I'm
just telling you. They love this team, they travel, they plan to travel. It's
fashionable, you know, whether it's vacation or just what they want to do on
the weekend, but they're just the best. I just can't say enough about 'em, how
much we appreciate them. I guess they wouldn't let us visit with them after
the game because I noticed my team wasn't around to do what they normally do.
Again, maybe we will talk to the NCAA about that. They're always wanting us to
build our fan base, well, this is what we've done. We shouldn't have different
rules different times of the year. If we're going to build our fan base and
this is how we did it at Stark Vegas at Mississippi State, why should we have
to change now at the NCAA tournament, especially when you've got all those
people. They are not five dollar tickets or ten dollar tickets. They're
spending money to come here, buying hotels, bought food locally and bought a
pretty expensive ticket to come to the game. So me and you, we'll get that
together.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier this season you criticized your team's maturity and
mental toughness coming off a 20 point win over Ole Miss going into a road
game at Missouri. You said your personal agenda can't be more important than
winning. In what ways during this tournament are you seeing that personal
agenda aside and these girls really coming together?  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, great job doing your homework. I wasn't really
happy that day! Obviously we had some things going on. We've addressed it. I
think our kids have played much better since that day and we have had much
better chemistry. In this tournament, like Mo said, you can't afford to have a
bad day, you can't miss a hedge on a ball screen, go under on a shooter. You
can't miss a block out. These are all things that as you move along are
important to victory. I think our kids are dialed in. They have been all year.
As much as I want to worry about 'em and worry about whether we're ready or
not, they have not let me down one time. We got outplayed one night and got
beat. That's what's going to happen in our league. I think they've grown from
that day and gotten better from it. I'm certainly pleased at our improvement
from that day. Good question.  
  
Q. Having such strong senior leadership on this team and knowing that
any game, any loss is the end of the season for those girls, what motivation,
what special motivation does that give your team going forward as they
continue this run?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, it's good to have four seniors and it's bad to have four
seniors because you're going to hate to -- whenever the last one is you're
going to miss those kids and these four are unbelievably special. Won their
124th game today in their career. They've been off the chart. Those types of
recruiting classes you hope come around all the time, but, unfortunately, you
know, they don't.  
  
So for them, I like where they're at. I like their leadership. I like their
focus. I don't have to get them dialed in in practice or in film, they get it.
They know their days are coming down to a close at Mississippi State, but I
don't think any of 'em are ready for it to end just yet and I don't have to
remind 'em. They understand it.  
  
Q. I couldn't help but notice when you were reading Teaira's stat line
it was almost like a nonchalant nature of someone who went 11 for 11. Do you
remember the last time you watched someone do that along with the performance
on the glass and the complete game in general?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't know that I've seen anybody go 11 for 11. Teaira went 11
for 12 against Florida her sophomore year but to do it in the NCAA Tournament
game, 24 and 15 but, look, it's old hat. I said it the other day, whoever is
on the committee, whoever is voting, if she's not a First Team All-American,
then they need to get rid of the daggum award. She has done it against the
best competition in the country, all year long!  
  
I think that was her 26th double-double. It's off the chart! She does it with
two and three people hanging on her. Let's just forget, okay, she is getting
the rebounds and the points, she alters the points and a lot of times she goes
into the lane and the guards back up. Just the impact that kid has in a ball
game is incredible. Again, her and Tori, if there's two better at their
position. Let's go two on two, because I promise you they're not losing to
anybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs!

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Mississippi State - 71, North Carolina - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the NC State Wolfpack, coach Wes
Moore, Chelsea Nelson, Kiara Leslie, and Akela Maize. Coach, your thoughts
about tonight's game?  
  
WES MOORE: Mississippi State is a great team. We didn't have an answer for
Teaira McCowan, 11 for 11 from the field, 15 rebounds. Foul trouble hurt us
with our match-up there, having Akela on the bench quite a bit there.  
  
But, again, offensively they took us out of what we want to do and you gotta
give them credit for that. They really applied a lot of pressure and make it
difficult for you to run your stuff and to be comfortable.  
  
Again, great team, but couldn't be prouder of my group. All year long great
resiliency and fight. Just couldn't be prouder.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Akela, matching up with Teaira McCowan, what was the plan going into
that match-up and how did she make that plan difficult for you?  
AKELA MAIZE: The plan at first was to push her up, make her uncomfortable way
from the block so she can't just turn around and shoot it and also keeping her
off the offensive boards. The plan did change. We started the second half
sitting in front of her and trying to deny her the ball all together. So that
worked out pretty well for the most part. But, yeah, she had a heck of a game.
Congrats to her.  
  
Q. Akela, was there anything that stood out or surprised you matching up
with Teaira McCowan that you didn't see on film or learned more about when the
game started?  
AKELA MAIZE: You never know how strong a player is 6'7 until you go against
them. I think that was the biggest surprise I had coming into the game, her
strength. She was really strong.  
  
Q. Kiara, seemed like your team was scrambling in the last five seconds
of so many short clocks just to get a shot off. What made their defense so
difficult where you were in that situation the whole game?  
KIARA LESLIE: We knew they were going to deny hard. We've been working on
getting open and making sure we were available for our teammates. They played
great defense. That's what made it a little bit tough.  
  
Q. Chelsea, Mississippi State got 44 points in the paint tonight. What
challenges did they present that you weren't expecting from the offense for
you guys on defense?  
CHELSEA NELSON: They have Teaira McCowan in the paint so we expected them to
go in the paint. I think we did a pretty okay job at one point, but their
guards started scoring pretty well and they just had a great night tonight.  
  
Q. Chelsea, Coach mentioned about the resiliency all year, Mississippi
State got off to a fast start, you guys came back, took the lead and ended the
first half well. What was it like going in down 5 feeling like you were in the
game?  
CHELSEA NELSON: We were confident even though we were scrambling a little bit.
We got our composure throughout the moments of the game. It was just we had
some mishaps and kinda weren't together. We started to come back together but
it was a little too late. I think Kiara really stepped up, though.  
  
KIARA LESLIE: Thanks, Chels.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a wonderful season. Teaira is most
effective when she can go quick, when she catches and doesn't put the ball on
the floor and goes up to make a move. How much did you want to double team her
to limit her mobility?  
WES MOORE: You talking about Teaira McCowan?  
  
Q. Yes, how much do you want to limit her?  
WES MOORE: In the first half we did try to double and we just didn't do a good
job of getting there. I think part of it was we let the ball enter from the
top. Whenever we are doubling we have to make the pass come in from the wing
and our post has to get up on the high side and we didn't get that done well
enough. Consequently when it comes in from the top it's hard to double.  
  
I think that was part of it. We started the game behind, pushing up, hoping we
could help in some. Then we tried to double it, didn't get that done. Started
the second half with Akela in foul trouble. We decided to get in front of her
but then you're opening yourself up to offensive rebounds. Hard to find an
answer. She is a great player and you just don't see that size and I agree
with Akela, her strength, which I kinda had a feel for it, but maybe on film
it didn't come through well enough. She does a great job of using her body in
there.  
  
Q. Other than Teaira, how do you feel like you did on their other
players, especially Vivians?  
WES MOORE: Victoria Vivians seems to knock down about every open shot she gets
and they've got so many weapons. Johnson can shoot the three. We did a nice
job on her so proud of that. Schaefer can shoot the three; we took that away.
Morgan hit the one three. She hit a couple of jumpers. You gotta pick your
poison. We knew if we got up and showed big on pick on the ball with Morgan
that, you know, we were going to be in trouble with the pick and roll and all
that.  
  
So we tried to go under picks with her and consequently she did hit a couple
little jump shots at the foul line. She was, what, 4 for 10 and Teaira McCowan
was 11 for 11 so you try to take McCowan away. It's not rocket science there,
but you gotta give her credit. She did knock down some shots. I think for the
most part we outrebounded them, which is an accomplishment in itself. We
didn't really let anybody else go off, but obviously we didn't have an answer
for Teaira McCowan. The foul trouble was very frustrating. Even when we were
playing in front of her we got fouls, so I'm not sure exactly what the answer
is there. But, again, great player.  
  
Q. Wes, you've played obviously in your conference you have two No. 1
seeds in Notre Dame and Louisville and now having played Mississippi State
another No. 1 seed. Can you give us an idea of how those three match-up having
faced them?  
WES MOORE: I don't know that I want to sit here and compare, you know, the
rankings or whatever, but I will say Mississippi State, the way they play is
different on a couple of fronts. First of all their defensive pressure. I was
proud of our kids as far as handling the press. I don't think it really hurt
us. The half court pressure is where we struggled. We had some shot clock
violations.  
  
I was stressing really the last two weeks because Maryland tried to do similar
things, stressing keep our dribble because once you pick it up they're like
piranhas in the water with red meat. They turn it up. We needed to keep our
dribble. Our players got frustrated trying to get open, trying to make an
entry pass, trying to run their stuff. That's what's difficult. You don't see
that as much day-to-day and you don't see 6'7 every day, either. You can do a
lot of things but when they're lobbing it up to her which they do a heck of a
job on inbounds plays, they chunk it up there, there is be not a lot you can
do about that. At times you feel pretty helpless. Great weapons, great team,
Notre Dame and Louisville are great teams, also, so ought to be interesting.  
  
Q. This was a big year for you. You talked about being picked tenth and
making the first Sweet 16 in ten years. I know you're losing key kids but you
have key kids coming back. Can you talk about building on what you've done the
last two years, especially?  
WES MOORE: We're proud of the fact that we've gone to the NCAA Tournament
three out of the last four years and gotten a step further each of those
years, that's what we reminded the team of. That doesn't help the seniors a
lot except for you say they played a big part in us getting there. This year
we had to replace our perimeter, 1-4 pretty much and the kids responded, did a
great job. This year we're losing our two starting post players if you want to
call 'em that. Now we've got to replace that. It's going to be a big
challenge. You never know year-to-year how a team is going to respond, but I'm
encouraged. We've got some good players already signed coming in and hopefully
the ones we had that didn't get to play a ton this year inside will be able to
step up and play well, Nae Nae Cole had a couple of buckets today. Hopefully
we can keep it going, keep the momentum going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.  
  
WES MOORE: Thanks for being here. Appreciate it.

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
UCLA - 84, Texas - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the UCLA Bruins, Coach Cori Close, her
student-athletes, Jordin Canada, Kennedy Burke and Monique Billings. Coach?  
  
CORI CLOSE: The joy I got to see in these players' faces was priceless. I'm
not sure I've seen Jordin and Monique smile that big, but at the same time the
seniors on the other side, Ariel Atkins and Brooke McCarty are trailblazers.
We're lucky to get to play on, but I want to credit them for how they have
raised that program. Karen has been nothing but classy with me. This means a
lot to us and this program, but I want to take a second to express my respect
for those two seniors and what they have done for Texas basketball.  
  
We knew that Monique and Jordin would show up big. We knew that. They've been
consistent all year long at being dependable and showing up and giving their
best when they're best is needed, but I knew it was going to come down to
other people. This one right here. I thought she was the difference in the
game, her aggression, her confidence, her ability to communicate with her
teammates and influence plays. I thought Dean's defense was key for us and we
were able to mix our defenses because of how well she was playing. Michaela
Onyenwere coming in and giving us a lift as well as rebounding by Laj.  
  
I know that's a lot of people, but that's what we needed, other people to is
step up and support Jordin and Monique for us to move on and courageous for
the three seniors who were able to dream big and work big to put us in the
position to be able to compete to have an opportunity to play in the Final
Four.  
  
Q. Jordin, your 0 for 5 in the first half, 2 points, what changed for
you in the second half and could you speak to two years ago you were in the
same position, same game against Texas and lose that one when they come out in
the second half and make that run. Do you have a flashback to that game two
years ago? Seemed like that's when the switch was flipped for you?  
JORDIN CANADA: Speaking on 0-5 I let the game come to me. My shots weren't
falling so I tried to get my teammates involved in the first half and in the
second half let everything come to me. When they came out on their run I don't
have any doubt. We've been here before. We've been through adversity. We know
the game is a game of runs. We know they're going to go on a run but it's
about how we stay composed and I thought that was the difference between this
time and two years ago was that we were able to stay together as a team and
play team ball and there wasn't any one individual, everybody stuck together
through that adversity and that was the difference.  
  
Q. Monique, a lot was made of the turnovers you guys were able to force
and I think you outrebounded them tonight. Where did that defensive mindset
come from and were you surprised you were able to create that havoc throughout
the course of the game?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: We knew that was our strength coming into the game so we
knew we were going to rely on our defense and defense was going to carry over
to offense and we wanted to set the tempo early with our defense. I thought
our guards did that, pressuring the ball and Texas guards didn't want anything
to do with our pressure. I think that's where it started.  
  
Q. Kennedy, preparing for that game you have played them two times. How
do you mentally prepare for that in like maybe the Oregon game where the same
scenario occurred and there was a balanced effort on all sides, is that
something you talked about before the game?  
KENNEDY BURKE: Obviously after the Pac-12 tournament we focused on taking one
practice at a time. Like coming into this tournament we were like really,
really focused on that and then just following the game plan, staying focused
together.  
  
Q. Monique, this program hasn't been in this position, the Elite Eight
since 1999 I'm not sure if any of you guys were born then! But after losing in
this round the last two years what does it mean for you guys as seniors and
this program to have this break through moment?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: It was starting to feel like Groundhog Day, so we had to
turn that around. That's what we did. That's what we came to UCLA to do, I can
speak for the seniors, Jordin and I, that was our vision. It's been a journey
and we're not done yet. We can't get too high from this game. It's exciting,
but we have to focus on the next game and the next match-up, Mississippi
State.  
  
Q. Monique, for give me for moving ahead to Sunday, but you guys have
faced some big post players including Kalani Brown, and others, but Teaira
McCowan had a big night tonight. When you go against players like that who
maybe have a lot of size on you, you maybe have quickness, what do you try to
do?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Try to use my advantage against them. I like to run. Tonight
was a that can meet and I plan on having another one on Sunday night, and she
is a great post player, picking her up early, know where she is on the floor
and never lose sight of her and focus on rebounding.  
  
Q. Jordin, what talk did you have with yourself at halftime and what
adjustments did you make at halftime? How are you preparing for Sunday?  
JORDIN CANADA: I just try to stay composed. I'm the head of the team. People
tell me I'm the captain of the ship and everyone is feeding off my energy. No
matter how bad of a game I'm having in the first half, whether my shots are
falling or not I have to stay composed through adversity and let the game come
to me. There was no adjustment. I tried to stay composed and consistent
throughout the whole game.  
  
Come Sunday, Mississippi State is a great team. They have lost one game this
whole year, so we know it's going to be a battle. But I think it comes down to
us and what we need to do to execute our game plan and staying together as a
team and doing what makes us great and playing to our strengths and I think
that's what it's going to take for Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, I know you said you thought Kennedy Burke was the difference,
but when they take the lead for the first time in the game and Jordin scores
the next 9 of 11 for you and her ability to get out in transition and pressure
them and in a minute to go she makes that circus shot over her head. How good
was Jordin Canada tonight?  
CORI CLOSE: She is good in all facets. Today in the second half you see the
spectacular, but you have heard how she has grown in her leadership, the
mentality, her basketball IQ, her poise, her defense away from the ball as
well as on the ball, her ability to shoot the three. I thought that was key.
She was able to get to the rack later on because she hit the open threes out
of transition. I think she has been so deliberate to work on all facets of her
game.  
  
I think she is just hitting her stride. I think she is going to be a better
pro than she is a college player. I've said that for a long time but she is a
complete player. I was proud of her because it sorta was, I agree with
Monique, it sorta was Groundhog Day. Jordin was struggling to get going and so
was Brooke McCarty. Last time she tried to put everyone on her back, and that
is when everyone panics is when she said I've got to do this by myself. I
thought she showed so much maturity and I know I'm biased but I believe she is
the most complete point guard in the country.  
  
Q. A few minutes ago, the end of the drought for the Elite Eight was
alluded to and another UCLA coach won his first national basketball
championship here. Could you talk about the significance of not only ending
the Elite Eight drought but doing it in a city that has historic significance
to UCLA basketball?  
CORI CLOSE: I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know that and honestly that's
really humbling. Coach Wooden mentored me for 15 years. I could get choked up
talking about it but the best message I've gotten is Nan Wooden called me
after our second round game and left a message and said, "Daddy would have
liked watching this team and Daddy would have been proud of you."  
  
That would be such an honor to be able to do that. Forget me as a coach, my
life has been deeply affected by him and his influence and his time. That's
really humbling. Right now my focus is just serving these young women. Coming
up with the best game plan, trying to spend the time to get our mental space
and emotional space in the right level place and I'm just absolutely thrilled
to be able to have an opportunity to work with and for them for another day.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like you all have grown even since ten days ago. Can
you comment on that if you feel that way, what you attribute that to, is there
chemistry happening?  
CORI CLOSE: It's interesting opinion I think that we always challenge our team
in one form or another, to every day you show up, you have to be committed to
give and to grow. It's never about one person. It's never about you. I
remember at the very beginning of the year I said this year will come down to
are we willing to put the team above ourselves and do with we have an "I will"
mentality. I will prepare and I can be counted on. I think that's exactly what
has happened the last ten days. I think everybody has shown up going how can I
grow more? How can I grow maybe two more possessions in the next ten days.  
  
That's the interesting thing about the women's game you have time between the
conference tournament and the NCAA Tournament and if you didn't win your
tournament some things got exposed at a high level and as disappointing as it
was I think our players were willing to look in the mirror and go okay there
is no pity pond here. You can swish your feet in the pity pond but it's time
to get out and grow and get after it. That's exactly what they did.  
  
Q. Before the game, you talked about how it was important for guards to
step up and rebound. You had rebounds from Jordin and even Japreece and
Kennedy. How important was that?  
CORI CLOSE: It was huge especially because we played so much zone. Those shots
that take place and we're on the strong side, that guard is the one that's
gotta go -- the weak side guard has to box out Hosey or Ariel Atkins coming
from the weak side of the floor. We had crashed the weak side. I didn't want
to start in zone because I thought they would be aggressive playing north to
south and if we could force uncomfortable shots and get them out of rhythm and
I didn't expect to play it as much as we did and the reason was I was worried
about our guard rebounding. They did a heck of a job. I thought that Japreece
and Jordin and Kelli Hayes gave us strong possessions. So I think it was the
reason our guard rebounding was the reason we could stay in that zone as long
as we did.  
  
Q. Cori, there were two upsets by Pac-12 teams with Oregon State and you
guys. I wonder if you could address that because it's been a very good
tournament for the Pac-12 and your initial thoughts on the match-up with
Mississippi State and the difficulty of facing Teaira McCowan.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah, I think the first part of your question being about the
Pac-12, it makes you a better coach, it makes you a better team. It prepares
you for March. We've been saying that all of us from 1 to 12 about how we make
each other better.  
  
We had three overtimes in the last couple weeks of the season. It's just, you
know, really the varied styles of play and all at such a high level. You have
to prepare so differently on multiple occasions and we play this format in our
conference. I think that is an advantage. We play this format. We're used to
quick, one-day turnarounds. When I coached in the SEC it was very new to have
a one-day turnaround, that almost never happened any other time during the
year.  
  
So the combination of the elite and depth of play in the Pac-12 as well as the
format and the styles of play I think really -- all of us coaches talk about
it gives us crate confidence going into March and the numbers haven't lied for
the last three years the Pac-12 teams have done well in March and we're
thankful to the whole Pac-12 and the Pac-12 Networks for how much exposure
they give us and we're able to keep recruits home that's been a huge thing.  
  
My initial thoughts on the match-ups, is I've got a lot of film to watch. We
should have brought Tony in for that; he has the scout. This year we played
Texas in the close scrimmage and last year we played Mississippi State in the
closed scrimmage.  
  
So there is some familiarity. Vic does such a great job. His defense has
always been spectacular on the perimeter and for him to add a rim protector
like Teaira McCowan. Can we hit enough jump shots? Can Monique hit enough jump
shots to be able to pull her away from the basket because then we can get
other match-ups going and it will be varied styles. They were shooting the
three so well and they shoot a lot of them and that's what also makes you
spread out and it's going to be very important that not only do we chase 'em
off the three-point line but we control possessions and rebounds and that's
how we can get out and use our speed.  
  
If we to take it out of the net all the time because they're executing and
getting high-percentage shots or open threes, it's going to be hard to use our
advantage of letting it be, as Mo said, a track meet.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks so much.  
  
CORI CLOSE: And thank you guys for covering all of us.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
UCLA - 84, Texas - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Karen Aston,
Brooke McCarty, Ariel Atkins and Jatarie White. Coach?  
  
KAREN ASTON: I think the first thought I have is that UCLA was really good
tonight. Sometimes as a coach you want to blame your kids or try to figure out
what went wrong but I think a lot of what went wrong was that UCLA was really
exceptional tonight. We were a little uncharacteristic with the basketball.  
  
I thought we had inopportune turnovers, and way too many in the first half in
particular. Then I thought we came out after halftime, made a really good run
but took some inopportune shots and maybe tried to home run it a little bit
instead of making them play defense longer which led into transition points
for them. Our transition defense was uncharacteristic today as was the
turnovers, but I think you have to give UCLA credit and Jordin Canada credit
for the way she managed the basketball team. Again, sometimes you have to give
the other team credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, can you give us the idea of the message at halftime? Seemed
like you came out fired up and were you surprised with how UCLA responded to
your reaction and the big run coming in the third quarter?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Our message at halftime was to stick to our game. We hadn't
played our type of basketball for the first half and so the beginning of the
third quarter we be kinda got a flow and then into the run.  
  
Q. Jatarie, you guys have been so good rebounding the ball this year and
they beat you on the boards tonight. What did they do so effectively
tonight?  
JATARIE WHITE: I think tonight they did a lot of outhustling us on the boards,
getting those extra loose balls. They don't wait for the ball to come to them.
They'll get it. I think that's what they did better tonight, rebounding.  
  
Q. Ariel and Brooke, besides the rebounding that Ms. White referred to,
any other ways that you felt like UCLA was exceptional tonight, like what
Coach said?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think they did a good job of capitalizing on our turnovers.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: I thought they flipped the floor and made us work on defense
as well and if they didn't get a shot they went and rebounded their ball. It
just all goes back to turnovers and rebounds.  
  
Q. Brooke, I wanted to ask you about Jordin Canada, 0-5 in the first
half. Then she comes out and I thought she was the difference in the second
half. What changed for her? Did you notice anything? How hard was she to stop
once she got going in the second half?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think in the first half she ran the point guards
facilitating a little bit and in the second half she decided to take over and
when she gets going it's going to be a tough match-up. So you have to be ready
to bring your best game and in the second half she managed the ball really
well and took over the game.  
  
Q. Brooke and Ariel, how did this match-up differ from the one that you
had in the scrimmage last fall with UCLA?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think that over the year everybody is going to get better
but I think they did a great job of working on their offense and getting the
ball in the hands of people that are going to make shots and stuff like that.
So I think that and then the fact that they can capitalize like Ariel said on
our turnovers.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think this they have gotten better overall, over the year, I
think both of us have. But the difference to me is their chemistry on defense.  
  
Q. Brooke and then Jatarie, with the 15 turnovers in the first half was
there a sense that you weren't giving yourself a chance to win the game
because of the way the ball was being thrown out of bounds and everything?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it was uncharacteristic of your team but when you have
15 turnovers in the first half and keep turning the ball over they're going to
capitalize off our mistakes; I bet they had 30 points off our turnovers. We
have to take care of the ball better.  
  
JATARIE WHITE: I agree with Brooke. We didn't do in what Coach said making
sure we ball faked in and made the right pass at the right time. I think
that's what made the difference as well.  
  
Q. Ariel, we've been talking about this for several weeks. You knew that
win or lose this was going to be the end as seniors. What's going through your
mind right now know that go your Longhorn career is over?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I'm very grateful for my four years that I've been here and I
wouldn't change it for anything. I am upset that we went out the way we did
this year just because I had high expectations for our team which everybody on
our team should have high expectations for each other. But I'm very grateful
that I came here and I got to wear this Texas uniform. It made me sit back and
realize there is something bigger than myself. I'm just very grateful.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I am truly blessed that I have had this opportunity. I think God
opened up a lot of doors for me since I've been here and the stage is set for
our younger players to take off. When we came here with a mindset we came here
to help the players that were here with us and before us to get Texas back to
what it needs to be.  
  
I think the stage is set and I think they have every opportunity to be what
they want to be. They're just going to have to work for it. They know what to
do. It will be up to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, I think you used the word "home run it" can you say in what
fashion they were trying to home run it? Was it the long, touch down-type
passes or something other than that?  
KAREN ASTON: I think in the first half they were doing a tremendous job of
handling our transition and we're used to getting easy buckets in transition
and I thought they were flooding the lane and we missed some easy ones I
thought in the first half and then we forced some that weren't there, where we
should have flipped the floor a little bit more and we talked about that at
halftime.  
  
We obviously got some transition buckets in the second half, but I still think
that there were times that we, even in the second half, tried to shoot too
quick when it wasn't really there.  
  
Again, they probably didn't have to play defense near as long as we did the
entire night. Again, that's part of our personality is to take quick shots,
but it's also something that we have talked about repeatedly, which is in the
games that we have struggled in. That's been kind of the bugaboo with this
team, not to have the discipline to reverse it and shift the defense, for two
reasons. One of the reasons is to get them out of position and the other is to
be able to offensive rebound and those were two categories that we were not
our best in. You don't get 'em out of position so therefore you don't wet to
the foul line which all of those things we did not do today.  
  
Q. As I told the players, Brooke and Ariel, we all knew this was going
to be their last go-round, win or lose. Thoughts and memories of what they
have done and brought to the basketball program?  
KAREN ASTON: Yeah, I mean, I've said this many times in the last few weeks,
and I said it to them in the locker room. I'm not sure. There may be in my
lifetime as a coach that I have coached more talented players but I don't know
that I will coach two better role models, two better leaders, two better gym
rats, two better workers than Brooke and Ariel. They've been model student-
athletes at Texas. We've talked at length about how they've helped us build
our program and they'll have some time to reflect. They're hurt right now, and
it will hit them at some point, the impact that they have had on our program
here at Texas. It's been an absolute joy to coach those two for four years.  
  
Q. Cori was saying she has had some conversations with you about how
similar the things that you two have done in terms of programs that had great
traditions but you had to come back in and rebuild a lot of things. I know
this is difficult for you but knowing her as you do, this is their first Elite
Eight since '99. Can you talk about the job she has done there?  
KAREN ASTON: She has done a tremendous job. It is interesting. There are a few
coaches, three of them in this regional, myself, Cori, Vic that our journey
has been similar in that we were long-time assistants for iconic coaches,
really, and we've kind of grown up in the profession together. So you have a
very mutual respect for, I guess, what I would call it as paying your dues. I
think that Cori is one of those coaches that did that and then she does it the
right way while she is there. She is an incredibly tireless recruiter. I think
we're similar in the way we recruit.  
  
I think that she appreciates the history of women's basketball. Those are all
things that because of who we worked for and the time that we've spent in the
game, we both have an appreciation for the game and a respect for the game and
the people that were there before us.  
  
So that's probably the biggest similarities. I'm obviously very disappointed
that we lost, and you know, it's never a time when you lose, especially your
last game, to be negative about your own team at all because I've really
enjoyed this team and the journey that we have been on. But I will say that
they looked like a really hungry team and one that had not been there in quite
some time by the way they played.  
  
Credit absolutely goes to them because I thought that the 50/50 balls and a
lot of the things we talked about they looked a little, for whatever reason,
hungrier tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. Thank you.

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Blair Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33278)

### [Victoria Vivians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28376)

### [Morgan William](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30442)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by student-athletes, Blair Schaefer, Morgan
William and Victoria Vivians.  
  
Q. First for Victoria, this being your third straight Sweet 16, how has
the approach changed from the first two years?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It's changed a lot because you know my first time we was
just going in here and, um, I feel like we weren't as good as we are now. We
was just happy to be in the Sweet 16. Now it's like an expectation, like, we
do this on the regular and we need to come out here and finish and try to win
a National Championship.  
  
Q. Blair, the game against Oklahoma State being as tight as it was how
can that prepare you for what you may face ahead?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I think tight ball games show us how important every
possession is and how important it is to focus on the details for every single
play that's called by our coaches and every single defensive possession that
we have to go through. Our coaches always talk about you can't have a wasted
possession, you can't know what a play is, you can't know how to run it, the
timing of it. I think it's going to teach us that we need to be in every
moment and we need to be focused and locked in on every play.  
  
Q. Morgan, Vic was talking about how your role has had to change at
times with this team, whether he needs you to score a lot, whether he doesn't
need you to score much at all. I'm wondering what that mindset is like for
you, how it can be different depending on what the defenses are giving you and
depending on how everybody else is maybe shooting that game?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I would say it's different. You know, from last year. Last
year we didn't have a ton of scorers like we do this year. I know we have four
people in double figures, I think, so like you said, I've got to stay
aggressive each game, though. Some games I feel myself just giving passes and
not being aggressive and not coming out attacking but the last game we played
I was very aggressive. I got to the basket. I took what the defense gave me.
So it was really about reading the defense and finding my teammates so we've
our energy, this team, it's pretty hard to stop.  
  
Q. Victoria, for you guys last year you had never been to the Elite
Eight in program history now that you are that team you're facing a team that
hasn't been to that stage for 20 years. What's it like being on the other
side, being the team that's been there before and have that big stage
experience?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It feels good. We are probably more confident than we were
last year, even though they were confident, but I feel like we're more
confident being in the same position and we know what to expect. We know
what's going to happen. We shouldn't be shocked or surprised about anything
because we've done it before and I feel like just being on the other side it's
a plus.  
  
Q. Blair, the emotion of the last game, the seniors last game inside the
Hump. How has it been transitioning from that game and refocusing to the Sweet
16?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I think that game was really special for all of our seniors,
but at the end of the day our season is not over, so there is not a lot of
sadness, really, that's going on, because a lot of our fans that were at that
game are going to travel for our games to come. It's not like it's the last
time we're seeing them or them seeing us but it was definitely bitter suite
seeing the Hump packed for us. It was really special.  
  
Q. Blair, when you guys referenced that experience helping you in these
games and knowing what to expect, can you think of end game situations or
circumstances it particularly makes you better in at all when you have been in
these big games before?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I think when you have not been at this stage before it's
really easy to be knocked to have your game because you don't know what to
expect, you've never been in those situations before or in tight ball games.  
  
But I think since this team has been here before, it gives us a sense of kind
of comfort, knowing that we've handled these tough situations before. We've
handled distractions before, went how to focus and lock in, especially on
teams where people think that you're the underdog, like we were last year.  
  
But I also think this year is different because we have a target on our back.
We have a No. 1 seed by our name so we have a job to do.  
  
Q. Blair and Victoria, if you guys could answer, one thing Vic talked
about is when you have a point guard that's literally like a bulldog out there
and aggressive on the ball how much that helps the rest of the defense, how
much it energizes. You guys have watched Morgan do that for a long time. I
wonder if you could talk about how her play impacts or inspires you?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I think when you have an aggressive and smart point guard on
the ball it gives the four people behind her so much confidence to play hard
for her. She is doing her best to get the point guard from the opposing team
off their game and distract them and it's our job to be denying our players,
to be helping her out. If she can't see something we have to be those people
that see that for her because her back is to us. Her game definitely inspires
the rest of our team to play harder because we see that there is, like, a
deeper passion and a deeper energy motivation to essentially beat the other
team.  
  
Plus, she has a lot of great experience on offense, too, and she is so
athletic and just quick that she can make a lot of decisions instantly and we
have to feed off of her, which is nice.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Playing behind her, I feel like we feed off her. However her
energy is, is how we react. If she is aggressive, we are aggressive and
playing behind her has made us a better team because she is the aggressive
player and I feel like if she is on her A game all of us are going to be on
our A game. If she is playing defense on the ball we are trying to help her
and deny the ball and not give up anything easy. So I feel like we just feed
off her.  
  
Q. Morgan, Coach Schaefer was here a few minutes ago and he said Morgan
doesn't always have to score, but if we need 41 from her I think she is
capable do it. Do you think you're capable of scoring 41 on a given night?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I was going to say, yes, sir. Probably like a week ago he
asked me if I could score 41 and I was like, yeah, if I shoot the ball. But I
haven't been shooting the ball as much. Last game I shot 17 shots, and I
haven't did that all year. If my teammates need me to score, I will, but
hopefully we equal up to 41 points but whatever my teammates need that's what
I will do. But, yeah, I'm capable if I need to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are snow joined by Mississippi State Bulldogs coach, Vic
Schaefer. Coach your thoughts about this upcoming tournament?  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thank you very much. We're obviously awfully glad to be here.
It's been a special season with a bunch of special kids and we've got a little
bit of a heavy heart this morning. We won't have Roshunda Johnson with us
today. She is attending a funeral back in Little Rock; she lost her
grandfather. So we've got her in our hearts and minds today and hopefully
she'll be able to rejoin us, but certainly our thoughts and prayers go out to
her and her family. We miss her and love her very much. We'll keep them in our
thoughts and minds.  
  
Obviously, coming off of two great games at home, tremendous crowds, over
20,000 in Stark Vegas for two games, and so proud of our fan base and the
support that our kids earned over the course of their careers. We have four
really special seniors on this ball club and they've done a great job leading
our kids, leading our team, and being ready when the lights come on.  
  
We're playing a really good team, obviously in NC State. They've got great
guard play, Konig can run the show and obviously score for them. Rebound it,
too, from there, which is unusual sometimes. Maize is a tremendous talent,
plays really hard. Defends, smart, physical, just a tough kid. Leslie is
explosive, big guard on the wing, and Chelsea Nelson is a double-double
machine.  
  
They're a little like us, just a hard-noticed defensive team, they bring two
athletic kids off the bench with some size as well and another big guard. Wes
has done a great job and he's been there one less year than I've been at
Mississippi State, I believe. Known him a long time. Have respect for him and
know the kind of man he is and the kind of coach he is and he's done a great
job there. We've got our hands full and we're excited to be here and excited
for the opportunity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about what you did last season and the men's team
is playing very well at Mississippi State. What's it like in Starkville right
now getting that basketball fever?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's really special. I'm so happy for our guys, Ben has done a
really good job. Those guys have really done a 180. Earlier in the year, and
speaking from what I see it goes back to guard play. He's done a really great
job coaching those guards and getting them, you know, ready and changed 'em in
some ways which changed the team. He's getting great guard play from Peters
and Nick our freshman who is just so special. It's a lot of fun, there's a lot
of buzz and talk about basketball in our community.  
  
Obviously in women's basketball it's really special. It's unlike most places
in the country. I say that all the time. There's a handful of places right now
across America that have the excitement that we have in Stark Vegas for
women's basketball and had two back-to-back sellouts in the NCAA women's
tournament, and that's part of building a program. It's not just the X's and
O's and the wins and losses I say your fan base. You're going to see tomorrow
night we're going to have a lot of maroon in the building. People making
plans, they have been for a long time.  
  
Look, I'm just going to tell ya, when we did lose our first one, people around
our community thought the sky was falling and I guess it's better than the
alternative, but that's the expectation that we kinda have right now. Again, I
would rather have that than the alternative, but, you know, it's a lot of fun.
Sure is.  
  
Q. Vic, talk about two things: Put in perspective how much Morgan has
grown as a player, the littlest person on your roster but obviously had such a
big impact. Then what are the main things you look for when you are recruiting
point guards in this day and age?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, Morgan obviously her role has changed this year in that
she has some more weapons and she doesn't have to score as much as she did a
year and two years ago. With the offense that we've been able to put together
at four positions she has become a great facilitator. Her assist to turnover
ratio is off the chart all year long and she has embraced that. I think you
saw in the second game in the Regional, I told her going into the ball game
she can dictate the whole game and I needed her to. I thought she did on both
ends. It's one of her better defensive games she has had if a long while. She
really did a great job, locked down on their kid that destroyed us the first
time we played them, Goodwin. So Morgan's role has changed, but I think she
can still fall back -- if I need her to go get 20 I think she is capable of
doing that. I told her she had 41 in the Elite 8. I think you're still capable
doing that. I hope I don't need her to do that, but if that's what they gave
us I think she is capable of doing that.  
  
As far as what we look for at that position you're looking at a prototypical
point guard for Vic Schaefer, somebody who is quick, heady, smart, somebody
who understands the game and somebody that can defend. You know for us, you've
watched us play, we're pretty much an energetic, pressure, defensive team. If
you're soft on the ball it's been my experience in 33 years you're going to be
soft behind the ball. If you're tough, physical, aggressive on the ball,
everybody behind the ball gets excited about do get same. It's just human
nature. When you see somebody out there picking up the ball full court and
getting after it, well, it makes you think to yourself. Morgan is playing
pretty hard on the ball I guess I'll get up here and take this wing away. It's
just the way it is. For us it becomes a very important role and Morgan has
been great. Jazz is in that same mold. Myah Taylor who we are being afforded
the opportunity to redshirt is the same way.  
  
So those kids are all very smart, heady, understand the game, understand who
needs the ball when they need it and yet they embrace their role defensively,
understand the importance of what they do.  
  
Q. Will Roshunda Johnson be here for the game?  
VIC SCHAEFER: She will. We anticipate her being here, yes, sir.  
  
Q. It's one thing to make it to the Final Four one year but every team
is different even if you have all your players back. How have you been able to
maintain this level of excellence the year after the Final Four?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, it's really been a unique year. We lost two kids
early in the season that in my mind were going to be starters on our team. We
lost Jacaira Allen in practice. We lost a kid who got up and left and went
home. Both those kids in my mind going into this season were probably going to
start for us. We haven't talked about it much. It's nothing to dwell on. For
us it's the next person up, next woman up. For this year this team which has
made us so unique and special is our maturity with the four seniors, they know
what it's about. They've been in this stage so the experience of playing in
our conference night in and night out, all those kids have played big minutes
for us coming into this year.  
  
The other piece that I don't think anybody saw coming was how good we were on
offense. We averaged 82 points a game most of the season. Our average margin
of victory in the SEC was 24 points. That's off the chart! I thought last
year's team was good! We were 13 points better going 13-3. This year it was 24
and that's just amazing, averaging 80-something points a ball game, holding
people to 55, 56 and I don't think we're that good defensively.  
  
But that's been this team. We've really embraced and taken advantage of some
things that we can do on offense, we shoot the ball extremely well from three.
Obviously you've got the big piece inside in Teaira and our point guard has
been really, really good. This team is much different than last year but
different in a good way in a lot of aspects. It's a special group, no question
about it. They've played not only with the target on their back of being in
the Final Four a year ago and playing for the National Championship, and as
the year has gone on this year, Rick, they've played with the target on their
back of being undefeated. So they've had two targets on their back.  
  
It's just really been fun for me to see them play night in and night out and
see how they've handled that. I mean, that's hard to do. Let's be honest.
That's really hard to do.  
  
You know, up until we get beat in the championship game in The Southeastern
Conference tournament, they're playing with an undefeated -- that's a heavy
anchor that you're carrying around and they handled it like a champ. I'm
really proud of them. It's a very special group. By the way, I was born in
Austin.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
VIC SCHAEFER: It was back in the early 60s, which Texas was beating A&M every
year about Thanksgiving. My dad was an Aggie one Monday afternoon. They played
on Thursdays. He was an engineer and every Monday after Thanksgiving they
would decorate his office in black toilet paper because he was an Aggie living
in Austin. He came home one afternoon and he said, honey, pack our stuff.
We're moving. And we moved to Houston when I was 2 years old, but I was born
across the street from the drum, Breckenridge Hospital.  
  
Q. A couple days ago you spoke about the idea of appreciating the moment
a little bit more than you did last year in this situation. How has that
balance been for you so far?  
VIC SCHAEFER: What?  
  
Q. How has that balance been for you?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's easy to talk about for me. It's a hard thing to do. I'm
always worried about the next one and I never get past the next one. I worried
about Oklahoma State last week and now NC State. It's difficult for me because
I want so badly for these kids. I wanted that win so badly on Monday night for
those seniors to go out on their home floor undefeated in front of their home
fans to win that last one, I just wanted that so bad.  
  
That was a really special night, a special moment for those four seniors and
for me, personally. So you move on to the next one. My staff and I have been
getting ready for this one, cramming for three days. You know, when you're a
bad college student, Will, that's all you know is cramming! That's all you
know is staying up all night and getting ready. So I'm pretty good at it and
we've been cramming for three days and, you know, we gave the kids Tuesday
off. I felt like they needed it. That's normal for us. We have had two-day
prep every game in the SEC. It's normal for us and our kids will be ready, I
think.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will let Coach go and bring student-athletes up.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs!

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Chelsea Nelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30399)

### [Akela Maize](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34694)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the North Carolina State Wolfpack student-
athletes, Chelsea Nelson and Akela Maize.  
  
Q. Welcome to Kansas City, guys and congratulations on your season so
far. Talk about how good of a rebounding team you guys are. When you look at
the stats you're one of the best especially in defensive rebounding in the
country in the top three and you two have been leading the way. Talk about how
you've been so successful with that?  
AKELA MAIZE: I think we're so successful because we have so much athleticism
on our team and we use our athleticism to the fullest potential and push each
other in practice, we do rebounding drills back-to-back and we're on the floor
going after each other and we have to cut the drill because it's on to the
next person.  
  
We really do focus on rebounding. We take a lot of pride in it and talk about
it every day and how rebounding wins games. That's something that we really
value.  
  
CHELSEA NELSON: Even with the guards Coach always challenges them to go into
the paint. Even if they go there, maybe the ball will fall their way and a lot
of the times, you know, Akela or Kaila will get a hand on the ball if we can
get a tip they can go and grab it. That's a really big thing that we focus on
as a team, everybody going to the paint and rebounding.  
  
Q. I was at your last game last year. It was heartbreaking for you guys,
I remember. Were you fueled this season by how close you were last year?  
CHELSEA NELSON: I'm sorry?  
  
Q. Were you motivated? Fuelled by what happened last year, being a
second away from advancing?  
CHELSEA NELSON: We were really motivated because Texas is a really great
program, a great team and we really did feel like we had that game and we came
to play it was a great game. So coming into this year we knew we wanted to go
further in the tournament, and also in the ACC tournament and also here in the
NCAA we knew we could. I think this year we have a really good defensive team
that helps when we play a really good opponent. So, yeah, we're so motivated.  
  
AKELA MAIZE: Like Chelsea said, the motivation is always there. Coach, at the
beginning of the season he talked about how we were a rebound away of winning
that game. So we go into these games with the rebounding mentality as we
mentioned earlier and with a defensive intensity that, you know, this could be
the final game. But if not, then this could be the game to get us to the next
level. So we think of it as that way.  
  
Q. You guys have five starters that average 9 to 13 points. What's that
like knowing they have the confidence they can score?  
AKELA MAIZE: It feels great. Any given night somebody can step up and score 20
points, things like that. So there is not a lot of pressure on anybody to try
and force shots, things like that. We can let the game come to us, either on
the defensive end getting steals, you know, or offensively something is
working for one particular player we can keep going to that player. Teams have
a hard time shutting all of us down. That I think is our upside.  
  
Q. Talk about Kaila's growth as a point guard this year after playing
behind Miah last year. How have you watched her grow. How she has been able to
direct the offense for you guys?  
AKELA MAIZE: I'm proud of Kaila this year especially like you said, playing
behind Miah last year, I think she learned a lot from Miah and she brought
that into this year along the with the confidence, going to the gym, working
on her craft, things like that. She has been a leader on the court as well, so
I'm proud of Kaila.  
  
CHELSEA NELSON: A lot of teams know Kaila is extremely quick and that's the
first thing people do is sag on Kaila and even in practice we would sag on
Kaila and she would never shoot it. We were like you need to be able to add
that to your game and we gave her confidence and even if she missed we were
like keep shooting and she doesn't second guess her shot at all now. I think
confidence is really key, a lot of times that's why it goes in. Her being able
to direct our offense and having confidence in us. It's awesome to see her
grow and continue to grow.  
  
Q. Akela first, Chelsea second, you guys were picked tenth by the
coaches in the preseason poll and you lost a bunch of seniors last year. At
what point in the season did you guys believe you could be sitting here today
as a Sweet 16 team?  
AKELA MAIZE: In the very beginning of the season me and Chelsea set that the
out to be our goal for this year. We believed the whole season that we could
be sitting in this spot that we're in right now. There was never any doubt in
our minds that we couldn't or weren't capable of being a team that, you know,
we had with the strength that we have in each player on the team this year.  
  
CHELSEA NELSON: Yeah, even though we did lose those four seniors, a lot of
people were coming up to us and saying, we think you guys have a better team
this year than last year; and I'm like, oh wow, that's a lot of confidence! We
have so much athleticism this year and just like the new players coming in,
Kiara and everyone developing their game. That's really helped us.  
  
Q. Guys, first off, congratulations, I'm proud of you and what you've
been able to do for the team. No career is smooth from freshman through your
senior year. You both have faced your share of adversity, Chelsea with the
loss of your mom. Akela to me you are one of the most improved players in the
country over the last couple of years. When you think about the adversity you
faced, what you have accomplished and how you've grown since the first day you
set foot on NC State's campus, explain what that has been like for both of
you?  
CHELSEA NELSON: Crazy, seeing from my freshman year within the team how each
year we've accomplished bigger and better things. My freshman and sophomore
year we didn't make it to the NCAA Tournament. I never knew what that felt
like so I really kinda didn't care. My junior year when we made it and lost
and just that feeling it was crazy and I knew we had to come back and through
all the adversity, the support I've had from my family and friends and NC
State community and them always pushing me and wanting to get better and not
giving up and we're at the Sweet 16.  
  
AKELA MAIZE: Like you said, we have faced a lot of adversity, me, with my
freshman year, especially with injuries throughout my career has really been a
step back for me. Seeing where we are now it's incredible. Each day I thank
God for giving me this opportunity to play this game and to allow me to grow,
not just as a basketball player but as a woman through everything that I've
been through.  
  
So, yeah, it's just a great experience and to see Chelsea grow from her
freshman year, you know, it was great watching her and being beside her
through it all.  
  
CHELSEA NELSON: I want to thank God, too. I'm sorry. I wanted to say that.  
  
Q. Chelsea, just from hearing Coach Moore speak today he seems like a
guy who is energetic and passionate. What type of a coach is he?  
CHELSEA NELSON: Oh, man! (Chuckles.) I think it's crazy. I mean when people
see him in the game they're like, oh, gosh, he is tough! He is tough, but
everybody is like does he always yell? I'm like, yeah, he does. But Coach
Moore is awesome and he's extremely understanding and he's been there for me
through my freshman year and it's weird, I've known him since I've been in
high school. He's been at the ACC. He's awesome and extremely caring and loves
to win and hates to lose. That will rub off on us. We really do try to make
him proud and just try to do what he says so he doesn't stress out and so his
hair doesn't turn gray or go bald. He told me by my senior year he would be
bald from how much he used to yell at me. He's not!  
  
AKELA MAIZE: I know that Coach Moore loves us dearly. He says that often. You
have to look past the yelling and the screaming and the red color that shows
up on his face and listen to what he's saying because he's trying to help us
every time he helps us. Whether it's defensive intensity or whatever, it's
going to make us better not just for NC State but for the future. I appreciate
Coach a lot.  
  
Q. To win tomorrow, Akela, your biggest challenge will be to what?  
AKELA MAIZE: To keep No. 15 off of the boards. She is a very well-coached
young lady and she is very good on the boards. That's going to be my biggest
task.  
  
Q. So you mentioned not making the tournament two years ago and last
season being devastated by the loss. Have you heard a lot of messages from
those players, from those two teams before this game here in Kansas City or
prior to the tournament?  
CHELSEA NELSON: We hear from Carlee Schumacher, Miah Spencer, Ashley Williams,
Dom, the seniors. They're like Final Four bound. We know it! We believe in
y'all. They have seen us play and they're excited for us. They have confidence
in us. Giving us messages every day. So, yeah, we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the North Carolina State Wolfpack head
coach Wes Moore. Coach, congratulations on your season and your thoughts about
the tournament?  
  
WES MOORE: We're obviously excited about being here, excited about being in
Kansas City. Our head football coach Dave Doeren is from here. I spent a few
summers here. I had an older sister that lived in Blue Springs. Used to go see
the Royals, Mayberry and Lou Piniella. We're excited about the challenge ahead
of us. Mississippi State a great team, year ago made an awesome run and this
year only one defeat. So we know we got our hands full but, again, we're
excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, I was at your last game last year. Can't see another team that
could have been more devastated because it looked like you had it until the
last second. Were you fueled this year by what happened last year?  
WES MOORE: The thing is, we have kind of a whole new team, almost, in the
sense that we lost four starters that were four of our top-five scorers. These
kids obviously most of 'em were here and on the team but they didn't play
quite as a significant role as they are this year.  
  
But you're right. I grew up in Texas and that was a devastating loss down
there. Again, it's a new year and new opportunity and we've moved on.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Schaefer was talking about all the things he likes about
your program but he says you guys are similar teams. Is that what you think?  
WES MOORE: I don't know about that. That's a great complement if he's
comparing us with them. Obviously they have so many weapons, and of course Vic
Schaefer, his calling card is his defense and they're going to get after you
and try to take you out of your stuff that you want to run.  
  
So we have, this year, really hung our hat on defense and rebounding. We
haven't always been beautifully esthetic offensive team, but I'm proud of how
our kids have kind of bought in to trying to take away another team's strength
and trying to control the boards and when you do those things, I also was in
the coaching shadow of Pat Summitt, and she says offense sells ticket, defense
wins games, rebounding wins championships, and I firmly agree with that. I'm
proud of how our team has bought into those priorities.  
  
Q. With Kayla, she had the injury, what would have been her freshman
season and last year playing behind Miah, this year she blossomed, it seemed
like and talk about her counterpart, Morgan William and how that match-up will
be because I think they're both good point guards.  
WES MOORE: You're right. I'm proud of her, made herself a threat from the
three-point line and when you can do that, when you can knock down the shot
enough to make 'em come out and guard you as quick as she is it opens up a lot
of things not just for herself and for her teammates.  
  
Morgan William stirs the drink for Mississippi State. She creates a lot for
her teammates, almost a 4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, so we've got to keep
her guarded and not let her set the table for everybody else.  
  
Q. Wes, the MSU players and Coach Schaefer talked about how their prior
experience in these stages was going to help them this weekend. I know you all
are going for your Elite Eight trip in almost 20 years. What do you tell them
about how you're doing it?  
WES MOORE: We haven't changed a thing. It's been, hey, we've been playing well
the last couple of months, we were picked 10th in the ACC. We started out 1-3.
It's a tough league, we rattled off seven in a row. I think we've won 14 out
of our last 17 games and that's all we've talked about this postseason is keep
doing what we're doing. Nothing is different, nothing's changed, play defense,
rebound. We've got to do a better job of taking care of the ball. That's our
focus so we don't worry about all the other stuff.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Louisville, you beat Florida State, can you talk
about how they hang in a moment like this against those teams?  
WES MOORE: I think you hope that the league -- again, the ACC has had great
year, No. 1 RPI league in the country, obviously Notre Dame and Louisville,
both number one seeds so we've played some really good teams and Mississippi
State is obviously a really good team. I think we just have to, you know,
remind ourselves that we've seen this and, again, try to keep everything
routine, do what we do and hopefully, play well, shoot the ball well and have
a shot at it.  
  
Q. Wes, you were talking about rebounding earlier, you're third in the
country in rebounding rate, you're getting 65% of your opponent's misses,
obviously Chelsea has a big part in that and Akela. What do you think is the
key to that and how does that translate against a team that has Teaira
McCowan?  
WES MOORE: Good point, kind of a game changer. Chelsea and Akela are both
athletic and they go get it. They do a pretty good job and we usually do
rebounding drills or two every day and that's a point of emphasis. I always
say that even on a bad night if we limit the other team to a one shot of
possession we're going to have a chance. I think a testament to that is going
into the regular end of the season we do not have a loose to a top-50 team
outside the RPI so we have taken care of business and done those things on a
consistent basis. Teaira McCowan, you're right. She is so strong and she is
able to ride you under some and at 6-7 if she rides you under a little bit she
is able to reach over you and get the rebound. We're not only going to have to
box out but deliver a blow on her and not let her should have us under because
she is one of the best offensive rebounders I've seen.  
  
Q. You were talking about being tenth in the league before the season
started and you talked about how many seniors you lost. At what point during
the season did you think that you had a shot to be in your seat right now?  
WES MOORE: You know, again, that's a good question. I don't know. I think I've
believed all along we could be better than what we started out and where
people picked us. I think there might have been confusion. Maybe they thought
that was a national poll they were voting on. I'm not sure. Even my athletic
director, she is probably going to get tired of me telling this story, but
when I had my meeting before the season and she asked me my goals and
expectations. After I shared those with her she said, wow, that's pretty
ambitious, isn't it?  
  
And there was a couple of times this year I walked down the end of the bench
during the game and said, "You might have been right." But this team battles.
We were down 26-1 to Louisville and with three minutes left in the game we
were down 4 and had the ball.  
  
So, again, they're not going to quit. They're going to be there, keep
competing, and that's what I'm really proud of in regards to this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you did a good job, congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Brooke McCarty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30450)

### [Ariel Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28410)

### [Lashann Higgs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30859)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the student-athletes from the University
of Texas Longhorns. Question for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Brooke, I want you to start with this and Ariel jump in afterwards.
The two of you have been around for four years. Jordin Canada and Kelli Hayes
have been around for four years. You know each other, you have gone up against
each other. How much fun is it to play against players like that that you have
known.  
BROOKE McCARTY: It's definitely exciting. They were great players. Definitely
played them freshmen year, sophomore year. But everybody's game has grown.
It's pretty cool to see how everybody has gotten better over the years and how
their team dynamic has change and they've gotten better with that. It's just
fun to get to play each other all through these years.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I would say the same thing. We have grown in our game and I
think people in general to play against people that are just as competitive.
It will be fun.  
  
Q. Lashann, three years ago you were the star player in high school in
Austin. Japreece was a star player at the same time. Do you have any
recollection of playing against her? What do you think of her as a player at
the time?  
LASHANN HIGGS: We've known each other for years. Especially since we were
pretty close, in the same area. I would say that we didn't really play against
each other much, but we worked out a lot together and I just know how
competitive she is.  
  
I just think the game tomorrow will be fun knowing we both worked on hard to
be at this point. I think it will be a very good game.  
  
Q. Brooke, Karen was just saying about how you bought into a vision, you
and the other seniors. It's been a long time since Texas has been to the Sweet
16 before you got here and you've advanced all four years in your career. Talk
about the pride in that. Also, you as the point guard, as she said the
"quarterback" you don't necessarily like that title but you've come to be
comfortable it, I think?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Coming in we didn't really know what to expect. We just kind
of trusted her plan and she was so passionate about it. How could you not
trust that? So just to see where this program has grown to and how we could be
a part of it is just amazing itself. I think now we're thinking, like, this is
where Texas should be, you know? Back then we were kind of just playing and we
were going to be as competitive as we can and see where it takes us but now
this is an expectation.  
  
So I think just that process has been pretty amazing. As a point guard, like I
said before, when I came in I didn't know who to expect. I just was kind of
blindsided by everything. But I had a great point guard in front of me,
Selena, and the things that she would tell me and that Coach would tell me
were just things I could build off of each other. Up to this point I think
I've taken on that role of I can get my team to do and we can do what we want
to do if we're focused. So I think I've just trusted her plan at the same
time, because she is hard on her point guards and I have to be that second
coach out there, a reflection of her. I just take it day by day, but I know at
the end of the day I have to be a reflection of her because my team needs that
from me.  
  
Q. For Lashann, Coach was talking about how rebounding was so important
against Arizona State what they did against Nebraska and UCLA another big
rebounding team and how the guards like to leak out and get in transition. How
hard is it to balance trying to get a fast break opportunity while making sure
the team has the rebound for sure?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I would say that it's important to try and focus on what the
team needs at the moment. We can't expect the post players to do everything
because they do a great job of boxing out, so it's our job to help them out on
the boards and go in and try and get as many boards as we can.  
  
Q. Ariel, you and Brooke get attention and rightfully so, and Lashann
doesn't get as much. But I think she has had a huge impact on this team. Talk
about what impact she has had this year and when you're gone next year how do
you feel about Texas being in her hands?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Well, Lashann has grown tremendously from her freshman year to
sophomore year to now and a lot of people don't get to see the behind the
scenes work that student-athletes have to put in to become what we end up
becoming at the end of all of this. But her growth has been amazing. She has
grown in ways that you can't really put into words. She has taken it to heart
on focusing what she needs to get better at to help this team. Like you said,
she probably doesn't get enough attention but that doesn't bother her at the
same time because she knows what she does for this team and what she brings to
us every day. I'm completely fine with leaving the program in her hands. I
think she is completely capable and I think she is going to grow into a great
leader for this team.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Ariel took the words right out of my mouth. Lashann doesn't
care she is not in the spotlight which I mean, at this point who could care
whether they're in the spotlight. What she brings to the table you can't put
into words. It comes from just her accepting her role and accepting that she
is going to bring it to the table no matter what, no matter the situation, no
matter what.  
  
So I'm really excited to see what Lashann has in store because she still has
another year and when she has that leadership role I'm amazed at the things
she'll be able to accomplish.  
  
Q. Ariel, you played at the hallmark high school basketball team in the
state of Texas. You were used to going to the state tournament year after
year. How much is the sense of urgency, the state tournament being the Final
Four of Texas. You haven't had a chance to experience the Final Four as a
college player. How much have you and Brooke and the seniors talked about how
important it is this last go-round to get to a Final Four even though there is
work in front of you here?  
ARIEL ATKINS: To be honest with you, we have not talked about that. We made
that mistake a while back and we looked so far ahead. We didn't see what was
right in front of us. So we have honestly not even talked about that because
we have a game tomorrow that if we do not win that could be my last game in a
Texas uniform. So we are not talking about that and not thinking about that.  
  
Q. Brooke, obviously Coach was talking when it's tournament time you
guys started to see that Kansas City was a possibility. You played at Kansas
and Kansas State. What's it going to be like? Should have a great crowd
tomorrow!  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's great that we are close to home and Shug is from
here and her family doesn't really get to come often, so to see her face light
up when we're in the Kansas City bracket and she was excited that her family
would be here and for us, most of us are from Texas, so our family gets to
come to every single game. But when we go somewhere and kids who don't have
that every single game it makes you want to play harder because they don't get
to experience what we get to experience every single game. I think it's
exciting.  
  
Q. Ariel, you've gone against UCLA in your career but you were teammates
with Monique Billings and Jordin Canada on the under 23 team that won. What
was it like being teammates with them? Did you get to know them particularly
well when you guys spent that time together?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I did get to know them better. We played together and knowing
them from McDonald's game in high school and you got to see them as people not
just basketball players. So that was neat to hang out with them in a
completely different environment than what we are used to, as far as being in
Japan and not the United States.  
  
Q. Brooke, we talked about your offense and Karen did but also
defensively how you have evolved as a player. I think the point guards here at
this regional all carry a big load defensively for their teams and kind of set
the tone. Is that something you have taken pride in doing as well?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. Like you said, the point guards, they set the tone
for the team. I think just coming out and trying to be as aggressive
defensively as these two are, it just kind of falls on you. I don't think it's
a big load but I think it's something that you should take pride in. I know
when I first got here, I really didn't take pride in defense. I didn't really
see why we talked about it so much. Now when I look back on it I do see why
defense is such a big thing. It's just a way to get stops and if you get stops
that leads to other things. So you have to have some pride in it. It makes the
flow of the game better.  
  
Q. Lashann, one word that folks around the program always look to you to
talk about was the word "confidence" and how you developed confidence and play
with confidence and players struggle with confidence and all that. Can you
discuss a little bit how that was a challenge for you early on and what it
ultimately has done for you as a player in developing your confidence within
your role with the team?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I would say it definitely had to start off with trusting the
process. As a freshman you don't really see how well you can do into the
future, how much you will accomplish. I would definitely say trusting the
process and the level of work you put in. Because the level of work you put in
always determines the outcome of your accomplishments. I would just say gotta
continue to work as hard as you can and trust the process and worry about what
you can control and don't focus on what you can't control.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by head coach, Cori Close from UCLA. Coach,
welcome and congratulations on a great season.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you. It's great to be here and thank you for all the media
coverage, all the people doing the work behind the scenes. I know these events
don't go off the way I know this will without a lot of people's sacrifices, so
we appreciate it. We're excited to be here, excited to compete. I think it's
going to be a great match-up and we're very grateful.  
  
Q. You were a point guard in college, a very good one. We've got some
really good ones here with these four teams. Can you talk about what it means
to be a college point guard especially at this level of the tournament when
you are in the Sweet 16? And also, in particular with yours, Jordin, and how
much she has meant to this program?  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you, Michelle, for mentioning me in the realm of these point
guards here. I don't know if I'm in their league, but I do think being a point
guard especially at this level, I think I probably wouldn't be a coach if I
not hadn't been influenced to have to think the game as well as play the game
in very intense situations.  
  
I think at this level that coaches do not determine what happens as much as
point guards do. Point guards have to be able to communicate in the most
pressurized moments. They have to be able to direct. They have to be able to
prevent things. They have to be able to make plays. They have to have a sense
of what their team needs from them.  
  
Really it starts with them on both ends of the floor. Specifically with Jordin
Canada. I'm not sure you're going to find a more complete point guard.
Obviously I'm biased because I work with her every day but if you look at the
numbers and watch her play and watch her influence on all of the dimensions of
the game, I think she is spectacular. I watch film with her every week and now
I'm not leading the film sessions, she is. What are our best looks here? What
would you have wanted to see different in this situation? And we're really
talking the game, and I am learning as much from her as I hope she is learning
from me. So her intellect and her ability to understand the game I think is
first.  
  
Then her ability on defense to be able to guard multiple people. We've done a
lot of switching this year and we have never once gotten beat with her
switching on to a post player. She'll find a way to do what she needs either
on the ball or away from the ball to help our team get a stop. And then
offensively, I used to say her weakness was her outside shooting; and now
she's been shooting are over 40% from the three-point most of the year and her
assist to turnover ratio. There was a couple of years ago she had a dream to
be a top-5 level draft pick and we looked at every point guard in the top-5
for the last several years and we had their statistics down.  
  
I was in a home visit the other day and I pulled that sheet out and she has
met or exceeded those statistics on all three fronts. I'm proud of not only
the basketball player she is but how she has grown as a leader, and I do think
she is a complete point guard at this point.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask you about two players. Japreece three years ago
was a big star in my town. Lashann Higgs, exact same thing. Did you recruit
both of them? If you did, what were your thoughts as a recruiter? If not, then
what did you like about Japreece coming out of Texas Tech.  
CORI CLOSE: Absolutely, but actually it's funny. I recruited Lashann Higgs. I
didn't recruit Dean out of high school, so I have a better knowledge of Higgs
in terms of her growing-up years and in terms of watching her play. Loved her
mid-range game her ability to guard. It's been documented we played each other
in a closed scrimmage earlier this year and I just was impressed with her
improvement.  
  
We wanted her. We would have loved the chance to have had her out to
California and she is a really good player and Texas is lucky to have her. I
did recruit her out of high school. Japreece, I did not. When she became
available and we were in need of another point guard I went and watched all of
her film at Texas Tech and her ability to be creative with the ball, she is
fearless, has great instincts. She loves the game of basketball. She is all
over social media like most kids these days and she'll post something with two
computers and a TV going with three different games. She just can't get
enough. I think this day and age that's really a lost art and I think that
Japreece's love of the game is what leads to her creativity of the game. It
was a great find by us and I'm really, really thrilled she is a Bruin.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously UMBC got a lot of talk with the upset last weekend
against Virginia, but in the women's tournament with the 3 seeds it's
difficult with Florida State, Ohio State, Tennessee losing for the first time
every at home. What does that say about women's college basketball, the upsets
and the competitiveness?  
CORI CLOSE: I think that's a good news/bad news. Obviously, I used to coach at
Florida State so I was tuned into that game. It made us nervous. We were the
last game and our players were aware of that. They were talking that, hey, we
will not be that team. Lock in, execute our game plan and we were very aware.  
  
But in a global sense, I'm thrilled for our game that there's more and more
players and more and more teams playing at a higher and higher level.  
  
You know, I think the women's game, actually Michelle and I have talked about
this before, but we have got to be committed to things bigger than ourselves
and there has been talk through this tournament about exposure and thank you
all for covering our game. But we need those competitive games. We need more
and more teams to bring that kind of excitement. It's really important that
all of us in our women's game, all the way down to grass roots is having a
mindset of how can we grow the game? How can we grow interest? The bottom line
is it affects young girls' lives. It's not just about exposure and not just
about money. The statistics don't lie. It makes a difference in the lives of
girls to be involved in sports at this kind of level. We need to be committed
to continue to grow the game and this kind of tournament, having parity,
upsets, exposure, communication about it, that's really important for us.  
  
Q. Texas is obviously an exceptional rebounding team. What's the message
for you guys to be able to compete on that stage?  
CORI CLOSE: They are exceptional. It wasn't just from their bigs. Their
guards, Ariel Atkins, Lashann Higgs, all of them are great rebounders. I think
we know what we're going to get from our forwards, Lajahna Drummer, Monique
Billings, Michaela Onyenwere, Lauryn Miller, all of those people have to
rebound a high level and cumulatively. The key factor for us is going to be
Chantel Horvat, Kennedy Burke. If we're playing zone our guards being able to
rebound on the backside. For us to be able to mitigate that advantage and
their strength of theirs all of our guards are going to have to be involved in
rebounding every single possession.  
  
Q. Obviously, in this tournament format you can play two games in two
days. You've done that a couple times this year where you played Baylor, UConn
within three days and a couple times in conference against top-25 teams. How
can those familiar experiences help you out?  
CORI CLOSE: That happens a lot in the Pac-12. That's where the structure of
the Pac-12 helps you because the rhythms of that are something that we're
really used to and there are so many good teams. I think we have the most
teams in the regionals or above right now and we have for the last several
years, so this is a normal thing. I do think it gives our players a lot of
confidence. This is what we do. This is what we prepared for. These are the
rhythms in which we are used to, but at this point you better be glad you're
playing or you're not going to be playing any longer. You better be competing.
No excuses. I don't care if you've had five days in between or one day in
between you have to have the mental stamina and the desire to prepare at a
level to get yourself ready and that's how you earn the right to prepare
again.  
  
Q. Cori, if you look at these two programs, there is a long gap between
UCLA Sweet 16 appearances until this senior class, you coming in and the
senior class. With Karen in Texas it was the same way, about a decade. Can you
compare the two programs? They had to regenerate themselves.  
CORI CLOSE: First of all, I give Karen so much credit. A lot of people have
compared our careers. We were assistants for a long time. We had a chance to
take over programs that did have a rich history.  
  
You know, try to honor that history but at the same time build on it. I think
actually her and I have talked about this, what a privilege! What a privilege
to be able to honor people that really blazed the trail, that really, you
know. Denise Curry is with us on this trip. Ann Meyers was at our last game. I
know the history of Texas people and what she has done to bring back and
invest in the history of Texas, and I think there has got to be a sense of
humility and pride that we get to walk in the path they blazed and we get to
honor them by building upon it.  
  
I can't speak for her on this, but that was a big motivator for me when I went
back to UCLA. Coach Wooden poured into my life for 15 years and I got to be
mentored by him; and Annie Meyers I've known since I was an athlete at UC
Santa Barbara. These alums have come back and we had just as many men's
basketball alumni at our second round game as women. There is a privilege and
humility of being able to build on a path that was so courageously blazed.
It's a privilege. It's the first time actually in UCLA history that we've gone
to three straight Sweet 16s. Mostly that credit goes to the choices of these
courageous young women. But to be a part of maybe even a small part of leading
that charge, it's humbling and I'm deeply grateful for the legacy that came
before me.  
  
Q. Coach, outside of UConn, Baylor has been the biggest bully on the
block, so to speak. I mean that in a nice way. How did you guys beat Baylor?  
CORI CLOSE: We shot the ball really well. They tried to go under screens and
Jordin Canada was just really good on reading the ball screen and we got high-
percentage shots and we were able to mix our defenses. They're so good when
they get into a rhythm at getting Kalani Brown on getting touches and we were
able to mix our defenses and make things hard for their guard play.  
  
At that point they had a lot of new guards. That was the fourth game of the
year, really early on and their guard play was very young outside of Kristy
Wallace. I think we took advantage of that a little bit. We trapped some ball
screens, went zone, you know. We did a lot of things that tried to make it
difficult for them to find the rhythm to find Kalani Brown on a consistent
basis. We didn't outrebound them and she scored points, so I can't even image
why I'm saying that. I was like we did a heck of a job. We held her to 33, but
we were able to make their guard decisions difficult and we got into our
transition game and turned them over a few times. We have to win the
possession game to be successful and we didn't win it on the rebounds, but I
think we won it on the turnover margins if I remember correctly. But that made
a big difference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Kelli Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28324)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by our student-athletes from UCLA, Jordin Canada,
Kelli Hayes and Monique Billings. Welcome ladies.  
  
Q. Kelli, you guys are going to your third straight Sweet 16 prior to
the one when you were sophomores, this program hadn't gone in a while. How
would you compare your feelings to going into that Sweet 16 game versus the
one that you have now going into this third one?  
KELLI HAYES: I think there is less anxiety because we've been here before.
Three times in a row that's a good luck charm, but it's also something that
not every team gets to the and we've done it and we say there is a legacy we
want to build at UCLA and we've built it. No program in UCLA basketball
history has made it three times in a row and we've done it and we're not done.
There is more ease with the maturity and growth we have had and the
experiences we have had to get us to this moment and where we're at now. If
anything I think we're ready. I know we're ready to conquer this and exceed in
ways that we haven't before.  
  
Q. Jordin was talking to Coach, and she mentioned with the other 3 seeds
going down that got your attention. What was your mindset when you saw the
other 3 seeds go down, a little more excitement to get the game going?  
JORDIN CANADA: It's the tournament, so we know there is always going to be
upsets, but Christian, our video coordinator, brought it to our attention. We
didn't have a great game against American. They stuck around throughout the
majority of the game and we didn't play to our potential. Seeing the upsets
that day and coming in having a mindset that that wasn't going to be us and we
wanted to conquer bigger things. So by that we just had to play our game. When
we played against Creighton we came out strong and played consistent
throughout the whole game. I think that's how we need to play the rest of the
tournament.  
  
Q. Jordin, Cori was talking about when you guys watch film together she
learns from you. You have become adept at breaking down film. She also talked
about you sat down a few years ago and said this is what I need to do to
become a better point guard. Talk about that process, how the two of you have
worked together because I know she played point guard, but what that
relationship has been like and how that's helped you grow?  
JORDIN CANADA: Our relationship at the beginning was up and down at first. I
came to her I sat down and we had a conversation. We talked it out. How can
she make me better as a point guard, the things that I wanted to do to get
better and from there we just kind of grew our relationship and that came with
watching a lot of film together, just seeing ways, what she is thinking and
what I'm thinking and how we can combine our ideas to help our team as well as
to help me grow.  
  
But our relationship wasn't always great. But now I can definitely say that
we're at a great spot right now, and I really love Coach and what she has done
for us and for me as well. I can say it wasn't always a great relationship.  
  
Q. Kelli, Coach was talking about how important rebounding is going to
be in this battle. You know what you're going to get from Monique and Lajahna.
What do you do to compete against rebounds against Texas?  
KELLI HAYES: When we watched film this morning Coach said we need guard
rebounding. Obviously we are going to get what we get from Mo. She has been
consistent. But people like Michaela coming off the bench. She is a huge spark
for our team. When she comes in the game she is resilient at getting boards.
Doesn't matter who is in front of her, or people like Chantel. She comes off
the bench and gives us great spark of getting the ball, or me, Jordin, KB, JD.
We need to get those boards and it's not always easy. Sometimes guards are
bigger than you or you're going against a post player but at the end of the
day we have this thing called passion play and passion play. One of the
passion plays are assist box outs and maybe I could box out a player and I may
not get the ball, but I box out so well that Jordin gets the ball. Those are
ways we can build the rebounding margin. Those are little things that we can
focus on and every possession matters. Getting every rebound on offense and
defense and knowing that the ball is ours versus just like staring at it, we
have to go and get it.  
  
Q. Monique, you and Jordin played with Ariel on the under 23 team and
the scrimmage, too. You have familiarity with Texas. They're such a good guard
team and rebounding team. What are the biggest challenges you face especially
as well as you know this team?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: That's a really good question. I think we match-up pretty
evenly in all positions. They're fast and athletic and that's how we describe
our team as well.  
  
I think it's honestly about who wants it more. They play with a lot of passion
so we have to be able to match that and maybe exceed that. I think that's how
we have to plan on starting the game. We have to set the tempo and we just
have to come out on fire and just come out with a fire about us that they have
to catch up to us. I think that's the plan going into the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordin, Kelli was talking about the tradition and history. Where you
went to high school is not very few from Pauley Pavilion right? 5 miles in
traffic?  
JORDIN CANADA: 10 to 15 minutes.  
  
Q. What's it meant to you to be this team that's been the first to go to
three Sweet 16s? When you came here it had been a while. What does that mean
to you?  
JORDIN CANADA: It's amazing, an honor and a blessing to be a part of this
group. That's what I came here to do. I came here to create a legacy with UCLA
basketball and with the girls I played with, the girl that I'm with right now,
next to me. It's an amazing feeling that we set out what we came here to do,
and to know that we're a part of a legacy that we created and to be a part of
UCLA history is just something that you don't come across every day, and I'm
just thankful to be a part of it and to represent, you know, where I come from
and to represent UCLA and west coast basketball. No matter the result of what
happens, just knowing that what we did here at UCLA is something that no one
can take away from us and I think that's what's most important. It's not just
about the legacy that we left, but it's also the impact that we left on little
girls' lives and other people, honestly, adults as well. Just being able to
impact other people, I think that's what's most important. Just to be a part
of something great is an honor and a blessing and I'm thankful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: KANSAS
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+KANSAS+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Karen Aston the Texas Longhorns coach.  
  
KAREN ASTON: Excited for our basketball team and program to be in the
regionals again in particular in Kansas City where as the bracket came out our
team was excited about the possibility of playing in Kansas City just because
of location and the ability for fans and families to be able to potentially
get in the car and drive to see some good basketball.  
  
I'm excited about that. I think Kansas City is a great host for women's
basketball. We've obviously been in the Big 12 tournament in years past and
love the environment that Kansas City brings for women's basketball. We really
appreciate what everybody's done thus far.  
  
Our team, I'm really, really excited about. As I looked back on film of the
first two games I thought that our team played at a pretty high level and
played with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. When you look forward to the game
against UCLA, I think that's a common theme that will be necessary to be able
to compete with a team of the caliber of UCLA. We're looking forward to the
competition and, again, super proud of our basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Brooke's growth and what she has meant to
this program and when you look historically where she rates I think it's
pretty high; and Jordin Canada, UCLA's point guard. I think both of those
players have had huge impacts on their programs.  
KAREN ASTON: Absolutely. Those two point guards committed to their respective
programs, I think, to fairly new coaches at those institutions; and I know for
us, Brooke bought a vision from our coaching staff and she knew that we saw
something really special in her when maybe others didn't. I think she trusted
that vision. What she's done to elevate our program is pretty priceless,
really, and I would say that about all of the guys that we recruited as we
first took over at Texas.  
  
I think you have to look at the point guard position, and most often they
dictate sort of how your team plays and how competitive your team is. You
know, what Brooke has developed into, Michelle, as much as she might not even
want to admit it, she's sort of the quarterback and she is the personality of
our team. When we are flowing really, really well, Brooke is playing really
well and she has a little smile on her face sometimes when we are really
playing well.  
  
When she struggles, sometimes we struggle. So I think that is a reflection,
probably, of a point guard. Your team usually goes as they go. Again, not
discounting a lot of other players on our team; but she is, as a lot of people
call point guards, she is the "head to the monster."  
  
I would say the same thing about Canada. They mirror each other as far as what
they've done for their programs. Obviously, Cori would talk about Jordin, but
we have played each other so often you can see the play of Jordin and the play
of Brooke and they left their high school teams as prolific scorers. They have
had to evolve into leaders and Brooke has had to figure out, okay sometimes I
need to facilitate and when do I need to take shots and take over. She has
grown in her decision-making of what is the timing of when to take a shot and
when to get other people involved.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask you about two players. Lashann was a great high
school player in Austin three years ago. Japreece Dean was a great high school
player in Austin three years ago. What was your thinking as a recruiter when
you were looking at the two of them? Did they have any rivalry? I think they
played in different leagues or districts?  
KAREN ASTON: I think you would probably have to ask them if they were rivals.
I definitely saw Japreece play and the thing that strikes me right offhand,
you know, just the immediate evaluation of her is how competitive she is. She
proved that during her time at Texas Tech and has impacted UCLA's team
immediately. Lashann and Japreece are different. Japreece is a point guard
that is playing off the ball right now because of Jordin Canada, and she is
definitely a point guard. I think Lashann is sort of the opposite of that. I
think she is a scoring guard and a combo that most often is the most
comfortable at the wing position where she is now. I'm glad you brought up
Lashann because our seniors have garnered so much attention that it's hard to
not put her up there with them as far as how impactful she has been on our
team this year and the difference in her as a basketball player from a
cerebral standpoint and a skills standpoint.  
  
She has just put so much time in and when I say "time" I'm talking about she
has put time in to grow. She has become such a great decision maker and she
has just really been one of the difference makers on our team.  
  
Q. Heading into that Arizona State game you were talking about how they
handled Nebraska on the glass 49-27. Then you guys go out and outrebound them
40-19. What does that say about your game plan and capitalizing and executing
that?  
KAREN ASTON: I think execution is a great word. We knew they were a great
rebounding team. We watched them play live and the coaching staff saw film on
how good rebounders they were and the team aspect they brought to the table.  
  
I thought that we countered that. When you look at Brooke having ten rebounds
it's not because she is skying over everybody it's because the other players
are doing their jobs and she is sort of sweeping in and picking up the loose
balls. I think it has to be that way when you're playing a great rebounding
team. It has to be a great team effort. Sometimes we get caught because we've
been fairly good rebounding all year long our guards will get caught leaking
out because they want to run in transition and you just can't do that in
postseason play. You can't do that against really, really rebounding teams and
we're going to see that again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Karen, obviously this isn't a conference game, but you've seen UCLA
enough, you had the scrimmage with them before. Is the preparation almost akin
like you would prepare for a conference game simply because of the personnel
and the knowledge of what Cori has and her program?  
KAREN ASTON: I think it's a good comparison, and I think one comparison is we
played Oklahoma December 28th or whenever that was and then the last
conference game. A dramatic amount of time between those two games where the
teams had changed dramatically from the first time we saw them. Obviously it's
been many more months since we played UCLA in that scrimmage, and they have
additions to their team. Japreece does make them very different. We have a
subtraction in Audrey and an addition in Joyner, so we are both very
different. But there are aspects that you could say these are reminders of who
they are, but on scrimmages you don't spend a lot of time on scouting. But
there is some familiarity. These guys have been playing against each other for
a long time. They know each other.  
  
Q. Coach, four in a row for you to be in this situation. A lot of people
in Austin think that this particular team is better equipped to make it to the
Final Four than the previous three. Maybe it's the way they're playing now or
maybe it's the experience factor with the two guards. Your thought on the
chances of making it to the next level?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I definitely don't want to discount the team two years ago
that was defeated by UConn because I thought that was a pretty good basketball
team that unfortunately was in the same region with Breanna Stewart and I
thought it was a team that was playing at a high level in postseason play, and
I do think our team is now.  
  
Yes, the difference could be that we have three experienced guards, where that
team, Brooke and Ariel were very young and they were impactful on that team
but they were freshmen. So our three starting guards have had a lot of
experience and scenarios and that's very helpful. You look at a player like
Jatarie White who I think gets overlooked for the impact that she has had on
our team. For me as a coach I feel strong about how she has anchored our team
this year.  
  
Even though she's new, she had some very valuable experiences at South
Carolina. She is mature. She is new to our conference and new to what she is
doing right now, but she is a very mature basketball player that understands
game plans.  
  
So maybe we are a little bit more mature, but I think that it's always the
same once you get to the regionals. It's a pretty high level of basketball.
Competition is extremely high.  
  
We can talk about our two seniors and UCLA is going to talk about theirs and
how much experience they have, so I think it's going to be a great match-up
and very likely intangibles and role players will be the difference.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked at the outset about Kansas City being a great host
for women's basketball. Can you share your thoughts about the Big 12
tournament returning to Kansas City?  
KAREN ASTON: I'm very excited about it. Again, I'm saying that knowing that
somewhere down the line the men could move. I understand that's not a given
that both tournaments will be in Kansas City, but I had the privilege of being
a part of Texas when I was an assist be assistant coach with Jody when the
tournaments were here and I just remember it being a very good experience. I
don't have anything negative to say. I'm not disappointed that it's coming
back. Do I wish it was in Dallas all the time? I'm not going to say no because
Dallas is closer to Austin, but I do think I have a very positive memory of
playing in Kansas City and the overall experience that we all had in the Big
12 and in particular the experience of possibly having the fan basis be in the
same place. As you talk about it, you want to put fans in the stands. You want
the student-athletes to play in front of a lot of people.  
  
I think if that's the way that that happens, then that's positive for not only
the student-athletes but for our league. I'm excited about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck.

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 76, Oregon State - 43  
  
JEFF WALZ: Just first off, I just want to congratulate Scott and Oregon State.
What a remarkable year they had. Very, very good basketball team, very well-
coached, first-class. I had the opportunity to get to know Scott, as I said
the other day, out at USA Basketball, and just really impressed with how he
does things and what they do.  
  
You know, unfortunately in this game, one team gets to be excited and one team
it's tough. But there's no doubt in my mind that Oregon State will be back
competing, like he's built that program into a very, very good ballclub.  
  
And then, you know, again, I just always want to thank Tom Jurich. 11 years
ago, whoever thought this would be possible. To be sitting here going to our
third Final Four in 11 years with a ballclub that when I was hired, it was
like, I just want a program, I don't want a good team, I want a program that's
going to compete on a national level, and gave us those resources to be able
to go out and recruit and do that, and now we're sitting here with Myisha
Hines-Allen being our senior, and we have not had one players who's finished
four years and graduated from Louisville that's not played in a Final Four.  
  
I think a program that had never been to a Sweet 16 until 11 years ago can now
say every player that's finished four years has had the opportunity to play in
a Final Four. I think that's pretty impressive.  
  
And then to these young women here, I can't say enough about their character.
The basketball stuff is there, that's great. It's their character. It's who
they are. It's what they do off the floor. You can't be a great basketball
team and have the results you want if you don't carry it over in your personal
life. And we truly do have wonderful young women who are wonderful role models
to my children, to Coach Purcell's children, and that means more to me than
winning basketball games.  
  
When my daughters were out there in the yard, and Lola tells me she's Lola
Hines-Allen today, and Lucy, you're going to be Lucy Durr, and then she tells
Mom, you're going to be the official, and Dad can still be the coach, you
know, it's the impact that they have on their lives that means everything to
me.  
  
It's a wonderful experience to have the opportunity to get back to a Final
Four again, but I want to thank them for being the people they are.  
  
Q. Asia, what would you like to say back to the fans back in Atlanta,
those who helped you when you were playing ball on that level there in high
school, middle school and others, and how they helped you get to this point
along with the coaching staff here?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I don't know where to start, but I try to represent my
hometown pretty well as a person and as a basketball player. Man, I go home,
we just played Georgia Tech back in December, and I mean, the place was just
crazy. My fans, my family, my friends, they were just unbelievable, and I just
want to thank them so much.  
  
I mean, they've been with me since I was like in the sixth grade, up into high
school at St. Pius. They would travel all across downtown just to come and see
me play. That's pretty crazy, and I truly thank them. This isn't just about me
and my teammates, this is about our fans, our family, our coaching staff.
Without them, we can't do it.  
  
Q. Myisha, talk about the adjustment at halftime that resulted in the
third quarter. I think you outscored them 28-12 and really took control of the
tempo in the game at that point.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, we knew we were going to have to win the game on the
defensive end. If we were able to get stops and go in transition, we were
going to be confident. Our shots were falling in the second half, and I mean,
it all came down to defense, on the defensive end. If we wanted to win, we had
to stop them. They are phenomenal at shooting threes. They have a great post
player, so it was going to come down to if you guys want to win, if you want
to go to a Final Four, we have to get stops.  
  
Q. Asia, the Oregon State coach a few minutes ago came in and said that
the last thing he told his team was remember how fast Louisville comes at you,
and it appeared that they didn't really adjust to the speed that you play. Can
you tell early in a game if a team is just going to be back on its heels and
it's going to turn into a game like today?  
ASIA DURR: Right, I think we pay attention to every play, especially in the
first quarter, first two, three minutes of the game, we could definitely tell
how they're going to play, how they're going to guard us. We definitely try to
play a fast pace. We try to push the ball up the floor. We have great posts
who know how to run. I mean, everybody runs on the team.  
  
I think we did a great job of doing that again today. That was huge. You know,
we love to sprint the ball up the floor, pass the ball up the floor, so that's
pretty much what we try to do.  
  
Q. Sam, two days ago, Marie Gülich basically carries Oregon State on
both sides of the court and leading them over No. 2 Baylor. What was your job
today in guarding her, and what was your mindset in going up against her to
keep her from doing that again?  
SAM FUEHRING: For me, it was to limit her touches and to keep her off the
boards. She's a big girl, so I mean, she's got like three inches on me, two
inches, so I've got to use my strength to keep her off the boards.  
  
But I feel like I did a pretty good job. She's got really good footwork, and
she had a lot of moves, but I kept moving my feet, and I think that helped the
team today.  
  
Q. Just a question for all three of you: You scored 24 points off
turnovers, they scored zero. You only had three turnovers. What made this the
kind of game where you only committed three turnovers?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I mean, we took care of the ball. We took shots that we
normally take. We weren't forcing anything. So I mean, that's why we were so
good. I think defensively, too, and offensively, because we didn't turn the
ball over. We cherished every possession that we had.  
  
ASIA DURR: I mean, I would say the same thing. Every time you take care of the
ball, you get more shots, so I think that was key. Last game we turned the
ball over, I think, nine times in the first half, so Coach Walz was really
talking to us about that, you can't turn the ball over nine times in the first
half, which is not good. Coming into this game we were trying to take care of
the ball more so we'll be able to get more shots.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, I feel like we took care of the ball, and towards the end
of the game we used the time for us. We did our pace, and at the end of the
shot clock, we just shot, and it went down.  
  
Q. Myisha, you had three rebounds today. Was that a testament to them
keeping you off the glass, or was it because your teammates were also making
big rebounds?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I think it was my teammates. I think we out-rebounded
them, too. Everyone was getting rebounds. But yeah, my teammates, they did a
good job rebounding the ball.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: They boxed out well, too. They hit me hard on box-outs. So they
boxed out well.  
  
Q. When you got here as a freshman, you played in three NCAA tournaments
before, never got this far, and when you got here, they were coming off of two
years before a Final Four. How do you see the program build to this moment, to
where you are right now?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, the program was already built, so it was basically
when I came in my freshman year, we had five seniors, so it was basically, if
you want to be successful, if you want to keep this program afloat, you've got
to do what you've got to do. You've got to do what the people behind you
already done, and that's play hard, play Louisville ball, and I feel like it's
just me left and AC, but I feel like we've done that, and we've gotten great
people in here to help us out with that, and they've bought into what
Louisville basketball is and what Coach Walz is wanting.  
  
So I mean, that's why we're so successful and we're here.  
  
Q. In that first quarter, you all rotated a bunch of people on Gülich
and really just kind of frustrated her. How much of that was just seeing
something that maybe just putting smaller players, rotating people off of her
might frustrate her?  
SAM FUEHRING: I mean, we were just taught that as long as we play hard defense
that she may not be able to get a shot off. Jaz did a really good job of
getting under her. They over threw the lob. Myisha helped inside, because we
knew if it got to her in the game, it could have been a close game.  
  
But I feel like we rotated well, we played hard, and that's how we stopped
her.  
  
Q. Myisha, since you played UConn, this team has gone on a pretty
dominant run. What has changed since then, and how much better prepared would
you be for an encore performance against them?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, well, first, before we even get to UConn, we have to
play either Mississippi State or UCLA, so that's our first focus. It's not
getting ahead. It's not jumping ahead or anything like that. It's one game at
a time. But I mean, once you play UConn, you see how they play. They're a
great team. They're a dynasty. So I mean, you see what the coaches want from
them. You see how they perform. You see how they run the floor every time.
They rebound the ball really well, and they run their plays.  
  
So once you're able to like play against that, you know -- and you're in a
game with them, too, you know that you're capable of doing it, too, and I
think after that game, it boosted a lot of our confidence up because we didn't
know where we were standing, and I mean, that's a high team. So I mean, when
you get to play them, you can see where you rank with them.  
  
Q. If you can talk about Arica Carter and the job she's done as the
season has gone on?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I can start that off because me and AC came in together as
freshmen, and AC has came a long, long way. Me and her laugh about it all the
time. Her freshman year was hard. Coach Walz got on her a lot, but he knew
that she could be great and she could do the things she's doing now. So AC --
and then the fact she sat out last year, too, and she learned all the plays,
she knew what to do, she was coaching people on the sideline. So AC is just a
coach at heart. She knows the game, she knows what she has to do for this team
to be successful, and I'm just happy that the team is doing so well because
it's a testimony to her, because she's a big part of it. You know, me, Asia
and Sam, too, we get a lot of credit for a lot of things, but AC is the one
who runs the team and makes sure everyone is in their right spots and knows
what we have to do, so it's a credit to her.  
  
Q. When you're not in the game, especially at the end when you're out
and it's becoming apparent that you guys are probably going to win, what's
going through your mind in that moment, and what little things about the game
are you still noticing? Are you just kind of exhausted at that point?  
ASIA DURR: Well, you try to soak it all in, but then again, you're still
focusing on your teammates because the game is not over yet. We can still
score, still get stops. We still want to pay attention to the game, but I
think at that point like everybody was definitely like truly excited. That's
basically it.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of people know about the job Myisha and Asia have
done throughout the season, but Sam's development this year has really been
key to you guys, and how big was she tonight, not just offensively but
defensively to go up against Gülich?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, Sam was outstanding. You know, you just can't even start with
Sam. You've got all of them. Jasmine Jones, she scores four points, and that's
all -- if you look at stats, you're like, gosh, she only got four tonight, but
defensively she was everywhere. I go back and look at the stats, they were 5
of 13 from three. We held them to five three-pointers. They're averaging eight
to nine a game.  
  
But Sam, you know, she's not afraid of contact. She holds her own. She doesn't
keep backing down. And that's the thing when we watch them on film. Gülich is
a fantastic post player. I'm so impressed with her. And she does a great job
of getting low post position, and we just kept telling them, you can't keep
backing up, you've got to hold your ground or she'll dominate you, and Sam did
a great job of holding her ground. Then it made her shoot over Sam instead of
around her. Starting that third quarter, she scored back-to-back buckets
because she got Sam on the top side, and then all she did was shoot it around
her, and we're like, Sam, she's got to shoot over you, you've got to make you
shoot over you, and then we made that adjustment, and then Sam was fantastic.  
  
Q. Speaking in metaphoric terms, it's been a long road to this point.
How do you keep the girls from having this sense of accomplishment, yes, we've
made it to Columbus but we have to win the game?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, they're aware of that. This is the whole tournament. Our
whole goal is to come out and compete for a national championship, but we know
you can't do that if you don't get to a Final Four. Now we've got a four-team
tournament, our third one in three weeks, and they'll be dialed in and ready
to go. There's no question about it. So we're just -- our kids have taken it
game by game, and that's what we're going to do. We're not worried about
anything else but this game tonight. We'll sit there and watch this game
tonight, figure out who we're going to play, and then start preparing on
Tuesday.  
  
Q. This is kind of a general question about women's basketball as a
whole. I've seen a number of articles come out recently about UConn being bad
for women's basketball. As a team who has competed against them once this year
and then year in and year out in the Big East, how would you respond to
that?  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, no, it's not bad for women's basketball. I guess when Alabama
beats somebody 66 and 3 it's bad for college football. You know, God forbid if
they go beat somebody 70-21, should they quit football because Alabama is
dominating people? I look at it more as if you can't be impressed and admire
what they do year in and year out, shame on you. If you want to sit there and
write an article saying it's bad for basketball, maybe you're bad for what you
do, I mean, because God forbid, if you can't appreciate greatness, then shame
on you. I mean, maybe the people that write these articles suck at their job,
so they want to try to crack on somebody else. That's my two cents.  
  
I mean, damn, like do you know how hard it is -- we're sitting there, and
Steph Norman and I have been here for 11 years, and we're going to our third
Final Four in 11 seasons, and I'm telling you, this is the damn hardest s---
I've ever been through. I sat there and told Steph before the game started,
imagine, UConn every year for like 15 years, I think they've been -- whatever
it's been in a row, their season doesn't end until April the 3rd, April the
4th, just about every year. Like it's exhausting. I mean, it's -- I told a
friend that when we're finished, when it's all finished, I hope it's not until
next Sunday, that my goal is to sit in bed for about four days and watch
reruns of Law and Order SVU. I mean, I'm physically exhausted, because the
amount of preparation you put into all of this. It's not you just show up for
the game and roll the ball out and go. So what Geno has done I think is
amazing. I don't think it's bad for anything. I watch it. I watch them play
and admire it. Our goal is to hopefully get there at one point in time. That's
what everybody is trying to do.  
  
So yeah, so whoever writes that needs to look at themselves and see if they
suck at their job, because I think they do. Sorry about that.  
  
Q. When Scott was in here, he was talking about that you play at a
different speed than they see. Looking at the scouting report and the film,
did you anticipate you'd be able to turn them over as much as you did, and did
you force the pace maybe a little faster than you normally do?  
JEFF WALZ: We tried to force the pace. We tried to force the pace against
Stanford in the Sweet 16 game. You know, I thought that game personally was
decided in the first six and a half minutes, our Stanford game, not because of
the score but because of the tempo of the game that we had it going at. There
was not a media time-out I don't think until 3:40 to go in the first quarter.
So we had that thing going at the pace that we wanted, and I thought it wore
them down as the game went on.  
  
Today, we were going to try to push in transition as much as we could, but at
the same time not take a bad shot. We had some -- we took one or two forced
shots in that first quarter because we were excited. Like Sam missed a reverse
lay-up she never misses. She drove from the high post and missed the lay-up.
Sam never misses that. But they were so excited. But I liked the tempo.  
  
All we've been working on offensively is tempo, get the ball going down the
floor, tempo, make them chase you.  
  
Offensively if you can make a defensive person chase you, then you're going to
have an opportunity to get the advantage, and that's what I thought we did.
There were points in the first half when they switched to zone that I was
getting on AC and Dana, you've got to get the ball up the floor, we've got to
get tempo, get it moving, instead of just walking it up and then trying to run
a set, and I thought we did a really good job of that. We go 5 of 17 the first
quarter, we weren't great, but we got good shots.  
  
At halftime, what I told the kids was, you know, it's a nine-point game or
whatever it was at half, seven, I said, I love the tempo. We missed open
shots. If you go back and watch the first half, we missed open shots. I
thought we made them earn every basket they got. We challenged them. They hit
the three threes. Corosdale, she hits three threes in the first half and gets
nothing in the second because we made an adjustment on that.  
  
But everything they got, they earned, which is what our goal was.  
  
Q. Coaches that have sustained success don't like to compare one good
year versus another, but what is the most rewarding thing about this year's
team and going to the Final Four maybe compared to the past?  
JEFF WALZ: It's getting these young women the opportunity to experience it.
You know, as a coach, I was fortunate enough as an assistant coach at Maryland
to win a National Championship in '06. We go back in '09 and '13. The coaching
side of it, I tell my players all the time, I push you as hard -- I push them
as hard as I push them because I want them to have the opportunity to
experience this.  
  
As a player, it's 10 times better than as a coach. Are you kidding me? I mean,
it's great. Don't get me wrong. But as a player, you have control over
everything out there. And I want them to have that opportunity to experience
what it feels like. I mean, it's a whole new thing. You get the opportunity to
go to the Final Four, everything that comes with that is awesome.  
  
And I've told them the past two times, soak up every second of it. You know,
in '06 when we won at Maryland, I had a good friend, Linden Weese from Texas
Tech, and Roger Reding, who were assistants at Tech when they won the National
Championship. They called me and said, soak in every second of it. Go to every
party that the coaches offer because it'll be maybe the only time that
everybody buys you a drink. They're like, maximize it, soak it in.  
  
Basketball is basketball. You can watch all the time you want. We're 38 games
into it. We're good at what we're good at, we're bad at what we're bad at.
You're not going to change it. So I'm going to tell the players the same
thing. We're going to enjoy it. I'm going to let them enjoy this experience.  
  
Now, when we practice, we practice, but it's not going to be when you're
locked in the room, we've got to do this. No, we're going to do our work,
we're going to be ready to play, but I want them to experience it and I'll
forever be grateful to Linden and Roger for that advice because you don't know
when you're getting back. It's not as -- as I said, it's not as easy as UConn
makes it out to seem. You know, it's a lot of hard work.  
  
So to have the opportunity to get back -- I want them to enjoy this, and then
let's see if we can't go out and win two games.  
  
Q. You've already alluded to the fans and how much of a difference they
basically painted this place red today. Go a little further about the fan
support.  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, it was great. Our fans are wonderful. To get close to 6200 to
come down and be a part of this is amazing. Our players -- I've said it all
along, I mean, we're forever grateful to our fan base. We don't ever take them
for granted. That's why we sign autographs at every home game win or lose. As
I always say, it's easy after you win, it's not much fun after you lose. But
it was an awesome venue tonight, today. I mean, they were loud, they were
excited, and it was just -- it's a tribute to the fan base that we have, not
just for women's basketball but the University of Louisville in general.  
  
Q. When you win these regionals, do you have a collection of Nets in
your office --  
JEFF WALZ: No.  
  
Q. Do you just let the players have them?  
JEFF WALZ: I let the players enjoy it. Now, we'll put the net and the trophy
out in our lobby or something like that. But it's a great feeling. I mean,
again, everybody laughs and I'm telling you, it's the truth, I'll sleep well
tonight. I would have slept well tonight if we hadn't won. We come out here
and we compete, we give it everything we have. I'm going to go home, and my
four and a half year old and two-and-a-half-year-old, all they're going to
talk about is the confetti on the floor. They have no idea. To them, if we
win, there's confetti on the floor that I get to play on. That's it.  
  
Q. How sentimental do you get with celebrations like that and keeping
little mementos like the net and that kind of thing?  
JEFF WALZ: We'll sit there and keep it in the office, in our lobby when you
walk in as a talking piece. But it's not something I put under my pillow. You
know, it's nothing like that. I mean, believe me, it's a wonderful experience.
I'm not trying to downplay it at all because it's a remarkable experience.  
  
But it's something that we enjoy, will celebrate, and then we've got to get
prepared for the next one.  
  
Q. You talked earlier about building a program. Is the National
Championship really the only missing piece now? Is this program where you want
it to be?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, I mean, a National Championship would be fantastic.
You know, that's why you play this is to hopefully make a big run in March.  
  
But you know, I'm not going to be defined, our program is not going to be
defined, oh, it was a bad 20 years, 15, 16 years, because they never won a
National Championship. That's not what it's all about. It's about the
consistency of what you're able to do year in and year out, because I've said
it all along: Come March -- I'll start that over. I've said, and I truly
believe, automatic bids for the NCAA Tournament should come from conference
regular season championships, and then you play the conference tournament to
see if you can't figure out a way to get a few more wins to get in, because
the hardest thing is to win your conference regular season, because it's 16
games, 18 games. You have one slip-up, you might lose the league.  
  
Come March, it's one game. It's like, okay, I've got to be ready to play well
on Friday night. We did. Now I've got to be ready to play well on Sunday. And
then you move on.  
  
So you've got to be able to sit here and come out every single night, enjoy
what you're doing, but hopefully we can win a National Championship. But I'll
never define what we do by one trophy.  
  
Q. In the third quarter Myisha tipped a pass at halftime, do a little
one-two with AC and dumped it off to Sam for the lay-up, and I saw you pumping
your fist and Myisha kind of went crazy. Are those kinds of moments, those big
plays, do you remember those years down the line, or are those things that get
overtaken by the larger scheme of things?  
JEFF WALZ: I'll be honest with you, and it's the honest truth. The games --
you remember some of the games, but like you go back -- I think it was in '13,
what I remember from that year is when we got stuck down in Clemson because
the flight was delayed because of weather, and Adrienne Johnson imitated every
player and every staff member, and it was great until you came along, until,
oh, God, this is me, because she does a fantastic job.  
  
Those are the things that you remember when it's all said and done. And I talk
to them about it all the time. You'll remember some games. You'll remember the
memories that are made off the court, because that's what you constantly go
back and talk about. That's what made this year so special is just how these
players are with my children. It's remarkable.  
  
You'll remember some of the game moments, but I promise you, it's a lot of the
stuff off the floor.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
JEFF WALZ: Right now I couldn't even tell you right now. I'm going 90 miles an
hour in every direction. I'm not stuttering much, so I just keep talking.  
  
Q. You made a point in your opening remarks of thanking Tom Jurich. Have
you had any communication with him since he was let go in?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what, I've sat there and exchanged a text message or so
with him just to -- I've sent it out to him just to thank him. I wrote him a
note, because I think it's important. I'm not naïve enough to sit here and
here without Tom I'd be sitting where I am. So it's okay to give credit where
credit is due, and Christine Herring and Vince have done a wonderful job.
Christine has been with me -- I think it's been five years now as my SWA, and
she's been fantastic. Vince came in, and Vince has done a great job of keeping
this thing going.  
  
You know, I'd like to reach out and talk to Tom, but I'm not sure how this
stuff all goes with what I'm allowed to do and what I can't, but there's no
question that he is a big part of this, and he has a stamp on it.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 76, Oregon State - 43  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I mean, hats off to Louisville. They played an outstanding
game I thought. I thought they were on point defensively, kept us off our
spots early, never let us get comfortable, forced us into turnovers. I thought
we survived pretty well early. You know, we had the grittiness defensively to
make them miss some shots. We were up four on the boards at halftime, and kind
of felt like maybe we had some traction coming into the second half, and I
thought, well, we're in front of our bench, we'll be able to get some momentum
going, execute a little bit better offensively, but they came out and just
shot lights out in that third quarter. It was the ballgame. You've got to give
them a lot of credit. They have a to of talent, well-coached, and it was a --
pretty much a home crowd for them.  
  
They rode that and created a really tough environment to play in.  
  
At the same time, it's hard to be more proud of this group than I am for what
they've accomplished. You can't do it better than Marie has done it this year,
and that's saying something. We've had incredible leaders and incredible
people come through our program, and she's right there at the top of the list
with them. What she's meant to Beaver Nation, what she's done for this team,
the confidence she's instilled in everyone, the example that she is to anyone
that's watched us play, I mean, it's phenomenal. It's what it's all about.
It's just class. You know, the truest word of competitor. She's the definition
of it.  
  
I'm so happy so many people got to watch her, especially the last couple
weeks, when I know more eyes were on her than even before. But her example to
everybody on the West Coast that's been watching for a while is second to
none. It's just incredible.  
  
What this team has done from day one to get to this point, I mean, we just
talked about it briefly in the locker room, how hard we had to push in
October. We were coaching them like we were a Final Four team in October, and
I think their heads were spinning, like what, like relax, Coach, relax. Why
are you pushing so hard, because they didn't speak the language yet. They
didn't understand exactly what it demanded.  
  
And then as we went through the trials, a couple losses, some success, then it
all started to sink in. In about mid-January this team hit a stride that was
championship level, and they played that way throughout and did some things
that defied the odds the last couple weeks. But I don't think it surprised
those of us who have been on the inside. It starts with Marie but it filters
through our roster, through our staff, and to be honest, Beaver Nation has
been absolutely phenomenal. I know they were back home for the most part.
Those who traveled, we're grateful to for creating a little bit of noise for
us in this building. But those people at people we've gotten messages from,
gotten videos from, we're so grateful for their support throughout the year,
and this is a year we'll never forget.  
  
Q. Marie, it looked like they were trying to feed you the ball inside
early on and they stripped it away from you the first couple possessions. Were
you surprised how tough and athletic Louisville's bigs were going up against
you?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I wasn't really surprised. I think my game today, I wasn't
poised enough. I wasn't calm enough. I think I could have handled a lot of
things differently, a lot of turnovers. I wasn't really surprised. It caught
me off guard a little bit, just how fast the double came, but not the
athleticism.  
  
Q. Marie, can you maybe talk about your career here at Oregon State and
the awesome teammates you get to play with and the awesome coaches you get to
be underneath and just talk about what that means to you?  
MARIE GÜLICH: Well, it's going to make me cry. Well, the teammates I had in
the past, especially this year, I couldn't be more proud to be like a leader
and a teammate for them. They made things so much easier, and everything I
have experienced this year I will never forget, so I'm super proud to be like
a beaver and have had the opportunity to play for Oregon State and in front of
Beaver Nation for all the four years.  
  
At the time of my life, and especially the past two weeks have been amazing,
and it's been so fun.  
  
I think we could have lost differently today, but I'm just honestly just sad
that it's over because I just want to keep playing and spend more time with
them, with the girls. But I'm proud of them, and I'm proud of our team and the
coaches and the way we handled things this year. Overall I'm really happy.  
  
Q. Katie, I'd like for you to talk about having Marie as a teammate. You
guys didn't win the game, but she was made for the all-tournament team. Can
you talk about how much you appreciate having her as a teammate, and Marie,
you'd like you to talk about how much you can appreciate being on the all-
tournament team.  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: Yeah, Marie is obviously a great basketball player, you see
that, but she's also a great person. She's been a great leader this whole
year. I just remember back when I was getting recruited and I came on my
official visit to Oregon State she was one of the first people to come talk to
me on the team, so it was really special. She's just been a great example for
all of us and just unstoppable all year long, so it was awesome to be able to
play with her for two years.  
  
MARIE GÜLICH: Yeah, I would have never seen that coming when I was a freshman.
I thought, I'm coming here, and the first few weeks of my freshman year or
month it was a struggle. Now being named in the all-tournament team is just an
amazing honor, and I'm really happy about that and really honored. I can only
thank my teammates for that. They made me better. They made me a better
person. The coaches made me a better basketball player and person in general,
just appreciate the game, and gave me so much basketball IQ. I'm really proud
and honored, thank you.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could compare the level of quickness and athleticism
that Louisville has to other teams you've seen; are they better or comparable
or not as good as maybe some that you've played?  
MARIE GÜLICH: They're really good. The way they move the ball, they're so
fast, it's hard to defend. Their weave offense is just incredibly fast. The
way they handle the ball, with that, they see the court. It's extraordinary
good. It's really hard to defend them just because you can't basically give up
anything. You just have to play perfect defense. Their speed is like
offensively something we might have seen with like -- comparable to like UCLA
and some other teams, but I think it was just something else today. They were
really fast.  
  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: They have a lot of threats from every position, Asia Durr
and their point guard and the posts inside, they're just really good all the
way around.  
  
Q. Katie, you've had to go up against four teams that have historic
appearances as far as women's basketball goes. What is that going to do for
the returning players coming back next year and getting you guys ready for the
Pac-12 season and another knack tournament run?  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: It just gave us a lot of experience and it shows us the
level we need to maintain for us to be as good next year. All those teams were
probably all going to be in the tournament next year and continue to be good.
But we just have to maintain that standard that we're going to be a tournament
team again next year and just keep grinding.  
  
Q. Marie, your plans for the future, if you have any right now, what are
they?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I mean, I definitely want to keep playing, finishing school, and
I haven't looked into that at all. I wanted to finish that season and
concentrate on the things that are in the present, so I guess I'll just like
try to figure that out right now or like in a week or something.  
  
Q. Do you want to play pro ball?  
MARIE GÜLICH: Yes, definitely, I want to keep playing.  
  
Q. Katie, your team usually hits some threes, they did hit some early.
How much effect did that have on them being able to clamp down inside a little
bit on the inside players?  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: Yeah, I think at the beginning, Kat and Taya were able to
hit a few threes. I know throughout the game we struggled a little bit getting
those open shots, and I don't think we swung the ball as much as we have like
the last few games. Just we didn't play the type of game that we have. But you
know, we have those shooters, and obviously we're all capable of hitting them.  
  
Q. Coach, I think the players kind of responded to this a little bit,
but I'd like to get your thoughts on it, as well. Seeing teams like UCLA and
Oregon in your conference, did that help prepare you for a team like
Louisville, or was it just seeing a team playing at another level tonight?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think our conference has prepared us very well. I think tonight
was a lot like USC, the way that they pressure, the perimeter. They forced
more turnovers than anybody else in our conference this year. UCLA probably
was next from a defensive standpoint.  
  
They moved the ball well, which is probably more similar to Oregon, I would
say, and then they shot it, obviously, extremely well.  
  
We didn't put a lot of pressure on them, though, in that, so they were very
comfortable offensively because they're ahead on the scoreboard, and so that's
what happens. That's what good teams do, they get up and then they get to
relax. Louisville is excellent at playing with a lead, and so I thought our
team was prepared for this game. It was a good game. I thought foul trouble
obviously really hurt us. I mean, we're a much different team without Marie on
the floor, and we've been able to avoid that until tonight.  
  
You know, and so that was unfortunate, but that was obviously a huge factor in
this game when she went out. I think it had gotten to 14-16, somewhere there,
but our offensive execution suffered once she was out.  
  
But I thought, like I've said every game, the Pac-12 prepares you, and so I
felt like we were ready. They just played phenomenal.  
  
Q. Coach, everyone in your profession is chasing UConn, including
Louisville, pretty lopsided loss earlier. Do you see them as competitive with
the Huskies?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I mean, we haven't played UConn this year. Did a couple
years ago.  
  
I think the speed -- two things that I see as similar. They have athleticism
and speed at every position, and they have -- I mean, this team had 21 assists
and three turnovers today. Not that we're a team that forces turnovers. In
fact, we're the last team in the nation, I think, in forced turnovers, so it's
not what we do. We make you miss typically. Connecticut has point guards
everywhere. This team basically has point guards everywhere, and they pass the
ball incredibly well. I think there's a lot of similarities between the two.  
  
I don't know, from a difference standpoint, I'm not sure. I know those things
are both very similar. The speed that they play at, the way that they can
change defenses, they can apply pressure, they're very active in the post,
they're very athletic, they transition exceptionally well, and they can shoot
at all five positions. And tonight you saw that from Louisville.  
  
If they meet up, that would be a fascinating match-up.  
  
Q. What was Fuehring doing with Marie when she was catching the ball?
How did they kind of approach that match-up?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, it's interesting because the last couple games -- this game
had a different vibe to it to me. I felt like they were allowed to really move
her off the block in this game. It just felt like it was a very physically
called game. So she's catching the ball, I mean, people are saying, why is the
ball getting -- why is the double-team on her so quick, well, because she's
close to the guards. She was catching the ball at 10 feet. So we had a hard
time getting her deep position, and so they were able to keep her away from
the basket. I thought that was impactful early in the game. We had a hard time
getting the ball to her on her spots where she was -- where she was used to
catching it and has been.  
  
And so I thought that was probably the biggest factor for us offensively.
Marie was off her spots, a little bit uncomfortable, and she's such a big part
of what we do, that messes with everybody else, as well. They did a good job
keeping her away from the basket.  
  
Q. At a couple points, it looked like you were calling for some more off
the ball movement, and it seemed like the team was a bit sluggish at points.
Is that a factor of just all the travel you've done this last week and the
finals and this crazy week finally catching up with the team?  
SCOTT RUECK: I have no idea. I mean, I don't know. I know it's been a grind to
this point, playing early today was hard, with shoot-around at 4:00 a.m. our
time today. But that's the tournament. You know, we're a West Coast team, so
those things are going to happen when you get sent east. So when we didn't get
to host, you knew we were going to be stretched. You add finals to that -- I
don't know how much that impacted us. I thought Louisville just played a great
game.  
  
Q. When you take a look at what you've accomplished this season and you
look forward to next season, what are some of the strong points that you're
looking forward to next year?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I don't see any weak points. I'm so proud of this team, and
I just told them that. I said, there's no good ending, but what we've
accomplished this year and the way we've accomplished it is -- it's
incredible. It's really incredible. The lessons that they've learned.  
  
When you have a championship culture built, you just hope that it gets passed
along and it continues. We're in year eight of our program culture, and it's
really strong, and Marie kept it going. I'm so thankful to her and this team
fell in line with her, and they do everything right. I was talking to our
security just at our locker room, and he says, Coach, this is the night he's
group we've ever had come through here. That means a lot to me. Now, you've
got to win, too. You can't just be the nice person and get beat. You've got to
win at some level, but I love hearing that. This team just does everything
right, they work like crazy. They prepare as well as anybody, and they're
coachable. I mean, I couldn't ask for a better group.  
  
So I know those things are going to be passed along. We're going to miss Marie
like crazy, without a question, but others will step up because it will be
their turn.  
  
And so everything that this group accomplished points towards a lot of success
in the future and a lot more great times.  
  
Q. How much time might you spend looking back at this game, maybe
picking it apart, trying to figure out what went right, what went wrong, as
you try to prepare for next season?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, how much do I want to torture myself. Yeah, I know. That's
the thing every year, unless you win the last game, there's some torture
involved. I think that's my responsibility is to look back and say, okay, what
could we have done different and how could we have gotten Marie better
positioned early or calmed our nerves a little bit, handled their stuff a
little better, handled the third quarter better. You know, there's lots of
things to look at, and that's the beauty of it. That's coaching. It never
ends. So there's always something to be doing to get better.  
  
I'm excited, you know, to help this team improve. When you get to this level,
play a game like this, it's a blessing. You know, getting to play Connecticut
in the Final Four a couple years ago, that opened our eyes to a level that we
hadn't seen before, and that makes us better, so now we have this experience
to make us better moving forward.  
  
We'll look back at it as hard as it might be.  
  
Q. I know Marie getting in foul trouble obviously hurt there in the
second half, but how much did Louisville's pressure defense and leading to
some of those transition buckets, was that just kind of a killer one-two blow
there?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I mean, that's what they're best at. They transition I
think 18 percent of the time, but they're as good as anybody in the country
when they do, when they do get out. They're 135th in steals per game in the
country. It means it's not the number one thing they do, but they're good at
it, and when they get a steal you're gone. When you've got players throughout
their roster like they do and attack the rim like they do, that's going to
cause fouls to happen and it's going to create a lot of momentum for them, and
both those things really hurt us today.  
  
Q. If you could face this defense two days from now, if you had that
tape to watch, do you think it would force you to change how you were trying
to go at it or just trying to do what you do more cleanly?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I liked what we did. I didn't like the way we executed it
necessarily. I thought we were prepared. Somebody mentioned ball movement or
movement away from the ball. I didn't feel like we saw the floor very clean
today, and I think that's one of our strengths. That's something -- we're the
leader in the nation in assists per game, in three-point shooting per game,
and that's because we move the ball very crisp typically on the outside and
from sideline to sideline.  
  
Today I just felt like we were a step slow in seeing that extra pass,
especially early, when there were some looks, and even when we did sometimes
we passed up shots I thought. We just had a hard time getting comfortable, and
against a team like this, I mean, they're going to create momentum, and now
you're on your heels.  
  
I think if we had it to do over, I'm sure I'd change things, of course, in
some ways. But I don't have that luxury, and so that goes along with his
question. We'll look back and see what we can do differently and get better
for the future.  
  
Q. As you scouted for this game and prepared, did you expect that their
quickness would be as much a factor as it was, and how did you try to
neutralize that?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yes, we did. There's only -- you can't burn your legs in
practice, but this team is a different speed, and they attack off the bounce
at a different level than most teams. The team that we saw that was most
similar to them was USC, to be honest. That's the team in our conference that
I kind of -- I felt was a tournament team that didn't get in. They had the
ability to take you throughout their roster, 1 through 4 on the outside, to
the rim, and ran weave action a lot like Louisville.  
  
With them, you really need to work on gap containment, keeping the ball in
front of you, every time they drove the ball it hurt us today. We didn't foul
them all the time, but they created easy opportunities inside, when they got
to the rim or they finished. So had we had another day to prepare or maybe if
I felt like our legs could have taken it, it would have been nice to get some
live reps against that. But every time they put it on the floor hurt us it
felt like today. So I thought that was a huge part of the game.  
  
We talked about the speed. I mean, that's the last thing I said to the team.
Remember how fast this is going to come at you offensively. Be ready. That's
the last thing I said before the tip. I hope that didn't get in their head.
But it's the facts. It's true. I go, Asia is going to come off screens like
you haven't seen yet. She's like Jordin Canada coming off screens out from
underneath the basket. She can go either way, she sets it up well, she's going
to come off an on ball screen and she's going to rise into her shot, and you
don't see it very often, it hits that hard.  
  
And so they have several that are able to put the ball on the floor with just
so much speed. So tough to contain. That's why they're really good. 36 and 2,
I think.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
JEFF WALZ: Just, again, want to say what an honor it is to be back, to have
the opportunity to continue to play at this point in time. Being involved in
the Elite 8 is quite an accomplishment by these young women next to me and our
young women that are still in our locker room.  
  
It was a great game last night against a very, very good Stanford ballclub,
and we're just excited to be here and have the opportunity to compete again
tomorrow against Oregon State, who's just been playing fantastic basketball.
Very well-coached. Scott and I had the opportunity to get to know each other
at USA Basketball a few summers ago, and he just does an outstanding job. And
I know it should be a very entertaining game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Arica and Asia, this is a very much dual-threat team. They can go
inside to their center and they're also shooting over 40 percent from three.
How do you manage that?  
ASIA DURR: I mean, it's been the same thing from day one, from the first game.
We've played teams that had great three-point shooters, who had great post
players, so it's going to be the same thing, the same principles, the same
thing that we've talked about throughout the whole year. But yeah, they have
some great scorers all across their team, so it's going to be a challenge for
us.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I agree, just making sure that teams score over us rather than
around us, keeping people in front of us.  
  
Q. Sam, your coach last night was describing a typical play of yours as
having three players lying on the floor. Has anybody ever described your game
as delicate or dainty?  
SAM FUEHRING: Well, they always say that I'm really aggressive. Honestly when
I got the rebound, I didn't even notice that I knocked three people down. I
noticed one girl was on the floor, and I tripped over her, and that was about
it. But yeah.  
  
Q. Myisha and Sam, when you look at Oregon State's front court, what's
really the challenge of defending them, particularly with Gülich?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: They're big. Their post players are pretty big. That's
really it. AC touched on it, making them score around us, not just having our
hands up and trying to contest every shot that we can. But I mean, yeah,
they're good.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, they're really big. I mean, heart over height. I mean, as
long as we work hard, we should be able to stop them from scoring.  
  
Q. When you look at how they pass the ball and how she moves around the
perimeter and around the post, what kind of challenge does that present for
you all or present for anybody really trying to stop her, physically?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, I mean, she's able to move, so it's going to be
different. We haven't really faced a post player with her size that's able to
move, do as great footwork.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: IQ.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, and that can pass the ball extremely well. But we're
ready. We're ready for the challenge, me, Sam, Bionca and Kylee. We're ready
all to dial it in and help our team in any way we can.  
  
Q. Jazmine, there was a play last night where you had a breakaway layup
and missed it and ran down the court holding your head. What was it about that
one that was so aggravating?  
JAZMINE JONES: I don't even know how I missed it, but it was just
embarrassing. Me and Coach Walz looked at each other, had the same expression,
like what in the world? So I apologized to my teammates afterwards. It was
just so embarrassing.  
  
Q. As easy as it has looked for you all, Myisha, in these three games,
where do you feel like there's room for growth? Where do you feel like you
haven't really touched upon something that you can do in this postseason?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Oh, man.  
  
JEFF WALZ: I'll help her out. It's not been easy. That's the thing I'll say.
These young women, the entire team, how hard we defend. It's not like we're
just walking out there and not playing hard. They're playing as hard as any
group that I've had, and because they're playing as hard as they are, they've
been able to capitalize on those things. So I promise you, there's nothing
easy about what these young women are doing. The scoreboard might make it look
like it's an easy big win, but it's a battle.  
  
Q. I guess the question is where do you feel like there's room for
improvement?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Everywhere. Every game you learn something new, and every
game you've got to grow. We didn't start the tournament off like we should
have, and then from then on, I feel like we've gotten better, but we're not
stopping here, we're trying to go far in this tournament. There's room for
improvement in every aspect of our game.  
  
Q. Sam, watching you over the course of the season, quite often you're
the one getting knocked down. Is that just a factor of being in there mixing
it up, or why does that happen so much maybe to you and not to others?  
SAM FUEHRING: Why I fall? I'm like the clumsiest athletic person you'll ever
meet. I don't know, I just can't catch my balance sometimes, or sometimes I
try to sell a foul that they don't call. I mean, that's like mostly why I'm on
the ground all the time. Yeah, trying to sell the foul. Got to act it out.  
  
Q. Was there anything now that you've kind of watched Oregon State a
little bit that surprised you about them? I don't know how familiar you guys
were with them being in the Pac-12 and everything before this weekend.  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel like nothing really surprises us. Going into the NCAA
Tournament, you have to expect everyone is going to be good, especially going
deeper into the tournament, everyone will be better and play harder. So I
mean, we're expecting them to come out and play hard because they made a deep
tournament run.  
  
Q. Arica, Coach before this round was talking about the challenge of
getting past Stanford's defense and really just trying to score and push the
ball against them. Do you see any kind of similarities with them, with
Stanford and Oregon state, that you have to kind of do the same thing or do it
better or do something different?  
ARICA CARTER: Yes, like when we played against Stanford, we have to box out
against Oregon State. They play very hard, and they go after rebounds hard, so
we have to make sure that we're boxing out and make sure that we push the ball
in transition. When we push it in transition, we're almost unstoppable, so we
have to make sure that we continue to do the things that we've done that got
us where we are.  
  
Q. Being that it's been four years for you to be in this game, how have
you prepared your players for this stage, or do you try to get them just to
treat it like just any other game or appreciate just the magnitude of the
moment?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, we've sat here and talked about it all year, about
what our goals are. One of our goals was to compete for a National
Championship, and we know you can't do that unless you get the opportunity to
get to a Final Four and keep going.  
  
We understand the importance of this game. Oregon State understands the
importance of the game. But at the same time, you're not trying to throw any
extra pressure. It's basketball. You know, it's what we do. They work their
tails off to be good at it and to perform on the floor.  
  
But you know, we've always talked all year about the next game. You know,
we're going to worry about the next game. So we focus on what's at hand right
now, and then we'll worry about the next one when that comes. But right now,
our next game is tomorrow. We don't look past that, and these young women have
done a great job of focusing in.  
  
Q. What makes Oregon State so effective from behind the three-point
line?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, they make them. I mean, they shoot the ball. They're really
good shooters. I mean, they've all spent time in the gym. They've worked on
their game. You know, when you've got four or five that can step out and make
the three, it opens up things. It opens up driving lanes. It opens up the post
game.  
  
You know, it's just like us. We get open shots from the three-point line
because of what Myisha and Sam can do in the paint. You know, you've got to
have good post players in order to have a good perimeter game, or one can
cancel the other out. Because their post play is so good, it helps open up the
three-point shot.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit about Sam and her bull-
in-a-china-shop approach to basketball? Did you see that scouting her in high
school as it developed, or is this innate?  
JEFF WALZ: Sam has always played hard. Sam has always played extremely hard,
in high school, in summer ball. Sam was not always as efficient around the
basket back then as she is now. Sam is in probably the best shape of her life,
which is translating over onto the basketball court. Her ability to finish
with her left and right hand is as good as any post player that I've coached
in 22 years. She keeps it high. She finishes with it high.  
  
And then her ability to finish with contact, you know, that's one thing you
don't see a lot. When someone gets hit, sometimes they'll end up going to the
free-throw line for two shots, but they can't finish it. Sam finishes a lot.
Our ACC championship game she finished a huge and-one against Notre Dame to
basically seal it away, and she got hit pretty good but was still able to
finish it.  
  
Sam has always been one that's embraced contact. She never shies away from it.  
  
You know, we wear all of our technology, our Catapult, our Polar, everything,
to track what our kids are doing during the game, and last night's game Sam
had the highest output that she's had the entire season. That's high-intensity
jumps. That's all her explosive stop and starts. It's pretty impressive.  
  
Q. You mentioned the similarities between your team and theirs with post
players, obviously being able to shoot the three. When you watch them, what's
the biggest difference you maybe see between the two teams?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, Scott does a great job of making sure he's got --
normally four shooters out on the floor at one time. We don't have four
shooters, per se, to throw out there, so we're going to try to use a little
bit more athleticism, try and get the tempo of the game more in our favor. I
thought Scott did a remarkable job of controlling the entire game last night
against Baylor. I thought the game was played at his pace, at their pace. They
slowed it up when they wanted to. Very seldom did you see a shot go up with 16
or 17 left in the shot clock. They normally got a quick score, which they got
a few of them, or they made you guard for 19, 20 seconds, and then that's when
it becomes difficult because the more cuts they get the chance to make, the
harder it is to make sure you're keeping track of the ball and your man.  
  
Q. On the other side of that, with the way that you all pass the ball
and try to push that quick pace, how do you adapt when a team tries to slow
you down, maybe try to make more passes, maybe try to go deeper into the
clock?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we've had teams that have done that before in the past. We
have a great league where we have a lot of teams that play different styles.
And we have some that will play a more -- not conservative but more
methodical, trying to make you defend. So we face that. What we have to try to
do is speed them up offensively some, try to put a little pressure on the
ball.  
  
And then we've got to look to run in transition when it's there. The thing you
can't do is take bad shots early. You know, a bad shot early then is going to
turn around to you going down there and guarding for 30 more seconds, and then
you've got to rebound the basketball. Because you know, you guard for 25, 26
seconds, they shoot, they miss, you give up an offensive rebound, you're
possibly guarding for a minute. You know, so rebounding the ball is going to
be very, very important for us.  
  
Q. How would you assess your distribution just particularly with the
assists? I think last night you had like 17 or 18 assists or something like
that. Are you pleased with that aspect, how you've been able to move the ball
around in games like that?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah. No, I think that's why we're playing at the level we're
playing right now is because we have five, six players that can score. You've
got to have a threat on the floor at every spot if you want to have a chance
to get to a Final Four, have a chance to win a championship.  
  
You know, you've got to have people that have to be guarded. You know, those
are the teams that we play throughout our career here when we can say we're
not going to guard this player, make them shoot, then it puts some pressure on
them.  
  
But there aren't many as you get into this right now. I don't know who you
want to guard on our team. I think everybody has shown that they can score the
basketball when needed. But at the same time, I've been really impressed with
our kids because if someone is open early in the shot clock, they don't take a
bad shot because they know they're going to get that shot again after ball
reversal, and it's hard to rebound if you take a quick shot because the
defense has never had to rotate or adjust.  
  
Q. The one-day turnaround in a tournament is always tough. How tough a
preparation is this game, and you get even less time given how late it was and
how early it is on Sunday? What's the preparation like here?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we had the chance, the staff, we went through some film late
last night once we got back to the hotel, so it was a late night for us. But
the players, as soon as we could get them out of here, we got them out. We got
them back. They all said they slept good, so that was encouraging. We watched
some film again this morning, went through a scouting report. We'll go out
here today in practice and just walk through things. It's not going to be
anything intense.  
  
You know, whatever we are, I mean, 30 something and 2, we're 36, 37 games into
the season. If you don't know what to do by now, we've got problems.  
  
So I think we can verbally tell them this is what we need to do, show them on
film, and then go out and execute. You know, sometimes early in the year you
need more reps to be able to get a good understanding of what your opponent is
trying to do, but now I think we can get some reps out there on the floor
today, but it's not something where we're going to go out there for an hour
and a half and practice real hard. We need fresh legs.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, it's nice to be working again today and out on the court.
Again, just really pleased with the way we performed last night and the
victory, and it was a short night with a lot of work and a good, quick
practice today, and excited for the challenge tomorrow against a great team in
Louisville. Really pleased with University of Kentucky for being excellent
hosts. Everything has gone very well, and they've taken good care of us. So
we're excited for the challenge tomorrow.  
  
Q. Marie, Louisville's two inside players are fairly physical, and they
anticipate that your size is going to cause them some issues. Can you give me
a sense for what kind of physical play you're accustomed to in your conference
and what you experience as a fairly skilled and tall player?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think overall, like the past season or like the last three
seasons have me prepared for like everything physical. I think getting like
pushed around in the post a lot this season especially. I'm just excited to be
on the floor again, to play, and I know it'll be tough and it'll be like a
really tough challenge to play against a quick team like that, but we as a
team, we prepared really well today, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. Katie, if you can kind of sum up your team's composure, particularly
last night, you all just kind of stayed patient and poised when you were down,
and then when you got up by nine and they made the run, you all just kind of
stuck with your offense until they got the pass to you for the three. When you
look at games like that, how do you really assess how well you all are able to
kind of stay within the game plan and not really panic?  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: You know, in just about every game, you're going to face
some kind of adversity, so we've been used to that this whole season. No
matter we're up or down, we've just got to keep our pace and keep executing as
well as possible. I thought yesterday we did that. We were getting stops on
defense down the stretch, and we were able to execute offense to get the ball
inside as well as shooting really well outside, Taya and Kat were shooting
well from the three, and credit to Mik for making that great drive to kick it
out to me for that wide open three at the end, but just execution.  
  
Q. Marie, how do you play such disciplined defense where you can still
get a bunch of blocked shots but without sending them to the free-throw line
on every possession?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think that's what our program is about. Like we're built on
defense. That gives us momentum, and we talk about this a lot, just to like
play defense, getting stops, because that keeps us in the game overall. It
gives us like all the possessions we have on offense. It just like leads us to
a good offensive possession. I think the discipline comes from that, knowing
that good defense gives us good offense.  
  
Q. Marie, Sam Fuehring says she's learned a few curse words in German.
Do you encounter much trash talk when you're playing back home, or is that an
American phenomenon?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I was never really a person of trash talk, to be honest. Playing
the game, if somebody says something to me, I'd probably be like, oh, just
caught off guard. But yeah.  
  
Q. Marie, you have some great abilities, but the four players to your
left are all adept three-point shooters, and they all have unique styles.
Maybe talk about how you admire the fact that they have this long-distance
ability, and which one of these players do you think has the most unusual
three-point shot?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, first of all, it's amazing how good they can shoot the
ball. It opens up a lot for me, gives me a lot of opportunities, and they're
not just good shooters, they're amazing passers, too, so they give me a lot of
opportunities the way they set screens and pass the ball to me, otherwise I
wouldn't be that successful. And then obviously if somebody doubles me or
anything else, I know I always have somebody outside who can knock down a
shot, which is amazing. And Kat Tudor over here, I don't know, she gets shots
up where I'm even like, whoa, Kat. Even yesterday there was one where she fell
backwards and she made it. That was really cool. And then Katie, you can count
on Katie for everything. And Mik is like an amazing driver, and she's just
great, too. I'm just really proud of all of them. Taya, I can count on her for
every shot. She's amazing for like a 4. So yeah.  
  
Q. Katie, what is it about baseline that allows you to hit the three?  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: I don't know, I feel like the past three years I've gotten a
lot of shots from that baseline running the 2 and the 3, so I shoot a lot of
those in practice, so it's just my money shot, I guess.  
  
Q. You have a European style of play; how much of an advantage has there
been for you playing here in the States, and how much of an advantage do you
think it'll be going forward looking at the next game and possibly the games
after?  
MARIE GÜLICH: Well, I think -- the year we played the 5s and 4s, they play
more faster, we run more, so I guess that helped me a lot being able to run
the floor like this, just like doing that early on from like the beginning
when I started playing. I think that's the biggest advantage.  
  
And then just skill-wise, I think that helped me a lot being able to play
inside-out. But overall, I think the American game has developed my basketball
game more than the European, so I'm really thankful for that.  
  
Q. Kat, looking at this run that you all have been on, you beat No. 3
Tennessee, then you beat No. 2 Baylor, now you face No. 1 Louisville; how have
you all approached this gauntlet, so to speak, in terms of just one game at a
time and really just kind of moving from one game and then preparing
differently for another opponent?  
KAT TUDOR: For us, I know for me, I don't really care who we play or who I
play. It's just do our job, get our job done and play Oregon State basketball.
That usually does it.  
  
Q. As a player, what has really kind of impressed you about how your
team has made it through these two rounds?  
KAT TUDOR: Well, we have every part of the game on our team. We have inside
presence. Marie runs the floor faster than half the guards in basketball, I
swear. Again, we have shooters all around. It's just complete. It's just hard
to guard.  
  
Q. What about this run has really impressed you about this team in terms
of how they've responded to each challenge?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, it was interesting coming off our loss to Arizona State in
the Pac-12 tournament, there was questions going into it. That clearly was not
our best performance that night, and we were beaten up. We didn't bring great
energy to that game, and so I was curious how we would approach the
tournament. I knew the character of this team. I know they're going to give it
everything, but could we get it going and could they play confident.  
  
I think all year long, I said, we have further to go from where we are today
in November -- October and November to the end than maybe anybody in the
country. I felt like we had all the character pieces, we had the leadership
piece, but we have so much experience to gain that we don't have.  
  
So we stayed with that. So our best basketball is still ahead. And I still
believe that. Our best basketball is ahead.  
  
So that being said, the character of this team, with the leadership of Marie
and now all the experience of the gauntlet of the Pac-12, a few really painful
losses that inspire growth and make the other stuff all so awesome, like last
night's game, you know, has been this perfect combination. And so this team is
so competitive, and now they know what they're doing, and they know how.  
  
Down the stretch of our season, with the exception of that tournament game in
Seattle, we've played championship basketball for the last month and a half,
you know, where it was just evident.  
  
This team is preparing. They're so coachable, and they have this confidence
about them, and I think everybody saw that down the stretch of our season, and
we've just continued it now into March.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, earlier you had talked about the Baylor win a couple
years ago as being a breakthrough for the program and telling this team that
they can win those kind of games. Did you see that more against Tennessee or
more yesterday in terms of how they handled it, and just kind of looking like
they knew they could win this game no matter what?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I think Tennessee. I would say I think Tennessee led into
last night. Tennessee was probably -- I mean, that was our best road win of
the year, of course. You know, and we'd been looking for a signature road --
we won at ASU the last game of the regular season, which was our best road win
to date.  
  
To go in there and play with that level of confidence, it comes from, okay, we
can do this, and we know how to do this, and now we have some experience.
Well, the foundation, all of that, the pinnacle moment before it was Baylor.
So Marie is operating from a leadership standpoint from that experience and
knowing this program can do that. All of these recruits watched that, or they
were freshmen on that team and watched that and were part of it. So I think it
all works together.  
  
But I think the Tennessee game was so significant for this group because they
went in and did something there against an elite team on their home floor that
was special. I mean, that was new. That was a new part of our legacy. We
hadn't achieved something like that before.  
  
You know, and then that led to last night. So it would have been silly to
think this team would enter last night's game not believing they could win
based upon all those experiences.  
  
Q. How did you find Marie over there in Europe, and how much of a joy
and how much of a challenge has she been to coach knowing that she's come over
here from playing in Europe and having that style of play?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, joy is a great word. Joy describes Marie and our
relationship with her as coaches and who she is to be around every day.  
  
Marie came over and actually played in a tournament in July before her senior
year in the U.S. on the West Coast, and so we got to see her over here.
Obviously fell in love from minute one. There's not many of those out there.  
  
So that's where we first saw her, and then we built that relationship with
her.  
  
She came in, you know, operating so professionally and so mature. What you're
witnessing -- I know Kim last night commented on how old -- she plays like a
pro, and she has this professionalism and maturity that you heard -- the first
time I talked to her, I could hear it in her voice. I said, you're going to
love our program, you're going to love the people we recruit and we'll
surround you with, and she'll flourish. That's what I felt. The first time I
got to watch her play with Ruth Hamblin, I watched her run just like everybody
watches her run, and it's just beautiful to watch somebody that competes at
that level of intensity and speed because it's rare.  
  
I watched her run, and she ran right past Ruth Hamblin, who's coming off this
amazing sophomore year, and Ruth is like, wow, like oh, I've got competition
in the gym now, and it was on from that moment.  
  
She had no clue how to defend. None. Zero. Bad feet, everything. I couldn't
play her some of her freshman year because of that reason. Her offensive game
was face-up at the time, and it was a little bit frustrating to get her so
comfortable with her back to the basket because she had the skill to do it,
she just didn't want to. She was like, okay, I'm a fish out of water with my
back to the hoop, but certainly she's embraced that, and now she's turned
herself into, like everybody is saying, one of the best post players in the
country and basically is unguardable.  
  
Then you put the character part with that and her understanding of what this
demands and her belief and her confidence to challenge her teammates, set the
bar high -- even today we're in a shooting drill, and she's like, let's go.
She's pushing them in a practice day between games that a lot of people would
think, it's just a shooting drill, who cares. No, there's a level of
excellence that she has lifted this team to, and so as a coach, that's
absolutely beautiful, because I know if I'm the leader, we're in trouble. I
can't be the leader. I inspire leaders as a coach. If the leadership is on the
inside of your team, interior leadership, that's where the magic happens. And
at this point if you're still playing, this month in particular but the last
two weeks, you've got something on the inside of your team that is pushing or
maybe even pulling that team, and it's not the head coach. It's not. We can
direct.  
  
And so Marie has been nothing but a joy. I mean, she's one of the best I've
ever coached, with all those things combined, and I've coached some incredible
people throughout my career, and Marie is right up there.  
  
Q. Coaches commonly will tell you you can't look past a game. With the
short turnaround did you cheat a little and look at Louisville before
yesterday, and what's the biggest match-up concern that you have?  
SCOTT RUECK: I didn't look at one down, not one play. Nope. Baylor was plenty.
You know, to that point. Now, our staff did, of course, but I stayed
singularly focused and I did the same last week on Western Kentucky. They're a
great team. You know, and so it's one game at a time.  
  
You know, the greatest match -- I mean, Louisville hits you in a lot of
different ways, and so it's not just one match-up. It's a collective force
that they play with, and it's intensity that they play with, the speed they
play with. That's why they've done what they've done this year. Within that,
they certainly have some really special talent. Asia is incredible and Hines
is unbelievable. You just go on down the roster.  
  
And so they can hurt you in a variety of ways, but I think it's just like our
team; they've got five pieces at all times that are working together, and so
that's what allows those All-American types to be All-American types. They've
got great complementary pieces.  
  
They play a team game just like we do, and so they're formidable. Not a lot of
sleep last night.  
  
Q. Along that line, how would you describe your passing, just how well
you all pass the ball around and work deep into the clock and really -- I
don't want to say wear down defenses but really just stay so deliberate?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I don't know if it's deliberate. I just think it's --
because I always tell people, my perfect score would be 95 to 55. I'm a little
point guard. I don't want to play half-court basketball. I don't want to be
around those big people. I want open court and space and get to the rim fast.
That's how I view the game.  
  
And so what I do think, we play with a discipline that's necessary to maintain
momentum as often as possible. You don't want to give that up. We didn't want
to let Baylor leak up and get in the open court, nor Tennessee, and we
certainly cannot tomorrow.  
  
So we've got to take great shots, and against great teams that play great
defense, that shot is going to be hard to come by, and you might only get one
in a 30-second span, and it might happen at 25.  
  
We work really hard at shot selection. We work really hard at understanding
where we're trying to go, what they do, and sometimes it appears deliberate. I
think it's just disciplined. I think we're disciplined in understanding what
it takes to win and maintain momentum.  
  
Q. Talk about the experiences of being a point guard; you could notice
yesterday obviously that the Baylor pressure in the fourth quarter, there were
some turnovers, and I'm curious with -- if that's going to be a concern
tomorrow in a hostile environment, getting the ball up court. Certainly seems
you can expect some more pressure tomorrow night. Is that a concern?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, for sure. It's always a concern. You're playing against a
great team that has lots of athletes and that have the ability to pressure
you. You look at the experiences that we've had, I mean, we went down to LA in
the second week of conference and turned it over 47 times in two games at
UCLA, then USC, and lost both of them because of it.  
  
That's been a constant evolution with this team is learning how to handle
those things. And the next time we saw UCLA, we turned it over nine times.  
  
We've made so much progress. Tennessee pressed us like crazy to start the
game, and then we handled it, and we were able to turn it into some offensive
opportunities, and so I would anticipate -- you know, I know Louisville enough
to know that they switch things up all the time, and you need to be ready for
anything against them, and they will roll the dice and try different things
and see if it works and then try something different, and I know that.  
  
I think at this point we've seen everything, and so turnovers clearly are
something that we have to manage, no question. You know, and I like the way
that -- I like the way that we've adapted to it and handled it, and I like the
confidence that we've shown.  
  
At the same time, I think that we've done a great job, if we do make a
mistake, of letting it go. I think earlier in the year, it would have
lingered, a mistake lingered two possessions. Now it's like, hey, you made a
mistake, get back on defense, get a stop, and let's go have a great
possession. Last night didn't really surprise me much. I thought we stopped
moving a little bit down the stretch when they amped up their pressure. I
didn't think we executed very well against it, which led to maybe a -- I don't
know how many turnovers we had. I haven't got a chance to watch that yet. I
don't know, so I think that is absolutely a factor in this game. We have to
take care of the ball.  
  
Q. You were talking about confidence; with this run that you all are on,
do you see your team kind of developing a swagger, for lack of a better
word?  
SCOTT RUECK: I hope so, yeah. I think so. They're great people. They're high-
character people. So it's not a -- we're talking trash talk earlier, the
German thing. That would be fascinating, by the way. She didn't answer your
question, though, do they talk trash in Germany. I don't know. I still want to
know. I'm going to ask her later.  
  
But the swagger, I think it's just a healthy confidence, and knowing that you
believe and you belong and that you can do it. And I think that's evident.
This team is full of people that have won a lot in their career at every
level.  
  
You look at Kat, Kat won a National Championship in high school, she won the
UIVL championship in the summer. She's done nothing but win, and so it's no
surprise she plays big last night. She's been competing against those people
and winning for years. Same with Marie, massive success; Katie McWilliams,
state champion; Mikayla Pivec, state champion; Aleah Goodman, state champion;
and as you go through our roster, you just see so many examples of success.  
  
Well, they had to learn to speak the language, and so there is a language that
champions speak, and it's doing all the right things and being willing to and
knowing how to handle adversity, knowing how to prepare each day, knowing how
to take care of yourself, knowing how to communicate on the court, which was
our number one issue earlier in the year. I would call a play, and Mik might
not see it, might not tell somebody, and Kat would be standing in the corner
over there and we'd be running something different and we'd have a disjointed
possession, and that might happen three times in a row, and then all of a
sudden towards the end of January, this team started speaking the language of
a champion, and now because of that, that consistency and that togetherness
has allowed them to play extremely confidently. It just feels good. Everybody
is on the same page.  
  
It's been neat to see. That's what every teacher or coach would want with
their group is that they are reaching their potential, and that's what I
thought this year. That's my goal every year is I want my group to reach their
potential, and I think this group is approaching that, and it's because of
that continued, sustained success that allows them to be confident.  
  
Q. Jeff Walz said last night that if he wins the Powerball he will not
be there tomorrow. Can you commit to coaching tomorrow?  
SCOTT RUECK: I'm going to be there, and I know Jeff would, too. That guy is a
competitor; are you kidding? If he wins Powerball, he'll just have a bigger
smile on his face than he normally does.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Oregon State - 73, Baylor - 68  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, what can you say? It's been a heck of a week to this point,
and we're excited that it gets to continue. I can't say enough about this
team, coming out and coming into another situation and game where you're
playing just an unbelievable team in Baylor that has so much ability, so much
talent, so much expectation, so well-coached, so efficient. One of the most
efficient teams in the country. You look at their numbers, and it takes a lot
to keep looking at them because you don't want to believe any of those things
because they're overwhelming.  
  
For this team to take the floor and once again know they belong, play like
they belong, believe that they should win and play that way the entire time, I
couldn't be more proud. It starts with Marie sitting next to me, and it
filters through our team, and you saw incredible performances throughout her
roster. Hats off to Baylor for just continuing to fight and never going away.  
  
I can think back to the first quarter where it felt like, man, we're in
control of this game, and you look up and we're up by two because they seemed
to score so easy at times. This game had incredible runs to it, and then when
that final three went down, our ninth three of the game, Katie knocked that
down in the corner after Mik's pass, man, we might actually get this thing,
and then what a great feeling the second that buzzer went off, and I'm so
happy for this team.  
  
We go into every week throughout our conference schedule, play Friday-Sunday
just like this, and we always talk about there's 80 minutes on the weekend,
and you've got 40 down and 40 to go. I'm so thankful that we get to complete
that this weekend. So proud of the fight and the courage to get the W today.
Excited and honored that I get to coach them again.  
  
And I have to say, so grateful to Beaver Nation for traveling like they did.
We had a good crowd here a long ways from home on short notice, and they never
disappoint. I always say that, and it's true. Really grateful, and proud of
our team.  
  
Q. Marie, going up against Kalani, I know she's finalist for National
Player of the Year. What was your mindset going up against her and really
being able to dominate the game?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think our scouting report said just attack her, and that was
my plan today was just like my quickness, I think I just used my quickness
really well against her. She's really tall and she's strong, but I think I
could get around her and have the shots over her.  
  
Defensively my goal was just to keep her off the block, to just take away her
left hand, and to not make it easy on her. She's a really tough person to
guard, and I'm proud that we as a team accomplished that.  
  
Q. Kat, you all made a lot of three-pointers and very efficient, as
well. But did you want to take more, or was Baylor's defense a little bit
quicker than maybe you thought?  
KAT TUDOR: It adjusted as the game went on, but whatever helps our team win,
if it's me making threes or not, just going to do whatever is best, and just
everybody found shooters so great today, and it just worked out.  
  
Q. Marie, just a quick follow-up on Brown. When she started hitting
those mid-range jumpers, how much of an adjustment did you have to make on
that down low?  
MARIE GÜLICH: Well, our game plan was to like let her -- like make her hit
those shots, and she did. So my goal was just to make her think a little bit
more about her shot, if she should pass it, drive it or shoot it. I think I
just adjusted a little bit by getting a little closer and backing up again,
just to make her think.  
  
Q. Kat, can you talk about just how physical this game was and how there
were many times I saw you try to go up for that signature hook move and a lot
of times bodies would just end up on the ground, but you guys didn't seem to
get rattled by it at all.  
KAT TUDOR: I mean, the Pac-12 prepares us for this, too. You kind of have to
play through it. You get a foul or not, the game is still going on, so you
have to play through it.  
  
Q. Marie, key sequence in the game obviously was your three-point play,
about seven minutes left to extend the lead to six, and then Kat, your three
to go up nine, can you each take us through those plays and what happened? You
draw the foul on Lauren, and how important do you think that was to get you
guys home?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think it just gave us a little bit more momentum. We were
trying to get to the rim all the time. We were trying to draw fouls, too. I
was just glad that I was able to just like spin off her and get the ball up
and make it, and yeah, got the call. I think it just helped us to get more
momentum and get more energy for us to like defend them.  
  
KAT TUDOR: Yeah, there are more comfort points, too, so it gives us that extra
lead, but to be honest I didn't really check the scoreboard at the end because
I don't like to do that. I like staying present in the moment, not letting
myself get ahead or anything.  
  
Q. In the closing seconds there when it was just a two-point game, you
had the ball, you were able to find McWilliams there. What did you see out on
the court, and was it just that she was the open player, or what was going on
out there?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: As the shot clock was winding down, I tried to attack to see
whether either I had my shot or whoever helped kick it out, and once I
attacked, I saw Natalie helping, and so I just kicked it, and I know Kitty is
a great shooter, and I was confident in her ability to hit that, and I was
happy she did.  
  
Q. Mikayla, how were you all able to stay so patient against their
defense, not forcing -- particularly not forcing shots, and how did that help
you all today?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: We knew with patience we could get whatever shot we wanted if
we executed well, and at times we didn't execute well, but we know when we
did, we would get good shots. So going through our first read, second read,
third reads, if that first option wasn't there, just staying with it and going
into motion.  
  
Q. Marie, you were in Dallas two years ago for the big win against
Baylor. How does this one compare?  
MARIE GÜLICH: It's pretty close. I mean, both -- I don't even know, but I
think this year it's just more special to me because I heard so much with like
the losses we had and the ups and downs we went through as a team, and I'm
just so proud of the accomplishment we have had so far, and we're playing so
confident right now, and it's just so fun. I'm just really proud, and I think
that just makes this win even like bigger and more important to me, and I'm
just very excited for the team.  
  
Q. Going up against one of the most potent offenses in the country,
second in points per game, second in field goal percentage, you hold them to
20 points below their average and under 40 percent shooting. What was the key
to doing that?  
SCOTT RUECK: I mean, well, A, it's what we do. I mean, it's by design, the way
that we defend, the way we keep people out of transition. I would say it's our
signature. We're in the top one, two, three or four in defensive field goal
percentage every year, and it's because we like to stay basket side, and you
look at this team and their ability to throw lob passes, their ability to
rebound offensively. You see teams play top side, which makes sense because
it's hard to stop them one-on-one, and it's one of the trade-offs. Are you
going to allow Kalani to catch the ball? Some teams say no. We say, well, let
her catch it, but let's keep her a little bit further away and let's let her
take that shot over the top of you, so at least you have rebounding position.
Then you want to give them different looks like that.  
  
Well, this team transitions incredibly well. They're one of the best assist
teams in the country. They shoot 52 percent from the field on the season, and
they themselves only give up 32. I mean, that's what I was saying. Their
numbers are crazy.  
  
And so our game plan was stay basket side and keep this team in front of us.
Don't let them get to the spots we know they love to get to and make them work
for everything, and then hold your own on the boards. These are two of the top
four -- I think we're third or fourth in the country in rebound margin. Baylor
is by far No. 1, plus 19.1 a game. I mean, that's incredible numbers.  
  
And so I knew if we can keep it close on the boards, just like two years ago,
we're going to have a chance in this game, and we're going to put pressure on
their shooters, and that was our goal.  
  
I thought we did a great job keeping them out of transition for the most part.
We made their posts work for everything. I didn't want Kalani to be quite as
wide open. I think we had a German-English translation issue with Marie maybe.
I'm just teasing. But I didn't want her to be that open because I know how
good of a shooter she is. I mean, a 77 percent free-throw shooter can make
free throws, whether it's a free throw or a jumper. But for the most part, we
made them take the shots we wanted, and we knew it was just going to be a war
on the boards every time that ball went up.  
  
That was our game plan, and that's what this team has done a great job of, and
I said, I think defensive transition is going to be the most important tonight
that it's been all year, and that's saying something when you've got UCLA
coming at you twice and you've got other teams in the Pac-12 coming at you,
including Tennessee the other day. Transition is so important to that team, as
well.  
  
Like Marie said, we're playing extremely confidently. We're executing our
stuff. They've bought into our scheme, and it's because of Marie. She trusts
it. She knows it. She's been a part of it. And she's holding them to that
standard within our locker room, and so then our execution is on point.
Tonight it had to be.  
  
Q. Can you also address how they were able to stay so patient on offense
against Baylor's defense?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, and I think that -- again, I don't want to sound like I'm
selling our conference, but our conference is good. If you look at who we play
against night in and night out and the schemes that you see, it does -- it
prepares us. You know, we had Notre Dame early this year. We had Duke early.
Those were the painful losses that Marie talked about. Both those games ended
in tears for her. She had tears in the locker room. Marie is a winner, and
those were hard for her because she's used to dominating, and the last three
years we have for the most part, and that was tough for her.  
  
You know, and so when you go through all those tests, then you learn what it
takes. We have a rookie point guard in Mikayla Pivec out there, bless her
heart, competing like crazy, thrown to the wolves, out of position, but
surviving and doing it really gracefully now. And so this team knows that when
we need a good shot, they know what it is. They know, okay, even versus this
pressure, we've got to manage the clock, and we've got to manage this
possession, and we've got to find the right shot.  
  
And so when you play a team like Baylor, part of the tempo issue, you can't
turn it over. You can't hand them possessions by either a turnover or taking a
quick, poor shot.  
  
I thought we took a couple early ones in the first quarter. They were pretty
good looks, but they were quick with no rebounding position. We didn't have
good balance, and that led to leak-outs. But overall, they just know how to
win. This team knows what it takes to win, and I think that leads to
possessions like that against a great defense and a great offense.  
  
Q. Katie's three there with 10 seconds to go, especially given the
circumstances, and I think she only had four points after that point and was 0
for 3 until that point from beyond the arc, was that the biggest shot the
season for the team?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, this is the biggest win, so -- it's not. There's a couple
others where you think about getting into the tournament. I mean, she had a
lob lay-up in an overtime win at the buzzer to send it to overtime. That was a
win earlier in the year. She had a lob lay-up against UCLA against a baseline
out of bounds play. So you look at things like that.  
  
We're up two, certainly didn't want them to have the ball on a two-point game
at the end, so it was a huge shot for that reason. But it iced the Sweet 16
game and created the Elite 8 opportunity for us. So it was a huge one.  
  
You know, and that's somebody that hit three threes against UConn in the Final
Four a couple years ago as a freshman, so Katie has hit nothing but huge shots
for us this year, so it didn't surprise me at all, and it was a great setup by
Mikayla, beautiful pass.  
  
Q. You mentioned a lot of the stats, about how good Baylor is
offensively. Was there one thing in particular that you all tried to work on
in preparation, or was there one specific player you wanted to shut down
today?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, well, the one thing we wanted to shut down was offensive
rebounds. When you look at that team, that's what you fear the most. Their
guards are so quick. They create off the dribble. You know, they have side-on
ball screens a lot. That's probably the action that they use the most. And
that creates -- for good reason. That creates a lot of trouble. So when the
guard drives middle, the help comes and they dump off passes to two probably
All-Americans, right, how do you defend in a way that keeps those post players
out of position to get offensive rebounds.  
  
You know, so that was really the trick. And so like I said earlier, if you
keep them behind you -- in front of you. If you keep them away from the rim
and you can defend in a way that does that and help in a way that does that,
that gives you a chance. And so that was the number one thing. So out of
transition, rebounding position, and try to force them out of the middle.
Those guards are so good once they get middle. They make great decisions, and
that's where they score the best from.  
  
Q. With all that was going on the last five days, the travel, finals,
game prep for Baylor, all of that, how did you manage all that? How did you
get this team into a routine to be able to be here tonight?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I have no idea. I have no -- it's been hard. You know,
today -- I mean, I'll tell you the number one thing is our staff is
incredible. That's number one. They, from logistics to thinking every single
thing through, helping me with everything I can do, phenomenal. Everybody that
I get the chance to work with. And so they've been a calm in this storm, and
they've been so -- they're just the best. They're mature, they just get it,
and they'd do anything for this team, so our staff is number one. When you
have a leader like Marie who approaches everything with a professionalism that
her expectations for people being prepared, you don't mess with Marie when it
comes to that, nor did you with Gaby or Sydney or Jamie or Ruth. We've
invested so much. Take care of yourself. We had finals last week. I mean,
there's still a couple, I think, to be taken still. So not only did we travel
across the country and back, we took finals, and we prepared for the No. 2
team in the country and all of these things, and played people long minutes,
and they didn't seem tired.  
  
So I think it's just -- you know, the will, and it's an expectation of
excellence throughout. You know, that's probably the thing I'm happiest about.
This team is continuing that legacy of being incredible role models, not just
to young girls, not just to young people, to everyone. I mean, they're
inspirational, just the way they carry themselves, and it's not a women's
basketball thing, it's a life thing. They do everything right, and because of
that, they can create experiences like what you just witnessed.  
  
I mean, there's a reason we're supported like we are. This team chooses to
operate at an incredibly high level. I would attribute it to the character of
the people in our program and their professionalism and their desire to do
things right, and it's a joy to be a part of. It's really special.  
  
Q. When you think about women's powerhouse basketball teams, Baylor and
Tennessee are right up there on the top. You just took both of them out, and
now do you think that Oregon State is maybe on the verge of creating tradition
and a powerhouse in women's basketball now?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, somehow we seem to continue to remain a secret. This team
is 62-10 in the No. 1 conference in the country the last four years. I know
the expectations were low, but I don't know if people expected us to disappear
this year. I know we graduated Sydney and Gaby and Bre and Kolbie last year,
but do you know who Mikayla Pivec is? Do you know who Marie is? Do you know
who Katie McWilliams is? Do you know who Taya Corosdale is? Do you know who
these people are? They're winners. We've won -- this is my 22nd year coaching.
You know, it's not like by accident that we won the Pac-12 three years in a
row and went to a Final Four. You don't luck into that stuff.  
  
You know, and so we have not done it the length of time that Baylor did or
has. We have not done it the length of time that Tennessee has, but I don't
think anybody that follows our sport is surprised. I don't think our
conference is surprised that we competed like we did.  
  
I mean, we're a weird loss to USC and a three-point loss at home to Stanford
from winning it again this year. We beat Oregon, we beat UCLA, and now we've
beaten Tennessee and Baylor.  
  
So that's the expectation in our program. It's mine. I don't look at this
stuff. I just -- we had an opportunity to win a game today, so this was going
to be a blast. Let's go figure out how to beat Baylor. Why not? I mean, that's
how I live. If you have a chance, why not? If you're going to do it, you might
as well win. So that's just the belief that I took this job with eight years
ago, and we had one player, and that's probably the reason we're here. It's
the reason Pat Casey has built our baseball program up, for the exact same
reason, and I don't see that stuff.  
  
I see an opportunity. I get to help these young women find out what they're
capable of, and who are we to put restrictions on what you're capable of. So
we just speak confidence into them. We work like crazy, and we say why not us,
and we don't just say it, we believe it. Why not?  
  
And so that belief -- I'm so happy that this team has embraced that, but you
look back, and it started with Jamie Weisner. It started with Ruth Hamblin,
and they had the belief first, and now this team has followed suit. Yeah, so
it's really awesome, but I can't say I'm surprised any longer. I don't think
anybody should be.  
  
Q. Morris goes off for them in the last couple minutes. I was watching
you, and you didn't seem too panicked. Is that fair to say? Take us inside the
huddle in that last minute after she scored nine points in like 45 seconds.  
SCOTT RUECK: They're good. They're good. These are competitors. And she's
good. I've watched -- I fear her. I've watched their last several games since
Wallace went down, and she's stepped up, and you've got a Texas girl
representing Baylor on the biggest stage, and she's embraced it with
everything, and she's a phenomenal player. And so I'm just not surprised. I'm
a little disappointed that we gave up the last one. I didn't want to give up
that one. We just had talked about that. But she hit another deep, tough
three, and so as a teacher, you can't allow them to see you panic, you know,
and so on the inside -- dang it, nice shot. But we can't do anything about it,
so what's next. Next play. Okay, now they're going to press us, let's advance
it, whatever, the next thing happened. But now there's no reason to be
panicked.  
  
And to be honest, that's kind of the fun of this. It's kind of the fun of it.
Let's figure this out now. This is another issue. You know, a big issue. Stop
making these tough shots.  
  
But if you think that Baylor is going to go quiet, you're crazy. There's no
way that team is going quiet. 30 straight wins. I think six losses ago was our
game with them. They haven't lost much the last decade.  
  
And so, you know, they're used to winning just like we are, so of course
they're going to make huge plays. There was 10 seconds to go, and we're up
five, and I'm like, they've got the ball out of bounds. That's why I called a
time-out. I'm like, this is not over. Crazy stuff happens. This is March
Madness, and shoot, it's November madness when it's November, too. It's
basketball. And so it's not over until that buzzer goes off. So yeah. But me
freaking out doesn't help anybody.  
  
Q. Would you rather face Stanford, a team that you've seen before? Or
would you rather play Louisville, a team that hasn't seen you?  
SCOTT RUECK: I don't care. I mean, it doesn't matter what I think in that. I
think in Louisville, they're a phenomenal team. They're a 1 seed. They're the
home team basically. You know, so that comes with its challenges. And in Tara,
Stanford comes with their challenges. She's an incredible coach, so nothing --
I don't know what's going on out there, but nothing would surprise me in that
game, so either way you're facing an elite opponent in the Elite 8, so that's
all good.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Oregon State - 72, Baylor - 67  
  
Q. You came in on such a roll. Your statistics for the last couple of
games were outstanding. What went wrong tonight that you didn't do
particularly well that you had been doing maybe all season long?  
KIM MULKEY: Hey, can you get the athletes first like she said and save that
question and then I can elaborate a little more? Save it for me, okay?  
  
Q. Y'all had come in on such a roll. Your statistics the last couple of
games were outstanding, and tonight it seemed like you could never really get
into a rhythm, get anything going that you normally do.  
KALANI BROWN: I think it starts with myself not being able to score the ball.
I let my team down tonight, honestly.  
  
DEKEIYA COHEN: I just think that, like you said, certain things weren't
falling for us tonight that we usually get, and we try to make adjustments,
but it wasn't working, so I think we suffered the consequence.  
  
Q. Ms. Brown, I'm sure you've seen all kinds of defenses this year. You
went out to the top of the key and hit some in the first half. Did they change
anything against you to make you change your game?  
KALANI BROWN: No, there was nothing we hadn't really seen before, I just
couldn't finish my shots. And at the top of the key, she started denying me
that shot after I had hit a few, so I had to rearrange some things, and I was
just out of rhythm tonight.  
  
DEKEIYA COHEN: I was just playing within the flow of the offense, and if
things came my way, then I shot it, and some shots fell, some shots didn't. We
didn't try to force anything that we don't usually do.  
  
Q. For Alexis, you guys did such a good job defensively in that second
quarter, held them to nine points. Did they do anything to change, or what did
y'all maybe not do in the second half that you did really well in that second
quarter?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: I think our defense was good in the second half. I think we got
stops. It wasn't nothing they did, it was us. We wasn't Baylor tonight. We're
going to watch film, get in the film room, and we'll get it right.  
  
Q. Kalani, you mentioned last week after the early part against Michigan
that you couldn't afford to play like that again in a game the rest of the
way. Did something not click again tonight? Did you feel kind of the way you
did after the first half against Michigan when things went wrong?  
KALANI BROWN: Not really. She was able to finish and I couldn't. That was the
end of it.  
  
Q. Only senior up here, realizing this is your last game, how tough was
this and how tough is it to go out this way?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: Very tough. It's not like expected, obviously, but I think we
fought hard. I think we fought until the end, and that's all I could really
ask for. I know that we all wanted it the same way I want it, even though I
was a senior, but we fell a little short. But I'm proud of our overall season.  
  
Q. Kim, I think they finished 9 of 20 from three. You knew that coming
in. Did you feel like overall, though, y'all did a pretty good job on
defending the three?  
KIM MULKEY: No, I don't. I think their offense exposes you a lot, particularly
when you're a man-to-man team, and that's what you've played. But then you
think, I can't go to a zone with as many perimeter shooters as they have. I
thought their big girl, that kid, she has to be older than a senior because
she played like she was older. I mean, she was dominant. We had nobody that
could guard her. She just reminded me of my days back in international
basketball, where she just dominated the floor, shooting, rebounding, finding
open players. She was by far the best player on the floor tonight, and she
controlled the whole thing for her team. I should call her name, right,
Gülich? Heck, just a great player.  
  
Q. Talk about things that you would like to do that you didn't do well
--  
KIM MULKEY: Well, look, they're good. We're good. The next two teams are good.
When you get to this level, it's just the nature of the business. Whoever hits
shots, makes shots, executes, you know, does what you have to do to win is
going to win. We couldn't score the basketball. How many lay-ups did Kalani
miss? How many lay-ups did -- executing against their zone. We got the looks
we wanted for Cox. It's partly what we just missed, but give your opponent
credit. I believe in giving your opponent credit.  
  
Guys, we milked that tournament about as far as we could milk it. Y'all know
what that means in Oregon? With all the stuff we had this year happen to this
basketball team, I can't go in there and chew them out. We lost to a very good
team, a team that shot it extremely well, and we seem to bring out the best in
people, and that's respect for our program, as well. We lost one kid. We
signed the No. 1 recruiting class in the country. They'll be on campus this
summer, and we will go back to work.  
  
Q. I think it was early in the game, Alexis had missed two or three lay-
ups, seemed to be going too fast. Was that the case with her, almost like she
was going too fast?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, I'm not one to make excuses. They're a young team, we're
a young team. We lost two starters in the last four weeks. It matters. It
matters. Alexis Morris stepped in and did a remarkable job as a freshman.
Juicy Landrum stepped in and did a remarkable job as a sophomore. I thought
there were moments tonight where the lights were too big. To have to look at
Juicy, did Juicy even score tonight? She played almost half the game and
didn't even score. I'll have to go back and look and see why. Were you
nervous? You know, sometimes kids -- the lights are bright, the deeper you
make a run in the tournament. I don't know. But I know we wouldn't be here
today without her stepping in and doing good when Natalie went down. Morris is
a freshman, and she will learn. She will get better. The good thing is we have
them all back.  
  
Did we miss Kristy Wallace? Guys, you don't miss -- look, you lose your
quarterback, yeah, you miss them. We missed her tonight. But that doesn't mean
that we couldn't have won the game. That doesn't mean we went in there
thinking we were defeated. We fought to the very end. It was a two-point game,
and you make a defensive stop, we made a mistake on coming to help when I
didn't think we needed to help, and that was a sophomore that made that
decision, too. So they'll learn from it. We'll get better.  
  
Q. 33 wins, and with everything that this team went through, was this
the most impressive way a team could get to 30-plus wins?  
KIM MULKEY: Hmm. Well, it wasn't easy. That's for sure. It seems like from the
beginning of the season until just, what, two, three weeks ago when we lost
Kristy, it never stopped. You keep thinking you're going to get a break, and
something is going to make all the stuff stop, and it never did. It was just
one thing after another.  
  
It started in November with the death of my grandchild. Then it was Trinity
Oliver tore her knee up. We only had 10 to begin with. Trinity Oliver tore her
knee up. Then we're stranded on the side of a highway with fog and bus on
fire, 3:00 in the morning. Then we come back and Chameka dies. It was just
something that we had to deal with, and you have to deal with it. You're
human.  
  
I'm so proud of how they dealt with it because they really made coming to work
enjoyable. And then you had Cox with the ketoacidosis, didn't even play in the
UCLA game. She's trying not to go into a coma because of her diabetes, then we
find out her sister has diabetes, we have to deal with that. Then we have two
families going through marital issues.  
  
It's stuff -- I don't have a book to go find what page I find how to deal with
this on. You deal with it with your heart. You deal with it as you would your
own family and as a mother and as their coach, and yet we don't get a break.
You've just got to keep going to work. And you don't go to work with this
stoic face like, oh, be strong, be brave. You cry with them, you laugh with
them, you bring it out of them, and it's a testament, and I've said this many
times, to the parenting of these kids, because they do care, they do hurt,
they do have feelings.  
  
But they just kept playing. They won a Big 12 championship. They ran the table
in the Big 12. They won the Big 12 tournament. They got a 2 seed in the NCAA
Tournament. You know, there's a lot to be proud of.  
  
But probably the biggest thing that I'm going to take away from today is the
experience that a lot of young people got. I looked out there on that floor
one time, and I didn't have a senior on the floor. I had two freshmen, three
sophomores on the floor at one time. And the value of their playing time
tonight and throughout the year will make us a better team next year and the
year after.  
  
Q. Is it almost to a point with all of what you said that you have set a
standard that not many people have reached in women's basketball that when you
keep knocking on the door and are falling just short that it could become
something that you want too much and players feel that when they get here?  
KIM MULKEY: No. No, who wants to go play somewhere that doesn't have a
standard? I don't. That's called mediocrity. Name me another program right now
that has that standard around central Texas. Men, women, football, name them.
I'm proud of that standard.  
  
I don't like finishing in the Sweet 16 or in the Elite 8, but as I tell you
many times, we're going to keep feeding that monster. If we break through that
door, we'll break through it. If we don't, we'll just keep feeding it.  
  
Does that help a little bit?  
  
Q. You talked about Gülich earlier. How did you want to guard her? What
were you trying to take away from her?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, she's hard to double because she faces up. She gets away
from the basket. So she is one of those that's not just a back-to-the-basket
post player. She sets those picks for the guards, but it's not like she's
rolling to that block where you can double her a lot. She got some on-the-
block stuff one-on-one, but they run a system where you have to respect the
shooters on the other side of the floor, so you don't know how much do I
really help off.  
  
I just thought the kid shot lights out. I mean, guys, they shot 60 and 45
percent in the second half. You know, that's what seniors do. She was the best
player on the floor, and she carried her team basically. She really did. She
carried them in that she made everybody else better. She gave them good looks,
good shots, one more rebound. I was very impressed with her.

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 86, Stanford - 59  
  
JEFF WALZ: I'd first like to just congratulate Stanford on a fantastic season.
We knew coming into the game tonight that we had our hands full. We knew we
were going to have to play extremely well, and I thought we did that. So just
to congratulate them on a great year.  
  
And then I'll question you all, are you past your deadlines? We're past
deadlines, so what you'll see is you can ask me as many questions tomorrow as
you all would love to because I'd like to get these kids back to get into bed
and we have a noon game on Sunday. My cell phone, I'll be happy to give it to
you when we're done, you can call me, I'll give you as much as you want. But
I'm finished with my statement because it's 12:10 right now and we play a noon
game on Sunday. So I want to get these kids back to sleep. It's the student-
athlete welfare that I think is important. Thank you.  
  
Q. You guys had some pretty unselfish play tonight, but talk about on
defense, what were you able to do differently tonight that maybe you feel like
you haven't done against other top teams earlier this season?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it's been the same thing all throughout the year
whole, pressuring the ball. We do a great job doing that. I mean -- sorry,
it's late. But yeah, we do a great job of doing that. Dana, Myisha, Sam,
throughout the whole -- I can go throughout the whole team. I mean, we got
some great steals. Our post players were getting steals. I think we played
hard tonight.  
  
Q. Asia, talk about Myisha just a little bit. 2,000 points. You know how
difficult points are to come by in this league. What does that mean she's able
to score that many points?  
ASIA DURR: I'm going to make it short, but Mya is a heck of a player. I have
so much fun playing with her. She brings me so much confidence. It's been nice
to see her grow as a player. Each year she's gotten better. I mean, she plays
her butt off, and she does some great things on that floor. I feel like she's
the best post player in the country. She does some great things for us.  
  
Q. How was the 9:45, 9:50 start for you out on the court? Did you notice
any appreciable difference?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, we were happy to play. We were happy to be out there
and got an opportunity to play a great team and to have the opportunity to get
to an Elite 8. We weren't really worried about the time, we were just ready to
play, and it felt like a regular game. We weren't really focused on what the
time was. We just did our normal routine, warmed up the same way, so it was
just like regular game, let's go, let's get the ball going.  
  
Q. Myisha, did you know that you had the 2,000 points?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yes.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: It means a lot. I mean, I really can't explain it. It's
just like 2,000 points, not a lot of people can do that or get that. But Angel
McCaughtry and Shoni Schimmel in this program have gotten it. Just to be with
those type of players is amazing, and I know Asia Durr is about to be up
there, too, soon. Just to be in company with those players is crazy just to
think about it.  
  
Q. Sam, on the glass tonight, what was the difference for you
personally?  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel like I've been going to the glass a lot more than in the
regular season. I don't really know why I've changed like that, but I mean,
it's been working.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: She wants to steal my rebounds.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: No, Myisha used to steal all of my rebounds, all of them.  
  
ASIA DURR: Now you steal mine.  
  
Q. Myisha, near the end of the third quarter, I'm not sure if this was
the basket, but you had a long pass that you caught and laid it in and pounded
the floor after it went in. Was that celebration of 2,000, or was that some
other milestone?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, that was just milestone of us getting closer to the
Elite 8. That was. I was just excited. I'm an emotional player, so I just got
emotional.  
  
Q. For everyone up here, how exciting is this to get this chance on
Sunday to get to the Final Four, your first Final Four?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I'm super excited. I'm ready to get back to it and
continue to work. We're not stopping here. We want to go to the Final Four. We
want to compete for a National Championship, and we know we have to take care
of business on Sunday, so it's going to start once we get back to the hotel
with treating your body good, making sure whatever it is that Carissa our
trainer needs us to do, we're doing it, so we have a chance to actually
compete to get to a Final Four.  
  
Q. Both of you guys had your brothers in attendance tonight. Can you
talk about how important family is on the sidelines and in the crowd?  
ASIA DURR: Well, my brother is my best friend. We're 14 months apart, so we're
pretty close. We do everything together. He's really like my twin, but the boy
version of me. It's pretty much -- yeah, I'm a big family person, so that
means a lot to me.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, if my brother wouldn't have came to the game, I
probably would have had to beat him up because he's here, so it's like -- I'm
just happy that he came, though. He's in support of us, and Sunday he'll be
wearing red. Yeah, impressive.  
  
Q. Asia, what was the key to you all getting -- creating the types of
shots you got tonight and being able to knock them down so well?  
ASIA DURR: Tempo. I think we played with great tempo tonight. We were trying
to push the ball. Our point guards have done a great job doing that, and our
posts, as well. I mean, our posts are spreading the floor. It's fun to play
like that. You want to play with such a fast pace, but I think we did a great
job spreading the floor tonight.  
  
Q. What made your defense so effective tonight?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's been effective all year. We just played hard. The kids
were dialed in, they knew what they were supposed to do, and I thought they
executed extremely well.  
  
Q. I'd like for you to speak individually about the three players that
were up here, Asia, Myisha and Sam, and their performance tonight and how much
you can appreciate the effort they put in.  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, when we recruited them, they weren't very good. My staff has
done a fantastic job of taking bad players and making them good. That's what
we do. I'm not sure any of them had scholarship offers. So we take -- our
staff takes all credit for what they're able to do. Next one.  
  
No, I mean, it's all of them -- they're all -- they work. They're the first
ones in the gym, last ones out of the gym. They're great -- not just great
players, they're great young women. You know, I'm hoping that we have a chance
to play three more games. You know, but we know we have one on Sunday. But
when it's all said and done, the games are fun. The games are -- you know,
obviously it's what we do, but it's a time that we get to spend with them off
the court that really is what this is all about. It's why I love coaching
women's basketball, because you get these young women for four years, so you
actually get to watch them grow. You get to watch them come in, and I call
them kids and they get upset, but they come in as kids, and they leave as
young women. We take a lot of pride in making sure they're prepared for life,
not just to be a good basketball player.  
  
Q. 15 minutes before the game, you're sitting on the bench, daughter in
your lap, singing along to Journey. Don't you feel stressed in that situation
--  
JEFF WALZ: Not one bit.  
  
Q. \-- that's a tournament game?  
JEFF WALZ: Not one bit.  
  
Q. Why?  
JEFF WALZ: I haven't missed a shot in 22 years. I keep telling them all the
time, everybody is like, hey, man, I don't want to talk to you -- no, I'm
fine, I'll talk to anybody.  
  
You know, we've done all of our work, and then my time comes when the game
starts. Before that, I'm not one of those, you can't talk to me, don't do
that. Again, that's why I love coaching women's basketball. You asked me that
question about would you be interested in a men's job. No. I mean, I want to
sit there with my daughter to experience it. Unfortunately our four-and-a-
half-year-old was home sick, but hopefully she'll be able to come Sunday. But
that's what it's all about. Memories like that that I'll be able to sit there
and share with her in 10 years.  
  
You know, Coach Purcell's daughters got on the big screen, and our players
were watching the game out in the hall, and they all just started -- our
players are like, oh, your girls are on, your girls are on. That's what it's
all about. Sure, if you don't win enough games, you get fired. It's part of
it. But I love what I do, but it's not my life. I tell people all the time,
I'm going to play the power ball, I've got my tickets. I think it's about 485,
and there's a chance if I win, Steph might be coaching tomorrow. You know, 485
million, I mean, I'd like to go count that, you know? I'll ask for it all in
5s and 10s.  
  
You know, I love these kids. I love what I do. But I think family is the most
important thing. You've got to make sure you have a good balance.  
  
Q. You talked about your family. Your team plays like a family.
Offensively you've got almost all five scorers in double figures. You held
four of their starters to a total of 21 points, the passing. Have you ever had
a team that is playing this well together at this time of year?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, well, we've had two that have gone on and played for National
Championships. I mean, you have to be playing pretty well at this time of the
year to have that happen. But I will say it's -- our locker room is great, and
that's what it's been like. You know, when you've got players that are excited
for each other and not necessarily worried about themselves or trying to
figure out how do I get a teammate on my page because I'm not playing as much
as I think I should so now you try to grab one to complain with, we don't have
that. Everybody knows what they've got to do to play, and everybody is honest
with each other. The players are honest with each other.  
  
You know, and there is no -- we have a saying that I can't use the word for,
but you don't want to live in this area, okay. Like when you wake up in the
morning, you have a choice to be in a good mood or be miserable, and we talk
to our players every day. If you're having a bad day, try to put a smile on
somebody else's face, instead of having to let everyone know you're having a
bad day.  
  
And I've got a group of young women that have bought into that. I mean,
they're great to be around. It's really hard to tell when someone has had a
bad day on our team. And you have them. But everybody doesn't have to know.
And I commend them for that, and I think that's why they enjoy playing with
each other as much as they do.  
  
Q. Obviously there's going to be excitement after any big win, but a lot
of these players have never been to an Elite 8 before. Is there added
excitement right now in the locker room about beginning to take a step that's
never been taken before?  
JEFF WALZ: No, it's one game at a time. We know we have to play a very, very
talented Oregon State team on Sunday. Sure, they're excited because they get
another opportunity to compete. But I'm telling you, and I've said it all year
and everybody laughs. If we can keep winning, I'm telling you, we could win a
National Championship, and our kids would want to play the next day because
that's all we talk about is just one game at a time. We don't get caught up in
the moment. Sure, will we sit there and enjoy this? Of course we will. But we
know there's bigger fish to fry, but I'm telling you, this group of kids, they
love -- they just love being around each other. They love playing with each
other, and we have fun. I mean, we literally have a good time. Life's too
short.  
  
Q. Tara was in here, and she said that if she didn't have to play you,
she would enjoy watching your team. What is it about your team do you think
that is appealing to another coach?  
JEFF WALZ: I think how hard our kids compete. I mean, I really do. I'm waiting
to see what actually happened, but like Sam Fuehring, the epitome to Sam
Fuehring and what she does is when she got the offensive rebound in the first
half and the three players from Stanford fell on the ground. And I don't know
what happened. I don't think she fouled them. But that's Sam. I mean, there's
three kids on the ground, Sam gets the rebound and makes it, and then Sam
falls.  
  
You know, we compete. We play hard. Our kids have handled adversity throughout
the year in terms of we're down 12, it's South Dakota State was a very
difficult place to play, we're down in the ACC Tournament -- as I've said, we
won an ACC Tournament championship I think by a combined total of 10 points in
three games. You know, our league is really good. Virginia Tech is making a
great run in the NIT, and NC State was who we beat in the semis, and they just
lost tonight but had a great year.  
  
So we've been in games that we know that you can't get too caught up in the
moment. You have to make sure you're able to handle some adversity because
it's going to come.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 86, Stanford - 59  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, it's not the press conference that you want to have. I
think we've had a great season. Our team has really demonstrated, I think,
tremendous resilience and fight. We had to do a lot of that tonight.  
  
I thought Louisville played very well. They knocked down shots. They were
extremely aggressive. We turned it over too much. We didn't do a good enough
job keeping them off the O-boards, and I thought we battled in spurts really
well, and then the two people next to me I thought really made some major
contributions to give us a chance.  
  
But I think we're better than what we showed tonight, but I'm really proud of
our whole team and how well -- the season that we had.  
  
Q. Brittany, talk about what they did that was so successful and some
things that normally you're able to do you weren't able to do tonight.  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, they were just really physical. We faced that earlier
in the season and struggled with it. But yeah, they just came out and didn't
back down, so it was difficult just to get open or just to get a handoff or
something like that. So they played really difficult defense.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, they just knocked down a lot of shots. They were
very aggressive on the offensive boards, from the 1 to the 5, and we didn't
match that today.  
  
Q. Brittany, from one scorer to another, what do you recognize in Asia
Durr's game? What makes her so effective?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I think she just exudes confidence, and she'll take any shot
and think it's going to go in. She was feeling it tonight, and she has range
from anywhere, so she's just a great player.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about what this team is going to mean in terms
of your memories of Stanford and your Stanford career?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: It's going to mean a lot. Everything does. I don't know. Each
year is different, and this year was great, and I wouldn't have wanted any
other teammates.  
  
Q. For both players, do you think in the fourth quarter the Cards were a
little bit faster than the Cardinal? Were you getting tired, or was the
strength still there?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I mean, our goal is not to back down at all. We always
thought -- in every game never give up. It doesn't matter what the score is
because as you guys have seen this season, last season, we have come back from
big deficits. Yeah, I didn't really see that, but they played really well the
entire game, and I think we were a step slow the whole game. So I don't think
it was a little bit slower in the fourth, I just think that's how the whole
game went.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you'll take from both Brittany and Kaylee as
they move on?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, especially Brittany, she's a super hard worker, and
I've seen the progression of her game from when she was a freshman until now,
and that's definitely something I want for me is just to continue to improve
and not become complacent. Last year she had a great season and especially a
great postseason, and I mean, she improved from then to now, and that's what I
want for myself.  
  
And then with Kaylee, just her leadership. She is always talking, always just
communicating, making sure everyone is aware of what we're running, keeping
everyone engaged and ready to go, in practice, in games, and I think that
those are two things that I definitely want to take into my game and the whole
team, as well.  
  
Q. As a Pac-12 team, how do you see them matching up with Oregon
State?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I think it'll be a really good game. Both teams probably are
going to scout super well, and it should -- I don't know what else.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, they obviously play very different styles, but I
think both teams are well-coached, and it's going to be a battle.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys have mentioned Louisville's shooting and
their strength on the offensive glass tonight, but what were they doing on
defense that disrupted you guys?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, they were just being really physical and then they were
limiting us to one shot most of the time. It was tough to get extra momentum.
They were getting back on defense, so we didn't really get any fast breaks or
anything like that.  
  
Q. Coach, what makes Louisville's defense so tough to deal with, and why
the 19 turnovers?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I mean, they have a combination of athleticism and
aggressiveness, size. They really extended their defense on us, and I think
that we -- intellectually we knew that was going to happen, but you can't --
it's hard to kind of talk to people about this is what's going to happen, and
when it happens, it's a little bit different.  
  
I thought they were extremely aggressive, and they were quick to the ball. A
lot of times -- they were just more physical. You know, just sometimes you
kind of just get kind of put on your heels right away, and I don't think we
recovered very well.  
  
Q. Louisville is a team offensively that can score from the 1 through
the 5 position. How much more difficult does that make it to play a team that
has the depth that they have?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think that they do, they have a very balanced
team, and they're a No. 1 seed for a reason. Like you said, they did score 1
through 5, and then they had some people come off the bench and score, too.  
  
I think what's -- there are a lot of things that were very impressive about
their team. I thought they passed the ball very well. They shot the ball well.
In the first half they were like 64 percent, and I mean, they -- our defense,
we were not aggressive enough. We didn't keep them off the glass well enough.
We didn't take care of the ball well enough. But that's a credit to them.  
  
They have an All-American in Asia Durr, and she's, I think, a candidate for
national Player of the Year. She had a great game tonight. We worked hard on
her, but she still found spots and was able to knock down her shot.  
  
Q. Talk about Brittany McPhee and what she's meant for you over the last
years.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, Brit is really -- it's been really exciting to see
her development, come in and -- she's really improved a lot. I think this year
-- each year we've seen more and more from her in terms of her scoring, her
passing, her rebounding. She's really been a great leader for us this year. So
it's been really fun to see her development. Our team is going to really miss
her a lot, and I'm really proud of how well she's done and proud to have been
her coach.  
  
Q. You spoke about Brittany's performance during the season, but in
regards to her play tonight, could you give us a few words about what you
thought of her play tonight and Di's play tonight, also?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think kind of the way Louisville played you, there
were basically players that can put the ball on the floor and attack the
basket were successful, and that's what Di does and that's what Brit does.
Brit loves to score. She puts the ball on the floor really well and goes to
the basket, and she was doing that really throughout the whole game. There
were some points in the game when two and three and four people would converge
on her, we need her to pitch it. But I think her ability to put the ball on
the floor and go to the basket is something that helped her, helped us do well
tonight.  
  
Q. You've seen both these two teams now, Louisville and Oregon State.
What do you think that game is going to look like?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, you know, I think that Louisville probably will try to
do the same thing.  
  
One thing, the way Oregon State plays, they really -- they spread the floor
very well, and if -- and they have someone that they can go to inside. Gülich
is -- I think Gülich is an All-American, too. So they put her in there, and
they'll go to her, and if she's one-on-one, she'll score on whoever is
guarding her. And if you help off of her, then they have, I think, excellent
three-point shooters around her.  
  
I think as Dijonai said, I think it's going to be a battle, and it'll be kind
of who can win out. Is it the defense, aggressive defense, extended out, or
are they going to be able to attack that and go inside?  
  
Defensively I don't know that -- when we played Oregon State, defensively
they're not a super quick team, but they play really good position, and again,
they have someone inside that blocks shots and is a kind of protector. I'd
come back for the game. I'll watch it on TV.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys had never played Louisville before, but watching
from afar over the past few seasons, how have you seen their program develop
to a place where they're a contender now?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, it's about players. They have really
complementary players, and they play very well together. I also think that --
I think it's great they've also built a great following with a lot of people
coming and cheering for them and getting really big crowds, which is great for
women's basketball.  
  
If you're not playing them, I think you could really enjoy watching them play.
They pass the ball well, they shoot the ball well. They work hard on defense.
They're extremely physical, as our players pointed out. A very well-coached
team and a very unselfish team. They score well together.  
  
Q. You spoke about Louisville's following, but the NCAA I don't think
would have sent you this far east three years in a row if your fans weren't
such great followers. Speak about your appreciation for your fans if you
would.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think that we have great fans, and they've followed
our team. Our team struggled early, and our fans have -- just as our team
stuck together, our fans stuck with us, which has been a great thing.  
  
And again, I think that the journey that this team has been on is a real
credit to the type of person we have on our team, the young people that we
have. They're really mature, and the fans have recognized that and I think
been very supportive.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
JEFF WALZ: Just like to say what a pleasure it is and an opportunity to
continue to still be playing. There's 16 teams left. It's a long year. It's a
long season. But we're really excited to still have the opportunity to
compete.  
  
We know we're going to have a very good game tomorrow night with a very
talented Stanford basketball team, a team that's extremely well-coached with
very talented players.  
  
We're looking forward to it. Anytime you get the opportunity to continue to
play, it puts a smile on your face.  
  
Q. Do you think the biggest problem for you guys with Stanford is going
to be their defense?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, we're going to have to figure out a way to score. I
mean, at this time of the year, the old saying, defense wins championships,
that's great, but if you don't score, it's a slight problem. You know, we know
we defend well, they defend well, so I think whichever team can execute the
best at the offensive end is probably going to be your one that comes out on
top.  
  
We played some great teams. That's one thing that our league affords you is
the opportunity night in and night out to play against some very talented and
well-coached basketball clubs.  
  
You know, we've had the opportunity to watch film. They're very good. They
rebound the ball extremely well. They get out and run in transition well. And
we know we're going to have our hands full.  
  
Q. You played here earlier this year against Kentucky. Having done that,
how comfortable are you with playing here at Rupp Arena, and how much of an
advantage do you think it'll give you having played here earlier?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we actually played at Memorial, so we did not play here.  
  
Q. I stand corrected.  
JEFF WALZ: That's all right. We played at Memorial Coliseum, but we have
played here before. A few of the players did a few years back. It might have
been Myisha Hines-Allen's freshman year. So we have had a couple that have had
the opportunity to play in Rupp.  
  
We're excited about it. You know, I don't know if it's much of an advantage
for us. This is Stanford's third year of playing in the Lexington region, so
this is more of a home court for them than I'd say it is for us.  
  
But it really doesn't matter. At this time of the year, you just have to go
and play.  
  
Q. How have you kept this team focused or made them aware of the stakes
at this round as a No. 1 seed, especially with a team like Stanford, which has
made a habit of upsetting No. 1 teams in this regional?  
JEFF WALZ: You know, at this time of the year, to me there is no upsets.
There's seeds; sure, we're a 1 seed, they're a 4 seed. Everybody is good. When
you get to the Sweet 16, you're playing everybody that's talented. You don't
make it this far by accident.  
  
You know, they have some very talented players on that roster. I had the
opportunity to coach Brittany McPhee this summer with the U-23 team, just a
remarkable young woman, great player.  
  
So we know that in order for us to win, we have to play our best, and it's
going to take a great effort from all of our players.  
  
At this time of the season, you know, it's great basketball. I mean, it's the
fun part about it. You're watching film, and you're trying to figure out how
are you going to attack your opponent, but everybody is good. It's really just
a matter -- I tell our staff, it's not a matter of what we're going to do to
them. It's like, okay, how can we execute at a higher percentage, how can we
perform better. Not necessarily what we're going to be able to do to stop
them.  
  
Q. Given the histories of both programs, are you kind of surprised that
it's come to this point for you all to finally meet? Have you ever had any
consideration or discussions about playing them in the regular season
before?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, we were actually supposed to play in that Columbus Tip-Off
Classic when we ended up playing Ohio State. But due to some time conflicts
with game times and when they could be on TV, I know Stanford wasn't able to
play past a certain time because they had to get back to the West Coast, so we
actually had to change opponents so Stanford could play the first game, which
was against UConn, and then we ended up playing Ohio State in the second game.
So we have had some talks about trying to play. But it's been fun.  
  
You watch them play. I've watched Tara for years. She does a remarkable job.
She's a Hall of Famer for a reason.  
  
We know that they're going to be very well-prepared and very well-coached.  
  
Q. You said how can we play at a higher percentage, how can we perform
better. After what you guys did to Marquette last weekend, what do you think
your team needs to be doing better moving into this regional?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, offensively I thought we played pretty well, but what we have
to get better at is our defensive transition. Especially if you go back and
look at that Marquette game in the third quarter, we scored. We got up and
down the floor great, but the problem is we allowed them to go seven for their
first seven. But we go six for our first seven. So that's something that we
have talked about is you can't trade baskets. You've got to make sure that
you're dialed in, you know exactly what you're supposed to do. You can't
celebrate after you make a shot. As I tell them, act like you've made one
before and let's try and sprint back on defense.  
  
Hopefully we'll get that figured out and you'll see a much better effort than
we showed the second half of that Marquette game.  
  
Q. You mentioned Brittany McPhee. Just kind of as a player, what do you
see from her on film?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I mean, she's so tough. She's a hard-nosed kid. She rebounds
the ball well. She can score. You know, she knocks down big shots. It's not
like she's a 45 or 50 percent three-point shooter, but when she needs a three,
when her team needs one, she steps out and makes it. She has great control of
their team. You know, I love how she passes the ball. She knows who to get it
to when someone else is on.  
  
But she's an all-around player. She rebounds, she defends, she scores, and
does it all with a smile. You know, that's the one thing I can remember about
her from the summer, she'll kick your ass and smile about it. That's kind of
what makes her as tough and hard-nosed as she is.  
  
Q. All season you've kind of talked about your team's ability to play
together and the team chemistry, but how have you seen them kind of handle
being a 1 seed so far in this tournament?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think they've handled it extremely well. We don't even talk
about it. The 1 seed is just a reward of what you've done during your regular
season, your conference tournament.  
  
You know, once the games start up, I've said it all postseason, it's all about
momentum. It's not about seeding. You know, you have to capitalize with every
opportunity. You have to gain momentum, you have to capitalize on it, and
that's something that we were able to do in the first two rounds. We came out
in that Marquette game, a team that I've got a ton of respect for, they take
Notre Dame to overtime, Tennessee to overtime. So it's a very talented
Marquette basketball team that's very well-coached, and we got a little
momentum right out of the gate. And before you know it, we're up 20. Well,
that's what you have to do. You've got to make sure you capitalize on it.  
  
So it has nothing to do to me with who's a 1 seed, who's a 4 seed, who's a 2.
You've got to make sure you come and capitalize on every opportunity that you
get.  
  
Q. Earlier this week there was a video of you going around at practice
hitting a half-court shot at the end. What was going on there?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I had plenty of time in my college days to practice those
trick shots because I wasn't ever in the game when it mattered, so like before
practice and after practice that's what we worked on all the time.  
  
You know, I just enjoy it. It's fun. I really think that part of the thing
that makes our program as special as it is and our players as special as they
are is the relationships that we form. You know, it's not you just come to
practice, you work at it and then you leave. It's about spending time with
them off the floor, after practice, and that's what we do. You know, I was
just -- I got lucky there. Coach Williams filmed the whole thing, and there
were a few of them that weren't very happy when it went in, because believe
me, I talked for a while after that.  
  
Q. How much of a luxury has it been to just be 80 or so miles from home,
to have a game this close? Has it really changed much of your routine coming
in here?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we were able to practice at home today, which was nice. We
slept in our own beds last night. And then knowing where all the social life
is tonight for our players is going to be important. If we can get them out on
High Street tonight just to get adjusted to the 9:45 tip, it'll be a good
thing, because we're going to be playing until about 11:45. So I want to make
sure they're prepared for that.  
  
So back in my college days, I used to come down here when I was at Northern to
my buddies' that went to UK, and we had a great time, so I know where to take
all the kids.  
  
Q. Not the party atmosphere but the proximity to Louisville, but how
awesome is it that you're only 60 miles away from Louisville to play the
second weekend?  
JEFF WALZ: It's great. We were really excited about it until they came up with
a 9:45 tip time. We're expecting snow tomorrow night, so it's going to cut
down on a ton of our fans that want to drive back and forth. But it should
increase the viewership, which is great, because that's what we're trying to
do. I think it'll increase TV viewership. But the actual in-person, it's going
to have a huge effect on.  
  
You know, I'm still -- I know what they're going to tell me, and this is the
standard line, you're the feature game on ESPN, all that good stuff. It's what
you hear all the time. We never tip a game at 9:45 eastern standard time all
year. Why would you do it in the NCAA Tournament? I just don't understand. I
thought this was about the student-athletes.  
  
But I mean, if we played at a normal -- if we play at 9:45 during the year,
that's great, and I know it's listed as a 9:00 tip. The first game starts at
7:15. It will take two hours; they all do. So now you're looking at about
9:15, then they're going to put about 26 minutes on the clock, so you're
talking about a 9:45 tip.  
  
I'm not worried about the players, I just feel bad for the fans. I feel bad
for the fans that want to come and support us and have a great environment.
What player doesn't want -- when we go play at Notre Dame, they're not
cheering for us, but golly, what an awesome experience to have a packed house.
That's what it's all about. In '13 when we played at Oklahoma City in the
regional and we're playing Baylor, I mean, it was all Baylor fans, but it's
the environment that these kids remember.  
  
You know, I can go back to '09, our first year we go to the Final Four, we
play Maryland in Raleigh, and there was nobody there. There was maybe 2,000
people that were at a regional championship game. I'd much rather play in
front of people.  
  
So unfortunately the times are just awful, and I hope it's something that we
can look and try to adjust for the future, just for the fans. You know, I
understand if I'm sitting in my house in Louisville and I'm watching a game
that's taking place on the West Coast and it's starting at 10:00 my time. Hey,
I understand that; it's 7:00 out west. But to be starting a game at 9:45, it's
just sad to me. And it's not for the players; the players are going to be
fine. I'm not worried about that at all. They're not going to be tired,
they're not going to be anything. They're going to be excited to play. It's
we're trying to grow our game, and I think we just had a huge turnover.  
  
Q. I was talking to Josh this morning, and first off, he says he can
beat you one-on-one, so I'd like you to tell me if that's true, but how great
is it going to be to have your family here tomorrow night?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, it's always great when you can have family come see
you play because I'm not from here, so just the fact that they can come and
see me grow as a basketball player. But he's a big guy now. He can probably
just like body me to the paint, but he's not a basketball player, so he can't
shoot. So I'll just take that advantage.  
  
But yeah, he's a football player, so he's pretty strong. I'll give him that.
That's it.  
  
Q. Coach Walz is not happy that you all are in the late game because
he's expecting that that might cut down on the fans here. Were you all
surprised to find out that you were going to be playing in a 9:45 game that's
probably going to be pushed back even later?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No. It is what it is. At the end of the day, we're just
here to play a basketball game and go far in this tournament. We're not really
worried about the time. And if we're being -- we've already played like games
at weird times. We had a game at 11:00 a.m. when we were in Miami. So we've
been able to adjust to the times that we've had to play, and we're just
grateful to be here, have the opportunity to play, and just get far in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Myisha, what's kind of been the message about facing Stanford in the
first game?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: They're a big team. They like to run in transition.
They're well-coached. You've got a Hall of Fame coach on their end coaching
them up. So we know it's going to be a hard-fought game. It's going to take 40
minutes to beat this team, and we just all have to be dialed in and know that
scouting report and who's who on that team, who we're going to be sagging off,
who we're going to let shoot the three.  
  
So I mean, we just have to be dialed in and know the scouting report.  
  
Q. You guys played tremendously well against Marquette, but is there
anything after the game that you were looking at that you need to get better
at moving into this regional this weekend?  
JAZMINE JONES: I would say yes, that third or fourth quarter we had a lot of
defensive breakdowns. We can't have that. We started off great, but throughout
the game, we had those breakdowns. We're trying to keep playing hard for all
four quarters, not just two quarters or three quarters, so that's what I would
say about our game.  
  
Q. Looking back on the last game, offensively what do you look back on
that game and feel pretty good about individually and maybe as a team that you
feel like can help you in this game?  
JAZMINE JONES: Well, I think we played hard. Our tempo was great. We got the
ball out quick. We pushed the ball up the floor. Our bigs were crashing the
boards like how they always do. That was huge.  
  
But I would definitely say the main thing was our tempo. I mean, that was
great. We all Sprinted up the floor.  
  
Q. Myisha, is Josh telling the truth when he says you wear blue during
football season?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I wore it once.  
  
Q. Does he wear red during basketball?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, he has, in this year. But he will tomorrow.  
  
Q. Asia and Jaz, how do you think you're going to match up guard play-
wise with Stanford? They're pretty solid defensively.  
ASIA DURR: I mean, like Myisha said, they're a great team, well-coached. They
have great guards, they have great post players, and it's definitely going to
be a great game. It's going to be a challenge for us. They have a great team
who plays well for all four quarters, so it's going to be a challenge.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: I agree with Asia. Their two guards, Williams and McPhee,
they're great offensive and defensive players, so we just have to come out and
play hard for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach Walz just said that to beat teams you have to execute as well
as stop but more so execute offensively. Jaz, how are you guys right now
clicking offensively, and what makes this team really go?  
JAZMINE JONES: I think our chemistry off the court, it trickles down on the
court, too, and I think we're just really close together off the court, so on
the court we're just a big fist, so it's kind of hard to break us up on the
court. So I think that helps.  
  
Q. Myisha, as a senior, how have you seen this team have that kind of
chemistry, maybe even more so or maybe not compared to the teams before that
you were on?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I don't want to say like it's the chemistry that's the
whole thing because in past teams we had great chemistry. But you can say
chemistry because -- I'm sorry. I mean, as soon as the freshmen -- I know what
it is. Freshmen, they want to learn. Like Dana wants to learn. She wants to
get better. That's one thing that I love most about her is when she messes up,
she'll actually like go to AC, me, Asia, and she'll ask questions. She wants
to get better, like she listens to what Coach Walz actually has to say to her
and doesn't take it to the heart.  
  
So that was one of the things, and Loretta, she's coming along, Lindsey, she's
coming along, too. So when the freshmen buy in to a program, it becomes a lot
easier. You have your seniors, you have your juniors, your sophomores, they've
been here, they already know what to expect, so once the freshmen come along,
everything starts to click, and everyone knows their roles and everyone is
doing their roles at this time right now great.  
  
I think it starts with freshmen. That's weird, but I feel like it starts with
freshmen.  
  
Q. Kind of the first game back in Louisville in the tournament, you guys
offensively took a little bit to go, but is that why the bench maybe was so
crucial, because of what you just said about the freshmen and the sophomores
even stepping up?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, every year you have someone different that steps up,
and this year I think it's them. So it's kind of weird how you don't know what
to expect from people, but right now this team is clicking so well because
everyone is playing together. Everyone has a common goal of winning this
tournament, and that's the only thing we're worried about, we're not worried
about who scores the most points, who gets the most rebounds, assists, any of
that, we're worried about winning. Whatever you have to do in order to win,
that's what we do. When we played Boise State, Kylee, B, Dana, they came off
the bench and gave us the spark that we needed because the starters weren't
doing what we had to do. So the fact that people can come off the bench, too,
and contribute so well, it's hard to come by. I mean, that's why there's only
16 teams left, because not everyone has a bench that's able to contribute like
we do. It's just credit to our bench players and us, too, for getting them
better, too, because without us, like playing well at times or playing bad at
times, they wouldn't get the opportunity that they have.  
  
Q. Talking about the bench play, is that what makes this team most
dangerous, or is there another aspect of this team that you would consider to
be most dangerous?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, I think when our bench is playing great, we're a dangerous
team because, like Myisha said, you never know whose night it is, and we have
so many unselfish players, so it doesn't matter whose night it is. We get to
that person. It could be Dana, it could be Bionca. Like Bionca played great in
our pit game this year, so you never know whose night it is, and whoever's
night it is, we're just going to keep that person going, and just like I say,
it could be anybody.  
  
Q. Myisha, just to follow up, you said you're going to have a lot of
family here. Is it just in particular because this is like an NCAA Tournament
game, and how many people are you expecting?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: So my mom, my brother, so that's not really a lot. But
they're going to be here.  
  
But I'm trying to get my sisters to come. My sister just got a new car, she's
from Maryland, so she did the drive, so hopefully my other three sisters will
drive in the car with her. Hopefully my family all comes down. But I know for
sure my mom and my brother will be here.  
  
Q. For all of you, Coach Walz hit that half-court shot at practice --  
JAZMINE JONES: It was fake.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We make that reaction because whenever he steps on the
court, say we're running through a drill or we're doing scouting report and he
has to be on the scout, or even like when we're running our own plays, he'll
like make the perfect pass or make some like weird shot, and it's like, how
did you do that. Like you look at him, and you're like, how are you able to
play basketball.  
  
So I mean, whenever someone talks about him, it's just like, oh, my gosh,
because you know like he's actually good, and he knows the game. That's the
weird part. It's not weird because you want your coach to know the game. But
as a player, you're like, how. When he made that half-court shot, he didn't
jump. He was just like --  
  
JAZMINE JONES: He did all the extra stuff.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah. Him and Coach Sam, they'll sit on the side and just
shoot the ball, like sitting down. It's weird. Coach Walz is -- I don't want
to say, but unique.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: That's a good word, unique.  
  
Q. He's had so much success in this tournament going back to some of his
earlier teams like in 2009 and everything. What makes him such a good coach in
this tournament?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: He knows the game. He says it all the time how when he
wasn't playing in KU, when he played there, so he sat down, he actually had to
watch the game. He wasn't getting a lot of playing time, so instead of like
pouting about it, he actually sat down and learned the game, and that's why I
think he's so successful now, because he's not worried about what happened
that last play but how to beat this team doing something else. If it's not
working, he knows like what to do. He's actually watching and coaching us up
to win.  
  
Q. When you all need some points or something, when he draws something
else, how much trust do you have in what he's telling you to do?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: A lot. I mean, it actually works. Like the stuff works.
And you're like, how did you actually come up with that. The game is going on,
and he's like, give me the board, and he draws something up real fast, and it
works. He's unique. That's a good guy, good guy to have on your side.  
  
Q. Jazmine and Asia, if you could talk about the time slot tomorrow
night, obviously only 60 miles away from Louisville, the proximity was great,
but Coach Walz was not happy with the 9:45 tip-off. Does it matter for you
all?  
JAZMINE JONES: It doesn't really matter to me. If you think about it, there's
times where we're in the gym training, it's like 2:00 in the morning, and we
get shots up. I think all college players do that from time to time. And also
like in high school, you train late at night. I don't think it matters. Like I
don't care. And I think the whole team really doesn't care about the time.
We're here to play.  
  
ASIA DURR: I think it's just another opportunity for us to play the game that
we love. Like when we was in high school, we'd play AAU games this late, so I
don't think it really matters to us, we're just ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know that the NCAA Tournament will match you against schools that
you haven't seen before in the early rounds, but what's the difference with
like say facing a team like Stanford for the first time and the challenge of
getting ready for them? You alluded to the defense and that kind of thing, but
really what's the hardest part when you have to face an elite team like that
for the first time on a stage like this?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I mean, right now we're in March, March Madness. Anything
can happen, and it's whoever plays the best basketball that night. I feel like
it's not really much about them, it's more so about us. If we play Louisville
basketball, then the score will take care of itself.  
  
We know that it's going to be a hard-fought game, but at the end of the day,
if you play your best basketball that night, you're going to win.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kaylee Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28443)

### [Brittany McPhee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33295)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: We're really excited to be back. We have great memories of
being here in the past, and we want to make some new ones this time around. I
think it's a great regional, and we're just really excited. Thank you.  
  
Q. What was your first reaction when you saw that you were in the
Lexington bracket for a third straight year, given the success that you've
had?  
TARA VANDERVEER: We're excited. First of all, we're excited to be in the
tournament. You know, we had a very tough first and second round, and I'm
really proud of how our team played. I think there's a certain -- there was a
certain familiarity, like you know the building, you've been here before, you
have great memories from being here before. We know it's going to be extremely
challenging, as it was the other two times we were here, but all in all, I
think people are just -- here we go.  
  
Q. Have you kind of looked at this place as kind of a good-luck charm
for you, for the program, in the NCAA, especially considering last year when
you overcame a big deficit to beat Notre Dame?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, the place itself doesn't do it. You have to have
the players that do the work. But I think that when you feel good about
things, it's always good. We're excited to be here and excited to be playing
in this regional.  
  
Our team has, I think, confidence, and there's a certain relaxation -- you're
relaxed at the same time. We're in the same hotel or whatever, and there's a
certain comfort that comes with familiarity. That won't be enough, however. We
know we have to play really well.  
  
Q. What's different from this team than the other two that you've
brought to this regional, and what should fans expect different?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think that this is a younger team. This is a team
that just -- it's a youthful team. We don't have three seniors leading the way
like we did last year. I think probably youth is the biggest thing. We're
running different things offensively. Our defense, I think, is probably
similar, but I think this is a very energetic team, a very enthusiastic team,
just -- they get excited for each other. Not that last year's team didn't, but
I think this year's team does a lot of that.  
  
Q. Louisville has used its post presence a lot in these two tournament
games. How do you stop Myisha Hines-Allen and Sam Fuehring inside?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I mean, they have a lot of weapons. Their posts are obviously
outstanding players, and not just two, but they bring in two more. You've got
to guard people, and you've got to figure out ways to attack them, which
hopefully my assistant coaches are doing that right now in the locker room
with our team.  
  
But we know that it's going to be a tough match-up, but we feel we have really
good posts, too, so we'll just really try to -- there's not a whole lot you
can change about your team between like now and the last couple days. You have
to kind of just go with what's been working, and that's what our plan is.  
  
Q. Last year you all came straight from your first-round games here
because I think it was just closer and easier than going back to California
--  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, we had some plane issues.  
  
Q. That's right. And the players seemed to welcome that. How much
different has the travel been? Has it been more like a normal schedule coming
from home this time?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that probably -- it was probably a little easier in a
way in that a little less chaotic. Everyone has clean clothes this trip,
whereas we weren't planning to come directly from Kansas last time.  
  
But it was an easy flight. Just got in yesterday and everything has been
great. Our team has finished up their finals. They had finals last night and
finals this morning, and now we can really focus on our games.  
  
Q. Your journey to get here had more than its share of bumps this year.
What have you all learned from that, and where do you feel like now it's kind
of helped you to be here?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I think it's really just taught us that nothing is going to
be given to you. You have to work hard for anything. Even in a game, it keeps
us from taking a playoff, losing focus, something like that, which has really
helped us against big teams because you can't take a playoff against them.  
  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Yeah, I think we talked about that a lot this year. Obviously
we started off tough, we had a tough preseason, but I think it was very
intentional. I think the biggest thing that we tried to instill in some of the
younger players, something I think we really understood, being upperclassmen,
is that it's a long season and it's kind of a roller coaster. There's ups and
downs, and you guys grow from it, and I think the most important thing is
staying resilient and really developing throughout the season.  
  
Q. I asked Coach about a third year back in Lexington, and it's had good
results for you. Again, what do you feel like can be -- can help get kind of
the same outcome?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I think it's just the same thing every year, that we love it
here, but more than anything, we're just excited to play together again, and
yeah, there are some familiar things about playing here. You know, we
recognize the locker room, we recognize the walk over here, but at the end of
the day, I don't think it matters what gym we're going to play in. As long as
we're playing hard for each other that's what matters.  
  
Q. Back during the summer you went to Italy; a trip like that, how did
that help you as a team in terms of your development and especially you had
three major personnel losses from last year, and how much did that Italy trip
help you to develop as a team?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Yeah, I think that was huge. Other than it just being a great
vacation, you get to go on with your best friends, we threw in new offense,
and it really helps I think some of the younger players get acclimated. I
think it was big in build I chemistry on the floor early on, but no, that was
definitely an advantage, and yeah, I definitely think it helped us.  
  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, I think it also helped just because we have so many
younger players who didn't have experience that we were able to go to Italy
and play, and while we didn't scout as strongly as we do now, they were able
to get used to the game without all those extra factors, and then we added
those in once we got to the season.  
  
Q. When you look at Louisville's defense, what really stands out about
how they succeed playing defending opponents?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: We know they play scouting report, so yeah, that's something
that we'll have to be aware of. But I mean, we're okay with it. We've played
teams who have played scouting report before, and we've been able to succeed
against them. So I think just being aware of how they're playing, what they're
trying to do or what they're trying to force us to do will be helpful.  
  
Q. Is it their speed or just their physicality, their athleticism that
really makes it work?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, they're really athletic, so that helps them a lot, and
then they just prepare really well for their opponents. They don't let them do
what they like to do, so you have to score in different ways.  
  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Yeah, but we're at the point of the tournament where every
team we're going to face is going to be physical, they're going to be
athletic, they're going to have a good game plan. I mean, we're just going to
have to bring that, as well, and be the more aggressive team.  
  
Q. Brittney, you played for Coach Walz this summer. Tell us about that
experience, what you learned from that experience.  
BRITTANY McPHEE: It was just a great overall experience. I got to play with a
lot of players in the country who you either play against or just watch, so it
was cool to get to know them. And then there was a great coaching staff, and
he was the head coach, and he was just really great and positive with
everyone. Really sarcastic. But he was a good coach. And it was just a great
experience.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

  

## March 22, 2018

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Marie Gülich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35176)

### [Katie McWilliams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34760)

### [Mikayla Pivec](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32690)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, we just completed a quick down-and-back, back home, and
we're back in the eastern time zone. We've got our airline miles and we've got
our finals taken care of for the most part, and this team has done a really
impressive job handling it all with maturity and toughness, and seem to be
taking everything in stride and having a lot of fun along the way.  
  
We're thankful for the University of Kentucky for being great hosts of this
regional, and we're in the process of preparing for an excellent Baylor team.  
  
Q. Regarding the travel, what kind of challenge did that present for you
to make that decision to decide to go back, and how much of a physical toll do
you feel like -- do you worry that it might take on your team?  
SCOTT RUECK: You know, I think that's just part of the deal when you're a West
Coast team. You know, it's happened throughout my career. You get into the
NCAA Tournament, you don't know where you're going to be sent, and typically
it's two or three time zones away, so it's just part of what you deal with.  
  
My old life I was a Division III coach, and the games were back to back days
at that level, and here you have a day in between, and so with the charter
flights that the NCAA provides, I think it's minimal, to be honest, and I
think there's a lot of strength in being in your home bed, and for a team
that's as conscientious academically as our team is, I think the amount of
stress that they would have carried being away and missing finals would have
outweighed any physical discomfort or whatever that they could have felt from
the fatigue.  
  
And so I don't see it being an issue, to be honest. I think travel has been
really smooth, coming and going and then coming back. So I think we're in a
good place.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustments do you make to the schedule when you are
two, three time zones ahead?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, very little. I think we try to stay -- I think everybody
probably pares down their practices a little bit this time of year. You try to
be as efficient as possible. You try to -- in so many ways, the reps are done,
now it's just putting people in place and focusing on small details and small
adjustments.  
  
And so I think you can manage things from a physical standpoint, and then --
you know, so from a regular schedule standpoint, we do everything as much as
we can identical to the way it happens during the season. We play Friday-
Sunday throughout our conference schedule, so we just try to stay on that
rhythm.  
  
Q. Can you tell us your thoughts about the bigs in this game, especially
Kalani Brown, who you saw as a freshman, your memories of her two years ago,
and how much better is she now?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, well, I think she's on that natural progression. She's
gotten so many reps. She's so talented. I think she looks a step quicker to
me. You know, she's so efficient. She's shooting 66 percent. She rebounds at
an amazing rate. Their entire team does, to be honest. But she leads the
charge there.  
  
She's certainly worked on her perimeter shot. That's something that was not, I
don't believe, a consideration before. Everything she did in that first match-
up was at the rim, on the block, under the basket, and now she'll pick-and-pop
and stretch the floor a little bit and look for those perimeter shots, which
that's impressive, because that was not in her comfort zone a couple years
ago.  
  
So you're right, the bigs in this game are intriguing on both sides, and it's
going to be a great challenge.  
  
Q. With this team, with this roster, did you go into the year thinking
it was going to be like this, or was this -- at the start was it maybe a
rebuilding year?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I think everybody from the outside looking in would say
rebuilding year, and in many ways, to be honest, it is. You're replacing nine
seniors that graduated over the last two years that built this program and
changed the beliefs and instilled the courage and the confidence that we could
go anywhere and play against anyone, and they proved it, and then they all
graduated.  
  
Fortunately, we've had some incredible leaders that have taken their place and
learned the lessons. And you kind of wonder if they're learning lessons when
they're underclassmen. You're hoping they pay attention. I'm hoping that Marie
is paying attention to what Ruth is doing and what Jamie is doing and Sydney
is going and Gaby and so on because when it's her turn I'm hoping she'll step
up. I've got to be honest with you, the leadership on this team has blown my
mind, not only that it's there but that it's based upon initiative. It's based
upon a want-to and a courage and a professionalism.  
  
I mean, Marie has stepped up, and she did it from day one on our team retreat
this year, when she offered to the team, I can't wait to lead you this year,
and I'm going to make sure you have a great year, and she looked them in the
eye. You hope that you have somebody say that, and maybe they'll say that
because it's inspired from a coach. I didn't say it at all. I mean, we
provided the opportunity for them to share, what do you want from this season,
and she stepped right up to it, and she's owned it, and you look at the
confidence that Marie has played with, and for someone who was a bit off the
radar going into the year, I think if people were paying attention or really
looking at her, you're not surprised by her skill set and what she can do.  
  
She is definitely playing at a different level, though. I mean, she was in
consideration for Pac-12 Player of the Year and obviously has become an All-
American. So when you have a leadership in place like that that welcomes the
challenges and then overcomes them and instills confidence in a group,
anything is possible.  
  
So I knew going into the year we had an incredible group of young women with a
lot of character, and I liked our skill set, but I knew we had a long ways to
go. The level of competition in the Pac-12 and the way it's coached, the
different types of systems and styles that teams play, they prepare you, and
so it's not surprising to me that we have four teams in the Sweet 16. I'll be
honest, I wouldn't be surprised if we would have had five. So I'm very
pleased. But yeah, there was no way to predict that this team would be back at
this point, which was the same place last year's team made it to. So very
pleased and happy for them because they chose to believe.  
  
Q. You just talked about roster turnover, but there is still that Elite
8 game from two years ago, which was obviously a landmark game for your
program, and Marie was obviously part of the squad then. What are your
memories from that game, and do you think there's anything that'll factor into
it tomorrow?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, for sure, and I think there's a lot of things that have
factored in since then. In preparation for that game, during that game and
after that game, that was one of those defining moments. You can look back on
some pinnacle moments in the development of a program and some key wins, and
that was as key as any because, A, it proved that we could do it, and it
proved that the vision was -- it became reality that day. Everybody dreams of
the Final Four. I think everybody says it. That's our goal, we're going to get
there. That day this team got there.  
  
And so that belief has never left. We've done it. So people can look at us and
say, well, you can get there at Oregon State, and our team can say, well, our
staff has been there, some of our players have been there, we can get there.  
  
And so what I remember from that game, it was the moment where this team and
this program made a choice in that third quarter that we were going to be a
Final Four team, and we were going to be elite. We came out of the locker room
up nine, I believe, seven or nine, I think nine. Jamie hit that three right
before halftime. And we knew that we were going to take a huge hit. I could
imagine what their locker room was like at halftime, and they were going to
come at us with everything.  
  
They got all the momentum the first four minutes of that third quarter. There
was a time-out where we were starting to panic. You could just see it, and it
was one of those moments. It's like, okay, this is either going to get away
from us, or we're going to fight, and we got here by fighting, so let's
remember what we're about.  
  
It was just one of those beautiful moments in sport where the team just chose
to be tough and courageous and say, no, this is our day today, we're going to
find a way to win this game. And you're doing it against one of the elite
programs in the country.  
  
That was a pivotal moment for us and a day we'll never forget. We all draw
strength from that. I don't know if Tennessee happens Sunday if that didn't
happen two years ago. I don't know, because why did we get the belief that we
could go into Tennessee and beat them on their home floor when nobody had done
it in the tournament? Well, we beat Baylor in Dallas two years ago. Well, the
Baylor win in Dallas also gave us the confidence that we could go into
Stanford and win last year where we'd never won.  
  
So it's just all these firsts add up. That day was -- that was a day none of
us will ever forget, of course, and you're right, it was a pinnacle moment.  
  
Q. Given what you've accomplished these last three years now, there's
got to be a little lingering resentment about the draw you've gotten, having
to go to Tennessee and now you're up against a powerhouse in Baylor,
potentially Louisville if it goes well tomorrow night for you. Is that a
motivating factor for the team? Is that something that you're kind of carrying
with you through this?  
SCOTT RUECK: Don't forget Stanford, first off. And don't ever bet against
Tara. I've learned that.  
  
No. I think that would be misguided. We don't -- I don't walk around with a
chip on the shoulder. I don't think that's the way to do it. I think you look
for opportunities. We have an opportunity to play against a great Baylor team.
We've got an opportunity to overcome everything that they are tomorrow. If we
can survive that, then we're going to have another opportunity, and we created
that.  
  
I understand the seeding. I don't love it, but I understand it. What I don't
love is that I don't think it counts the right things. I think the more we tie
ourselves to RPI, I think it's misguided. I think it puts a little bit too
much -- I've learned that this year because we're on the receiving end.
There's a little pain involved in it, because man, what if our strength of
schedule could have been a little bit better, could we have been at home.
Well, if we're at home, then Tennessee doesn't happen, and what a cool
experience. You can't worry about things you can't control, and because of
that, knowing that the committee values RPI at some level, and the Pac-12's
RPI was not in the top three this year, which it has been the last three
years, then I think for the committee, it would have been tough to justify
having four Pac-12 teams as host sites. That's what I think.  
  
And so I don't think anybody on the committee would have said -- five? Five
host sites?  
  
Well, no matter, I don't think anybody on the committee is looking at us and
saying, well, Oregon State is clearly a 6 seed because they're not any good.
They're just looking at the way everything falls, and we're a 5 or a 6. That's
just the way the numbers worked out.  
  
And so every other poll had us 13 or higher. Everything. Every statistical
thing you could find had us a top 13 or 14 team in the country, and so I think
people at Tennessee -- they knew that going into that game. It was a stunner
because nobody had done it before. I don't think anybody that knows the game
was stunned that Oregon State played Tennessee tough. With all those things,
then I just -- I understand it. So if you understand it, you can't be mad.
That's just the way it works.  
  
And so I wish our strength of schedule could have been a little stronger. Some
of the teams that we schedule -- we certainly scheduled for momentum this
year. We knew we were going to be young at the beginning. But that's why I
disagree with RPI. We did what we were supposed to do. We played our best
basketball in March, and for this team, we needed momentum at the beginning.
We beat two top-10 teams as we went on. We finished 9-1. Didn't do great at
the Pac-12 tournament, of course, which hurt us. However, we played pretty
well last weekend, and that's the design, and that's what coaches have to try
to manage through the year and through the schedule.  
  
I'm not upset about it. It worked out.  
  
Q. When you looked at the bracket and saw the possibility you could face
Stanford, and of course having two Pac-12 teams in this bracket, what do you
think that says about the strength of the conference?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I mean, everybody is talking about our conference. You
know, we were an afterthought, I know. I know. This is my eighth year at
Oregon State. And when we came in, there were one or two, and it was --
everybody talked about Tara and the 11 dwarfs or whatever. It was never quite
that. I know that. There's a lot of talent that's gone through this
conference, a lot before I got here, of course.  
  
You look at it now, and you look at the way that this conference has paid
attention to our sport, and every administration within our conference is
working hard at women's basketball. They're all diligently working to build
their programs. They have great coaches and staffs in place. And so every
night is an absolute test.  
  
There are no nights off. We had a couple teams that had down years this year
towards the bottom, but even they were tough tests every night.  
  
And so that's why I'm telling you, every team is prepared for the postseason.
It gets you there. You have to bring your A game every night, and so you get
in the conference -- or into the postseason, like yeah, we've seen everything.
The Pac-12 prepared us for Tennessee. Baylor is an extreme case. We've seen
athleticism. We haven't quite seen the size that they have. That's the one
difference. Mercedes Russell last week was similar to Kristine Anigwe. The
speed and athleticism they have, we have in our conference. So the strength of
the Pac-12 is -- it's legit, and it's been that way for the last four years in
my opinion, and it's not going anywhere.  
  
Q. Marie and Katie, go back to Dallas two years ago. What are your
memories of your first meeting with Baylor?  
MARIE GÜLICH: It was tough. Like just a tough battle. I remember, I was a
sophomore, so just watching like Ruth play and she got into foul trouble, and
then I got on the court, and I was nervous. I just remember it was tough. Like
everything you got you had to work for, and it was just really close, but it
was so much fun to be out there and play, and at the end, obviously the win, I
think, that was just amazing, just us storming the floor. I'll remember that
forever.  
  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: I remember how tough Baylor's defense was. I remember Jamie
had to make some crazy shots to keep us in the game, as well, and Sidney, as
well. But I remember that amazing feeling. Right when that buzzer went off,
they missed that three and we stormed the court, and we were going to the
Final Four. Nothing is better than that feeling.  
  
Q. Mikayla, you began last year and you played with a senior-laden team
with Sidney Wiese and Gaby Henson and others and you played with Marie. Talk
about what you've learned from those upperclassmen to make you a better player
and to learn about the culture of what Oregon State basketball has become.  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, the seniors last year were great examples as to what's
important to this program. How close the relationships are with other people
and other teammates contributes a lot to our success, and how much emphasis
they put on each possession to make it as good a possession as you can each
time you're given an opportunity. So they were great examples, and I was glad
I had the opportunity to play with them.  
  
Q. Marie, you get in a pretty big hole early on Sunday against
Tennessee. I'm curious if there was any panic at that point. You guys -- you
obviously have -- Marie particularly, in your career you have some games that
you can draw off of, some similar tough environments where the team overcame.
But was there any panic in the huddles? When you're down nine early and you've
got the hostile crowd up against you, what are you guys thinking at this
point?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think it was funny because we were all not freaking out.
Obviously we said some things to each other, we were like, okay, we can't take
those early shots anymore, we have to execute now, but it was all very
productive, and it was not -- it was not that we got super nervous. Everyone
was just calm and everyone was just like, okay, let's get back into the game,
let's do this. And I think just that confidence in those huddles got us back
into the game. I think if we would have like freaked out, we would have made
mistakes. I mean, we did overall make a few mistakes, but the calmness and the
poise got us back.  
  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: I feel like there's been a couple situations this year where
we've been down either before the second quarter or halftime. Not to say we're
used to it, but we've been in that situation before so we know how to handle
it, and we took it possession by possession and were able to execute and get
stops. Obviously that's not what you want to do, but we handled it the right
way, and we were able to gain that lead.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, we were down 10, and that's not how we wanted to start.
But once that happens you have to have a positive attitude towards what's
going to happen next. I remember a couple days before that game, they showed
us film versus Notre Dame, and Notre Dame was down 15-20 to Tennessee and
ended up working their way back, so we had confidence that we'd be able to
make a run, too.  
  
Q. The Pac-12 has pretty much owned this regional the past two years. Do
you take any pride in that and trying to have a third Pac-12 team come out of
this regional and head to the Final Four?  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: Yeah, the Pac-12 always has great teams. They've been one of
the top conferences the last couple years, and so like with Stanford and UCLA
in this Sweet 16 and Oregon, I mean, always tough competitors, always great
teams, and so I mean, obviously we want to be that team to advance to the
Elite 8, so do the other Pac-12 teams, but the Pac-12 has just prepared us for
this position, and yeah, it's made us very tough.  
  
Q. Coach kind of downplayed it, but I'm curious to get your take,
whether you feel you were disrespected with your seed. Obviously you were
knocking on the door of the top 10 and yet you get a 6 seed, have to go play
Tennessee on the road, have to play Baylor, a powerhouse, have to play
potentially either Stanford or Louisville on Sunday. Is that something that
motivates you?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think you don't have control over seedings, and obviously we
had that in our hands during the season to win against good teams. But we had
some downs during the season. We had ups and downs. We weren't really
consistent. So overall, I wasn't really surprised. It was just -- everything
you get, you'll take, and I think we just made the best out of the situation,
and even a 6 seed is pretty high and pretty good for us. Nobody expected that
like for us at the beginning of the season.  
  
I think we were all super happy and proud that we were able to play in the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: Yeah, we know a lot of teams don't get an opportunity to
play in the NCAA Tournament, so we just got that seed. We knew we probably
wouldn't host, we knew we'd probably be a 5 or 6 seed, but once we saw we were
in the tournament, we were just super happy.  
  
Q. Marie, for the second game in a row you're going to be facing a big
who's bigger than you. What do you think you garnered, learned from your
battle against Mercedes Russell last week that will prepare you for
tomorrow?  
MARIE GÜLICH: I think I just have to move a little quicker, just be a little
more quicker in my decisions and just a little more physical. But just
different. I can't foul early. I have to be more careful with those kind of
things. But I think I just can use my body better and my quickness against
somebody like that. She's tall and she has length, and she takes a lot off the
zone, like the key to her defensive opportunities. I just have to be a little
more smarter about my moves, and overall, I think I just play my game. I
played against Ruth, and I have Jo to play against every day, so I know
length, and I'm just excited for the challenge.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Q. Coach, if you could just talk about your postseason and just how
dominant you've been and just things that you've seen out of this team that
maybe you didn't see in the regular season.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think we've been pretty consistent with our play. The
biggest difference and the only difference between regular season and
postseason is doing it with a freshman point guard versus Kristy Wallace, our
senior point guard. We're still the same team, run the same stuff. The only
thing different would be the inexperience of Alexis Morris, and I think she's
done remarkably well.  
  
Q. How much are you sharing information with other coaches who may have
some common opponents earlier this season?  
KIM MULKEY: You don't. You don't. You know your team better than other
coaches. You see scores. You see common opponents. But you've got to go to
work, and your staff does all the work.  
  
You know, we're very familiar with our opponents here. We've played all three
at some point in the last couple of years, and you just don't pick up the
phone and talk about strengths and weaknesses. When you've played them, you
can see it on film pretty much.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how Oregon State plays pretty much the
same style of play. When I go back and look at that game two years ago,
there's very few of the same names. Kalani played quite a bit, but really
hardly anybody for them. Do you take much from that, or is it more looking at
this year's team and what they're doing?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think they have two players. We have one that -- no, we
have two. We forget Dekeiya, even though she didn't play much in that game,
and had Kristy Wallace, she would have been our third one from that game two
years ago. And I think Oregon State has two that I remember. There may be one
more or two more.  
  
But you don't put much stock in that. That was two years ago. They now have
two WNBA players that were great players for them. We had some great players
for us. Their style of play is pretty much like it was two years ago, and our
style of play is the same. Two teams that fought hard two years ago, but
really has no impact on what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much have you spoken with Kristy leading up to these postseason
games and specifically these rounds?  
KIM MULKEY: Kristy is in Australia. She had surgery over there with the
influence of her father and the Opals team and had a physician over there do
her ACL surgery. Texting, there's 16 hours difference between Australia time
and our time, and just texting her, keeping her spirits up, which you don't
have to. That kid has a spirit. She'll be fine. I just wish that she was with
us on that bench as opposed to being in Australia, but because of the long
flight, I don't know when they will release her to come back to Baylor. She
still needs to graduate.  
  
Keeping our fingers crossed that she'll be back in Waco and at Baylor maybe
next week sometime.  
  
Q. What do you see, particularly on the defensive end? Was there an aha
moment for her where she got it, or was it just a progression point of last
year, going against Alexis and Alexis?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, as I told her the other day, Juicy has made a fool out
of me as a coach. Here's a kid that last year was beat up every day by Alexis
Prince and Alexis Jones. She had to guard them every day, and those were two
fifth-year seniors and here was this freshman straight out of high school, and
her minutes were limited because of the depth that we had at her position.  
  
We start the year, and Natalie Chou was in front of her and pretty much gets
all the minutes, and then Natalie hurts her wrist, and Juicy steps in like, I
told you I belong and you should have had me out here to begin with, and she
hasn't let up. Juicy is just confident, shoots it from way out, has unlimited
range, probably has the best -- no probably, she has the most consistent
three-point shot that we have, and she does it effortlessly from way out.  
  
Her defense, to answer your question, was what limited her last year, and
that's not unexpected for a freshman. She just needed to learn angles, passing
lanes, help side and things like that, and now it's very comfortable for her
because it's like when you repeat something every day, it's like driving to
work; if you just moved to a new city you have to use that GPS and concentrate
on where you're going every day, and then when you've been doing it for a long
period of time, you don't think about it anymore, and I think that's where
Juicy is now in her development as a player for us.  
  
Q. Last week you mentioned that Dekeiya was one of your best offensive
rebounders. Where would you be without her this season?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Dekeiya, you wish that every coach had an opportunity to
coach a kid who -- I don't want to use the word waited her turn but was
patient. Dekeiya is a senior that never saw this many minutes in her career at
Baylor until her senior year. Most kids whine or complain or transfer,
particularly today's athlete. Everything has to happen for them today. And
Dekeiya just hung in there.  
  
She's reaping the rewards because she is our best offensive rebounder. She's a
tough match-up because I play her both inside and outside, has a great
perimeter shot. I said Juicy has the best range. Dekeiya may be the most
consistent shooter we have from the perimeter. She can nail mid-range jumpers
and can shoot the three but doesn't have to shoot the three. Very strong, can
post you up.  
  
She's having an unbelievable senior year, and that's what you want. Some
seniors leave and they're miserable and didn't enjoy it, and then you have
those seniors that leave and they feel good about themselves.  
  
Q. Along that line, what is Lauren Cox bringing to you now that, again,
over the course of the season, just looking, she's averaging nearly 25 points
a game in these two tournament games.  
KIM MULKEY: Lauren Cox is working her way into being an All-American, and she
was a freshman last year that had to share the floor with about five post
players. She signed with us as the No. 1 player in the country out of high
school, knowing that we had all those players in our program, but she came
anyway. So that's the first thing you notice about Lauren is how unselfish she
is.  
  
She genuinely cares about her teammates. She genuinely enjoys Kalani, playing
with her. They have a relationship off the floor that you will see as they
play together where they laugh and they play well together and they hug each
other and chest bump. I haven't seen every school in the country, but them
together has to be one of the finest post duos that you will see right now.  
  
I think her knowledge of the game on defense, she just can be a tremendous
help side defender. She blocks shots like crazy. She can defend the perimeter
player if we need her to. On the offensive end, she makes Kalani a better
player because of her ability to feed Kalani, but also Lauren Cox can shoot
any shot on the perimeter, and you have to respect that and come out and guard
her.  
  
Q. With the short bench, how much are you telling your players to be a
little more conservative, if at all, specifically with Kalani?  
KIM MULKEY: No, we don't play that way. I can't coach that way. Go play. If we
get in foul trouble and you go back in the last month, we've been in foul
trouble. I've had to play small when Kalani and Cox picked up fouls early. You
can't coach that way. You can't play that way. It's not our style.  
  
Now, be smarter. If you pick up a foul early, be smart. Instead of going for
that blocked shot, maybe just stand there with your hands up. Things like that
I've encouraged, but not to tell them not to play hard.  
  
Q. Obviously you've been at this point a lot of times, and even going
back to first and second round, how do you approach it, potentially you've got
another game to play in two days. Do you start looking at those teams or
having other coaches look at the other teams to already have a scouting report
ready? How do you approach that?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, yes, the players you don't fool with, but the coaches, we've
got more coaches than I do players, so each of them is assigned a team. Each
of them when the bracket is announced is assigned a team, and you get in the
film work and you do your work, who you potentially could play. We've done
scouting reports on people that have lost out, that we're not going to play.
Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built his ark, right? Told you those
Baptists love me. I'm the only Methodist they have on that campus.  
  
We have a great coaching staff. Three of them have been head coaches. They're
in that film room when I'm not. All I can concentrate on is the next opponent,
and then they will present things to me as you progress in the tournament. If
you don't, then we keep those scouting reports and you put them in a file for
the future in case you play them in the regular season or in the Playoffs
again.  
  
Q. Coming to a new venue, how do you get your team used to the
surroundings, just how it's laid out?  
KIM MULKEY: You practice. We're going to go out there and approach it the same
way we do when we go in the non-conference and play some place that we haven't
played before. The thing, the biggest difference is just your fans. You know,
this is a home court to Louisville. Let's just be honest. It's a home court
for Louisville. And I hear -- is it sold out? I don't know. Not quite?  
  
But we've been in this situation, too, where we've played in venues that seem
like a home court for our team. Just got to go play.  
  
And you've seen, I mean, Oregon State is a great example. Those home courts
mean nothing anymore. They might get the adrenaline going a little bit when
you're fatigued, but they don't win basketball games for you. Oregon State
beating Tennessee there -- who else lost on their home floor? It's happening
more now on the women's side than maybe in the past.  
  
Q. Do you put much thought in the whole idea about depth perception when
you come into a different place and getting the players used to that
atmosphere shooting-wise?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know, I never was a shooter. I just told them, make the
shot, I'll get you the ball. I don't know. You know, the bigger the arena,
does it matter? I really don't know.  
  
I think people who are competitors, that's why you have practice. They figure
it out. You'll hear people talk about loose rims, tight rims, all that stuff.
There may be something to it, but at the end of the day, you've just got to go
play.  
  
Q. You spoke earlier, kind of touched on the idea of parity. Speak to
parity because I believe you said playing on somebody else's floor doesn't
really matter much anymore, you've still got to go out there and play. Does it
kind of go to how much parity there is in women's basketball now?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, I was asked that question by a Michigan person before we
played Michigan at home, the advantage of playing at home, and I understood
his question, because there is an advantage when you go to an arena on a home
floor where you're just outnumbered. The crowd gets into it. But like I told
him, we've experimented with that on the women's side. We've taken it to
neutral courts. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. I knew it wouldn't work when
we tried it, but we tried it, because there's nothing worse than watching a
women's basketball game and there's nobody in the stands.  
  
So what I told him was this: Build your program and do your work and you build
your program and become one of the 16 seeds, and then the next week, we saw
Tennessee lost at home and some others lost at home. So the home court doesn't
necessarily win ballgames for you.  
  
The teams are getting better. The coaches are getting better. And you kind of
tune that out as an athlete.  
  
When you're in the heat of the moment, I'm not sure how much of that crowd you
really hear because you're focusing on your team, what your coach is telling
you to do, and you're just trying your best to win a ballgame.  
  
Does that help answer it a little bit? Is there parity like on the men's side?
No, I can't ever believe that there will be that kind of parity. There are
thousands of male players that can play. There are only some handful of big-
time blue chip elite difference makers on the women's side. What you're seeing
is they're spreading out more and they're going to different schools. They're
not all congregating at one school anymore. And that's progress. I think
that's progress.  
  
Q. Kalani, can you talk about Matt (Shadeed) coming in and what he's
done with the strength program and how much that's helped you guys?  
KALANI BROWN: He's been a great help, fixing our nutrition, first and
foremost. That was a big deal for him. And then strength came second. I
thought that -- yeah, he's just a great strength coach.  
  
Q. Lauren, Coach was saying that despite the short bench and possibly
foul trouble, she's not telling you to be conservative. Are you sometimes
trying to catch yourself with that knowing that you go for so many blocks?  
LAUREN COX: I think like starting the game, we just have to see how the refs
are going to call it because if they're going to call it tight, we can't be as
aggressive, try and go get those blocks, but if they're going to let us play,
then we're going to be more aggressive and not be as conservative.  
  
Q. Kalani and Lauren, Coach was just saying a little while ago that
Lauren, just by her development, in turn she's made you a better player. Can
you just talk about the development of your chemistry together on the court
and what you two do to play off of each other's talents?  
KALANI BROWN: We make each other better. I've picked up a few things from
Lauren that she does, and it's really helped me out. Lauren really opens the
floor for me with them having to guard her on the outside so you can't really
sag on me all that much, and whenever I'm taking the entourage with me down
low, she can hit the three or the jumper. Makes no difference, whichever one.
But I think that we play well together.  
  
It all started last year, and now we're just debuting what we've been working
on since last year.  
  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, like Kalani said, we've always kind of had that chemistry,
we just didn't really showcase it last year because we had five post players.
And I think we really play well off of each other. I think you have to focus
on one of us, which leaves the other one open.  
  
Q. Alexis, describe your team's style of play. What is your style of
play offensively and defensively?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: I would say up tempo because we like to get out in transition,
but we also can execute in the half court. On the defensive end, I think we're
aggressive. We play together. We communicate. Yeah.  
  
Q. Alexis, your teammates up here, they've traveled the country post-
seasons before, and you've traveled the country this year, obviously, in
regular-season games, but how does it feel to do that now, knowing that y'all
are one of the 16 teams left here?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: As you know, I'm a freshman, so it's kind of new to me. I'm
just taking it all in, just traveling and getting a feel, getting -- I don't
know, I'm just taking it all in. I'm just trying to get the feel right now.  
  
Q. Great things to say about you, and she said you waited your time but
you're really starting to blossom here in your senior year. Can you talk about
your four years and how much the season has meant to you?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: Well, like she said, I kind of did wait my turn, so this year
I'm getting a chance to be a starter for the first time and play a lot of
minutes, so I'm just trying to take advantage of the opportunity, and I have a
bigger role on the team than I've ever had this year. I'm excited about it,
and I'm trying to go out there and play my best and show what I can do, what I
haven't gotten a chance to show these past few years. I'm really just trying
to help my team in whatever way I can.  
  
Q. As one of the few seniors on this team, have you had to help Alexis
with her freshman role and kind of stepping in here or taking on more of a
leadership role in the last few weeks?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: Yeah, I mean, she's been doing a great job at stepping up and
being a leader. All the questions that she had, I try to be there to help her
answer anything that she asks me about, things that deal with experience, but
other than that, like on the court, she's been doing a great job. I think
she's made a great adjustment, and she's growing as a person and as a player
on the court.  
  
Q. Alexis, back when you were playing with Juicy in AAU ball, do you
remember her playing any defense back then? And how have you seen her step up
during this last run?  
ALEXIS MORRIS: Actually, our AAU coach demanded us to play defense. That's the
program we built around was playing defense. She played defense, but I
wouldn't say as hard as she does now.  
  
Offensively and defensively she's been guarding the best players in the
previous games we've played. She's just been taking on that challenge. She's
been hitting big shots for us. She's just stepped up a lot. She's
communicating. At the beginning of the season, she wasn't really talking.
She's stepped up by communicating. Also she's been helping me, keeping me
uplifted when I get down on myself saying, you've got it, you're going to make
the next stop. She's a great teammate on and off the court. When I need a
ride, she's coming to get me, or when I'm hungry she's bringing me food. She's
just a great person. That's my sister.  
  
Q. Kalani and Lauren, y'all faced it some during the year, but this is a
team where maybe everybody shoots the three. How difficult is that to try to
get out there when you're used to playing in the post and guarding in the
post? Lauren, I know you've done more of it, but how difficult is that to get
out to the arc and defend them?  
KALANI BROWN: I think it's been a little bit more difficult for me than for
Lauren, with me being used to playing people my size and in the paint. But
that's something I've been working on pretty much all year because Coach said
you might as well be prepared for it, teams are going to do it. It's
definitely been an improvement for me defensively.  
  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, it's definitely difficult, especially for the team, just
because Coach always says to the guards, if you get beat, don't foul them as
we're going to the basket because you have a second line of defense. Me and
Kalani are there. So when they spread us out, we can't be just sitting in the
paint waiting for them, we have to have a foot in the paint, we have to kind
of hedge at them and then get back to our player.  
  
KALANI BROWN: It also takes us out of rebounding, which is another big part of
our transition.  
  
Q. A lot of players have come to Rupp Arena and had difficulties
adjusting because of the lights. I know you guys haven't practiced yet, but
have you been out of the court and taken a look at the landscape, and have you
noticed the lights may be somewhat bothersome for you guys or for you
particularly?  
LAUREN COX: We haven't been out there yet, but that's one of the things that
we're going to have to adjust to during this first practice. I think we're
going to be doing a lot of shooting. That's one of the things that you always
have to adjust to coming to a new arena, so I think once we shoot around a
little bit, we'll be all right.  
  
Q. The tradition of the program and the success, I don't want to say
take it for granted, but what have you come to appreciate in your time, just
where you've been able to go, what you've been able to do with this program?  
DEKEIYA COHEN: I most definitely appreciate winning really. Every time we win
a championship, it's like a new goal that we set and we surpass it, and it
never gets tiresome. And just making it to the Elite 8 in general, like
hopefully -- and the Sweet 16, as well. We never take it for granted. Every
year, everyone doesn't make it this far. So we just never like look past it.
We take it one game at a time, and just focus on what we're doing at the
moment.  
  
Q. Lauren, same kind of question I asked Kalani earlier, but how much
has Matt helped you in terms of your conditioning and just getting you maybe
in better shape, ready to play more minutes? How much has he helped you in
that term?  
LAUREN COX: He's helped a lot. I was out for most of the summer because I had
a procedure on my knees, so I wasn't able to run or anything like that, so
once I came back, he kind of helped me. He was going to breakfast with me
every morning, making sure I eat good. Like Kalani said, improving our
nutrition and just helping me lose some weight, just get my body ready for the
season.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2018&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 26, 2018

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Jessica Shepard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32622)

### [Kathryn Westbeld](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28382)

  
_Spokane, Washington_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Oregon - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the West Regional Champions, Notre Dame. We'll
begin with an opening statement from coach followed by questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: So proud of this team, where we came from, what we've overcome
to get here, over a great Oregon team. Sabrina Ionescu, just a fantastic
player. Did a great job on her in the third quarter, I thought was as well as
we played defensively. That was the difference in the game.  
  
Got them to miss a couple shots, rebounded really well. Jackie Young
particularly rebounded well. Kathryn, you expect a senior to be ready to lead
your team, she certainly did that today. Balance in the scoring like we've
always had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jessica, you guys go to the halftime locker room down six. What was
being talked about? What was the mentality you went in with the third
quarter?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think the biggest thing for us as players was just going in
there focusing, we knew we were a better team than them offensively, we knew
it ultimately came down to defense, just getting stops. We knew that first
five minutes of the third quarter would be really important for us.  
  
Q. Kathryn, as what point did you kind of realize they maybe weren't
paying that much attention to you in the paint, maybe this could be a good
offensive game for you?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I think from right at the get-go, the high post was really
open, midrange. So I just kind of took what they gave me. We have four great
players, other than me on the floor, at the same time. You have to kind of
take away -- choose something to give up. I think they chose me to kind of
leave me a little bit, double-team on some other people.  
  
So, you know, I just kind of took what they gave me.  
  
Q. Kathryn, how is the ankle? What has enabled you to log these heavy
minutes through that injury?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: The ankle's all right. It's sore. It's going to be sore. But
this is my senior year, last round in the tournament. I'm just going to give
it my all regardless of pain, injury, anything. I'm just going to fight, play
with my teammates, fight for them, play for everybody in South Bend, family,
friends, everyone.  
  
Q. With all that you have been through as a team this year, getting to
this point, what does it mean for both of you?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I mean, it definitely means a lot, especially it being my
senior year. Honestly, just what we've overcome this season with seven
scholarship players, everyone really just fighting like till the end literally
through everything, broken nose, sprains, black eyes, Marina's bump on her
forehead now.  
  
I'm just honestly so proud of each and every one of our players. Just what
we've overcome, how we've stuck together through it all, through the rough
times, how we've overcome everything and came out on top.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I agree. Just proud of everyone in that locker room,
from the four that tore the ACLs that are there every day at practice, giving
their best for us. The walk-ons that come on every day at practice, practice
hard against us, it's not easy. Just proud of this team. I think you look at
what we do have, and that's really the key to this team. I think we're just
relentless. We're not going to settle for anything less than our best.  
  
Q. Did you notice any frustration from Oregon on the court because
they're not used to struggling like that offensively?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I think a little bit in the third quarter. You started
to see that frustration. There were some unnecessary elbows here and there.
The refs weren't calling them, which was fine. You could definitely sense
their frustration.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, student-athletes. We will now move on
to questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said yesterday your team maybe not the best defensively, and you
would have to battle. Describe what did you see out of your team in that third
quarter?  
MUFFET McGRAW: They proved me right in the first half, didn't they? The third
quarter, I thought we guarded the ball screen a little differently. We tried
to double Sabrina a little bit more, tried to get a little bit of a hedge. I
think that was a little more effective than our Plan A, B, C in the first
half. We dug deep to the scouting report to go to that one.  
  
Q. You talked about your pride with this team. Can you compare it to the
other trips to the Final Four? Something more special about this group?  
MUFFET McGRAW: This one's just so rewarding because I think even though we're
No. 1 seed, a little unexpected. I think at the beginning of the year, we got
blown out at Louisville. We were down 23 to Tennessee. We had a stretch in the
middle there that determined our season. We battled back from it. That's where
you saw their character.  
  
I think that was definitely the game that turned our season. This team, they
just never gave up.  
  
Q. When you have a comeback like that, the history of comebacks you have
had, does a six-point deficit at halftime tonight not feel as daunting?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It didn't. We felt we couldn't be worse defensively than we
were in the first half. Defensively we're on pace, doing what we were supposed
to do. We didn't look sharp, but we were still scoring. We felt like we're in
a good spot right now, we're not playing that well, and we're only down six.  
  
Q. Kathryn hasn't had many offensive games like that. Was she aware of
the fact they were leaving her open early on? Did you point that out to her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We pointed it out before the game, we wanted to attack the mid
post area. Every timeout she reminded them to look for that spot. She's so
good there. She makes good decisions. She can make that shot.  
  
I think the guards really had a little trouble finding her at times, but
eventually they were able to see the open man.  
  
Q. What kind of testament is it to your team that you get big
performances from every different starter in one of the two games this week?
How does that compare in terms of the depth of different players?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's hard to pick an MVP. You look at the whole starting unit,
we couldn't do it without any of them. Certainly Arike has had a fantastic
year, made a lot of All-American teams. We wouldn't be here without Jessica
Shepard, without Marina Mabrey, without Jackie Young, and Kathryn. And really,
Coco and Dani on the bench. We've needed everybody at times this year. I think
everybody has stepped up and come through for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

### [Ruthy Hebard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33290)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

  
_Spokane, Washington_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Oregon - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon. We'll begin with an opening statement
by coach, followed by questions for the student-athletes.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I first want to congratulate Notre Dame on moving on to
the Final Four. They're a great program. Coach McGraw does such a great job.
This particular group is a great team.  
  
I'm disappointed for us. I know this is something that we obviously wanted. It
was attainable, I felt. I think the second half was the separation. You saw a
team that was still trying to climb the mountain, trying to get to where we've
never been before. And you saw a team that knew how to get there, and they
wanted it. It shows up in that rebound stat.  
  
But it doesn't take anything away from what a great season these guys have
had. There's so many firsts, I can't even enumerate them. Pac-12 champions
twice over this season. They acted and behaved like champions all year. Today
we just didn't have enough in that second half to get it done.  
  
But I'm really proud of 'em. This is a team that will be back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you go to the halftime locker room up six. What was the
feeling? What happened the first couple minutes of the second half?  
SABRINA IONESCU: We got hot there at the end of the second quarter, but we
knew they were going to come back fiery. They don't want to lose. They know
what it's like to win at a high level. We knew they were going to come out and
punch us. We just had to be able to punch back, and we didn't.  
  
Q. Ruthy, how challenging was it to rebound against those guys? Did you
feel like that was the key to the game?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, definitely was a key to the game. They're big, strong,
physical players. I think I and a few other people could have done better.  
  
But that's how it turned out.  
  
Q. Sabrina, it seemed like the pace got to them a little bit in the
second quarter. What was the challenge of trying to get back to that pace over
the course of the second half?  
SABRINA IONESCU: We got stops in the first half. I think that led to
transition baskets. That's what we're best at. It's hard to run in transition
when they continue to score. So that's where we, you know, fell behind. That's
where we couldn't really get out of our hole. They kept scoring. They went on
a run. We couldn't go on a run, and we couldn't get our rhythm back.  
  
But it happens. I mean, we're going to learn from this and we're going to come
back next year better.  
  
Q. Ruthy, what did Notre Dame do differently than almost any other team
this year that they were able to beat you guys underneath the basket?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I don't think they did anything differently. I think I just
needed to get more rebounds, be in the right position a little more.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you were obviously the nation's best three-point shooting
team all year. Today 27%. What was so good about their perimeter defense that
was limiting you from even getting looks?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, they've been in this position before. They know how
to scout teams. They know who our shooter was. They knew what our post
players, guards liked to do. They knew our personnel well. That's what they
did, they played us to our weaknesses. They're long, they're athletic, they
flew by on our shooters and contested a lot of shots. We didn't get a lot of
open looks tonight.  
  
We have to be able to hit those shots regardless if they know our personnel or
not.  
  
Q. Sabrina, when you get some perspective, do you think you'll look back
on this season, what do you think you'll think about this particular team?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I'll definitely remember this game. I mean, you know, it was
a great run. I mean, this is going to hurt. We had a great year. I'm happy our
freshmen were able to come in and contribute and see what it's like to play
for an Elite 8. I'm happy we were able to do that last year.  
  
I think they're going to come back better. Happy to do this for our seniors.
We had a historic year this year, winning the Pac-12 tournament, winning the
regular season.  
  
At the end of the day we needed to get over this hump, and we didn't. So this
is what I'm going to remember. But regardless, we're going to come back, we're
going to learn from this, we're going to come back better and hunting this
Final Four next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to the student-athletes. We'll move on to questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Looking at the box score, it's 51-29 rebounds advantage, 52 points in
the paint. That really was the story, wasn't it?  
KELLY GRAVES: It was, yeah. It was. Obviously a couple of their players are
really strong. But I don't think it was as much that as it was, you could
tell, they wanted it. They were physical. They went after it. Jackie Young was
so impressive on that offensive boards. We haven't been manhandled like that
on the boards all year. A lot of it was in the second half. We gave up some in
the first half.  
  
I don't think we came out like, Oh, yeah, we're up. I don't think it was
anything like that. They just raised their level, and we didn't quite enough.
I knew this game was going to come down, I remember texting Holly Rowe before
the game, saying, Holly, it's going to be the team that puts that one quarter
together defensively that is going to win the game. They did it in the third
quarter. That's where the game was won.  
  
Q. What did they do defensively? Third quarter you really struggled to
get in a flow offensively. Sabrina seemed to be trying to find someone to pick
up the slack.  
KELLY GRAVES: Very first possession was Lexi Bando wide open in the corner,
three. We've run that play several times. She was literally wide open and
missed it.  
  
I thought Ruthy had some looks inside. I thought it got pretty physical at
times. I thought Sabrina had some good looks around the rim, some pull-ups
that we were making in the first half.  
  
We had five turnovers, so it's not like we were giving the ball away or
anything like that. We didn't make the same shots that we were making earlier
in the game.  
  
Now, maybe they were contested a little bit more. But, you know, normally when
we get some of those shooters open, like they were, that's like a layup for
some of them. Just didn't make 'em tonight.  
  
Q. This was Lexi's last game as a Duck. Talk about what her career has
been like.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I owe a lot to Lexi. She was the first one to take a
chance on us when we started the program. She's a local kid. Not many local
Eugenians have stayed at the University of Oregon, especially good players.
They won two state championships there. She means a lot to this program now.
She left a legacy that nobody before did. 33 wins this year, like I said, the
Pac-12 championship. There were so many firsts, I can't even enumerate. She's
a big part of that. She's been so consistent for four years. You look at her
scoring average, it stayed within one point I think every single year she was
there.  
  
Most importantly, on top of all her records and those kind of things, she's
just been a great representative of our university. She's a great student.
She's a good citizen. She's been a great leader on the team. She's been an
awesome teammate.  
  
I'm really proud of her. Early on she and I would (clash) from time to time
because we're similar in some ways. We've both grown up. She's been an
absolute pleasure and joy to coach.  
  
Q. Are your emotions kind of mirroring Sabrina, this is going to hurt
for a while, but it can maybe fuel you next year to get to the Final Four?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I wouldn't make predictions. We were good enough. We were
good enough. Last year I don't think we were ready for that. I think this year
we were. We played in a lot of big games. I was joking with the team, the
other side of the Elite 8 bracket, we played seven games against those teams
and played every single one of those teams. Every big game that we've had this
year seems like we've won. So we've come through.  
  
Tonight we didn't. We met a team that was just a little bit tougher. If you
saw my board before the game, number one key to success, toughest team wins.
They were the toughest team.  
  
Q. Did you think after the first half that this might be kind of like
the Pac-12, one of those nights where Sabrina takes over, carries the team to
victory?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I was hoping. She's such a great player. She's capable of
doing that any time.  
  
No, game like this against an opponent like Notre Dame, it takes everybody.
Everybody that's playing has to be at their best. We just weren't tonight.  
  
But there's always that thought in the back of your mind that, Hey, Sabrina
can take this over. She was going against some really athletic and motivated
guards, for sure.  
  
Q. You mentioned toughness and the physicality of the game. Is that
something you'll be looking to enhance with your team next year, get them more
physical?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't think that's been an issue with us this year. It kind of
was tonight. I wouldn't say that's been a downfall or a negative of ours this
year.  
  
Sure, games like this where they're letting you play, and they did let us
play, we didn't respond as well as we should have.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Thank you.

### [Marina Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30383)

  
_Spokane, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Notre Dame. We will begin with questions for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Arike and Marina, what have you learned about Oregon during this
brief prep time, Sabrina and their guards specifically? Do they remind you of
anyone you played this year?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: They're a great team. I mean, we watched film on them. We
went through practice. We just have to be ready for anything. They can score
at all different positions, so we don't have to focus on one person, focus on
everybody. It's going to be a team defensive game.  
  
MARINA MABREY: They're great in the ball screen. We need to try to control
Sabrina and make her take tough shots. As Arike said, we need to play a good
team defense.  
  
Q. Jessica, how tough of a matchup will it be facing against a player
like Ruthy?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think like they said, it's definitely going to be a team
effort. They have a great inside presence, too. For us it's going to be
important on the defensive end to control them on defense. We know that will
lead to easy offense.  
  
Q. Kathryn, how has the process been with your ankle this week? What
kind of feeling did you have hitting that jumper yesterday that put the game
away?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I mean, it feels a little bit better each day. The swelling
goes down. Bruising kind of turns color. It's kind of interesting to see what
it looks like the next day.  
  
Honestly, I was just in the flow of the game. It felt like any other shot to
me honestly. I just hit it, got back on D, finished off the game, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. We'll now move
on to questions for coach.  
  
Q. You have played a really hard schedule. Does Oregon remind you of
anyone you faced? What's it been like getting ready for them in such a short
period of time?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Very difficult to get ready in a short period of time. Think
Sabrina is just a phenomenal player, just phenomenal. So difficult to guard.
I've never seen a player, especially so young, already got the record for
triple-doubles, but the assists is what's so impressive to me. I've had some
pretty good point guards, some good guards, but to look at the number of
assists she has, really it's a challenge to figure out how to defend them.  
  
She can just pick you apart. I mean, she's just so smart and crafty with the
ball. It's fun watching her when you're not on the other bench.  
  
Q. You guys have been among the sports elites for a long time. Oregon is
new to that, relatively the last couple years. What is your perception of the
Oregon program, what you think it might be like for their team being so new on
this big stage?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, great program. Kelly has done a tremendous job with
the recruiting. Sabrina just makes everybody better. She's definitely the key
to their team, what she can do. They got good players all around her.  
  
I think they're in the stage of, you know, kind of the rise. It's got to be a
lot of fun for them. Last year I think a 10 seed, got to the Elite 8. This
year a 2 seed, so they've made tremendous strides in a short period of time.
He's really turned the program around. They are now one of the best programs
in the country.  
  
Q. Sabrina gets a lot of the attention. Ruthy set the NCAA record for
consecutive field goals, 33. Do you like the matchup with your players in
trying to limit her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She is a really tough matchup because she's able to score
around the basket, it seems easily. She gets a lot of great shots, again I
think because Sabrina finds her, puts her in a great position to score. To
have that kind of record, I think that's really phenomenal. She's probably
shattered the record. I think it's amazing how she can score her field goal
percentage. You know she's going to score when she gets the ball. The question
is, can you stop her from getting it. That's going to be the challenge.  
  
Q. You've talked about Sabrina and Ruthy. Just overall what kind of key
areas do you feel like you have to limit Oregon in to be successful
tomorrow?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, they're the best three-point shooting team in the
country. We've got to figure out a way to guard the three-point line. We
haven't had a lot of success just playing Villanova a couple games ago, who
was another great three-point shooting team. I don't think we guarded them
that well. This is going to be yet another challenge for us, especially with
our lineup. We're playing more bigs than we want to, which makes it even more
difficult to guard the three-point line.  
  
Q. In the first round you talked about you started pretty badly on
defense. You talked about maybe you gave too much attention early on. Against
Texas A &M yesterday, not a great defensive start. Too much attention to
Carter early on. Other players were able to make some shots. This Oregon team,
Sabrina is so good, how do you get that balance right between star player and
the rest of the team?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, we didn't have a lot of success guarding the star player
yesterday. She had 31. So I think we've got to do a better job individually
just on the ball, man-to-man wise. Then team defense, being more aware of
where people are. I don't think we can focus on one person because they have
such a good, well-rounded team.  
  
Q. With two such efficient offensive teams, do you look at this kind of
similar to the Texas A &M game, where that one quarter of strong defense you
had in the third can make the difference?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Whew, I hope so. It would be great if we could have a strong
defensive game throughout. But we're not a great defensive team. We need to
really battle a little bit more.  
  
But I think with the limited bench that we have, it makes it difficult for
them. So I think defense is going to be a key to the game. Both teams have
high-powered offense. It's going to be a matter of who can get some stops.  
  
Q. Considering you guys have high skill level on offense, too, would you
mind at all if it was an up-tempo, high-scoring game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We are a high-tempo type of team. I think that's when we're at
our best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Thanks.

THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon. We will begin with questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you have obviously played a lot of good guards this year. Is
this tandem of guards that Notre Dame has up there with anyone you faced?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Of course, they have great guards. They're athletic. They can
shoot the ball. They can get to the basket. They're great in transition.  
  
But we faced guards like that all year. They have great post players as well.
We're not going to do anything different. I think we're going to stick to our
game plan and play basketball the way that we play it, we've played it all
year.  
  
Q. Satou, what is it like bouncing back from the other night? What is
your mentality coming back from that performance?  
SATOU SABALLY: I mean, I'm looking forward to the next game. I'm really
excited to play in the Elite 8 for the first time. Playing with those amazing
players, I'm just looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Maite and Satou, did you watch the NCAA tournament growing up in
Europe? If not, what has it been like playing in it? What time will it be and
how will your family watch it?  
MAITE CAZORLA: No, I didn't really watch it when I was back home. It's a great
experience. My family usually stays up and watch the game. It's usually 2 a.m.
there. I'm really thankful for that.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: Yeah, same with me. I didn't really know a lot about college
basketball. Last year I started watching college basketball. I bought the ESPN
pass for it, just for March Madness, to watch those people (laughter).  
  
Yeah, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa, they are all watching the games at
night.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Lexi, you guys said after the Central Michigan game you
didn't play your best game. Where do you think you need to play better against
Notre Dame to beat them?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, in every aspect I think we need to play better. We're
going to have to stay dialed in for 40 minutes. They're well-coached, have
veteran players, players that have played overseas in international
basketball. They know what it takes to win. They've won at a high level for
many years.  
  
We're going to have to stay focused for 40 minutes of the game, offensively,
defensively, apply pressure, try to play them to their weaknesses.  
  
LEXI BANDO: Piggybacking off of what Sabrina just said, I think the game is
going to be won at the defensive end for us. We just have to know the game
plan, know personnel. I think that's where the game's going to be won.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you said yesterday it took you a few minutes to get settled
in, had a little bit of jitters at the beginning. Have you talked about that,
how you're going to settle in quicker tomorrow?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think the second game is always easier. So I don't think
we'll have too many jitters. Of course, everyone is going to be nervous. It's
just part of the game. I think everyone knows what's at stake. We're going to
have to come ready to play. I'm excited to see what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sabrina, Notre Dame has been a pretty dominant team in the NCAA
tournament and college basketball the last 10-plus years. What have you seen
from them? What can you say about their program watching them growing up?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I think I was talking to Lexi yesterday. I don't think
I've ever seen them live. Yesterday was my first time seeing them live, which
was actually really cool. I have seen them a lot, know a lot of their players,
playing against them growing up. They're well-coached. They have players that
play hard. They want to win and they know how to win.  
  
So we definitely learn from them, and we learn from every team we play, and
take what they do and try to do it as well. But I think we'll be fine
tomorrow. We're excited to be in this position, excited to get better.  
  
Q. Ruthy, your offense has gotten better. Defensively, big numbers
yesterday. Where does that defensive performance rank for you in terms of how
much you held your own on that end of the floor? How different is this matchup
going to be tomorrow?  
RUTHY HEBARD: We've been working all year with the post players, being able to
play players one-on-one. I was happy I could do that yesterday for the team.
Tomorrow they have great post players, so all of us need to be dialed in
again, be ready to take on their posts one-on-one, and hopefully do the same
as last night.  
  
Q. Ruthy, you got to watch a little bit of Notre Dame and Texas A &M.
What stood out against the team you faced earlier in the season?  
RUTHY HEBARD: For Texas A&M?  
  
Q. No, for Notre Dame, a team you also played.  
RUTHY HEBARD: Definitely the posts, like he said. They're really strong and
physical. Definitely going to have to have our feet set, be just as strong, be
ready for a dogfight all 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Maite, I don't know if you got to see the Texas A &M game. Got a
pretty big lead against Notre Dame. You beat Texas A&M twice during the
season. What do you think you can take from that? Were you able to see how
they were able to get that lead, duplicate that, keep it going?  
MAITE CAZORLA: I think tomorrow we just have to be ready. We have to play hard
for 40 minutes. I think that's real important. But especially we need to be
dialed in defensively.  
  
Q. Lexi, we talked a little bit about defending the perimeter ahead of
the Central Michigan. Notre Dame has good perimeter shooters. What did you
learn from defending the perimeter against Central Michigan and how do you
carry that into tomorrow?  
LEXI BANDO: The three-point ball is the great equalizer in the game. That's
where upsets are made. So we're going to have to make them, you know, score
tough, contested jump shots, we're going to have to really defend the three.
We've been doing that kind of all season, all throughout the tournament. I
think we're ready. We just have to be dialed in for 40 minutes, like the girls
said.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you've been playing double-digit seeds to this point. Do you
feel like an underdog going into this matchup? Where are your heads in terms
of that?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, I don't think so. I don't think we're an underdog. I
don't really know what everyone else is talking about. I'm not really paying
attention to it.  
  
But seeding-wise, you could say we're an underdog. They are the 1 seed. But I
think once that game starts, it's anybody's game. I think we're just as
talented as they are. So I'm excited to see how we match up with their
players. I'm excited to see how we grow. I just want the game -- I wish the
game was today (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes to the locker room. We will
now move on to questions for the coach.  
  
Q. I wonder about the historical contrast between Notre Dame and Oregon.
Notre Dame has been to nine Elite 8s, you're making your second trip. Maybe
for the team that doesn't necessarily matter. Is there some significance there
at all?  
KELLY GRAVES: Not really, as far as they're concerned. I mean, this is the
first time they've met Notre Dame, or we've met Notre Dame in an Elite 8. I
don't think they pay much attention to what's happened in the past.  
  
I think Sabrina said it pretty well. She knows this is one of the storied
programs in our game. But all that doesn't matter tomorrow. It's 40 minutes
between the Ducks and the Irish, so...  
  
Q. Do you like the level head Sabrina showed in terms of the seeding?
Seems pretty unfazed about the fact they're finally the lower seed in a
matchup.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, again, we've been preaching all along that the seeding
doesn't matter at this point. Everybody's really good. Yeah, well, Sabrina is
a natural at this stuff. She's about the best there is. I was really proud of
a lot of clichés they used. That was impressive (smiling).  
  
But, no, I really feel that our team is confident. They're ready. I mean, they
know what we're up against. I think we all feel that we're a good basketball
team, and we have a chance tomorrow for 40 minutes to go prove it.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked a little bit about the energy not being where
you wanted it coming out of the locker room. What are you telling the girls to
make sure that doesn't happen again tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, they know we're playing Notre Dame tomorrow. I don't think
that will happen. And I think we were ready yesterday. I think coming out of
the locker room in the second half we relaxed a little defensively, got that
back in line.  
  
We took control early in the game. I know we missed some shots early. But that
happens. We were playing well. Then when we built a lead, we just kind of
stayed on it. We never really kind of buried them. They never really were in
the game either. It was kind of a businesslike effort.  
  
I thought for about five minutes in that second half, we relaxed a little bit.
They hit a couple threes, got some energy. We kind of reined it in. We're
playing the 1 seed for a right to go to the Final Four. Yeah, if we can't get
up for something like that, then we're in big, big trouble.  
  
I don't anticipate that will happen.  
  
Q. Do you agree with the players that with two offenses this strong,
this is won at the defensive end? How do you feel you guys are playing on that
end since the start of the Pac-12 tournament?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think we've been playing really well defensively. I can't
remember what they scored last night. It was in the 60s. It was well below
their average. I think seven or eight games prior to yesterday, teams were
only scoring 55 on us, and five of those seven games were against teams in the
NCAA tournament.  
  
We've been defending actually quite well for about a month. Tomorrow, yeah,
these two great offenses, I think this is going to be one of those epic games.
I know a lot of people in women's college basketball are looking forward to
it, two teams with a lot of skill offensively, a lot of different weapons,
star power. This should be a fun game.  
  
Yes, when you have games like that, whoever can make -- you know, put together
a great quarter of defense, that might be the difference. Maybe that's a
three- or four-minute stretch of good defense. That might be three or four
consecutive stops kind of defense that I think will really impact the game.  
  
I'm actually really looking forward to it as a coach who enjoys offensive
basketball. But, yes, I do agree. I think defense in the end is going to carry
the day.  
  
Q. Talk about the mental process over the last few years of turning this
underdog program really into a program where these guys feel like we're not
underdogs to anybody any more.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I don't feel, like anybody thinks they're underdogs. All
this team knows is winning. I guess it would just be our two seniors, Lexi,
and not even Justine because she was a transfer. Lexi is the only one that was
there the first year we had a losing record. But Maite and Oti, those are our
only two juniors. Their first we won 24 games, went to the semifinals of the
WNIT. It wasn't the NCAA. They won, what, does that make four games in that
tournament? We won three games in last year's tournament, the NCAA, then three
games this year.  
  
I think they like post-season basketball. They're used to playing it. Even
though we're still relatively young, I don't think the stage fazes them, I
truly don't. Sabrina, Ruthy, those kids, they thrive on this kind of setting.  
  
We sure don't preach the underdog role. We did maybe a little bit last year,
but not this year, yeah.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about last year, obviously you played UConn
basically on the road in this scenario. How much can you draw on that
experience in terms of just getting off to a better start?  
KELLY GRAVES: That was not relatively a road game. That was a road game in
Bridgeport, believe me (smiling).  
  
Again, I think this team, we've matured. I don't think the venue matters that
much, who the crowd is cheering for. Obviously you want the crowd on your
side. Hopefully they will be tomorrow. I've lived up here, I think there are a
lot of Catholics that will come out and support the Irish. I don't know.  
  
I think at this point that's not going to be a difference maker. I think
they'll say they feed off that.  
  
These guys are usually pretty dialed into what's going on on the floor.
Externally, I don't think that matters as much to them, I truly don't. Which
is good, that means they are maturing as a team.  
  
Q. What kind of key areas have you identified with Notre Dame you have
to limit to be successful tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we can't let Mabrey go off and score three at a time.
She's, what, 15 of 24, 23 or something, from the three-point line in the
tournament. Then what she does, again, when she hits a three, it seems like
it's four. You know the next one now is going to go down easier.  
  
We've got to make sure that she's making two-pointers. Them as a team really,
but especially her. They're not a huge three-point shooting team, but she is
one that can really get it going. When she's making those, it stretches the
defense, then Shepard is a load inside. She is really good. The more I watch
her, the more I appreciate that. I didn't up until I've had a chance to really
watch them here.  
  
She is as strong and physical as any post I've seen this year. We've played
some good ones. We played the Louisville post, McCowan at Mississippi State,
those in our conference. She's terrific.  
  
I think Arike is special. She truly is. We cannot allow her to make plays in
transition. We just can't. We've got to sprint back. We've likened it to UCLA
with Jordin Canada, those kids are airplanes, jet airplanes. When they take
off, we can't catch them. We've got to make sure we take care of the ball so
that we can all get back and take away any driving lanes that Arike might
have.  
  
I think those three are the key. Jackie Young is a terrific player. Have to
keep her off the glass. They kind of have with Westbeld, by committee at that
four spot, they're solid.  
  
I think the key, though is transition D, eliminate those easy baskets, make
them work for everything, and keep them off the boards. We gave up two
offensive rebounds yesterday. If we do that tomorrow, we lose.  
  
Q. Satou goes over five from three, but also seems unfazed. I would
assume it's fair to say you feel confident in her? Also Ruthy, how much better
is she prepared this year compared to last year for a physical post matchup?  
KELLY GRAVES: Ruthy, those that watch us on a daily basis have seen just her
growth. It's incredible. You see it game to game with her. She's still got a
lot more to give. So I think she's going to be fine. I mean, she's going to be
ready for this. I think looks forward to it.  
  
If you've noticed Satou this year, she sometimes has struggled in the first
game of a weekend. I think she went scoreless against USC, came back from UCLA
and scored 35. Against the Beavers the first time she maybe had two, then came
back with a 24-point effort two days later. That's kind of been her MO. I
don't want to tell the Irish anything here, but that's her MO. She's been a
good bounce-back player, which shows maturity in her. She knows we have
confidence in her.  
  
Q. Do you have depth as a potential edge with their injuries? Is that
something you can try to take advantage of?  
KELLY GRAVES: I always feel like we have an advantage when it comes to depth.
We really do play a deep bench, sometimes not a ton of minutes. We try to get
all our players some rest. Yeah, I think any time you can get rest this late
in the season is a positive. I know they have to, to play a lot of minutes.
They've handled that so well all year long. To me it actually is amazing that
they can play at the pace with which they play and the skill, just how
efficient they are with relatively no bench. I mean, that's a true testament
to some awesome players and a phenomenal coach.  
  
But, yeah, we'll always try to use that as an advantage. I love our bench. I
trust our bench.  
  
Q. Oregon and Notre Dame have not played in women's hoops. Do you know
Muffet from anywhere?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, actually she may not remember. It was actually a pretty
good game. My first NCAA tournament as a coach was against her, her team, down
in Baton Rouge, back in 1997. It was a close game. One-possession game late.
They ended up beating us. That's when they had Ruth Riley, Niele Ivey. That
was my first NCAA tournament as a coach. We later played when I was at Gonzaga
back in 2010, in the '10/'11 season, with Skylar Diggins, Courtney
Vandersloot. That year they went to the championship game, we went to the
Elite 8. If you would have watched that game that night you wouldn't have
guessed either team would have done what we did. It was an ugly game. It was a
post Christmas game and both teams played like it.  
  
Yes, we've gone head-to-head twice. I've been on the short end both times. But
both good games.  
  
Q. I saw you retweeted this last night, so I figured I'd ask you about
this. Would you rather try to guard Ruthy in the post with pun possession or
stick your head in a box filled with wasps for an hour?  
KELLY GRAVES: With all due respect to Shea Sarrano know who has become a Ducks
fan, I would try to guard Ruthy. I'm not much for sticking my head in a wasp's
nest for an hour. It's pretty neat that he's jumped onboard. He's a great
follow on Twitter and a great author, so...  
  
I retweeted that? Okay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

### [Jackie Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35203)

### [Marina Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30383)

  
_Spokane, Washington_  
  
Notre Dame - 90, Texas A&M - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined by Notre Dame. We'll begin with an
opening statement from Coach McGraw, then open the floor to the student-
athletes.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'm just so proud of this team and what we accomplished,
especially Kathryn Westbeld playing basically on one leg. I thought the jumper
she hit from the free-throw line was the difference in the game. That was the
game winner.  
  
Really, really thought Marina shot the ball extremely well. Jackie took over
the game I thought for a stretch late in the fourth quarter. Just phenomenal
play by our guards.  
  
I thought Howard really, really she was just a nightmare fun for us. We
couldn't keep her off the boards. She picked today to decide she was going to
be a great three-point shooter in addition to the other things she does so
well. She was phenomenal today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marina, talk about how you guys were able to exploit the three-point
shooting, how you were able to have so much success.  
MARINA MABREY: I think a few times in transition, they might have mixed up
some players. Got some shots there. Also Jess got some good driving kicks.
Also in transition finding the open player was working for us.  
  
Q. Marina, six threes in the first game of the tournament, seven today.
Is it the quality of the shots? You just shooting the ball well? Any
explanation?  
MARINA MABREY: I practiced for it (smiling).  
  
I don't know. I think when the shots are open, they're a little bit easier to
make. My teammates are finding me in great positions.  
  
Q. Jackie, that kind of stretch you had in the fourth quarter, what were
you seeing that made you so good at the offensive end?  
JACKIE YOUNG: Yeah, I knew (indiscernible) was in foul trouble. We were just
going at her. We knew she didn't want to pick up another foul, so we were
running a couple plays for me. I was able to get going off of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. We will now
move on to questions for coach.  
  
Q. Defensively when they jumped out to the 31-19 lead, did you change
anything defensively to help cause that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We did. We were so worried about Carter, we kept leaving the
high post really exposed. That's where Howard I thought was having a field day
on us. We tried to go to a couple different things, went to the triangle-and-
two, then went back to the zone. Had a little more success just trying to
guard the high post.  
  
That was an area that we had worked on. It was really open. We had a hard time
matching up to them in our zone. They did a really good job early on,
especially moving the ball and hitting the open man.  
  
Q. The stretch you had late second quarter got you guys back in the
game. Third quarter is when they shot poorly, you moved ahead. How important
was that first stretch?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was huge. We got down big. We've been down in other games.
We feel like we are poised and can come back. I thought we showed a lack of
discipline in the first quarter. Our shot selection was bad. We didn't get any
rebounds. I think we had one offensive rebound at halftime. We weren't getting
the ball to Jessica Shepard, which was a big part of our game plan, then we
couldn't get any stops. We did a lot of things wrong in the first quarter. I
thought readied the ship a little in the second quarter to pull within two,
then third quarter I think we relaxed and played our game a little bit more.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Westbeld, coming back from the injury. Not a
lot on the stat sheet, but drawing charges, setting screens. How has she been
in terms of recovery from the injury?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought she made a huge impact in the game. She hasn't
recovered yet. Unfortunately she wasn't able to practice this week. She was in
the boot. It's probably not going to get a lot better by Monday's game.  
  
She shows tremendous toughness. We need her in the game because she does so
many things for us that don't show up on the stat sheet. She's a great
facilitator for us with the ball on the high post. That huge basket, that free
throw jumper she hit, that was the play of the game.  
  
Q. I know you've been asked a lot about how a few number of players have
carried you. But talk about they're iron horses out there, aren't they?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'm sorry?  
  
Q. They're iron horses out there. They carry the load.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have a great strength and conditioning program. I think
they're in great shape. They know they're going to have to go the distance, I
think they're ready for it. I think sometimes they rest a little bit on
defense because of it.  
  
Foul trouble was a huge worry today with Jackie picking up two quick ones in
the first quarter. Danielle Patterson came in and gave us great minutes. Coco
came in and gave us great minutes. Generally those three guards are going to
have to go the distance for us. I think that's all thanks to our strength and
conditioning program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Thank you.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
Oregon - 83, Central Michigan - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Central Michigan. We will begin with an
opening statement from coach and then open the floor to questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
SUE GUEVARA: First of all, I think give a lot of credit to Oregon. They're
tough, they have a lot of weapons. When they're firing, they're firing.  
  
I'll tell you something, I cannot tell you enough how proud I am of our team,
the way we battled. I thought that at one point we were able to cut the lead
from 15, and I think we got it to 10 maybe, or 9. We just couldn't get over
that hump.  
  
I thought that we had some great looks. They didn't go down. But I love this
team. I couldn't be more proud of the effort that they gave today and that
they've given all season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cassie, when you had the back-to-back threes, that cut the lead to 9
at that point. What was the feeling on the team?  
CASSIE BREEN: I think the feeling on the team was that we weren't going to
give up. We were just going to keep pushing. Whether it was back-to-back
threes or Tinara's back-to-back and-one layups, we just wanted to fight. We
knew it was going to be a fight against Oregon. Obviously they're a really
great team. We just didn't want to give up.  
  
So that adrenaline and that emotion, like, after my and-one, I was just, like,
last 20 minutes, we got to give it all we got.  
  
Q. Tinara, this might have been your last game. Do you want to have a
chance to reflect on your career, this season specifically.  
TINARA MOORE: It's just been amazing.  
  
I don't want to answer, I'm sorry.  
  
SUE GUEVARA: It's been amazing for what Tinara has gone through. Obviously
she's pretty emotional. Again, if you look at what she has done in the four
years of her career here, I don't think we've ever had a player improve as
much as she has improved. You know, when you love something so much, it hurts.
It hurts.  
  
Q. Presley, touch on what these two seniors have meant to you, playing
for Central Michigan.  
PRESLEY HUDSON: I'm going to miss 'em a lot. They're family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you for
your time.  
  
SUE GUEVARA: Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will now move on to questions for coach.  
  
Q. It really came down to that first half where it seemed like all the
open shots didn't go in.  
SUE GUEVARA: It came down to the first quarter. I thought, you know, we had
some open looks, looks that usually go in, that did not go in, whether it was
from the high post or short corner. I thought, you know, if we could have got
our outside game going a little bit, I think it would have helped our inside
game.  
  
Again, I think you give Oregon some credit. They're long. They got that big
paw up in you. They were really bodying us up inside. I'm not sure that we
adjusted quick enough offensively inside.  
  
Then you saw Tinara get going a little bit, and that helped. Obviously Cassie
hitting some shots, Presley hitting some shots. We took Presley off the point
so she would be able to come off some screens, maybe get her shot off a little
bit. When they were switching, maybe attack their bigs a little bit, hit a
little floater or create for other people.  
  
But, I mean, they're pretty good.  
  
Q. What was the conversation like, if there is one, in the locker room
immediately following this game?  
SUE GUEVARA: I went in and I told them that I was so proud of them. I thought,
you know, we just kept fighting. We just kept fighting. We just couldn't get
over that hump.  
  
I think when you lose a basketball game, and you did everything that you could
possibly do, sometimes you just lose to a better team. You know, they were
bigger. They were bigger, they shot it better than we did tonight. I was kind
of surprised on the boards that it was only 44-46, we had 22 offensive
rebounds. The 16 offensive rebounds they got were at inopportune times for us.  
  
We got them to miss the shots, it's four for a quarter, you miss three, get
the offensive rebound, hit a three, it's a dagger, takes the wind out of you.  
  
The senior class has just done an outstanding job. Our players that don't play
really embrace the role. I can't ask any more of them than what I got for 35
games, let alone every day in practice.  
  
Q. Most winning class in program history, MAC champions, first
tournament win. Touch on the senior class, what it's been like to coach them
for four years.  
SUE GUEVARA: I said this in the locker room. This senior class, I mean, we
should put them up here on a poster. For all the freshmen that are out there,
the sophomores and juniors, look at what they have done over the course of
their career. I'm talking in the classroom, too, and in the community, how
they have really embraced Central Michigan University and the Mt. Pleasant
community. They're great role models.  
  
I think for, you know, the teams that are going to be coming in after, these
guys, these seniors, really set the bar high. That's what you're supposed to
do. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. You know what? I can hardly
wait to get the next couple teams to get that bar even higher.  
  
Q. What stands out to you? The finest women's basketball season ever had
at CMU.  
SUE GUEVARA: What's your question?  
  
Q. This is the best season women's basketball has ever had at CMU, Sweet
16, championships, great grades. What stands out to you?  
SUE GUEVARA: I told them this. They are the most coachable team I've ever been
a part of in 38 years because they listen. It doesn't matter sometimes if I'm
just rah-rah, they listen, they have thick skin. They understand the person on
the right, they have to trust the person on the right, the person on their
left, and trust us.  
  
I think they're so coachable. And their work ethic. I've said that all along.
This isn't the first time you hear me talk about how this team works when
nobody's watching. They're working before we get in the gym. I have to drag
them off the gym floor.  
  
They've really been a lot of fun to coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
SUE GUEVARA: Thank you.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
Oregon - 83, Central Michigan - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon. We'll begin with an opening statement
from Coach Graves, then take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: First of all, I want to congratulate Coach Guevara on a
tremendous season. The run they made is pretty special. Those kids will
remember that forever. I'll tell you, they were tough as nails tonight, that's
for sure.  
  
She's a great coach. What I really appreciate is you can tell those players
love her and they play really hard for her. I wish Central Michigan all the
best.  
  
I thought tonight was a solid effort for the most part for our team. I loved
our energy early in the game. I thought defensively we were on point for the
first half. Second half we got a little lax. They started hitting some threes.
I thought the three ball might be the key to the game, and neither team shot
it very well. For two teams that rely on the three a lot, none of us shot it
well.  
  
All in all, it was a really good, good game, and I'm really proud of these
guys, excited we're playing another day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ruthy, when you started the game and missed a series of threes, I
could hear Kelly yelling, Get the ball to Ruthy. How important was it for you
to take care of your business in the paint?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I think it's always important for the post to get in good
position, do what we do inside. We have great shooters. Maybe tonight wasn't
their best night. It's our job to pick it up and make baskets.  
  
Q. Sabrina, a little unsettled at the beginning of the first quarter.
How long generally does it take you to get things settled down? At what point
in the game did you feel settled down?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think we had a little jitters starting the game, which is
normal. We were playing for a spot in the Elite 8. I think we started off with
just little jitters. We got it out of the way a few minutes into the game. I
think we played well throughout the game. We had a little slipup for about
five minutes there, but then I think we came back and really put our foot on
the gas.  
  
Q. Oti, what was it like with family in the stands yelling as loud as
possible with every bucket and board you got?  
OTI GILDON: It was really fun. It's always nice to hear familiar voices in the
crowd yelling and cheering you on. I knew I needed to step up for the team.
That was our stretch where we had a bad time. I just wanted to make sure I
contributed to the team. Luckily I did.  
  
Q. Oti, I remember you sparked the team off the bench against Maryland
last year, too. What is it about this round that gets you going?  
OTI GILDON: I have no idea. To be honest, I just really want to help the team
succeed and advance to the Elite 8. We were able to do that. Whether it's
rebounding or defense, I'm happy to do that for the team.  
  
Q. Hudson got going in the third quarter. Sabrina, what kind of
adjustments did you make guarding her?  
SABRINA IONESCU: We knew she was going to come out and try to give her team
the best shot of winning. She does that night in and night out for her team.
She hit some pretty big shots there. But she didn't hit enough to beat us. We
just had to make sure we stood out on her and made her take tough shots and
try to keep her out of the paint because she's a great facilitator, as well.  
  
Q. Ruthy, I wanted to ask about the matchup with Tinara. That was
sometimes a wrestling match, sometimes a skill, a challenge. You must have
enjoyed having a chance to play against her.  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's definitely a great post player, really physical. Fun
to go against an elite post, best in her league. Yeah, it was really fun.  
  
Q. Sabrina, were you aware of how close you were to a triple-double?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No. No, I wasn't. Now I am (smiling).  
  
No, I had no idea. I don't think I played my best game. Regardless if I had
gotten one, I wouldn't have been any happier than I am now.  
  
Q. All the players, can you contrast your emotions right now with how
you felt this time a year ago advancing to the Elite 8? What is this
experience like on an emotional level?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I just think last year we had no idea what to expect. I know
a lot of new players this year have no idea what to expect. I think we're
leading them well, we're making it known that every game could be our last
game, so we have to come out and play with an edge, play as hard as we can,
just enjoy the moment.  
  
We're happy to be where we are. We're happy to be able to play another game on
Monday. We're looking forward to going out there and competing against a great
team.  
  
OTI GILDON: Yeah, to kind of go off what she said, we're really happy to be
here. Last year we were the lowest seed and we proved ourselves as we went on.
This year as a 2 seed we need to stay focused and we did that tonight without
giving them the edge, coming out hot. It was good.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Happy to be here, excited to get to the Elite 8. Hope we make
another step forward this year.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SABRINA IONESCU: Define 'elation'. Oregon education (laughter).  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SABRINA IONESCU: I have no idea what that is.  
  
Q. Exuberance, jubilation. Contrast your reaction that way. This seems a
little more businesslike.  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think it is. I think we have high expectations for
ourselves. Last year we came in not really knowing any different. So when we
win those big games, we had a lot of people doubting us. But we never really
doubted ourselves. I think it kind of came as a surprise, yes, we could this,
we belong here.  
  
This year I think it's known that we belong where we're at, we deserve to be
where we're at, we worked very hard to get here the last two years. I think
it's more where we should be instead of jumping up for joy.  
  
But it's about the same thing for me. I'm excited to be here with this team,
with this coaching staff. I don't take anything for granted.  
  
Q. Oti, speaking of elation, there will now be a dinner at your house
tomorrow?  
OTI GILDON: No.  
  
Q. Why not?  
OTI GILDON: No, I mean, we're still trying to focus on what we have to do. We
have dinner on our own tonight. We want to get some dinner, get in early, so
we can get ready for the game on Monday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to the student-athletes. We'll move on to questions
for the coach.  
  
Q. Sue said they had good looks, they just weren't falling tonight. Were
you pleased with the defensive effort guarding the three?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, overall. I mean, a couple of those that Presley hit were
crazy. She's going to get some. But they were 7-27. We'll take that percentage
against them any time.  
  
I thought we did a pretty good job actually on their shooters for the most
part. I don't know what she would define as 'open,' but we all miss some. It
was kind of funny, two really good three-point shooting teams really struggled
tonight.  
  
Q. How would you describe the team's attitude the past two days, coming
in as the higher seed, the role reversal from last year? How did they handle
this first round?  
KELLY GRAVES: We won by double-digits and we're moving on. I think they
handled it well. Ultimately that's the test.  
  
Yeah, I think this team, you know, they're businesslike when they need to be,
but they really are a loose bunch. I haven't seen any difference between this
year and last year. This year in January, February, December, they are who
they are. It's working. It's working.  
  
Q. They're a loose bunch. How about you this year?  
KELLY GRAVES: I'm never loose, no (smiling). I'm a pain in the butt.  
  
Q. This year has your style changed? Have you approached the game with
them differently? Is it pretty much the same as last year with them?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think maybe I've been a little more task oriented this year.
As a person, I don't think I've changed. On the court I have a whole different
persona than I do off the court. I think when they understand that, then
everything goes well.  
  
No, I think externally I sometimes feel some added pressure, but that's my
job. As long as they don't feel it. I try to shield them from that kind of
stuff. They can heap all that on me as much as they want. You know, just when
we were 33-4, you have higher expectations. Last year we didn't know what the
heck we were doing. We were playing well, but we didn't know. That kind of
ignorance I thought really helped us.  
  
Well, now we've earned the right to get here, so maybe there's some different
expectations that might be affecting me somehow. I don't know. Nothing meds
can't handle (smiling).  
  
Q. You mentioned you weren't happy with the energy in the second half.
Why do you think the team came out a little flat in the second half?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't know. I don't know. It was something that happened from
time to time earlier in the season. I thought the last month of the season we
really came out with that put-them-away instinct. We maybe resorted back to it
tonight, kind of let them off the hook a little bit when we had a chance to
really kind of separate from them for good.  
  
But, you know, we were never really in jeopardy of losing the lead or anything
like that. Yeah, we just lost a little focus defensively. That happens.  
  
Then the boards, we got to do a better job. We can't allow 22 offensive
rebounds on Monday night or we're going to get, you know, blown out. That's
the bottom line.  
  
Q. When you put the game plan together, did you feel like Ruthy could
dominate in the paint? When Oti also gets it going, how big was that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, we did, I don't know what we ended up scoring,
40-something points in the paint. As good as Tinara is, she's not used to
seeing players like Ruthy. Ruthy makes layups because she gets her deep post-
up position. Her team found her tonight. I thought she was just really dialed
in offensively. I thought Ruthy had a great game actually at both ends of the
floor. That's really good to see.  
  
Sabrina didn't have her best night. Maite wasn't at her best that we've seen.
And even Bando. Don't get me wrong. Tonight was Ruthy's night. Next night it
might be somebody else or Sabrina.  
  
Oti, I think you nailed it. There's something about this round. She even hit
that little 15-foot jumper that was pretty neat. She just gives us great
energy. She's so different than other posts we bring in. She has bounce, a
little smaller, can attack the basket. She has the best second jump on our
team. If she misses a shot, she's quick to get back up. Happy for her to do it
in front of her friends and family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Thank you. We'll see you on Monday.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
Notre Dame - 90, Texas A&M - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined by Texas A&M. We will begin with an
opening statement from Coach Blair, then open the floor to questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
GARY BLAIR: First you had a well-run tournament. Spokane should be very proud
of what they put on. I know you've had tournaments in the men and in the
women, as well. This was as well-run of a tournament as we've been to.  
  
I was just telling my team in 13 years, we've been to 13. Of course, in one of
them we went all the way and won it. In those other 12 losses, I could sit
back and I could second-guess myself on what we didn't do well, play the poor
man's game, what if, bad call, other team just played great.  
  
I wouldn't change a thing. We played exceptionally well. Even though we were
up 12 or 13 or whatever it was, we knew Notre Dame would come back. They were
hitting shots. They were doing what they needed to. That's why they're the No.
1 team and played the hardest schedule in the country.  
  
But I'm not going to change a thing. We played extremely well. The game was
probably lost in the third quarter when we came out I thought flat. We were
trying for the perfect play, whatever. They showed the aggression we didn't
show, that we were showing in the first and second quarter.  
  
We made so many good things happen. I know Muffet, when she comes in here,
she's going to say, My gosh, she's got one, two, three more games to play if
she expects to win it, but she saw somebody today in Texas A&M that's going to
show her how to win it.  
  
What we've got to do, remember, we shot 23% in the third quarter, fourth
quarter we went back to doing our thing. Chennedy and Khaalia and Anriel, they
were having their way. I think it really hurt us in the second quarter when I
had to protect Anriel because she had two fouls. One of the fouls never should
have happened because we made a mistake with somebody else. It put her in a
vulnerable position.  
  
What we've got to do as a basketball team is grow from this, get better. I
really believe we're even going to be better than ever next year.  
  
But these three up here, if there's 10 to 20 better players in the country
than these three up here, I'd like to see them. I'm proud of them, what
they've done. Howard's game in the last two to three weeks has elevated us.
She's doing it all. Who cares if you're only 5'11". If you're a basketball
player, has the heart.  
  
Hillsman went against their All-American Shepard, it was an even ballgame, 13
points apiece. That one down on the end might be the next face of this
basketball team. But Howard was our most valuable player in this tournament
for what she did with the energy. Hillsman was our most important player
because she had to stop their All-American, and she did it as well as she
could. Their kid, Shepard, did it as well as she could on there.  
  
Chennedy is special. More and more kids are going to want to play with this
young lady to come in because we've got a Final Four run in us just like Notre
Dame has made it for the last time.  
  
We've got the consistency of going to tournaments, Sweet 16s, Elite 8s. Notre
Dame has the consistency of playing for national championships every year. So
give them credit for what they're doing.  
  
Go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes only at this
point.  
  
Q. Chennedy, talk about the third quarter. He thought you came out a
little bit slow. What were the problems?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: They just came out pretty quick. They got the momentum in the
third quarter. We kind of laid down just a little bit, energy went down,
effort went down. We just got to come out from halftime ready to play. That's
a big thing with us, we kind of laid down a little bit, hit a couple shots,
they got the crowd going. The game was their way. We just got to work on that,
get better.  
  
Q. Anriel, when you got off to that good start, you were a big part of
it. What did you feel was working for you and your team at that point?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I think my teammates and I, like, we were sharing the ball, we
were finding the open player, we were knocking down some pretty good shots.
They were looking for me, when I was open, and I knocked down some.  
  
Q. Chennedy, how proud are you of this team, being it was your first
season as a freshman, you made it this far into the tournament?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: I'm very proud, the way that we played this whole tournament,
this whole year, really just showed how strong we really are. We stayed
together. We faced a lot of adversity. We're in the Southeastern Conference.
It's one of the hardest conferences to me, if not the hardest conference. I'm
just proud of the way we came out and played.  
  
They're a great team. I'm just blessed. We're going to be without Khaalia next
year, but we're going to try to have a better season and make her proud.  
  
Q. Khaalia, obviously this is your last game. What has your time at
Texas A &M meant to you?  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: I'm going to cry now. It's been special, you know. I've been
so blessed to be able to play and meet and form so many relationships with
these people. I played with Chennedy for one year, and she's already one of my
favorite players I ever played with. Anriel, near and dear to my heart.
Wouldn't trade her for the world. Jas has been around her for about 12 years,
it's just been incredible being able to play with somebody you had a
relationship with since high school, even before that.  
  
Just like all the relationships that I formed from my older teammates that are
on to bigger and better things now, the coaches, they've meant a lot to me,
they've helped me out in rough times. They really, like, Coach Starkey and
Coach Bond, they really have done some incredible things for me, Coach Blair
giving me the opportunity, staying on me, believing in me, and Coach Wright,
she's the silent assassin, she does a lot, but it's behind the scenes, so no
one will ever know.  
  
It's just been incredible. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm getting a
first-class education. I formed relationships I'm going to have for the rest
of my life. It's just been really special. I'm just really glad I had this
opportunity.  
  
Q. Chennedy, talk about the problems matching up three-point shooting
with them. Why were they a tough matchup there?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: I mean, they're a great three-point shooting team. We faced a
lot of good three-point shooting teams. We just made some unsmart decisions on
defense which led them to get players open, wide open on the three.  
  
They had a player that went 7 for 11 for three. That's probably what hurt us
the most. She's one of the best players on the team. We just got to lock down.
We let her get open, get in a rhythm. We can't do that.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Not going to interject on that. They scored 21 points on inbound
plays. That's the most in history A&M has ever given up in their life. That
was the three. We were defending the three and halfcourt offense the best we
could against a great team. But 21 points on inbound plays, that was the
difference in the ballgame.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. We will now
move to questions for coach.  
  
Q. The same question I asked Chennedy: How proud are you of this team
and the season you guys were able to put together?  
GARY BLAIR: Like I said earlier, I wouldn't change a thing because our talent
base keeps growing. We might not get some of the -- all the McDonald's All-
Americans that some of these other teams get, but I think we develop kids.
That's our strength. We have kids that play hard. We have kids that play smart
the majority of the time. I've got a great coaching staff. If it isn't broken,
we're going to keep rolling with it.  
  
But these three up here, incredible talent for as many minutes as they're
having to play. When you look at the stat line, we won the four points in the
paint, 16-7 off turnovers, 16-15 second chance, 12-2 on fastbreak, 6-0 on
bench.  
  
We needed to run more. But I give you a hint: we were taking the ball out of
the net too many times in the second half. Then when we did run, we converted.
But that's a lot of mileage on those young people's legs. Sometimes you just
don't have it, particularly on the offensive rebounds. We missed a few put-
backs that we should have had. That's what saved them in the second half, was
their put-backs by their guards, particularly 24.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the fourth quarter when they were building their
lead, they did a lot of isolation stuff, one-on-one stuff from the high post.
That hurt you a little bit, it seemed like. Your thoughts?  
GARY BLAIR: We tried to mix it up, playing our matchup, our bump, 2-3 zone
with some man. We finally had to switch to man on inbound plays. I was going
bananas over there because we were making mistakes. Mabrey was walking right
back in.  
  
They run some very, very good man-to-man stuff off the 1-4 high series. Nobody
we have faced this year has a duck-in move as well as Shepard. I mean, she
gets down low. Hillsman did as good as she could. But I think it's good. I
think that girl is going to make a lot of money when she finally graduates
because I think she's a great player.  
  
I think Notre Dame could get hurt by some faster teams that have a longer
bench than us, that could rotate more guards in. We just didn't have that,
okay? But you got teams like Louisville. That's the only thing I could see
that could hurt Notre Dame.  
  
But they're a very good ballclub. With their 1-4 set, I'd like to run it a
little bit more myself. We saw 95% man in the game -- I mean, 95% zone, and
triangle-and-two. So a little bit of that.  
  
Q. Can you describe the impact of some of the seniors like Hillsman,
what it's been like to coach her for four seasons at A &M.  
GARY BLAIR: Well, she's grown so much. She came from a great high school. You
know the story. That's where Michelle Obama is from. Michael Jordan sent his
kids there. Okafor played there. Great high school. She had the balance coming
in. She was our most gifted ACT score, business school. It's a lot better than
you and I when we graduated.  
  
All of a sudden she's grown. She's going to be a pro. She's going to be a pro
because she's got a heart. She's not going to have to go play 37 minutes a
ballgame for a pro team. I think that will make her a better player.  
  
She cares about her teammates so much. I think that's what separates her out.
She doesn't have that 'I' on her forehead. She cares about those teammates.
She embraces A&M, what A&M has to offer, to just the regular student-athletes.  
  
Look, y'all have got enough from me. The story should be on Notre Dame. They
need to get out and scout this next game. So is that enough questions?  
  
Q. How much more would one more score outside help you against that
zone? You mentioned matchup. You only had three scorers a lot of time.  
GARY BLAIR: I got one coming next year in Wilson. I ain't worried at all. She
can fill it up from outside. Wilson is going to be a big help for us. Johnson
is going inside. So I think we'll be in great shape.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Appreciate y'all.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get going here today with Notre Dame. We're joined by
head coach Muffet McGraw.  
  
At this time I'll open up the floor for questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Chennedy Carter, what you see looking at film, how
she's changed from early in the year maybe till now?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's a phenomenal player. I remember watching her on the USA
team. She has really transformed her body. I think she looks terrific. She
single-handedly won the DePaul game, great play at the end of the game.  
  
She's really hard to guard because she can put it on the floor, get it to the
rim, pass, she can score from just about anywhere on the floor. She's really,
really dangerous. I think she's going to be a huge challenge for us.  
  
Q. How is Kathryn's ankle? How has she recovered from playing as much as
she did in the second-round game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's been in a boot all week. She's not expected to do much
today. She'll be another game-time decision.  
  
Q. How have you been able to persevere through all the injuries and
things this year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, it's been a challenge. I think basketball is a great
way to teach your team about life lessons. These are some life lessons that
they're going to need, that are going to help them for the rest of their
lives.  
  
You're going to hit adversity, there's going to be bumps in the road along
your life, no matter what you do. How you handle it determines a lot about
your character, how you can move on.  
  
I think they've handled it really well. There's been some difficult situations
come up. They've persevered. They haven't let it get them down. I think
they've been knocked down a couple of times. They keep getting back up.
They've really stayed together as a unit.  
  
Q. Have you had to change the way you practice to keep girls fresh? Do
you do anything different to avoid foul trouble?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Practice has been different. That's the hardest thing, when we
lost Lili first game of the ACC that put us at seven players. We had the
entire conference season to go through.  
  
We looked at some things that we could do differently. We definitely practiced
shorter, tried to be intense, try to go for an hour and 10 minutes. Any time
somebody was in a collision, we'd panic a little bit. After practice, when
somebody would say, how was practice, we would say nobody got hurt, it was a
great day.  
  
We changed a lot of things. Sometimes it hurt us a little bit. It was
stressful to try to manage their legs, make sure that we were getting enough
reps, but not too many so we got tired. That was a challenge, I think probably
the biggest challenge.  
  
We've really talked about how we had to be smart and not foul. It's hard for
competitive women to let somebody score on them. That's what we had to work
on, was their times when you just got to get up the shot, the layups, whatever
it was, especially early in the game, and just be okay with that. That was a
challenge for some of them. Not so much for others, but for some of them, they
really hated to get scored on.  
  
Just being a little bit smarter, just getting out of the way, and wait until
the second half to be a little more aggressive, so we would do different
things in the second half depending on the foul trouble.  
  
Q. When you saw A &M in the Sweet 16, did you at any point think back to
the 2011 matchup?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it's hard not to. That was a tough one for us. Nobody is
the same. None of our players thought of it at all. Some of our coaches of
course thought about it. But just another opportunity for us to face a really
good team.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the fact that in your coaching career you've
been there and done that when it comes to playing with injured players. Talk
about what that experience has lended as far as how to handle this
situation.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it was great for us to be able to look back at the '97
team and see what we did at the end of the season. But the difference in that
team was people would get hurt and then come back. We had a broken thumb; she
came back a month later. We had somebody go down in the Big East Tournament,
which was very close to the end of the season. We didn't really get down to
seven till the very end of the season. This was a little more difficult in
having to manage it throughout the year.  
  
We only talked about the positives, we didn't talk about the timing of it. We
talked about, we've done it before, we've been there with seven, we can do it
again.  
  
Q. You touched on Carter. They're not very deep as you are. What do you
see as maybe a couple keys for the game tomorrow?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think Carter is clearly their best player. But I love
Howard. I love the energy she brings. I think she's the heart and soul of
their team. Fantastic rebounder, one of the best rebounders I've ever seen. I
just love the energy she brings to the game.  
  
She's relentless on the boards. She is just somebody that will not be denied.
She can will them to victory. She's going to make big play after big play. I
really think she is probably the key to the game.  
  
Q. You once recruited out this way back in the late '90s. What do you
remember about recruiting Kari Hutchinson, somebody from such a small school,
gauge where she was from a competitive standpoint?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she was a great player. We didn't come west that often
back then. It seemed like a long way from home when you didn't have the
ability to be in touch with your parents as much. She was a great Notre Dame
kid. I thought she fit in well with what we did. Great family. Loved coming
out to Spokane to visit with her. It's a beautiful area. Glad to see the sun
shining today so we can really enjoy it.  
  
Q. I know South Carolina wasn't thrilled to be the 2 seed in UConn's
region. When the bracket came out, were you pleased to come out west as the
No. 1?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I will say I'm never pleased because you look at it
and say, Wow, it's going to be a tough region. We thought we would go west. We
also thought we could be a No. 2 seed somewhere else.  
  
I think we have not been west in a while. It's kind of our turn to go out
west. We were probably the fourth overall No. 1 seed, we were going to go the
furthest away. It's a tough region. Everywhere is a tough region by the time
you get to Sweet 16. Everybody is good. It's a little bit more travel, but it
is what it is.  
  
Q. Do you stay in touch with Kari?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, not as much. She hasn't been back to campus. Really
it's been a while since she's been back to campus. We haven't been out here
for quite a while. But big events. Haven't really seen her back on campus
much. Hoping to see her family.  
  
Q. Could I get your thoughts on an upset, like Buffalo, Central
Michigan, what does that do for the women's game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's great for the game. I think it is so exciting. I
think the MAC was a little underrated this year. I think both teams were 11
seeds, their conference was ranked sixth in the RPI just behind the power
five. I thought they probably had something to prove. I know both coaches
pretty well. Very happy for both of them.  
  
It's fun to see that in the women's game, just getting a little bit more like
the men's game. We're approaching parity, maybe not so much at the very top,
but certainly throughout the rest of the tournament. I think it's exciting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
We are joined by Notre Dame student-athletes. At this time we'll open it up
for questions to the floor.  
  
Q. Arike, could you talk about your matchup with Chennedy Carter.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I wouldn't say it's a matchup with me and Chennedy. It's
Texas A&M versus Notre Dame. We have to play team basketball and they have to
play team basketball. And just the best team wins.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: She's a great player. She can take over the game whenever
she wants. We have to be focused on her as a team. We all have to know where
she is at all times.  
  
Q. For both of you, how difficult is the idea that because you have so
few players right now because of injuries that sometimes you have to give up
layups, avoiding foul situations? How much of a challenge has that been this
year to I guess play in that sort of style?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think for us it's not really necessarily looking at it like
we can't give up a foul here and there. It's playing the principles that the
coaches have taught us every day at practice. Just being smarter about it. I
think everybody on this team has done a great job of it.  
  
I think for us it's not looking at we don't have a sub; it's looking at what
we can do while we're on the court.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I agree with her. I mean, we have to of course play smart.
Then again, we don't have to play soft. We have to keep being aggressive. If
we do pick up fouls because we're being aggressive and smart, then that's
going to happen.  
  
I think we have enough smart players on the team to know we can't get too many
fouls.  
  
Q. Jessica, on film when you look at A &M's inside play, what sticks out
to you?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I mean, I think Texas A&M is a great team. They have
good outside players, good inside players. But they have a big, physical post
player.  
  
For us, it's just going to be kind of like Arike said, focusing on what we can
do, just going into the game focused on what we can do, how we can stop them
defensively.  
  
Q. You have traveled all the way out here to Spokane. It's your first
two games on the road. How has that changed your preparation for this week?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I don't think it's changed anything. I mean, we've had many
road games. We just came from the ACC tournament. Even though we had two games
for the first and second rounds, we're used to on-the-road games. So is
nothing different.  
  
Q. Jessica, you played the toughest schedule in the country. How do you
feel that prepared you for the NCAA tournament?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I mean, I think for us, it's prepared us definitely. But I
think going into every game now you know you're going to get every team's best
shot. If you lose, you're out.  
  
I think for us, it's just focusing on what we can do. Post-season is a
completely different season than what we did in the regular season.  
  
Q. You play for a Hall of Fame head coach. What is that experience like
for both of you?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think for us, all of us, every day at practice, just to go
in knowing that we have the best coach in the country, a Hall of Famer, is
something special that we don't take for granted. I think just to learn from
somebody that knows so much about basketball, just also what she does off the
court for us. It's a blessing.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah, I think it's important to focus on, like Jess said,
the off-the-court stuff. A lot of coaches can give you on-the-court insights
to everything. But being able to learn life lessons from your basketball coach
for off-the-court stuff, and graduate, becoming women and all that. I think
it's just helpful. It's just amazing to be able to have her there with us
every day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get going here today with Notre Dame. We're joined by
head coach Muffet McGraw.  
  
At this time I'll open up the floor for questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Chennedy Carter, what you see looking at film, how
she's changed from early in the year maybe till now?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's a phenomenal player. I remember watching her on the USA
team. She has really transformed her body. I think she looks terrific. She
single-handedly won the DePaul game, great play at the end of the game.  
  
She's really hard to guard because she can put it on the floor, get it to the
rim, pass, she can score from just about anywhere on the floor. She's really,
really dangerous. I think she's going to be a huge challenge for us.  
  
Q. How is Kathryn's ankle? How has she recovered from playing as much as
she did in the second-round game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's been in a boot all week. She's not expected to do much
today. She'll be another game-time decision.  
  
Q. How have you been able to persevere through all the injuries and
things this year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, it's been a challenge. I think basketball is a great
way to teach your team about life lessons. These are some life lessons that
they're going to need, that are going to help them for the rest of their
lives.  
  
You're going to hit adversity, there's going to be bumps in the road along
your life, no matter what you do. How you handle it determines a lot about
your character, how you can move on.  
  
I think they've handled it really well. There's been some difficult situations
come up. They've persevered. They haven't let it get them down. I think
they've been knocked down a couple of times. They keep getting back up.
They've really stayed together as a unit.  
  
Q. Have you had to change the way you practice to keep girls fresh? Do
you do anything different to avoid foul trouble?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Practice has been different. That's the hardest thing, when we
lost Lili first game of the ACC that put us at seven players. We had the
entire conference season to go through.  
  
We looked at some things that we could do differently. We definitely practiced
shorter, tried to be intense, try to go for an hour and 10 minutes. Any time
somebody was in a collision, we'd panic a little bit. After practice, when
somebody would say, how was practice, we would say nobody got hurt, it was a
great day.  
  
We changed a lot of things. Sometimes it hurt us a little bit. It was
stressful to try to manage their legs, make sure that we were getting enough
reps, but not too many so we got tired. That was a challenge, I think probably
the biggest challenge.  
  
We've really talked about how we had to be smart and not foul. It's hard for
competitive women to let somebody score on them. That's what we had to work
on, was their times when you just got to get up the shot, the layups, whatever
it was, especially early in the game, and just be okay with that. That was a
challenge for some of them. Not so much for others, but for some of them, they
really hated to get scored on.  
  
Just being a little bit smarter, just getting out of the way, and wait until
the second half to be a little more aggressive, so we would do different
things in the second half depending on the foul trouble.  
  
Q. When you saw A &M in the Sweet 16, did you at any point think back to
the 2011 matchup?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it's hard not to. That was a tough one for us. Nobody is
the same. None of our players thought of it at all. Some of our coaches of
course thought about it. But just another opportunity for us to face a really
good team.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the fact that in your coaching career you've
been there and done that when it comes to playing with injured players. Talk
about what that experience has lended as far as how to handle this
situation.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it was great for us to be able to look back at the '97
team and see what we did at the end of the season. But the difference in that
team was people would get hurt and then come back. We had a broken thumb; she
came back a month later. We had somebody go down in the Big East Tournament,
which was very close to the end of the season. We didn't really get down to
seven till the very end of the season. This was a little more difficult in
having to manage it throughout the year.  
  
We only talked about the positives, we didn't talk about the timing of it. We
talked about, we've done it before, we've been there with seven, we can do it
again.  
  
Q. You touched on Carter. They're not very deep as you are. What do you
see as maybe a couple keys for the game tomorrow?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think Carter is clearly their best player. But I love
Howard. I love the energy she brings. I think she's the heart and soul of
their team. Fantastic rebounder, one of the best rebounders I've ever seen. I
just love the energy she brings to the game.  
  
She's relentless on the boards. She is just somebody that will not be denied.
She can will them to victory. She's going to make big play after big play. I
really think she is probably the key to the game.  
  
Q. You once recruited out this way back in the late '90s. What do you
remember about recruiting Kari Hutchinson, somebody from such a small school,
gauge where she was from a competitive standpoint?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she was a great player. We didn't come west that often
back then. It seemed like a long way from home when you didn't have the
ability to be in touch with your parents as much. She was a great Notre Dame
kid. I thought she fit in well with what we did. Great family. Loved coming
out to Spokane to visit with her. It's a beautiful area. Glad to see the sun
shining today so we can really enjoy it.  
  
Q. I know South Carolina wasn't thrilled to be the 2 seed in UConn's
region. When the bracket came out, were you pleased to come out west as the
No. 1?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I will say I'm never pleased because you look at it
and say, Wow, it's going to be a tough region. We thought we would go west. We
also thought we could be a No. 2 seed somewhere else.  
  
I think we have not been west in a while. It's kind of our turn to go out
west. We were probably the fourth overall No. 1 seed, we were going to go the
furthest away. It's a tough region. Everywhere is a tough region by the time
you get to Sweet 16. Everybody is good. It's a little bit more travel, but it
is what it is.  
  
Q. Do you stay in touch with Kari?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, not as much. She hasn't been back to campus. Really
it's been a while since she's been back to campus. We haven't been out here
for quite a while. But big events. Haven't really seen her back on campus
much. Hoping to see her family.  
  
Q. Could I get your thoughts on an upset, like Buffalo, Central
Michigan, what does that do for the women's game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's great for the game. I think it is so exciting. I
think the MAC was a little underrated this year. I think both teams were 11
seeds, their conference was ranked sixth in the RPI just behind the power
five. I thought they probably had something to prove. I know both coaches
pretty well. Very happy for both of them.  
  
It's fun to see that in the women's game, just getting a little bit more like
the men's game. We're approaching parity, maybe not so much at the very top,
but certainly throughout the rest of the tournament. I think it's exciting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
We are joined by Notre Dame student-athletes. At this time we'll open it up
for questions to the floor.  
  
Q. Arike, could you talk about your matchup with Chennedy Carter.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I wouldn't say it's a matchup with me and Chennedy. It's
Texas A&M versus Notre Dame. We have to play team basketball and they have to
play team basketball. And just the best team wins.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: She's a great player. She can take over the game whenever
she wants. We have to be focused on her as a team. We all have to know where
she is at all times.  
  
Q. For both of you, how difficult is the idea that because you have so
few players right now because of injuries that sometimes you have to give up
layups, avoiding foul situations? How much of a challenge has that been this
year to I guess play in that sort of style?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think for us it's not really necessarily looking at it like
we can't give up a foul here and there. It's playing the principles that the
coaches have taught us every day at practice. Just being smarter about it. I
think everybody on this team has done a great job of it.  
  
I think for us it's not looking at we don't have a sub; it's looking at what
we can do while we're on the court.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I agree with her. I mean, we have to of course play smart.
Then again, we don't have to play soft. We have to keep being aggressive. If
we do pick up fouls because we're being aggressive and smart, then that's
going to happen.  
  
I think we have enough smart players on the team to know we can't get too many
fouls.  
  
Q. Jessica, on film when you look at A &M's inside play, what sticks out
to you?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I mean, I think Texas A&M is a great team. They have
good outside players, good inside players. But they have a big, physical post
player.  
  
For us, it's just going to be kind of like Arike said, focusing on what we can
do, just going into the game focused on what we can do, how we can stop them
defensively.  
  
Q. You have traveled all the way out here to Spokane. It's your first
two games on the road. How has that changed your preparation for this week?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I don't think it's changed anything. I mean, we've had many
road games. We just came from the ACC tournament. Even though we had two games
for the first and second rounds, we're used to on-the-road games. So is
nothing different.  
  
Q. Jessica, you played the toughest schedule in the country. How do you
feel that prepared you for the NCAA tournament?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I mean, I think for us, it's prepared us definitely. But I
think going into every game now you know you're going to get every team's best
shot. If you lose, you're out.  
  
I think for us, it's just focusing on what we can do. Post-season is a
completely different season than what we did in the regular season.  
  
Q. You play for a Hall of Fame head coach. What is that experience like
for both of you?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think for us, all of us, every day at practice, just to go
in knowing that we have the best coach in the country, a Hall of Famer, is
something special that we don't take for granted. I think just to learn from
somebody that knows so much about basketball, just also what she does off the
court for us. It's a blessing.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah, I think it's important to focus on, like Jess said,
the off-the-court stuff. A lot of coaches can give you on-the-court insights
to everything. But being able to learn life lessons from your basketball coach
for off-the-court stuff, and graduate, becoming women and all that. I think
it's just helpful. It's just amazing to be able to have her there with us
every day.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Central Michigan head coach. We'll open it up
to the floor for questions for coach.  
  
Q. You've had a little more time to look at film since we spoke. What
have you noticed about Oregon to start off with?  
SUE GUEVARA: They're big. They can all shoot it. Very good passing team. Love
to get out in transition. It's a track meet. They want to get out and they
want to go.  
  
I think they have four kids with Presley Hudson range, which means as soon as
they come across halfcourt, that thing is going up.  
  
Q. How do you think your team matches up with them?  
SUE GUEVARA: I think we match up pretty well with them. I think that our style
of play is very, very similar. We're just a little smaller. But we have five
kids that can all shoot the three. We like to run, too. We like to rebound the
ball and get out in transition.  
  
If anything, I think it's going to be a fun game for the fans to watch and
maybe a nightmare for me.  
  
Q. How would you describe the energy for the past couple days from
Monday night till now from your team?  
SUE GUEVARA: I think we were all pretty high, pretty excited. We get 24 hours
to enjoy it, then it's over. Now I will tell you, it's very businesslike. We
understand why we are here. We know we're preparing for another game.  
  
It's been very, very workmanlike. I like that a lot.  
  
Q. You just mentioned one through five can shoot the three. After Tinara
hit those back-to-back three-pointers in the Ohio State game, have you been
telling her to shoot it more?  
SUE GUEVARA: I always tell her to shoot the three. What you guys see that day,
we see every day in practice. We'll run shooting drills, our post players will
run the trail post, they shoot the three. When we do our shooting drill called
'Texas shooting', where everybody shoots the three, so...  
  
What you saw is what we see all the time. It's just that, you know,
unfortunately now all the other coaches see it.  
  
Q. Muffet McGraw said earlier she thought the MAC was underrated, you in
Buffalo had something to prove. Did you come in with that kind of chip on your
shoulder or did you even think about it?  
SUE GUEVARA: Quite frankly, I can't speak for Felicia, I might be able to a
little bit, but, no, we didn't come in that we have to prove anything to
anybody. You know, we feel we're a pretty good basketball team, both of us. I
think if you look at our non-conference schedules, both Buffalo and Central,
we scheduled difficult teams to get ready for the MAC Conference.  
  
I think the MAC Conference prepared both of us for where we are right now. I
think I've said this before. This isn't about proving anything to anybody. If
anything, it's about showcasing the Mid-American Conference, showcasing the
style of basketball of Central Michigan University and the University of
Buffalo.  
  
Q. It's been well-documented that Oregon has some ties to Spokane.
Everyone loves a Cinderella. Have you prepared for maybe the mood in the arena
tomorrow, how the crowd is going to be split?  
SUE GUEVARA: Okay, I'm going to talk about two things with that, all right? I
just finished talking to our team about both those things: Cinderella and the
crowd. I told them about Coach Graves having been at Gonzaga. I said, There's
going to be a lot of little ducklings in the stands. Guess what, we just came
from St. John Arena where there were a lot of Buckeyes in the stands.  
  
What we have to do is do what we do well, keep the crowd out of it except for
our contingency of maroon and gold.  
  
As far as Cinderella, everybody knows the story of Cinderella, right? I mean,
Cinderella was not invited to the ball, was she? No. Cinderella wasn't invited
to the ball.  
  
We got invited to the ball. We didn't need a fairy godmother to give us
slippers or high heels or whatever to go to the ball. Adidas gave us tennis
shoes and we're out.  
  
The only Cinderella I think I want our team to look at, and I talked to our
team about this, who in here has seen "Pretty Woman"? Sure, she wanted it all
and she got it all. She earned it all. She wasn't Cinderella. If we're going
to be a Cinderella, I'm going to be like Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman."  
  
Other than that, we got invited, and we're still dancing. We don't have any
magic slippers on, we have really good adidas shoes on.  
  
I'm not fired up about that at all, though (laughter).  
  
Q. Was there any thought to look at the game from a few years ago when
you played Oregon?  
SUE GUEVARA: I think Crystal Bradford had I don't know how many, but she had a
very good game.  
  
No, not at all. I think both teams are quite different. I mean, our seniors at
that point, I think our seniors were freshmen. I'm not even sure they saw the
floor. Didn't go back at all.  
  
Q. How has the support been from the community the past few days?  
SUE GUEVARA: It has been outstanding. It has been outstanding. But it's been
outstanding for us pretty much the whole season. I mean, when you go into the
McGuirk, it's been electric for all the games. When we went and played at the
Q in Cleveland, it was unbelievable. Somebody asked me, is the whole city of
Mt. Pleasant here? I said, no, maybe about half.  
  
I think the support from the players, their hometowns, you see the billboards
at the schools. Then when we were at Ohio State, it was great. Our crowd when
we played LSU was unbelievable. Then when we played Ohio State, again, you had
our bench, and behind our bench and up in the corners and stuff, it was all
maroon and gold. They were going nuts.  
  
I say, if you're a recruit, you want to come in and play in a great
atmosphere, in a good style of basketball, where the community and the
university, you know, really care about you and they embrace you, Central
Michigan's the place to be.  
  
Q. Sabrina usually sets the tone for Oregon, especially in the post-
season so far. What has been your impression of her, kind of the key to
dealing with that?  
SUE GUEVARA: She's tough. There's no doubt about it. I mean, what does she
have, six, seven, eight triple-doubles? She makes them go. There is no doubt
about that.  
  
But, you know, I think we're going to do some things that might be able to
disrupt the flow of Oregon's offense. They do pass it so well, so we just have
to do a couple things to disrupt what they do, not let them get in that
rhythm.  
  
Q. Beyond Sabrina, is there another player that captures your attention,
too?  
SUE GUEVARA: Just talked about Bando. We're going to follow Bando to the
bathroom. That's how she can shoot it. Then you have Ruthy inside. I think
Ruthy is shooting 60, 65 percent from the floor because she's shooting layups.  
  
I'm going to be bad with names, I'm going to be better with numbers. You look
at zero, 6'4", long length, lefty, can shoot the three like that.  
  
Then their point guard, she can shoot it, too. It's not just one, just like it
is for us. You take away one, then here somebody else is going to go off.
Inside, outside, what are you going to take away? Are you going to double on
Ruthy, then who in God's name are you going to leave open?  
  
Again, without putting out the game plan, there's just some different things
we have to do, just like I'm sure what they're going to have to do. Maybe not,
I don't know.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about Ruthy. How do you think Tinara Moore
will match up with her?  
SUE GUEVARA: I think it will be a nice battle. I think you look at Tinara, how
she has answered the bell I would say pretty much for the whole season. But
when you're going up against a Mavunga from Ohio State, a couple other big
ones, then LSU, the size of them. I mean, Tinara went one-on-one. She went
one-on-one. I was so pleased with the way she attacked them, how she used her
quickness to get by them, the different moves.  
  
At one point, I think it was the LSU game maybe, she and Reyna both were
trying to go one-on-one, trying to power their way up. It's like, You guys,
they might have like 15 or 20 pounds on you. You might think about doing a
counter move, a reverse pivot, look at the basket.  
  
Answering the bell? Absolutely. I expect the same thing.  
  
Q. On the floor after your win earlier this week, you spoke in the
interview something to the effect of once your team got through that first
couple minutes against Ohio State, you could power through that. If that kind
of happens tomorrow afternoon, do you feel like the same formula can work
tomorrow?  
SUE GUEVARA: What I was very pleased about in that first quarter, I mean, we
were down 15-5. It's very easy for teams to fold, very easy for teams to fold.
We came out of that first quarter 15-9. I told our players, I said, Hey, look,
they only scored 15 points. Against Ohio State in that first quarter, that's
pretty good.  
  
I said, Yeah, we only scored nine points, but we were getting shots. We were
getting open shots that just did not fall. We talk about this all the time,
you know this, basketball is a game of runs. It's just weathering through that
run and understanding you're going to get a run, too. You just got to keep
shooting the ball because you're open, and they will go in.  
  
But this team has done that. I will tell you during the whole course of the
year, we would be down five, six points with two minutes to go. I know our
fans are going, Oh. They're getting all worried.  
  
I keep telling them, Keep the faith. Keep the faith. This team will never,
ever quit.  
  
Q. One of the things that's been most impressive about your wins in this
tournament in particular, from the outside looking in, is that you've done it
almost entirely with your starters. What is the secret? Some sort of water we
don't know about in Michigan that has gotten those ladies to the point where
they can carry you against Ohio State and LSU?  
SUE GUEVARA: And against Buffalo and Ball State and Toledo. There's a
gentleman back here who is Taylor Larson, our strength and conditioning coach.
He does a great job. We have a nutritionist, Dr. Leslie Hildebrandt. She's
done a great job of making sure our kids are fueled with the right stuff.  
  
I will tell you this. This team has really bought in to Dr. Hildebrandt, what
she has done, the nutritional value of it. They have bought in to Taylor, when
he's pushing them and pushing them in the weight room, getting them running.
Our trainer has done a tremendous job. You have to get lucky and be injury-
free. We've done that.  
  
Then I think, you know, being I would say a 'seasoned' coach, I understand as
the season goes along, you're not going to practice two hours every single
day. I will tell you this, that when we played on Wednesdays and Saturdays,
anybody who played over 30 minutes on Wednesday, Thursday morning we practice,
our practice is from 8 till 11, Thursday morning those players that played
over 30, they did not practice. They watched film. We watch film from the
night before. We get the scouting report ready for Saturday. All they do is go
into our auxiliary gym and shoot free throws. That's all they do.  
  
Our other players, our subs, they play a 40-minute game on Thursday. They're
still getting up and down with the conditioning. Part of it is also, I heard a
quote by Geno, and I've said this before, What's the difference between a good
player and a great player? Great players don't get tired.  
  
That's a mental, mental toughness that those five really have embraced, and
the fact that, you know, Coach Guevara got a little smart. I am not the
brightest crayon. But getting our freshmen, getting them in there maybe just
before timeout, like 30 seconds before the timeout, to give Tinara the break,
to give Twin the break or Cassie a break. Whether it's for two minutes, three
minutes, sometimes it's 14 minutes, which is great. I think all that has
helped.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
SUE GUEVARA: All right. That was easy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow.  
  
SUE GUEVARA: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Central Michigan student-athletes.
Questions, please.  
  
Q. Tinara, what do you know about this team from the first game of
Purdue to now, what have you learned?  
TINARA MOORE: About our team?  
  
Q. Yes.  
TINARA MOORE: That we're going to attack every game and that we're going to
stick together no matter what happens in that game and we're always going to
be there for each other. After every timeout, you can see us making a little
huddle after the timeout, just really making sure we each are on the same page
with the game plan. I think that's helped us throughout the whole season, just
sticking together.  
  
Q. Cassie, you played against Oregon in 2013 when you were a freshman.
Do you remember anything about that game?  
CASSIE BREEN: I remember a little bit. Honestly, freshman year is a while ago,
a lot of games have passed. I just remember them being just a tough team, like
any BCS school is. I don't remember anything other than that.  
  
I know No. 10, we played against her, Bando. I just remember she was a
shooter, just looking to score obviously. A lot of things have probably
changed since then.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit with Sue about the matchup with you and Ruthy.
How do you think you kind of match up together? What will that be like
tomorrow?  
TINARA MOORE: I think it will be interesting. She's a really good basketball
player, good post player. Just going to have to move my feet and defend her
well, just like I've been doing on every other post player. As my offense
goes, just reading how she plays me defensively, whether she plays me behind
or she's in front of me. I'll just read the defense and kind of adjust to
that.  
  
Q. Presley, can you talk about this team's confidence. You haven't lost
since like mid February. What is the feeling like in the locker room?  
PRESLEY HUDSON: We're really confident in each other. We believe in each
other, we know we're capable. And coach, she gives us a lot of confidence as
well. We're just a confident team.  
  
Q. Tinara, your coach was just saying you aren't a Cinderella, there's
no slippers, just adidas. What is your mindset coming into this tournament as
an 11 seed, having to win road games, now facing Oregon?  
TINARA MOORE: I just think it's the next game, there's no bigger game than
tomorrow because it's the next game. I don't really look into seeding. Our
team doesn't look into seeding. We've beat big schools before. We're doing it
now in the tournament.  
  
The whole upset, Cinderella thing is really just going over my head because
we're a good basketball team, we can stick with these teams. I think just
because people think we're a mid-major we're a Cinderella or an upset, we get
the lower seed. But in reality, we're a good basketball team and I think we're
finally getting the respect that we deserve.  
  
Q. Tinara, talk about at Ohio State you did something you've never done
before, hit two straight three-pointers. Will you be looking to do a couple
more of those throughout the rest of the tournament, taking a little bit more
threes?  
TINARA MOORE: I mean, whatever happens happens. If I ever get the opportunity
to get two wide-open threes, yeah, I'm going to take them. I practice them in
practice. You don't see it that much in the games.  
  
It is what it is. If it happens in the games, I'll definitely take the shot.  
  
Q. A preview of this game has been described as a track meet. Do you
feel that plays right into your hands? Is this what you want?  
PRESLEY HUDSON: I think it's not just a matter of preference. Like obviously
throughout the game, we're going to be adjusting, doing what we need to do to
be able to be the team on top. Really just not a matter of preference, but
just being able to adjust to what we need to do.  
  
Q. Presley, your coach referred to it as 'Presley Hudson range'. Where
does your range start?  
TINARA MOORE: Halfcourt (laughter).  
  
PRESLEY HUDSON: Anywhere I feel comfortable. In the game sometimes the hoop
feels closer than what it really is. Wherever I'm able to take an open shots,
my teammates have confidence in me to take those shots.  
  
Q. Cassie, you guys have already been able to take down two higher
seeds. I know you said you don't talk about seeding. How do you keep that
momentum going, getting on to the next round?  
CASSIE BREEN: I think we keep the momentum going by, like everybody has said
before, instilling confidence in each other, just knowing that every time you
step on the court, we work hard, just as every other team does.  
  
I think that makes it easier to not look at seeds because we're classified as
a mid-major. We have players that could have potentially played at bigger
schools, but we decided on Central Michigan. That's where we are now. That's
who we're going to play for, Central Michigan, because it's across our chests.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon head coach. Questions for coach,
please.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, a little disappointed we couldn't get out yesterday, but
those kind of things happen. I reminded our team and sent them a little text
today about our core values and principles. Number one on that list is we
choose to be positive (smiling). So we were positive about it and got here.  
  
I was just hoping to get here last night so I could visit with friends and
things like that, being back. But, no, it was all good. Those things happen.  
  
Q. What is it like being back in Spokane? They were shouting you out on
the news last night. You're a pretty popular guy here.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, coaches come in terms of their popularity and go. Depends
on the outcome of the previous night's game.  
  
It feels great to be here, honestly. I went for a great walk down along the
river, through the Gonzaga campus this morning, remember how beautiful this
place is. I loved my time here, 14 years. It was all during the time my kids
were growing up. We made some of our very best friends here.  
  
Yeah, it was special. I know it's not about me this week, it's about my team.
But I was really hoping we would draw the Spokane regional, and indeed we did.  
  
Q. In watching the Central Michigan game, I noticed not only did they
hit 14 threes, but their big hit a number of them. What kind of challenge does
that present for you guys defensively? What would Ruthy's responsibility be on
that defense?  
KELLY GRAVES: That's what makes them so formidable, they can put five players
on the floor that can make threes. They're an 11 seed, but it's in number
only. This is a much better team than that. They've obviously shown that.  
  
Yeah, I mean, Ruthy, she's capable of playing a guard. We've switched defenses
enough this year where she's had to play that position on a smaller player if
need be.  
  
Yeah, I mean, this is a formidable team. We're going to have to be on point,
not just Ruthy, but everybody. What I love about Moore inside is she's inside-
out. You can't lose her. Two-time Player of the Year for a reason. Yeah, we've
got our work cut out for us. I think that's going to be a key matchup
tomorrow, Ruthy and Moore.  
  
Q. They rely heavily on their starters. The two people coming off the
bench played a total of 10 combined minutes against Ohio State. How does that
affect the game plan? Is there any thought to kind of trying to tire them
out?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think at this point in the season, you kind of are who
you are. We're not changing. We might tweak the game plan a little bit, try to
focus in this area or that area. But we're not going to change the style with
which we play.  
  
I think we're difficult to play against if you don't have a bench, only
because we make you defend. We get up and down the floor okay, but I think in
the halfcourt, we make you guard. We try to get it to the third and fourth
side of the floor. I think over the course of a 40-minute game, that can be
difficult.  
  
They've obviously proven they can do it. They won two great games in Columbus
playing a limited bench, so...  
  
I think at this point in the season, the adrenaline is also going to help. I
don't know if the conditioning is going to be much of a factor either way.  
  
Q. Ever since the home game against UCLA you won, shooting numbers are
way up. Is this a factor for that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Lexi Bando. Truly, with having Lexi out there, that gives us
four shooters on the perimeter. Before you could maybe play off one of our
players at that four spot. Satou, they could put their best defender on Satou
out there in terms of somebody who is going to be spotting up. Now they can't
do that with Bando back. That means Satou is getting a little bit more room to
get those looks.  
  
Plus she's a freshman. Freshmen continue to get better and better and better.
That's what she's doing. Her confidence right now is really high. I think she
could be an X factor for us not only tomorrow but hopefully beyond.  
  
Q. It's not only a return to Spokane for you, but for Oti, as well. How
excited has she been to come here? What has her role been? Because of the
plane, you missed a food gathering at her parents' house?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, and I've eaten there before. It's impressive. I knew they
had a big old slab of ribs ready for the team last night.  
  
Yeah, she was disappointed because I think she was really excited to go home
and show off her family to the team and everything. In these parts, Oti is a
really popular player only -- not only, but because she was a successful
player, two state championships at Gonzaga Prep, two undefeated seasons, but
she is just a well-liked person, just a competitor, great personality, an
awesome teammate.  
  
What I'm really proud of Oti is she's in our student-athlete leadership. She
has really developed into just a strong, confident woman. As a player, man,
I'm telling you, she gives us a lift. We kind of kid with her Miss March. She
had a great March last year. She's already had a good start this year. We hope
that continues. We need that spark.  
  
Q. You were an 11 seed in this position before. What advice would you
give to an 11 seed that's playing in a regional semifinal?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I'm not going to say (smiling).  
  
You know, I think I would say the same thing I would say to anybody else. Just
play, be who you are. I don't think at this point it helps anybody to change
or to add new things or anything like that. I think at this point pretty much
every team has seen everything. They're not running anything tomorrow that we
haven't seen before.  
  
I think just kind of be yourself, have fun with it. I think at this point in
the season, just having fun and enjoying the experience is important. But, you
know, I've been fortunate to be in this position before. I've had the team
prepped for this. We're not looking at a seed, that's for sure.  
  
I think my teams have been fortunate enough to win nine games in this
tournament as a double-digit seed. I'm not sure anybody else can say that.
We've been in the position before, yeah.  
  
Q. Being back in the place you coached at for 14 years, I'm sure you've
had a lot of people reaching out to you. How many texts have you gotten? Have
any stood out to you?  
KELLY GRAVES: No more than normal. I think, you know, my friends usually text
after every game anyway. It's not just because they're here. I think most who
know me and know me well enough to be texting know that, you know, this is a
business trip. That's why I was really hoping to get here yesterday, because
the day before the game and the day of the game, you know, my friends know not
to really hang around too much. I stay pretty focused on the task at hand.  
  
No, this means a lot to me personally, it really does. I love Spokane. I loved
Gonzaga. I'm proud to have been the Zag coach for 14 years. I tweeted out
today, one of my fondest memories right here, seven years ago. We made that
run to the Elite 8. It happened right here in Spokane, so that was special.  
  
Q. Going off that experience of being on the other side, is it any
different now that you're kind of expected to get to this point?  
KELLY GRAVES: No. You know, not internally. Externally, people may be
predicting we're going to do this, we're going to do that. Internally, wait
till you see the three up here, if you come watch us practice, we're the same
loose team we've been all year. I haven't noticed anything different in how
we're going about things this year as we did last year. This is just a fun
group to be around. They're very loose, so...  
  
No, I think the external pressures are different, but we try not to let that
affect our team.  
  
Q. You talked about fond memories here in Spokane, Gonzaga. What do you
think of the job that Lisa has done, being an assistant while you were here in
Spokane?  
KELLY GRAVES: She's been great. Just picked up right where we left off. She
was part of the success before. I think she had been on my staff for seven or
eight years prior. As I get older, I kind of forget those kind of details. A
long time, she helped build it. She's just taking it over. They continue to do
great. They're recruiting well.  
  
She obviously is a great coach and has an awesome staff. Gonzaga supports
women's basketball, you know, as much as anybody in the country.  
  
I'm really proud of her. I think it's great. She's still a young coach. She's
got a bright future.  
  
Q. I know you loved playing at Matthew Knight last weekend, home-court
advantage. We talked to people here in Spokane who say they plan on becoming
Ducks fans this weekend. How big an advantage would that be, to almost have a
second home court this weekend?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, I sure hope that the Spokane fans come out in force,
yeah, cheer for the Ducks. Why not? We're a Northwest school. I'm sure if they
didn't go to the school themselves, they know people who did, have friends
whose kids went there. It's a popular school in the Northwest.  
  
I think any time you have a crowd cheering for you it's a positive. It's human
nature to root for the underdog. Right now Central Michigan would be
considered the underdog - not in my view - but in terms of the seed and maybe
nationally.  
  
Yeah, so, come on Zag fans, let's cheer for those Ducks.  
  
Q. There's not the chaos on the women's side that the men's bracket has,
but how important is it for there to be two 11 seeds in the Sweet 16? You say
you're not the underdog, but to have some sort of parity in women's
basketball?  
KELLY GRAVES: Again, I think it's great. I think it's good for our team. Think
one of the knocks for years in the women's game would be, especially with the
top four seeds hosting, maybe 15 or even 16 of those top-seeded teams move on.
There wasn't a whole lot of drama in the early rounds. That's what makes the
men's tournament so special.  
  
So, yeah, I think it's great. Again, you guys, listen, I've seen I don't know
how many games of Central Michigan, these guys can play. They actually remind
me a lot of our Zag teams in the past. They can play fast, they can all score,
they play good defense, they play really hard, they play with a high IQ, they
have great leadership. I think Coach Guevara is a good coach.  
  
I think this is good for everybody. Hopefully it's not good for them tomorrow,
but it's pretty neat what they've done, that whole league.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Oregon student-athletes. Questions,
please.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I know you have had some plane issues yesterday, but what
have the last 24 hours been like? What have you been doing? Just hanging out
in Eugene?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, we've just been hanging out in Eugene. We came back
from the airport when we had to deboard the plane. We hung around for a few
hours, then found out we were going to come back here in the morning. So slept
for the few hours that we were able to, and got back here.  
  
But, I mean, we're excited to be here. The hotel is nice. The beds were
amazing. We're just excited to be here. It's just going to be a fun experience
for us regardless of the plane issues. We got here.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I heard you got some advice from Courtney Vandersloot and
John Stockton during your trip to the great state of Washington. What kind of
wisdom did they share with you?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think Courtney talked to us as a team, I talked to her a
little bit. Just to keep working hard, take the criticism Kelly gives me,
because he gave it to her, as well.  
  
Then John actually is probably one of my favorite players of all time. I was
looking for him in the stands before the game started, trying to find him. I
hope he comes out, you know, this weekend (smiling).  
  
But he didn't talk too much about basketball. He's pretty down-to-earth, just
talked to me and said he watched our team, liked how we played. I hope he
continues to like how we play, because I'd love to see him there tomorrow. Let
him know.  
  
Q. Ruthy, what has Kelly's main focal message been about this Central
Michigan team?  
RUTHY HEBARD: They're a super good team. We were the lower seed that came up
last year and upset a few really good top seeds.  
  
We need to stay focused. They're really good at shooting the three, as we saw
in their last game. Just keeping up this good defense and playing our game
offensively.  
  
Q. Sabrina, the scouting report on you guys is you're so difficult to
defend because all five starters are in double figures. Central Michigan,
they're able to do the same. How difficult is that to defend?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think the Pac-12 has prepared us for that. We play teams
every night that have a lot of players in double figures. We know that they're
a transition team. They like to get out there in transition. They shoot the
ball well. They have a good inside presence.  
  
But I think us being a team like that, we play against that in practice every
day. I think that is going to help us coming into tomorrow and defending a
team like that. We're going to have to use our length. They're shorter and
quicker than we are. We're going to have to use our length and play them to
their weakness.  
  
Q. Ruthy, you and Moore are probably going to be matched up on Saturday.
What do you see in her game? What kind of challenges does she pose?  
RUTHY HEBARD: She's definitely a great post player. She was one of the best
ones in her conference, I heard. I watched a little film. She has a really
good shot outside. I'm definitely going to have to (indiscernible) out this
whole time, be physical, hope my size will do me well on Saturday.  
  
Q. Being the local team, other than maybe John Stockton, what are you
looking to see from the fans this weekend?  
MAITE CAZORLA: I hope all Kelly's fans come here and support us. I think we're
really excited to play. We're looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: I'm looking forward to it. Oti is from here. It's going to be
great to see her family in the stands, other teammates. Being home for Kelly
is going to be great. I feel like a lot of Zag fans will be here wearing
Oregon colors. I can't wait to play.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: They said it all. I hope Kelly's people come out to support
him. I know he left a legacy in this town. I hope they come out and support
him. A lot of our families are making the trip, are going to be there. I hope
people from Eugene come down and support us, as well. It's a fun time. I think
we have an exciting weekend.  
  
Q. Sabrina, we've talked a lot about their starters, how big of an
impact they have. How big of an advantage is it that you have the starters but
you also have an incredibly deep bench who has played some NCAA minutes
already this year?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, our bench has played well. I think as well as
they've ever played, especially at this point. They came in those last two
games and really had key minutes for us, played well, definitely helped us
rest, as well. I think it's going to be definitely beneficial for us to have
such a deep bench.  
  
I know they're not as deep. But their starting five can do it. They've proven
they can play 80 minutes in the last two games they've played. So we're going
to have to play as hard as we can. Our bench is going to help us, just like
they've been doing all year.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you have the triple-double burger commercial that airs in
Eugene. I will say if you've watched ESPN over the past couple days, when they
preview the NCAA tournament, you're featured in there. What has that been
like, to see you next to all the other great players in this women's
tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: It's been cool, I guess. I don't really pay too much
attention to that. I hope my team was somewhere in the background because they
deserve all the recognition that I get. So, go us (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

_Spokane, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Texas A&M head Coach Gary Blair. Questions
for coach.  
  
Q. You faced a lot of good inside games in the SEC and non-conference.
Where does Notre Dame rank, how do you combat that?  
GARY BLAIR: There's not anybody in the SEC that's like Shepard. I can go from
past experiences. My last year at Arkansas, Stacy Stephens who played for
Texas, they went on to the Final Four, was very similar. If you can help me
with this game, the girl that used to play for Nebraska, in the WNBA now. I'm
trying to think of her name. Kelsey or something like that. But she was also a
very versatile post player just like Shepard is.  
  
Shepard is not the perimeter post player that we faced at DePaul or Drake, so
it's a different set. She's going to take you to the low block. They run a
great 1-4 high set that they isolate her down low. She's a very good passer.
She's a complete package.  
  
If I could go back to years ago, most of you guys are too young, Leslie
Johnson who used to play at Purdue was that type of player. I've had other
players. Norris at Stephen F. Austin, players similar to that. A little bit of
Danielle Adams. She's a completely different thing than we faced when we faced
McCowan at Mississippi State, Russell with Tennessee, A'ja Wilson, or even
Coates last year of South Carolina.  
  
She's a very physical player that loves to duck her shoulder. She draws fouls
very well. They do a good job of managing her time, taking her out to rest, to
send her back in. They do not have a lot of depth.  
  
Muffet has done a good job of managing a short bench this year by keeping
people fresh and also learning to play heavy minutes. I think we've done that
for two straight years.  
  
People talk about Notre Dame's four ACLs, but I've got four kids out, too,
that nobody has ever written a story about. I have two kids that are out,
redshirted the whole year, because of injuries, then I have two McDonald's
All-Americans sitting out because of the one-year transfer. I have four kids
out, as well.  
  
It's a shame for her four ACLs. That's just unheard of. I don't think I've
ever heard of four in one year. But they've overcome it. They're playing very
well.  
  
If you go back and look at our last four games, Mississippi State was
averaging 83 points a game. Drake was averaging 82.5. DePaul was averaging 83.
Now we have Notre Dame averaging 85 and shooting 51%. Where are all the
defensive teams that I'd love to face that are slowing it down?  
  
We just keep facing great, great offensive teams.  
  
Q. Did you envision the type of year that Chennedy Carter has had?  
GARY BLAIR: You dream about it. But how many can expect Kelsey Plum, Kelsey
Mitchell, Alanna DeShields, Asia Durr? They're all that heralded coming out.
But can they do it under the big tent? Can they do it under the pressure of
defenses, the different schemes people will play at you, the triangle-and-
twos, the box-and-one, denial back. She's overcome all of it.  
  
A lot of this came from she played for the state championship last year. She
fouled out about with a minute to go and they ended up losing. She played for
the gold medal against Russia this summer. Was the leading scorer on that team
as a two guard. The year before she won the gold medal.  
  
This isn't just a kid just slipping in through the cracks. This is the most
highly-recruited kid that we've ever had since probably Kelsey Bone played for
us. But remember, she transferred from South Carolina after a year to come
home.  
  
But Chennedy, her basketball IQ is off the charts. Sometimes when you're
coaching a point guard, it's a love-hate relationship until they get on the
same page as you as a coach. That's hard for an 18-year-old. I couldn't even
get my own two kids when they were 18 to be on the same page with me and I was
their parent. You have to have a give-and-take.  
  
Being an old-school guy, I cannot go in and talk about John Stockton and Karl
Malone on the pick'n roll, all that type of stuff. She'll know who they are,
but most of my other kids won't know who Malone and Stockton are.  
  
You have to adjust as a head coach. You have to let a kid feel her way.
Sometimes as a coach, don't go in and over-coach, and take away what she does
best, and that's be able to create her own shot, which the majority of the
guards at her age cannot do. They're situational players or they have to grow
until they learn how to handle, think, react, do all those things.  
  
But she can do it all. I'd like to take all that credit, but I can't.
Actually, she was coached in high school by one of my former assistants who
was with me at Arkansas and Stephen F. Austin. Her dad did a great job of
working with her on her handles and everything like that. Her mom has done a
tremendous job of raising that young lady, being with her on the discipline
parts that you have to have.  
  
Q. When you saw Notre Dame would be the Sweet 16 matchup, did you think
back to 2011?  
GARY BLAIR: I think back to 2011 every day I look at my right hand. But I'm
not looking at Notre Dame; I'm looking at Stanford, I'm looking at Baylor, I'm
looking at Georgia, and I'm looking at Notre Dame.  
  
A team that was not a Cinderella team, a team that played well, that defeated
a lot of No. 1s and 2s to win the thing. But when you win it, it comes so few
and far between, you better enjoy it.  
  
Our football team is still enjoying 1939, when they won it, okay? It's hard to
do. When I was at Arkansas, Nolan Richardson won it in '94 by beating Duke.
They're still enjoying it. Then the next year he loses it to coast-to-coast
because Dabney goes coast-to-coast on a basket for UCLA and wins it.  
  
You better enjoy. Yes, I think about it every day. But I don't think about the
game itself. To be honest, I've never seen the complete game after the fact.
I've only seen the highlights. It was time to turn the page and start thinking
about next year's team.  
  
One of these days, whenever I do retire, I'll sit back and I'll watch that
whole game and enjoy every single minute of it with a beverage or three.  
  
Q. Last game in the first half you guys really found yourself in a hole.
You used Chennedy Carter's 32-point second half to get out of that barely. How
are you going to get your girls going early in the first half so there's no
hole, no performance needed like that to win the game?  
GARY BLAIR: You got to make shots. We had good shots in the first half. It
wasn't what DePaul was doing to us, it was what we were not doing to ourselves
to execute. Chennedy was 2-9, and Danni was 1-8, and Khaalia was 1-3. Jas
Lumpkin didn't score at all. Anriel Howard kept us in that game with her
heart, with her rebounding, with her put-backs. Sometimes you have to have a
different person step up every night.  
  
I have a team, everybody wants to talk about Chennedy Carter. I have a team of
stars, okay? It's a frigging galaxy out there. I don't know which one is going
to shine the most that day, will it be Jas Lumpkin's defense and rebounding or
Hillsman ruling the paint?  
  
Unfortunately in this business, y'all have got to write about the story. The
story right now is Texas A&M in the Sweet 16, and I've got the best freshman
in the country. But I've got a pretty damn good team that goes along with her.
Very similar to 2011 when everybody wanted to talk about Danielle Adams. They
needed to talk about Colson and Carter and Tyra White and Adaora Elonu because
those were very good players.  
  
You know what's funny? All those kids are still playing pro ball seven years
later. So there was a lot of stars on that team, just like there is here, as
well. So we're not going to get off to that bad of a start again, I hope, I
hope.  
  
But I appreciate you guys coming out and covering it for the student
newspaper. I really appreciate that.  
  
Q. First time for all these players to be in the Sweet 16. What do you
see from them that enables them to handle stuff off the court, get ready for
the spotlight? It's a little bit bigger this week than last week.  
GARY BLAIR: Well, due to social media, those kids are in it every day, okay?
Even in 2011, it was nothing compared to today. The stuff that's going up on
Instagram or instant chat [sic], whatever you guys do, I don't understand it.
The thing that the SEC is putting together, the players tribune thing that
just came out on Chennedy, an interview with her, the thing in the Spokane
paper was very good this morning, talking about four great players, Anriel
Howard was mentioned as our great player right there.  
  
All that stuff is tremendous, okay? This is where we're going. We're standing
on our own two feet. You people here in the audience, y'all want to be here.
This was not an assignment that you had to cover. You want to be here to cover
women's basketball. This is what makes this game so special. It keeps growing
and growing and getting better and better.  
  
I'm just lucky to still be doing it. I'm getting to go against a Hall of Famer
in Muffet. She's done so much for the game. She's Coach of the Year this year
with six players. She's been doing one heck of a job.  
  
I really admire what Muffet has given back to the game. She's a former WBCA
president. Last week I faced a former WBCA president. It's just good to be
here back in the Northwest. The last time I was here was in about 1990 at an
AAU tournament, okay? I got to learn how your golf courses were. I played 36
at Spokane Country Club. I recruited hard. Went over to Coeur d'Alene to play.
It was a great time.  
  
But usually we're over on the other side of the mountain range in Seattle,
which is also a beautiful town. One of my favorite towns is Seattle. But after
eating at the Italian Kitchen last night, that was pretty good, too (smiling).  
  
Q. What do you see as keys to the game tomorrow?  
GARY BLAIR: Two keys: Shepard and Hillsman, both of them need to stay out of
foul trouble. How is the game going to be called? The DePaul game, the refs
let the kids decide it. It was a very well-called ballgame by veteran
officials that didn't try to over-call. I think once you get to the NCAA
tournament, you got to let your bigs play a little. You got to let your bigs
play a little. I think that's going to be important.  
  
The other thing is, who is going to do what? Are we going to see the triangle-
and-two? Are we going to see the zone? Are we going to see the man that she
played against Villanova because she had to? Villanova's own offense is about
as good as anybody in the country, so she had to play man, and she knew she
had the better team and eventually it would work out like it did in the second
half.  
  
Their guards are outstanding. NCAA games are won with your guards. Post
players set the tone and everything like that, but you win championships, you
win everything at the guard position. I believe we've got three or four pretty
good ones there. I know she does, as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, Coach Blair.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Texas A&M student-athletes. Questions,
please.  
  
Q. Khaalia, can you talk about what is going to be some of the keys you
going up against Shepard, if you're not going to do man-to-man, what do you
see as the keys?  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: I mean, I've been watching film on her. She's very
fundamentally sound. She has great hands and great feet. I'm going to have to
have great feet to be able to defend her.  
  
I know she's very strong, so I can't let her muscle me down there on the
block, do whatever she wants. I'm going to try to wear her out with that, try
to run up and down the court a little bit, tire her down a little bit.  
  
I've been watching film on her. She's very a good post player. I'm very
excited. I love a challenge, so she's definitely going to be a challenge. She
can drive the ball, she can shoot the high post, she's very strong, can finish
under the rim. I'm very excited to play her.  
  
Q. Danni, after the come-from-behind win, do you feel like you have some
momentum going into this game against Notre Dame?  
DANNI WILLIAMS: Absolutely. I think we've been putting it together recently
towards the end of the season. We feel confident coming in. We know we can't
get down 15 points to a team like Notre Dame and have that comeback. We have
to be ready from the start, ready to go.  
  
Q. Anriel, talk about getting to the Sweet 16, being you guys are all
upperclassmen, this is your first time. What about handling everything maybe
off the court, one more level than last week.  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Right. For all of us, this is very meaningful to us because we
haven't been here before since we've been here. So we're very honored and
blessed to have this opportunity, but we're definitely handling our business
off the court as well. Even though we're out here, it's a business trip. We
have to take care of things first, so...  
  
Q. How are you as upperclassmen stepping up to help out with the younger
girls, like Carter? How are you using your role as a leader to help her in
this big situation?  
DANNI WILLIAMS: Personally, I feel like she doesn't in a sense need that
mentorship. She's played in big games just like this. For her, I think it's
just playing her game. But for the other people, I feel like, you know, we
have to be telling them this is do or die, we got to be mentally locked in and
focused, ready to go at all times.  
  
Q. Khaalia, Coach Blair was saying one of the biggest keys to the game
was keeping you out of foul trouble despite what he expects to be a physical
matchup tomorrow against Shepard. What is going to be the key to being
physical and locking her down but staying out of foul trouble?  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: One of the things that Coach Starkey teaches us on post
defense is to meet the post up the lane. I saw a lot of clips when I watched
the Villanova game of Villanova just letting Shepard go down there and just
post up and turn around, shoot a layup. I definitely want to make her work to
get down there.  
  
It's definitely going to be a feet game, a footwork game. I can't just reach
around her, because that will be a foul. I have to move my feet. I have to
focus on that in practice today so I can transition into the game tomorrow.  
  
But it's definitely just going to be a feet game, just not letting her set up
shop wherever she wants, yeah.  
  
Q. Danni, a stretch for eight or nine games where you're probably
shooting the best you ever have. Last game, 1-10, looked like you were getting
your shots, they were just not falling. Why were you shooting so well the last
eight or nine games?  
DANNI WILLIAMS: I think I just been relaxed, doing whatever I can do to help
our team win down the stretch. I got the shots. I got good looks in DePaul,
they just didn't fall. As a shooter, you're going to go through that. I'm not
really worried about, you know, thinking about that. I can't dwell about that.
We have a game tomorrow. That's a new day and a new opportunity.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Yeah, D (smiling).  
  
Q. Danni, you've played a ton of minutes this season, played the whole
game last game. Does that take a toll on your body this time of year? Have you
had time to regroup?  
DANNI WILLIAMS: It does take a toll. But we've had almost a week to recover
and get ready. So you just got to be drinking a lot of water. You got to be
prepared. You can't take anything lightly. You got to stay on top of your
recovery to be prepared for these type of games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: Shout out to my mom. I love you (laughter).
