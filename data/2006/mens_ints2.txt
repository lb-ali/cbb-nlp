_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
GLEN DAVIS: Before they start asking the questions, I want to know what y'all
think. I want to ask y'all a couple questions. Can I do that?  
_MODERATOR: No. We got to stick with the format._  
_We have Coach Brady, student-athletes Glen Davis, Tyrus Thomas, and Darrel
Mitchell. And we'll start with Coach Brady. A brief overview._  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I thought the game was going to come down to a
rebounding game and a defending game. And I thought we held our own with that
team on the board. I think they're the best rebounding team in the country
from a statistical standpoint. We rebounded the ball with them quite well and
we knew or we expected that they would play some zone, if we scored against
them in our man offense, we thought they would play zone and they did.  
Particularly I think he went zone early when Tasmin got his second foul and we
took him out, we put Darnell Lazare in with the three and that gave us some
size, but certainly from a perimeter playing standpoint, a play making
standpoint it hurt our team a little bit and they played zone. But we did
enough things against the zone to play with them and I thought the first half
score was fine. I thought 26-26 with a majority of the time that they played
zone was good for our team to be able to do.  
Then they came out man and played us mostly man the second half. And they
played us a couple of -- you know, a few possessions of zone, but and we had
the game in hand at about in the five-minute mark and we had about four
straight possessions where I thought we got some good looks or we kind of ran
what we needed to but we didn't come away with anything.  
And Texas is well coached, they're a talented team and they were able to tie
the score. And then the last shot at the end we were trying to throw it to
Glen to make a play but he caught the ball a little too far off the lane line
and we didn't get quite the shot we wanted. But the timeout before the
overtime started was really positive for our team. We all thought that we were
going to win the game. It didn't matter what had happened to that point, all
we needed was five minutes and we were going to have an opportunity to play
for a National Championship or keep playing for a National Championship. And I
thought the overtime we just played outstanding.  
And I mean this and this isn't -- it's just what it is, you know, you can
coach a long time and never have a group of people like I have. You got to
have talented players, which they are, but they're also very good people.
High-character guys that are fun to be around. I'm fortunate to be able to
coach these guys. And I said it in the press conference the other day, they
have helped me be a better coach. And hopefully we can play two more games.
You got your hankys?  
(Laughter.) That's my overview.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for the student-athletes._  
Q. For all three of you guy, two questions: 8-5 you're sitting in Hartford
getting on the bus, did you have any clue that this was waiting for you down
the road? And the second part is, what makes you guys so resilient to stand up
when a team comes back on you, when a team forces overtime like that?  
GLEN DAVIS: Well, we can't predict the future. So we never knew we were going
to be in this situation. But we believed. We always believed in ourselves and
our team. It's just a will and determination to get back up again, after you
get slugged by a tough team. You got to be willing to take some shots and
bounce back up.  
And it shows a lot of character for our team being so young, we have went
through a lot of trials and tribulations as far as Ohio State, Connecticut,
and we learned from those things. Tight situations. So it's not new to us to
get back up and fight.  
We just got to keep doing our thing and just keep doing this next week.  
TYRUS THOMAS: Coach sat us in the locker room before the season and we put our
goals on the board. And it was to win the SEC west, to win the SEC, to win the
SEC tournament, to win, to make it to the Final Four and win the National
Championship. And he said we had to take it one step at a time. And it just
feels good to win. And after we lost at Connecticut, it was a -- I think it
was more of an eye-opener to show what we can do and it showed us what we
needed to do to achieve our potential. And the resiliency, you know, Coach
showed us a video of Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson the other day, and Texas
gave us some hard punches and we had to be Buster Douglas and swing back and
we swung back at them. We knocked out Mike Tyson.  
DARREL MITCHELL: The guys basically covered it all, but after the Connecticut
loss I kind of was down on myself a little bit because I had a chance to pull
us through that game with that last shot and that kind of hurt me deep down
inside.  
But the guys, they came up to me and was like, you know, you'll get another
chance to do it again and put it behind you. So I think that brought us
together as a team and like Tyrus said, it was an eye-opening experience for
us and our capabilities as a team. And as individuals what we could do, to go
on the road early in the season with the team that we had and we weren't even
established as good as we are now. We weren't that established at that time.
And for us to go up there and do that, it showed us a lot.  
And as far as the second question, you know, we just wanted -- like he said,
we set goals at the beginning of the season and for us to be successful and
getting that goal, we were minus one goal, we didn't win the tournament. But
other than that we achieved all the other goals and we have one left. And I
think that us using things like people didn't expect us to be here, we used
that as motivation. Each and every night we gathered ourselves together and
pulled through for one another.  
But we were just happy to be here and happy to have the experience with this
young team and we're looking forward to going to Indy.  
Q. Glen, can you talk about the three pointer and in overtime, I think that
might have just been the sixth one you've had all year and that was, needless
to say, a huge shot.  
GLEN DAVIS: It's called thinking without thinking. That's what I call it. The
opportunity was there to make the shot. Most of the time when I'm shooting or
when I'm shooting threes, I'm thinking about it too much. So I just was in
rhythm and I felt that it was a great shot and I made it.  
Q. Glen, could you repeat what you said up on the stage there after the
game? The acoustics were bad. Can you repeat what you said?  
GLEN DAVIS: Basically I was giving credit to God, because we couldn't do it
without him. And then I wanted to also give a shout out to the people of
Louisiana, the victims of Hurricane Katrina, just giving them some motivation.
And just some uplifting to some -- a good feeling about their state. Because I
know a lot of things are going on right now and people are just trying to
recuperate from what happened and this is something to push them in the right
direction of coming back home to New Orleans and basically just having a good
feeling about their state.  
Q. Glen, everybody in the arena can see your intensity. Could you talk about
where it comes from and possibly touch on the time you spent living in the
Temple house for awhile when you were in high school?  
GLEN DAVIS: Well, basically, you have to want it. You have to want to win. You
have to want to succeed. And basically I want the best for my team and I'm
going to give 110 percent to make sure that happens. So the emotions that you
are seeing out there were not just from me, it was all the guys around me. How
much I cared about them and how much I wanted them to feel good, you know.  
So basically it's just something that you got to have inside of you. Something
you can't teach. The will to win. You got to want to win. You can't make them
go out there and win, you got to -- they got to do it themselves.  
But growing up also in -- and touching on the Temples, you know, they did some
very, very -- they changed my life in different ways to the point that it made
me the man that I am right now today. I give credit to Mr. Temple and his
family because I don't know where I would have been without those guys and
just being around those guys led me in the right direction, because I was
going down the wrong path. So I love the Temples and what can I say, they kind
of saved my life.  
Q. From half time on, Glen and Tyrus, y'all were in full court zone. I mean,
both you took the team on your back. I think you scored most of the points,
grabbed most of the rebounds. Can you say something, both of you, about when
you end that kind of a zone, when you think you can make every point, grab
every rebound?  
TYRUS THOMAS: As a lot of you guys know, Glen and myself live together and we
have been knowing each other since we were small, 13 years old. And we just
have a relationship to like we're blood brothers. And, you know, we battle for
each other and sometimes we call each other soldiers, and soldiers never --
they never leave a man behind. And Glen just told me it's time to go to war.
We both understood it was time to go to war and we just -- it was time to
fight. And when he fights, I fight. And when I fight, he fights, as well as
the rest of the members of our team. It wasn't just us.  
But we have a mentality that we're not going to lose. If you beat us, it's not
because you -- you're outworking us or you outhustled us or you have more
heart than us. So that's our mentality. And we didn't -- I don't think we
played with that mentality all the way in the first half, but the second half
we knew we had to give it our all if we wanted to win.  
GLEN DAVIS: Well, basically, you know, I'm closer, or close to the people, the
teammates, my teammates on my team, we're all close, but there's a bond me and
Tyrus have. We call each other brothers, brothers from another mother. That's
what we call ourselves. And like he says, when one fights, the other fights.
That's what brothers do. You go get the big brother. So we got each other's
back and we realize the task at hand and we wanted to accomplish our goals
because at the beginning of the season we set multiple goals.  
And we just want to leave it out there on the floor. We told each other we're
going to leave it out on the floor every time we come out here, we're going to
leave it out on the floor. And that's what we did. And we just have a
chemistry and a camaraderie together that most people can't establish.  
_MODERATOR: We'll excuse our student-athletes. Thank you, gentlemen. Questions
for Coach._  
Q. Obviously you play in a league where if you win the league you got a
chance to play for a National Championship in this tournament. Yet you have so
many young guys coming in in October, how improbable is being here?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, it's been surprising the way our team has developed
and come together. You've heard testimony all the last two or three days about
the relationship that these guys have. I think that may have something to do
with the way our team has developed. I do agree with them that some of the
difficult games that we had early that we had in hand, the Cincinnati game and
the Ohio State game and the Connecticut game, on the road, we had those games
and we lost them and then but we were able to win at West Virginia.  
But even in losing with a young team, our team gained some confidence out of
that. I remember in the locker room after the Connecticut game we were 8-5 and
I told them after the game, we're a Top-25 team, people just don't know it
yet. And I really believed that because of the way we were playing with the
youth that we had.  
But once you get into the season and you play in the SEC as we did, I think
the key to our season though was the win on the road at Arkansas to open up
SEC play. That's -- they draw 18,000 every game and we went into their arena
and we were able to win that game and then we started out in the league 7-0.
And our team just developed a lot of confidence about it.  
But our players never got down, they never got discouraged, we as a coaching
staff were committed to being positive with this team because of their youth.
And I think hopefully we made the right decisions that -- and they did what
they were supposed to done now I think it's paying off with how we're playing
now.  
Q. It's been about 20 years I think since LSU has been to a Final Four, what
does this do, what does this mean to the program?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I think it establishes us right now at this particular time
one of the better teams in the country because of what we have gone through.
When Dale Brown was a basketball coach almost 20 years to the day, he took an
11th seeded team and made it to the Final Four. And there's been a lot of
similarities with our progression upsetting a number one as they did 20 years
ago, we beat Duke, number one, and we were able to advance on.  
And but it means a great deal. It means a great deal to our fans that love to
win and in Louisiana and in Baton Rouge. LSU, the culture of our fan base, LSU
runs deep in our state. I said earlier that there are other students that go
to other schools, but they're all LSU fans. And I think it's uplifting for our
state, but it's great for our program, it puts us in a situation now where I
don't think -- I don't know if you call it respect, but certainly the
notoriety that we're going to receive from this is extremely important. It
attracts other students to your university, it's going to help in our
recruiting, it's just so many benefits that can be derived from putting
yourself in a position to play for a National Championship going to a Final
Four.  
And if we -- like Glen said, if we have helped our state in some way and
uplifted some people there that have had a difficult time with what the state
has been through, then we're humbled by that, but we're also appreciative --
if we're able to do that, we're certainly appreciative of the position that
we're in.  
Q. At 9-2 you guys seemed a little static on offense and then Tyrus had that
one-handed dunk that made it 9-4. How much did that kind of just get things
going for you guys?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well I think when you have an athlete like Tyrus Thomas, he
can make plays like that throughout a game. And you're exactly right, at the
first of the game when he tip dunked the ball back in the goal, it kind of
gave us a lift, got our fans involved in the game and teams feed off of that.
Not only does it help your own team, it can somewhat demoralize the other team
to a degree.  
Then we got ourselves back offensively against their man defense pretty good.
But then they went zone and kind of slowed us down a little bit. But Tyrus
Thomas can -- he did that early in the game, he blocked two or three shots, as
the game went along he got another slam dunk. We ran a play off of their zone
where we screened the back screen for him and threw him a lob off of that.  
All of those things kept our team going. And that's something that you don't
coach, athletic ability. That's something you recruit. And you have to recruit
well, and coach it decent to have a chance to keep playing. But that's
something we recruited a long, athletic young man like him that's a pleasure
to coach and he's energized our team throughout the season with plays like
that throughout the course of a game and we're fortunate to have a player like
that on our team.  
Q. I wonder if you could just talk about that huddle before overtime, it
looked like -- I think you guys scored four seconds into overtime and like you
had a little extra zip, more than Texas did really at the start.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: My goal in that timeout was to make sure our players didn't
feel in any way that they could lose that game. I didn't want them to think --
because Garrett missed an open jump shot, I didn't want him to feel bad about
anything that had gone on. We had some opportunities down the stretch to score
the ball and we didn't do it. And it's not all of a sudden that the LSU team
played poorly, you have to credit Texas for guarding us pretty well too. And
they the resiliency to come back and tie the game.  
But I wanted to make sure our team was extremely positive coming out of that
timeout, that they had a belief in them that if we did the things necessary we
were going to win the game. And that's really all the timeout consisted of. I
didn't draw a play, I didn't diagram one thing, I just wanted to make sure
they came out of the timeout with a belief system or belief in themselves that
that game was theirs to win.  
Q. LaMarcus I guess was 2 for 14, can you talk about the way you defended
him and did you suspect that that could happen? I know you rely on Glen
offensively, but defensively to do that to LaMarcus with Tyrus and Glen?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, different than the last eight minutes of the or the 10
minutes of the Duke game, we went and double teamed Williams, I was afraid to
really double team Aldridge because Texas has some other guy that can score
the ball and we would leave people open in our rotation.  
But Glen and Tyrus gave him different looks. Glen was able to force him a
little farther out than he wanted to score the ball. When he turned to shoot
it, Glen gave him some resistance and probably kept him off balance a little
bit and he couldn't turn in rhythm to shoot it because of Glen's presence.
Tyrus on the other hand made him deal with a different kind of athlete that's
long and lanky and could maybe get a piece of the ball when he shot it. Which
made him probably think about it.  
But defensively that was a key for us because you saw the game he had the
night before last, 26 and 13. And we knew if he did that against us we had no
chance to win the game. So you got to compliment Glen specifically and Tyrus
Thomas as an assist in the way we defended him today.  
Q. First of all, congratulations. Second of all, 14 seconds to go, you're up
eight, you know you're going to win. I'm assuming that you're like every coach
in the world that went to the Final Fours when you were an assistant and a
high school guy and sat there and watched the workouts on Friday. Did it go
through your mind that you're going to be the team now working out and
everybody's going to be sitting there watching you guys?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: You know, that's a great question. And I was talking to Glen
walking down the hall way, and our AD is out here, Skip, he's won five
National Championships and I'm going to ask him how he felt when he knew he
was -- I guess going to Omaha is a little bit different, but with two games to
go he had a chance to win. I would like to see how he felt.  
But I'll be honest with you, you know, the celebration was great, I knew we
were going to win the game, but there's something in my mind that says we're
not finished yet. And I don't feel like this is over. I thought I would react
differently, to be quite honest. Going to the Final Four, that's where it is.
But when I was talking with Glen, walking down the hall and he agreed with me,
for some reason this doesn't seem like the end to me or I'm not all
overwhelmed by the moment. Because there's some more work to do. And maybe
there's something more in store for this team. Who knows.  
But I like what Darrel and Tyrus and Glen both told me walking into this
interview room, that this is nice, but we're through here now and we're ready
to go home and get to work and try to prepare for two more games. And it's
really a little strange that I would feel like this, but I think that's a good
way to feel. And hopefully Glen and Tyrus and Darrel will carry that over to
our other team members and we'll have two or three days of good practice and
try to remove ourselves from the distractions that are going to come along and
meet the obligations that we have to meet in the next four or five days, but
at the same time reserve two hours of practice every day to not upset our
routine too much in that particular time so we can play well when we go to
Indianapolis.  
_MODERATOR: Thank you, John, very much._  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 3RD & 4TH ROUND REGIONALS:
ATLANTA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+3RD+%26+4TH+ROUND+REGIONALS%3A+ATLANTA)

  

## March 25, 2006

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Brad Buckman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13722)

### [P.J. Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13721)

  
_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
_MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Barnes, LaMarcus Aldridge, P.J. Tucker and
Brad Buckman. We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Barnes._  
COACH RICK BARNES: First of all, obviously LSU, outstanding team, defensively,
made it really difficult for us to score. But also I told our team that we
certainly have nothing to -- we're disappointed, but I really appreciate the
effort that a Brad Buckman and a Kenton Paulino gave us today and throughout
the four years they have been at Texas.  
And this year especially with the expectations that were put on the program,
maybe the most ever, in the way we were able to fight through it, to get
within one game of possible getting back to a Final Four, that will be
something in a couple weeks we'll look back and reflect on.  
But, again, LSU deserved to win the game, they made the plays when they had
to, and again, defensively they were outstanding.  
Q. The two players, could you talk about the defensive pressure that LSU put
on you guys and to limit you to 52 points in regulation?  
P.J. TUCKER: They did a pretty good job. They played hard. We didn't shoot the
ball very well. You give them a lot of credit. They played really hard. They
kept coming back at us. So like I say, you got to give those guys a lot of
credit.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: There's no if and buts about it, I mean they played great D. And
it's a tough way to go out like this and you saw the Duke game, they played
that amount of D in that game too, so they did a great job.  
Q. Can both players talk about the start of the overtime. There were a
couple turnovers right out of the gate.  
P.J. TUCKER: It was just mishandling the ball a couple times. We were trying
to get a quick hit real fast and we just didn't take our time. Stuff happens,
but you got to play through it. We had a good season, but obviously things
didn't go the way we wanted them to. But just a little sloppy at the end.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: Those turnovers were tough, man. I mean, we tried to get
something going and we had a couple mental lapses and it just happened. It's
how the game goes out. It's a tough way to feel like that, but it's been a
great season and I'm not really thinking about that anymore.  
Q. For both players, I wonder if you can talk about the wear of having to go
against a guy like the Big Baby for 45 minutes and then also the jumping
ability of Thomas and how tough that was?  
BRAD BUCKMAN: You look at the stat sheet, man, it shows it. They're two great
players. They came ready to play. And we did our best job. I think we played
pretty good defense on those guys and it was tough, because Tyrus is always
jumping when you try to shoot a shot and he had a couple great blocks that I
saw. And Big Baby, I mean he's just a load down there, man, some of the moves
and the shots he made, it's just incredible. You give them a lot of credit.
They came out and did what they had to do against us. And it was a tough
matchup.  
P.J. TUCKER: The they're both two tough players. I think LaMarcus did a good
job, Brad too, they played hard. But Glen Davis knocked down some big-time
shots and over two or three people, I mean he just made some big-time shots.
Tyrus Thomas got it going early, he got in the groove early, we let him get
comfortable. So they're good players and once they start to get comfortable,
they start playing well.  
Q. Players, two questions, can you say something about what your offense was
like once your big man was put in lock down? And number two, can you say
something about the two-man scoring game that LSU had with Tyrus Thomas and
Glen Davis?  
BRAD BUCKMAN: You can't make shots every day. LaMarcus had a big-time game the
first game. He was unbelievable. And then you struggle sometimes. He did his
best trying to get his shots. They just wasn't falling. LaMarcus is one heck
of a player. I give him so much credit because he did -- he tried to do what
he had to do. It's tough when you can't knock down shots. But he took great
shots. He never took shots that he wasn't supposed to take.  
It's tough when your big man can't score. But he tried his hardest. And then
Glen Davis and Tyrus, I mean that's going to be tough. You watch the Final
Four, man, they're going to be tough inside and we'll see if teams can slow
them down and do what they got to do against them. But it's going to be a
tough matchup come Final Four time.  
P.J. TUCKER: LaMarcus got a lot of good looks, shots that he's going to make.
Most of the time he's going to make those. He got a lot of good looks, 10, 15
feet. And got some real close shots and he just missed them.  
The night before everybody was all behind over him when he was making them.
But you're going to have nights. Great players have off nights. He kept
playing, he never cried, everybody just kept playing. Nobody on our team shot
great. But they played great defense too. So you just got to keep playing the
game. It ain't going to go your way every time.  
Q. P.J., one, could I ask you about injuring your hand, and what effect that
had, and two, the sequence where you missed the front end of the one-and-one
and then Davis hits that off balance, turn around jumper right after that, I
believe.  
P.J. TUCKER: Those are two big plays in the game. My hand, nothing to do with
it. If I'm in the game, I'm playing. There's no excuse for nothing. So my hand
had no affect on anything. I'm not going to sit up here and make excuses about
anything. But that was a big change in the game when I missed the one-and-one
and they came down and scored.  
But even after that we still made plays and made it to overtime. But we just
didn't come out and play our basketball in overtime. So with all that being
said, we still had great opportunities to win the game, we just didn't max out
on them.  
Q. For P.J., just talk about the future of this team. Obviously you guys
have shown you have got a lot of young, up-and-coming talent and obviously
you're going to miss Brad and K.P., but just talk about the talent coming back
next year.  
P.J. TUCKER: We got guys, man, I mean, I think that we got guys coming back,
we got coaches that do a great job recruiting, we got a lot of good kids
coming in, great class next year. But we're going to go back and work like we
always do in the off season. We're going to start working as soon as we get
back, like we always do. So we're just going to prepare for next year now and
just get ready.  
Q. Brad, I don't know at what point you went and switched with LaMarcus on
Glen Davis and I think y'all decided to double him a little bit more late in
the game, right?  
BRAD BUCKMAN: Our guys did a great job helping out. He's a load down there so
we need some help. We felt like that the guards could come down and try to
strip the ball and they did a couple times.  
Q. Brad, can you just talk about what -- your performance today, you've been
struggling here of late, but you got off to a great start and had a good
performance today.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: Well, my performance would be a lot better if we came up with a
W. But, I mean, I thought I played okay. It's never great when you don't win.
I don't know what to say, man. I don't -- I just -- I'm going to -- it's hard
to talk right now. I've been thinking about too many things. So I think I
played okay.  
Q. Brad, what did you think of playing against Tyrus Thomas, just what kind
of athlete you felt he was or have you played somebody like that?  
BRAD BUCKMAN: He's a tremendous athlete, just for being a freshman he's got a
huge upside. And he's aggressive, he can rebound the ball, and he is going to
be good, man, he's going to be real good. So it was a good matchup.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. We'll excuse our student-athletes. Questions for Coach._  
Q. Was this as good a defensive padlock you've seen put on LaMarcus? And
generally how much does it throw your team offense off when he has this kind
of a game?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I told -- and I talked about this coming in, I thought
defensively they were an outstanding team coming in. And people are going to
talk about LaMarcus, but I thought where they do an unbelievable job with
perimeter defense. We were trying to work different angles, trying to get our
perimeter guys involved and they're very much underrated. You go back to the
Duke game and the job that they worked on J.J. Redick, I mean, everybody's
going to look at their shot blocking ability and we blocked seven shots today
too and they blocked seven.  
But it's not just their inside defense, I mean, obviously Big Baby, he's a --
that's a tough matchup for LaMarcus. I mean, the thing that I wanted LaMarcus
to do was to try to get a little bit deeper post-up so he could get up over
the top of him. And then we tried to work inside out and tried to get movement
with our perimeter guys. They did a great job of fighting through screens,
getting there, being there on the catch, and really they turned in an
outstanding defensive effort. Both inside and out.  
Q. The way you guarded Glen Davis, it was mostly LaMarcus most of the game
and you went to Brad late in the game and you doubled him some I guess with
Kenton, right, I was just curious what all you considered defending him. If
you felt like you should have doubled him earlier?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We were choking it in there early too, you know. I look at
it, it's a tie game and we -- you know, I mean, again, they're going to score
some points. He made some tough shots too now. You go back and look, LaMarcus
had five blocks and they were probably -- I don't know how many shots he
missed, he was 11 for 19. I would image and LaMarcus blocked three or four of
those shots. But we were trying to really help off getting Kenton down there,
against the zone. We were trying to really work hard inside of trying not to
allow them to work the paint area. But they have done it all year. They don't
-- you know, their three-point shooting is something they're not going to --
tonight they took 18 of them, but they work hard at working that area of the
floor because of the fact that they have got the athletes, and if you help too
much, if you come in there and you do try to help and then he shoots the ball,
which he normally does, it's hard to get the back of the board covered on the
back side because of their athletic ability.  
But, yeah, we were trying to double, trying to get as much help down there as
we could without giving up position to give the offensive rebounds, to give up
offensive rebounds.  
Q. Davis' three pointer in overtime, that put them up seven. How big a back-
breaker was that?  
COACH RICK BARNES: It was a big one. Obviously he hasn't made many this year,
I think he's taken what, 21 or so this year and but he shot the ball well. He
made a tough -- another couple tough shots and that's what you're going to
need this time of year, somebody against -- you know, that can go get you a
shot against pretty good defense. And he draws a lot of attention. He's got a
great touch around the basket. He's physical. He can take a hit. And he can
still score after a hit. But and he's a good -- he has skills. I talked about
that yesterday, it's his skills that really impresses you, the way he passes
the ball and handles the ball and he'll shoot it, even if you have two or
three people around, he still feels he has the ability to go score it and he
does a pretty good job.  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about that drought you guys had at the start of
overtime.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we were trying to run the same action we had been
running when we really tied the game up when we were really trying to get P.J.
isolated. And we just didn't execute it. We didn't handle it the way we needed
to. And we allowed them early, the very first possession, they went down and
scored, we came back and we just didn't execute.  
I could break it down a couple different ways, but like I told the team in the
locker room, we -- no one single guy cost us this game today. We won as a team
all year and we lost today as a team. And really the credit should go to LSU,
because when the game was in doubt, they made the plays they needed to make
and we didn't.  
Q. Can you say something about how young LSU is, how impressed were you at
how well they were able to perform being so young?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know if young -- youth has anything to do with it.
What impressed me about it was their athleticism. I mean they're an extremely
athletic team. Glen Davis, regardless of his age, physically he's well
advanced. They -- again, I don't know youth has anything to do with it this
time of year. They played in a really good league and they have been in big
games.  
You go back and look, they have had a great year, they went into Morgantown,
West Virginia and won a game. I think they played Connecticut pretty close.
They're an outstanding team and they played in a tremendous league.  
But, again, I think when that -- when they go out there and play, I don't
think youth has a lot to do with it, because I think these guys get exposed to
so much early and I could talk about our youth too, but I don't look at our
guys as being that young right now.  
Q. What kind of chance do you think LSU has in the Final Four?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think they have got as good a chance as anybody. I think
if you get to this point any team that's playing right now has got a chance.
Because we know in one game -- 40 minute game, anything can happen. And again,
you go back and look at their year, they have had a great year. So absolutely
they do and whoever the other teams advance there, they will all have a
chance.  
Q. Do you feel like you milked about everything you could out of this team?
I know it was good enough to get to the Final Four but with Brad and Daniel
struggling a little bit and Kenton's knee, do you feel like you pretty much
maximized this team?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Like I told our guys, we're disappointed, you know, we
really are disappointed because we wanted to get back and have a chance like
every team that was in this tournament, but I'm proud of this team. I really
am. I'm proud of what Brad and Kenton have done in their four years and you
look at 30 wins and the most in school history and like I told the team, we're
all disappointed right now, but a couple days we'll look back and we'll
reflect and I think we'll appreciate more what Kenton Paulino has done in his
career and certainly Brad Buckman.  
And so I don't know, I mean, we'll always look back and question this or
question that, but right now there's no doubt this team has had a great year
and I've enjoyed coaching them. Because they haven't given me any problem, we
have had a happy locker room all year. I watched guys improve and get better
and we'll do just like every team now, we'll get back and get back into our
what we need to do and we'll try to work hard at trying to put ourselves back
in position to get back here again.  
Q. Did Kenton hurt his knee in Thursday's game or has that been coming on or
a chronic thing?  
COACH RICK BARNES: He actually hurt it in the Kansas game in the Big-12
championship game. They had a player that rolled up on him and then he hurt it
again in the I want to say the NC State game. And he went in for the layup
tonight on the way he had a breakaway, he hurt it again a little bit. But it's
been -- it started hurting him in the Kansas game.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. We'll conclude that. Thank you very much, Coach Barnes._  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
_MODERATOR: We have Coach Brady, and players here. We'll start with an opening
statement from the coach._  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I can't wait to see where this goes with this crew.
We're excited about where we are and looking forward to the game tomorrow
night. I think they're extremely talented athletically. I think they mirror us
in some ways. Some of the things we like to do, they do. So sometimes when
we're watching tape of them, we're similar in some areas. So I think it may be
a case of which team can do what they do the best for the longest period of
time will have an opportunity to win that game. They're well coached.  
But I was proud of our team last night and one of the things that I told the
guys coming in here, only thing -- I don't dislike this press conference, I
really enjoy it, because it's better than not having one when you're going
home. But we're going to have to talk about the Duke game again. I know we'll
have some questions about last night and I would just as soon move on and
leave that game where it was. Because that does no good for us to keep talking
about it.  
But this is an obligation we have and we will cooperate in any way that we
need to. But I told our guys, answer any questions about whatever they ask
you, but remember when we walk out of this room, last night's over. And we
need to give all of our attention to Texas and understand the next game is the
most important game and that's tomorrow afternoon or tomorrow evening.  
_MODERATOR: Questions for Coach or players._  
Q. I have nothing to ask about Duke. But this is a question for Coach and
for the several players who are from Baton Rouge. Is there an extra feeling of
satisfaction that you've put this team together from so many local guys and
for the guys who are from Baton Rouge, what made you stay home to play for
LSU?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, that's a great question. I think -- and I think when
you see Tasmin Mitchell here from Denham Springs that's ten miles down the
road, and Darrel is 45 miles in St. Martinville, so I think it's unique in
college basketball to have a starting five -- and then Darnell Lazare from
Baton Rouge comes off the bench and I think it's unique. Maybe not as unique
as it would be for New York City or Chicago where you have millions of people
in a small area. We don't have millions of people in our state.  
So I think to have this type of team and the quality of the players that we
have from the area, from the city and 50 miles around the city, our top six
players, is unique. These guys grew up together. Garrett and Glen and Tyrus
and Tasmin have known each other and played against each other all of their
lives, really. And Darnell Lazare is in that group too as a junior. And they
have their own way of communicating, their own language, that I'm not privy
to, and their own way of doing things. And they're great to be around. And I
would say that, I don't say that because they're here, and I hate to see that
in front of them sometimes, because I want them to stay humble and hungry. But
they have helped me be a better coach. Not because they're talented players,
but because of their approach to the game and approach to one another and
their response to me. There's been many times in coming off of the floor when
things aren't going as well as we would have liked, where Glen or Tasmin come
off the bench or Garrett and say, Okay, coach, be positive, we know, we know,
be positive. And that's good stuff. Because I've had a tendency to fly off and
be confrontational at times. And this group has helped me approach it better.
They may be laughing, but it's the truth. And I appreciate that from these
guys.  
GARRETT TEMPLE: Oh, you know, my thoughts? Oh, I guess it is a little more
special than the usual because we are all from Baton Rouge. Me, having known
Tyrus since we were about four years old and I knew Glen since the age of nine
or ten, and I been battling with Tasmin since 12, you know. And I guess it is
a little more special than usual. But we're just another college basketball
team trying to win.  
TYRUS THOMAS: You know, like Garrett said, we have been knowing each other
since we were four and Glen, since we were ten, Tasmin. I think they knew
Tasmin a little bit before me. But it's just -- it's good to have local guys
playing at the college level together. It draws a great fan base and a great
camaraderie with the team that we have. So I'm just happy to be playing. We're
just trying to win games.  
GLEN DAVIS: It's a great feeling to play with guys you know and guys you
already have established a relationship with off the court also. I'm so sorry.
I was distracted from a teammate. See like that. Stuff like that, it's just
some things that you can't teach that. You can't. You just got to have that.
It's just an understanding that we have. Not just coming from the same city,
it's because we know each other and we enjoy each other's presence and it make
as good feeling when we can all be from the same city and same state and come
here and compete on a national level. It makes it even better. So it's a great
feeling to be at one and to share this with these guys.  
Q. Follow-up question to that is, do you think that some is made too much of
the fact that these guys have known each other for so long, is it really such
a huge benefit on the court and conversely, is there any negative of having
guys that have known each other for so many years, they're so tight, trying to
mix them in with other players?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I don't think so. To answer your second question first,
Magnum Rolle, they have been great with him and he's from the Bahamas, and Ben
Voogd from Oregon, he's mixed in well. And this isn't something that we
planned, it just happened that all of these players came along at this
particular time. It's a circumstance that I had no control over. But with
Butch Pierre, who has known all of these guys forever, recruited them and I
helped a little bit and we did have to work -- there was nothing taken for
granted. All these guys were recruited by everybody in the country and I think
we did a nice recruiting job on them.  
And we did have the advantage of them wanting to stay home and play. And
knowing what they could do collectively and the statement that they could
make, I think it is an advantage. Particularly when you have tough times.
Anybody can get along with things are going great. But the test of true
friendship and concern and care for one another is when have you difficult
times. And we have had some of those.  
But we have always tried to remain positive this year with one another and
with this team to get ourselves through those early bumps, when we gave away a
couple of games against quality competition. We kind of gave them away. But we
were able to work through all of that. And to get to this point I think it
shows the character of the team, but I think it also shows the concern that
this team has for each other. And I think that the base of it is from these
guys knowing each other for as long as they have.  
Q. I understand your desire to move on from yesterday's game, you guys made
such a big deal out of wanting to beat Duke and having that opportunity, are
you at all concerned that it's going to be difficult to turn the page as
quickly as you have to do it? How do you do that?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I thought that -- I talked to someone last night after
the game they said what's your biggest challenge, I said the biggest challenge
for us right now is to calm our team down, get them back to the hotel, settle
them down and get some rest. And worry about our preparation for Texas today.  
And our team did well. We had a meal in the hotel last night, we talked a
little bit at the meal. They went straight to their rooms. We had no family,
no friends up there. We had we had the floor monitored and we brought a campus
security officer with us and our strength coach, they monitored the floor. And
our players controlled themselves pretty well. And I think they're focused on
tomorrow's game. I think they feel good about what they were able to do last
night and how they did it, not only -- it wasn't a fluke where we hit a shot
from half court to win the game. It was a 40 minute complete defensive effort
that our team gave.  
They feel good about that and hopefully that gives them more confidence going
into a game tomorrow.  
They know that the game tomorrow is a chance to go to the Final Four. One more
win, you're in the Final Four. And I told Darrel Mitchell today at the workout
this morning, that we just completed, I said, Darrel, let's go win, win one
more. And Darrel Mitchell said, let's go win three more. So I think the
planning ahead is there and I think our team's responded to that pretty well
right now.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the defensive adjustments you made from the
Iona game going through a zone, forcing them to shoot three pointers to the
Texas A &M game and now to Duke? Just three different adjustments and how
defense has really kind of helped you guys ride this win streak?   
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I think that we're basically a man to man defensive
team that puts a premium on rebounding the ball. I think that's always how
I've tried to build every team that I've ever had, regardless of its talent
level or its -- or the things that it can do well in terms of scoring the ball
or driving it, whatever the case may be offensively. But Iona presented a
different challenge because their two guards combined for almost 50 points a
game. And although they shot a good percentage from the three point line, they
didn't shoot a lot of three pointers. So our attitude particularly the second
half was to take away their penetration and let them shoot some threes and
when we went to a zone in that game it really kind of helped us out.  
After we got a little lead we went to a zone and made them shoot balls over
us. Which helped us, it took away their dribble penetration and changed the
game. Texas A&M, there was nothing tricky about Texas A&M, what they run is
pretty simple, straightforward kind of basketball team, but extremely well
disciplined defensively, very, very tough for 40 minutes. That was a good
preparation game for us coming into the Duke game because of the defense that
Texas A&M played, the overplay, the denials, the physicalness of it. And Duke
likes to cover and get out on first and second pass. So it was a good
preparation game for us, playing A&M coming into Duke.  
Duke presented a pretty straightforward challenge too, because you had J.J.
Redick and Williams, making and shooting over half their free throws, free
throw attempts, making and shooting over half their field goals, averaging
over half of the points that the team scores. So it's like I said earlier,
doesn't take a mathematician to figure out, if you slow both those guys down
or stop one or whatever the case may be, you may enhance your chances to win
the game. And that was our plan. To not let J.J. Redick shoot any ball in
rhythm. I can only remember one rhythm three that he made and it was in the
second half and I'm not singling out Tyrus, because without Tyrus Thomas we
certainly wouldn't have been able to win the game. It was a down screen on
Garrett and I know Garrett remembers it, he got hung up and Tyrus was laying
off of his screener, and he broke free and shot it in rhythm and he made it.
And when you let Redick shoot in rhythm, it's in every time.  
And our rule was, if we're in doubt, defender leave the screener and both of
you run at Redick and leave the other guy open. And we didn't do that and he
made it. But I -- but that's the only one that I can remember off the top of
my head where we didn't double J.J. on every ball screen or hedge him big or
help Garrett every way we possibly could to keep him off a rhythm of scoring.
But still, even tomorrow's game against Texas is still -- it's a base defense
of solid, aggressive, man to man defense that doesn't foul carelessly or
needlessly. And that's what we try to do is defend aggressively without
fouling. And there's a discipline that comes with that. And I think our team
has shown it in this tournament to this point.  
Q. Darrel, Coach talked about it a while ago how he's less confrontational
than he used to be and so forth. You being the only senior on the team how
have you seen him change in four years and can you kind of lets us know what
makes him a good coach? Maybe something that we don't get to see or know
about?  
DARREL MITCHELL: He's made a drastic change since my freshman year. My
freshman year he was a tough cookie, you know. He would say things you
wouldn't expect him to say and with me playing for my dad, he was a different,
it was different out look for me. So I would just sit back and watch him and
laugh and sometimes and I didn't think he would like that, but he would get on
me and I was so used to playing for my dad and I think it would kind of -- it
would kind of get on him a little bit because it didn't bother me. Because he
was used to guys getting pissed off and stuff.  
But with this team, he had to have his patience. I think he did a tremendous
job with being patient with these young guys and working with them from day
one and I think that with him being patient that it let guys show that he does
wants us to have a great season and he wants us to do special things.  
For him to be that calm with a lot of young guys, it just shows the respect he
had for us and the respect he had for the other coaches. But from my first
year, to my second year, to my third year to this year, he's improved each and
every year. He's done a tremendous job with us this season and I'm real proud
of him.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I need a hanky.  
(Laughter.)  
DARREL MITCHELL: But he has made a drastic change from my first year.  
Q. Coach or Glen, I'll give Coach a chance to pass the hanky down. Can you
talk about what Darrel has meant both on and off the court this year?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: This sounds like the banquet material. The only senior on
the team, I credit Darrel Mitchell, the way he is, by the way he was raised. I
can't eliminate his mother and father and the close knit family that he has in
St. Martinville Louisiana. That's what Darrel Mitchell is. He's a family guy,
he understands team, he understands sharing, he understands getting along, he
understands you can't always have your way. That's been instilled in him since
he was growing up in St. Martinville. He had a tremendous benefit that a lot
of young people don't have, his father was his high school coach.  
So not only did he get it on the practice floor, he took it home and he heard
it in the kitchen and in the den and in the bedroom, he was around it all the
time.  
The character that he brings to the team is as important for this particular
team as his talent. We have asked Darrel Mitchell to play the point this year
when he's had really been a three year two guard who ran around receiving
screens and without the ball. Now he's learned how to score with the ball in
his hands the majority of the time.  
So he's had to change his approach his senior year, he's handled it
beautifully, he's responded just like we thought he would as a mature senior.
He's provided great leadership as a senior. And I know our players respect him
a great deal. Certainly we will never be able to replace him on this team next
year.  
And other teams, to Darrel's credit, have tried to take him out. Duke last
night, we inbound the ball, they put two people on Darrel and not let him get
the ball and Garrett and Tasmin brought it up a few times. Which was very
critical for us in that game. But Darrel handles it the way he handles
everything, he doesn't get too excited, he doesn't get too down when it's not
going his way, or when it is going his way he handles everything on a level
even keel. And I'm a better coach for having had the opportunity to coach him.  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the importance of bench play and
production and particularly what you got against Duke with Darnell and Magnum
coming off the bench and their contributions?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, Darnell Lazare is as valuable to our team as any one
of these guys sitting here. Without Darnell's play off bench and his play
positive attitude about coming off the bench and his leadership that he
provides as a junior, we certainly wouldn't have been able to have the success
that we have had.  
I also said this about make Magnum Rolle, he's on the same path as Tyrus
Thomas. The difference is we didn't notice Tyrus Thomas last year, I say we,
you know, the fans and the media, because he redshirt Ted and he didn't play.
We noticed Magnum Rolle because he's playing 10 or 12 minutes a game, but
certainly that the improvement and the ascending rise as a player Magnum's on
the same path as Tyrus. Things you can't rush with young players is strength
and weight gain.  
Magnum didn't have the benefit of coming in in the summertime, he didn't get
to our campus until school started at the end of August. But this spring and
this summer Magnum Rolle will put 15 to 18 pounds on his frame, and he will be
the same type of exciting, explosive player that Tyrus has been for us this
year when he shows up and puts on a uniform again next year.  
Q. Coach, two questions, do you expect a bunch of 2-3 zone from Texas, and
can you tell us an interesting story about Tyrus Thomas for those of us who
haven't had the chance to cover him?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I think Texas will play man and zone against us. I think
when Texas plays exclusive zone, you know, some early times in the season,
when I don't think they feel -- they were feeling like their man was as good
as it needed to be, but since that time their man defense has certainly
improved and they played majority of man I think lately in the last several
games.  
But they're going to play us some zone. And we are expecting them to do that.
I don't think there's any question. It's a long zone with some athletes that
are quick and rangey and they have length that we have to negotiate with.  
Tyrus Thomas, you know, I'm asked that about several players and when I'm put
on the spot I can't remember much. But I know this: I will say this about
Tyrus Thomas, when he came to LSU, and I'm not trying to embarrass him in any
way because I think he's the greatest, but when he came to LSU, when he came
on our campus, he was a little suspicious about a lot of things. You got to
prove to Tyrus a little bit that you're for real. He doesn't just walk up to
you and embrace you, you got to proffer yourself to him. And after he was at
LSU for awhile and went through the academic center and met the people there
and got to working with them on a daily basis, got around me on a daily base,
our assistants on a daily basis, he accepted and he found out that we really
cared about his development and he's just blossomed since then.  
He's relaxed, he doesn't walk around hesitant or suspicious of anyone. He
knows we're all there to try to make him a better person, a better basketball
player. And I want him to achieve every goal that he has set for himself. And
we have provided an environment for him now to grow and flourish in and I
think that's what you're seeing now is a player and as a young more maturing
young person.  
TYRUS THOMAS: I need a hanky now.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Question for you, Coach, and then one for all of the players. First,
their inherent chemistry edge from having played together for so long, that's
a positive, how much do you think that particular positive compensates for the
negative of them being perhaps the youngest team in the NCAA tournament now?
And for the players, how much -- how many of you are still influenced strongly
by going through the adversity of Hurricane Katrina?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: It's like I said earlier, I think the care that these guys
and concern that they have for one another because of how long they have known
each other and known each other's families and their backgrounds, I think all
of that make as difference. Particularly in adverse times. And we hit a couple
of those early in the season. We have picked each other up, we picked up each
other out of that and I think our team has benefited from that. I was asked
earlier about -- there are some drawbacks being from Baton Rouge and everybody
knowing you and they watch you play. Tyrus had a poor game one time early in
the year and I called him on the phone and asked him how he was doing and just
to check on him after the game, wanted to make sure he was okay, that he
didn't jump off the Mississippi River bridge, you know, because we have a
tendency to do that sometimes. And he said, wow, Coach, he said everybody's a
basketball coach. And I told him, I said, you're right. And being from Baton
Rouge, they all can tell you what you should have done or what you could have
done or what the coach should have done or how the coach isn't doing you
right. And I said what we need to do is trust each other and listen to one
another and everybody else can move along.  
And those are things that you have to deal with being local from Baton Rouge
or Denham Springs, because you can't escape it. All your friends, your
parents, everyone can tell you what you should have, could have, would have,
and they can also tell them what the coach should have done. So it's something
that we have to deal with. I think because of their friendship and their trust
in one another and I'm thankful for their belief in me and our other coaches
on the coaching staff, that it's worked out in a positive way for us this
year.  
TYRUS THOMAS: Oh, Katrina didn't directly me or any of my family. I don't
think it did the team as well. Although we helped out on at the P-MAC when the
evacuees came through. And I think that was one of the times that the team
began to really pull together because we realized that at any point that could
have been our campus that was hit. And we helped out and a couple of us shared
tears and we just pulled together a lot after that. And it was an eye opening
experience for us.  
DARREL MITCHELL: Well, like Tyrus said, it didn't directly affect any of my
family, but I had a couple of friends from up there and it was pretty
emotional for them. But like he said, we helped out with some of the evacuees
and I think it did bring our team together and made us realize that we are in
a good position and we can't take any regrets for anything that we have done,
because like he said, anything could happen.  
But I think that really it did bring us closer together and made us realize
that at any given time point in the day something could happen to you and for
us to be together at that point in time, we was with each other that whole
time. We were off of school, we pretty much hung around each other every day
during that time. So I think it did bring us together.  
GARRETT TEMPLE: Along with what they said, it didn't really affect me
personally, but I had a couple of family members from New Orleans that moved
in with my mom and my dad. And I stayed with them a couple of times. My lights
and stuff went out. I actually stayed at Darrel's and Darnell's apartment for
a couple of days when my lights went out at my house. But like Tyrus said, and
Darrel said, we went out and helped out at the center for a couple of days and
I saw some things that you really wouldn't experience anywhere else. And it
was a very eye opening experience for us and it brought us together.  
TASMIN MITCHELL: Well that was a bad experience, but it really allowed us to
come together as a team as we went over there. And we helped at the center
like we say. We went and helped and we saw some things that we never seen
before. And we really thought that we were really grateful for not being in
the midst of that and that it really skipped over us. But during that
particular time it really brought us together and like I said, we was all
together eating together and all that stuff. So it really brought us together.  
GLEN DAVIS: It really touched me from a mental aspect as far as my purpose in
life to sit there and see a patient sitting there and everything they went
through. So me being there and through the midst of all of that they still
know who I am at this present moment. They're still enlightened about my
presence, so that kind of showed me on what kind of impact I had on people and
basically what's my purpose in life, to portray a positive and a good image
for those who, in the event, you know, to rely on and for me to for me it's
basketball. So it really changed my life and gave me a purpose to strive for
and something to look for and to also to help others.  
_MODERATOR: We'll excuse our student-athletes to the breakout rooms and we'll
continue with Coach Brady. Questions for Coach?_  
Q. I was going to ask you about all the Baton Rouge boys, you said they have
this way of communicating that you're not really privy to. What do you mean,
is it hand signals? Is it words you hadn't heard before? Is it body
language?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, it's all of that, really. A few weeks ago or, I don't
know, a couple of weeks ago we were in the locker room, or they were in the
locker room and I thought they were angry at one another. I thought that we
were about to have some kind of meltdown, for what reason I had no idea.  
So I walked in the locker room and I said, hey, hey, guys, knock all that off.
And they looked at me and said, what do you mean? I said, knock that off guys,
what you all are doing. He says, oh, Coach, we have been doing this since we
were kids, you don't know what you're talking about. I said, okay. Then they
started laughing. So I said, okay, maybe, I don't. So I left.  
Whatever that means, I mean that's the way to communicate that I don't know
what they're talking about. I thought they were angry and about to have a
meltdown in the locker room. So I went in there to try to stop something and
get to the bottom of it and there was nothing to do. I was intruding on their
conversation.  
Q. They were raising their voices or?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was -- it was an argument. I thought it
was an argument. But it was just the way they like to debate with one another
and I just didn't like it. I thought it was negativity going on. And I wanted
to keep everything kind of positive because our team was flowing pretty good
at the moment. And so I just excused myself and went on about my business and
we came out to practice and everything was fine.  
But I will say this. Let me say this about that. I was telling somebody
earlier, if I ever want to have the practice really meltdown into a
competitive angry practice, sometimes you need to let your team get
uncomfortable with where it is. And you need to shake it up every now and
then. If I put Glen Davis and Tyrus Thomas on an opposing team, as close as
they are, it becomes like two brothers in a fist fight. Our practice goes
straight to meltdown mode. It becomes serious because as friendly as they are,
when they play against one another, they become that competitive. And we
hadn't done that in a while. Because we hadn't needed to, because Tyrus had
been injured and all.  
But when I really want to get their attention and have the practice breakdown
to where it was just not a lot of -- not anything but a real competitive sort
of practice where the players really wanted to win, split those two up and
balance out the teams, then it was on. And I think that relates to how close
they are. Even though they're friends, they're extremely competitive with one
another. And I think when they play together, it shows on the court.  
Q. Two part question. How hard is it to get incoming freshmen to play
defense, the college brand of defense, that you want them to play? And given
what y'all did last night, do you feel that it validated what you've been
trying to teach basing what you teach on defense first? What happened last
night did.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I don't think we all of a sudden became a good
defensive team last night. I think that it's like I answered the question last
night, I think that if anybody -- not a lot of people have followed my career
at LSU, but the ones that have, I think that's always been a staple of our
team, defending and rebounding. And I think we were on a stage last night
where everybody got -- they took notice of what we did against the number one
ranked team in America against a player like J.J. that will probably be the
most outstanding player in the United States this year. And we were able to
hold him to probably his worst scoring night of his career at Duke. And that's
pretty significant.  
And it's nothing that we wouldn't have done in the SEC against someone else,
it just never does get the recognition. And it's like anything else, sometimes
you're fortunate when you have the opportunity to show what you can do,
sometimes it works. Last night it worked. I feel fortunate for it to have
worked last night in the stage that we were on.  
But it's an approach that we have always used and it's nothing that really
shocked our team in terms of the plan for how we were going to guard a great
player. It was no shock to our team that the last 10 minutes of the game when
Glen had four fouls, and they threw the ball to Williams, that we had Tyrus go
double team Shelden Williams. Jim, you've seen us do that for years. But now
all of a sudden it's pretty good stuff because of the stage that it was done
on. So like Mark wrote the article about it's a validation game for John
Brady, it was not, in my mind. I had no question in my mind that everything we
had done to this point was sound, solid, good basketball, a good way to play
the game. Not the only way, but the way I thought was appropriate. And it
showed up last night with good players. There's no coach that can say it's all
about him. He is setting himself up for ridicule and failure, I think. It's
about a combination of talented athletes, which we have been able to recruit,
along with the coach getting them to do what he thinks is the best thing for
that particular collection of players.  
We were able to do it last night. And I'm, I feel good for our team and I feel
fortunate that it happened the way it did.  
Q. How hard is it to get players to play defense?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I think that you get what you emphasize as a coach.
I've always thought that. If you emphasize offense, then you're team's
probably going to play good offense. If your emphasis is rebounding, you're
probably going to rebound the ball. I really think the most difficult thing
for players to get players to do is, like I said a day or so ago, is to get
players to think defensively. Most players when they say they're going to work
on their game, they take their ball, they go in the gym and they start firing
balls at the basket. They work on their game from an offensive stand point.
What we try to do from day one when they come in to LSU is we talk about
defending, rebounding, getting in a stance, staying committed to a stance and
guarding. Our first three or four days of practice the only time we use a
basketball is for our defensive drill purpose. We never play much offense at
all. And I think that it's -- and now since I've been there for a number of
years, freshmen coming in are told by the upperclassmen, that you better
defend or you're not going to make it here. And I think that now it's kind of
a situation where freshmen know that, they know the first three or four days
of our practice every year is based on upon two and a half hours of defending
and rebounding. And we get them thinking defensively because I think by nature
I think they think offense anyway.  
Q. Did you see the shot go in last night, the Texas shot, when you were --  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Yes, I did. I was in the room.  
Q. What was your reaction? Your immediate reaction?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Wow. I thought it was going to overtime. But Rick Barnes did
a smart thing. If you reflect back to our game against A&M, Darrel Mitchell
scored, they called timeout, and we were able to set our defense to not let
A.C. Law get the ball. I had thought that if A&M would not have called timeout
they could have I know bounded the ball to A.C. Law and he could have probably
made a play on the fly and maybe they could have got a shot up to possible
beat us.  
Last night Rick Barnes did a smart thing, the ball went in, and West Virginia
is kind of jumping up and down and then they get the ball in quickly, advance
up the floor and get a decent shot, not a great shot, but a decent shot. I
thought that was a great no-call timeout in that particular situation to
attack a retreating defense as opposed to calling timeout and then West
Virginia would have been allowed to set their defense.  
But if the question is -- I had no preference on who to play, it didn't matter
to me. At this stage of the game you're going to play a good basketball team
with different characteristics of positive, of strengths of their team,
depending upon who it is, so it really didn't matter. But it was a great
finish. I thought it was going to overtime. Texas made a great shot at the end
to win it. And now we're playing the Longhorns.  
Q. Do you believe in destiny? Is there such a thing as destiny?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I don't know if I think that deep. I'm -- I don't know. I'm
so focused on the now I don't know. Dale Brown did call me this morning, and
--  
Q. That's destiny.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I don't know if that's destiny, but I'm just talking
about, he was talking about the similarities between the '86 team and our team
now and how it came through Atlanta and all those kinds of things. Almost 20
years ago to the day. That really is -- and only Dale thinks that way, I don't
think that way and he was very complimentary in the call, but I don't know
about destiny.  
I do know this: That if you don't take care of things you need to take care of
tomorrow in that game, and focus on the moment, you got no chance for another
day. To fulfill your destiny. So I think our focus is on what we have been
talking about defending and rebounding and maybe that will give us an
opportunity to fulfill the destiny, whatever it is, for this team, if we can
do those things tomorrow in that game.  
Q. Considering what Glen Davis went through, I guess, and witnessed as a
young guy growing up, with a troubled mom, is it, I mean for those of us who
don't know him and didn't see him grow up, is it surprising that he is as
bubbling and I don't know, sunny?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Positive.  
Q. Positive, uplifted, etcetera. Because some kids might have sort of
withdrawn and hidden inside themselves through all that.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: That's a difficult question to answer because I don't want
to reveal too much or sound like I'm being critical of anyone, because I'm
not. Glen Davis loves his mother and she loves him. Trust me. I know them both
well. Glen Davis's mother, if you meet her, in fact she's here, by the way,
she is as positive and as fun and you can tell exactly where Glen Davis gets
his personality, there's no question, when you're around his mom. But
everybody has their shortcomings and we all carry our different -- we all have
our crosses to bear, I guess. But Glen loves his mother and his mother loves
him tremendously. When you meet his mom and you're around her, with whatever
has gone on with her, you can tell exactly Glen, why Glen Davis is like he is.
But to Glen's credit, in the character that he has developed, I don't think he
did that on his own either. There's been a lot of other people in Glen's life
that has helped him have the outlook that he has. And he works hard at it to
this day.  
He could be, he could go another way, he has every reason to do that. But he
chooses to be this way, the way he is now, because that's produced benefits
for him. And he sees the benefit of being like he is. But it's a unique story,
and it's why I respect Glen so much. Because of what he's been through, what
he's witnessed, and all of that though has helped him be the kind of young
person that he is today. Going through what he's gone through.  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what the guys did to help people
when the hurricane hit and also has there been any sort of rally I think in
the state for your success that people said that you're kind of a beacon to
us, we have had some hard times, have you heard from anybody? Do you get any
mail like that, has that happened at all?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, our guys, they went over and they unloaded cots and
they helped with the critical care unit that was established at Assembly
Center. Glen held IV's when they were working on a patient because they didn't
have the stands to hang them on. So Glen stuck his arms out and they hung some
IV's on Glen's arms. I think they were doing a tracheotomy on someone, it was
a -- and you know, all of the players were around that sort of emergency care,
MASH unit sort of situation that they threw together. Our players stayed up
all night and most of the day doing whatever they could to help.  
The other question, the governor called me last night, governor called me last
night on the cell phone and she watched the game and she related an enormous
amount of pride she had for our team and our state because LSU is unique in
some areas -- Louisiana is a unique in a lot of areas, honestly, but LSU is
the only school in Louisiana. We have some other schools there, but the other
schools, LSU fans go to those schools, but they're really LSU fans. They're
spread out all over different little colleges and some universities, but
they're all really LSU fans. And the governor was relating to me how much
pride she has for the way we have played and that the whole nation watched the
game. And she indicated to me that Louisiana needed a positive image and we're
helping with that in some way, in our own little way. I certainly would never
sit here and say we're the flag bearer for our state now. I mean I think
that's a little taking it way out of proportion. But athletics in Louisiana,
particularly the play of our football team this year, has given people some
hope and made them a little more, have a little more pride in the fact that
they're from our state. And I think our basketball has helped do that also.
And it's an escape and it's a positive thing and for the governor to call and
indicate that to me, I know she sees it and I'm sure if she did, that's what a
lot of our fans and a lot of people of Louisiana saw too. And it's really
humbling and I'm very appreciative that they would say that about us.  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the inside matchup with Texas and I
think Randy was saying that they might compare a little bit with Florida, I
don't know what you would compare them to.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: A little bit. I don't know if they score quite as good as
Florida or I don't know if Aldridge, he probably, he may turn around and just
wear us out. But I don't know if he'll, he's as physical as Noah and Richard
and Moss and Horford, those four players at Florida are as good as anybody in
the country. And don't anybody underestimate how talented Florida is and how
easily they can score the ball. They're really good and Billy Donovan is an
outstanding coach, as is Rick Barnes, but the team tomorrow, Buckman,
Aldridge, Williams played well last night. He's playing 13 minutes a game, but
last night I thought he was awful good. Those three guys are going to create
some problems for us. Tucker is maybe a key to their team in terms of the
toughness that he brings to them. He's very good. But difficult guard for us.
I think that -- I think we're fine around the goal. I respect Texas's inside
players and the talent of their team, but I think our perimeter needs to hold
up again. And I always said this whole year, if our perimeter can hold up and
make a few baskets, then I think we'll be fine. Because around the goal we
have been consistently pretty good all year long. But Tucker's a matchup for
us that we got to be considered concern. Dan Gibson is a matchup we got to be
concerned with. And hopefully we can find a way to not let Aldridge just turn
around and shoot jump shots on us. But we can put Tyrus in there with him and
bother him, maybe even Glen to lean on him a little bit, and then make sure we
pay attention to Williams when he comes off the bench. But I don't know if
they're scoring is as spread out as the Florida team, but certainly Texas has
the quality of athlete as Florida and the quality of athlete that we do, so it
should be an interesting game and a fun game to watch.  
Q. How did you tell Darnell that he was going to be coming off the bench
again and what is it about him that enabled him to accept it and do what he
did last night?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, we started Darnell the first seven or eight games of
the year and then when we didn't start him I brought him in and explained to
him that we thought Tyrus Thomas deserved to start by the way he played, and
although Darnell didn't like it, which he shouldn't like it, he came off the
bench and handled it well. Then when Tyrus got hurt it was obvious it was the
right thing to do to have Darnell start. But when Tyrus got back and started
practicing with us, I started, we started Darnell in the SEC tournament, even
though Tyrus came off the bench those couple of games. Then when we got back
to campus, it was time to put our best players on the floor. And I didn't say
anything to Darnell this particular time, because in his mind he knew because
we came back to practice on that Monday, and I called the first five out and
Tyrus was the name I called and not Darnell and the purple jerseys came out
and Darnell put a shirt on for the white team and stepped out there and never
said a word. Never said a word. Has never even broke stride on it.  
And I have a tremendous amount of respect for him and how he's handled the
whole situation. He's great in the time outs. He's positive. When we break,
when we huddle up in practice, because Darrel Mitchell doesn't say much,
Darnell Lazare is always the guy that's telling our team what to say, what to
do, always encouraging. Last night he was great during the game when he was in
the game, when he was out of the game, the second half. And he's handled it
extremely well and that's why he'll always be a special guy to me. Guys who
start all the time don't need any help too much. Because they know what's
going to happen with them. The guys that come off your bench are the guys that
need to be talked to from time to time and be encouraged that their important
to the team. And he knows that. And he has a comfort zone in that and I
appreciate that in him.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. That will do it. Thank you very much, Coach._

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
_MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas Longhorns and their coach. We'll have
Coach give just a brief overview and then open up to questions to student-
athletes and Coach._  
COACH RICK BARNES: We realize tomorrow's opponent is much different than what
we played up to this point in the NCAA tournament. We really played three
teams that have ran more of a spread type offense. More of a bit control
oriented where LSU is a very athletic, strong, physical team. Excellent in the
open court. A team that I thought last night their defense was outstanding.
And as you go back and watch them, the success they have had this year and the
way they play, they're a very tough opponent to play against.  
Certainly we realize that we're going to have to play great basketball to give
ourselves a chance.  
_MODERATOR: Questions?_  
Q. Coach, is there a process that a program has to go through over time to
sort of imprint itself on the college basketball world, and that includes
everything from fans to the media, to the players, who say, I want to go to
that program because they're always there? And is it a time consuming thing
you have to go through and is Texas there now?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, I do think that to be a program that every year if
you want to be in, everyone comes out with their preseason top 10 pick and you
want to be one of those teams that every year that they say well, Texas, the
programs over the years, the Dukes, the North Carolinas, the Kentuckys, and
reason those schools are always mentioned is because they have been great for
a long time. And it is consistency.  
To be in that neighborhood you can't be a won-and-done-type thing. And I am
proud of the consistency that we have had with our program over a long period
of time now and certainly the players have -- are the reason for that
happening. We know what we're chasing, and but the fact is that the last
couple years where we have been with our program -- and we will never take for
granted being in this tournament, we won't. But once you get in it, we know
what we're playing for.  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about P.J., his development as a player,
and what he has meant to the team this season in particular?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think a lot of watching him from the first time I met him
when I walked into his house in North Carolina a couple years ago and how far
he's come, and when you recruit, there's a lot of things that you try to look
and see and but there's some things you just don't know until you spend time
with the person day in and day out.  
Over the course of the last three years, I don't think anyone has an idea what
P.J. is about. My college roommate probably said it best when I called him
back then and I said, what do you know about P.J. Tucker? He said, I can tell
you this, I never seen a kid work harder from the time he walks in the court,
whether it's in the morning with drills, playing games, he said I never seen
him not play hard. He's got so much passion, he said, I can't believe that
everybody in the country is not recruiting him.  
But once he got to Texas and we knew we were going to work with him and we
have actually recruited him because we felt like when you get to the NCAA
tournament, you need an undersized postman to help you because when you play
against certain teams you need to do that. And we didn't know that we were
getting a guy that had the ability to pass the ball like he does, you never
know in terms of the competitive level what you're going to get.  
And his work ethic. I mean I don't -- it's tremendous what he's done. And what
he went through a year ago, I can I think he grew from it, I think it was a --
he'll look back one day and realize it was probably a real turning point. He's
handled everything. And one of his strongest suits is he's stubborn, which I
think good players are. I think people that are successful -- but yet he'll,
he's learned to bend and he's learned to grow. And that's what he's done over
the last, really, a lot over the last year.  
Q. For Brad and P.J., could you guys talk a bit about Mike Williams' play
last night and also like during the season what kind of things have you said
to Mike to try to keep him up? I know he's had some ups and downs this season,
but have you guys tried to do anything to keep his attitude going and that
sort of thing?  
P.J. TUCKER: Mike, there are a lot of people trying to take hits at our bench
saying our bench isn't getting productivity and we wouldn't go far because our
bench hasn't been good all year. But I think that Mike has been one of the
guys that just proved everybody wrong. Came in played hard. You think that's
the biggest thing that he does, whatever we need him to do. Play defense, play
hard, rebound, he's just been a guy that's just come off the bench and give us
energy and just play hard. So he's been a real big part of a lot of things we
have been doing here lately in terms of the tournament.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: You see him in practice, he works hard, man. He's a guy that's
going to make you better when you go out with him because he's improved a lot
over his two years here and I think just a glimpse of what he's going to be
these next two years afterwards, so.  
Q. LaMarcus, I read something along the lines of former LSU Tiger Shaquille
O'Neal had a talk with you before you came to Texas about going to college and
staying away from the pros and how much college was to him and how much he
enjoyed it. Can you tell us about that?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, during my senior year that I was playing and he came
down and he had a lunch with me and I went to the hotel in Dallas with him and
he just emphasized how much fun you have in college and how much you will miss
out on it if you didn't go to college.  
He just made the statement that you have time to develop in college whereas
when you go to the NBA, you're on this time line and if you don't meet that
time then you're out. So that was like the main thing he was just talking
about, just have fun and just take your time developing.  
Q. For LaMarcus first and then P.J., can you explain to us, not being
available both you guys at this time last year, how much extra desire and
inspiration you have now because of what happened? LaMarcus first?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I'm just real excited just to be in this position that
we're in right now. And because of last year, it hurt me to watch the game
that our players, they played their hearts out last year and it just didn't go
good for us. So I really, I was really down just because I wasn't in the game
and I couldn't help, so just being back this year I'm really excited and I'm
just trying to do everything I can to win.  
P.J. TUCKER: I think just for both of us, me and LaMarcus, to see our team
struggle with both of us out last year, we just sat on the bench and vowed to
each other that we were going to come back and make everything right. We were
going to do what we needed to do to put ourselves in a position to win a
championship.  
So just all year we just went back to that and just thought about where we
been and what we were trying to go to. So now that we are here, we're just
trying to live every moment of it. Just trying to play every possession and
win those inches, just to be able to win championships.  
Q. For Kenton and Daniel, can you talk about finally getting away from the
spread offensive teams, playing a team like LSU and maybe who they remind you
of? From teams you faced this season.  
DANIEL GIBSON: They're a different ball club than what we faced, but, yeah,
they're extremely athletic and things like that. But it's tough to make the
comparison to another team. Just because the way that they play and their
style. So but I think, yes, they're definitely a different ball club and I
think we'll prepare for them and be ready to play.  
KENTON PAULINO: They're a very athletic team. You could somewhat compare them
to Memphis just with based on athletic ability, but we're going into this game
and just preparing for them just like we prepare for any other team. They're
very good and they got very good inside play, so we'll just prepare for it.  
Q. Brad and P.J., you guys had a very tough patch in December that could
have shattered some teams when you have those back to back games that you had.
How did you guys overcome that and would you be here had maybe those games
gone differently or had you handled them differently.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: It's hard when you lose two back to back games by a pretty good
amount of points because you try to find ways to get back and improve. And as
a team we did a great job coming together and not giving up, man. A lot of
teams followed after stuff like that and secondguess themselves. And a lot of
people say we now -- the good things that happened in the before, and we took
it as a -- as a way to push forward. We knew we were better than that and we
weren't going to let that affect us at all. And we had a great core of guys
and we all stuck together and we pulled it out and we had a good nine, ten
game winning streak after that. So we pushed forward.  
P.J. TUCKER: I think the biggest thing was that we all -- the whole team and
staff, we all knew that we didn't play Texas basketball. That it wasn't even
us in those two games. We played nothing like we usually do and we knew it. So
we just have to find out why we weren't playing to our abilities and what was
going on. And it was just kind of everybody finding out their roles and what
they meant to the team and what they need to do for to us win.  
So I think once we got past that point that everybody knew what we need to do
to win, it was just working hard and trying to do it every single day, having
the consistency to do it every day. So I think every day, ever since then we
have been working at it, trying to play that perfect game or be able to win
all the chips that we want to win.  
Q. Last night obviously the country was sort of introduced to Kenton
Paulino. But you guys have known about him this whole year. I was wondering if
the coach and maybe some of the players could speak to what he's meant to the
team and you got a lot of guys with a lot of bigger names, but he's obviously
somebody that's very important to what you guys do.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, he has been important and his maturity is something
that I think that certainly from a coaching standpoint we have all knew that
we would need him this year. And I've always thought Kenton probably really
didn't give himself enough credit for how good he is. He's always been a very
smart player. He understands the way the game should be played, the way we
want to play it.  
He had to battle injuries his first couple years and even last year, but this
year he came in and has -- he's been everything that I think we always thought
he could be. He's very quiet, not a very emotional person, but yet in his own
way he's very efficient when he's on the floor, the way he goes about his
workouts he's very efficient. He gets his work done and we would not be where
we are today without Kenton Paulino.  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: He's an all-around and just a great guy. He's always called
the silent assassin because he can play a game and nobody would ever know it,
like give him any attention. But by the end of the game he got like 19 points
and like seven assists and you're like, dang, he did that?  
So, you know, I just call him the silent assassin. But I always go back to the
Duke game when we was struggling and he had like our first 12 points, I mean,
but that's what he does -- he does that for us game in and game out. So he's a
big part of our team.  
DANIEL GIBSON: Oh, yeah, definitely. K.P., as a unit, we always knew that he
was that special player and the thing about him is that he doesn't worry about
getting a lot of notoriety or a lot of publicity, he just kind of lays in the
weeds and just does it every night out. Every night out he comes out and does
the same thing. He's very consistent and he's definitely a valuable player on
this team and somebody that I really admire.  
Q. Kenton, three part question. Sorry, I apologize in advance. Number one,
how many times have you seen your shot? Number two, did you stay up any later
just so you could see it again? And number three, has it sunk in yet that
you're going to be seeing that shot the rest of your life?  
COACH RICK BARNES: First of all, he asked for four copies of it before we left
the building. And he went back and he did watch it, but he asked for a VCR to
be sent to his room too.  
(Laughter.)  
KENTON PAULINO: No, I watched the shot over and over and over again. Just it
was just soaking it all in. But it's short lived. I just tried to enjoy it for
that night because I know today, you know, we have to focus on something else.
So tomorrow we got a big game against LSU. So it's short lived. So I just try
to enjoy it as much that night as possible.  
Q. Kenton, did the president call or did you get a bunch of calls on your
cell phone?  
KENTON PAULINO: I didn't get a call from the president, but I got a lot of
calls from family members and they were happy for me. And I was happy about
that. It just feels good when family and people that want to see you do well
is happy for you.  
Q. LSU has got a unique collection of athletes, they come at you a lot of
different way, I wonder if you can talk about the specific challenges guys
like Thomas, Big Baby and Temple will provide for your offense tomorrow
night.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, last night I thought they were great defensively.
Maybe as good a defensive effort as I've seen this year. Guarding a very
talented team and a -- the way they swarmed last night. They just did a great
job using their athletic ability.  
Did a great job on J.J. Redick, there was not much separation, Duke does about
as good a job as anybody in the country running their offense. And J.J. Redick
curls tremendously. They were there, they didn't give him much at all and then
offensively, you got to understand that they know what they're looking for.
And they really realize that their athletic ability, they can -- they block
shots, they alter shots, and offensively, they get in the open court, they can
create a lot of problems.  
Q. Along those lines, LaMarcus, what do you know about Glen Davis and Tyrus
Thomas and just talk about the front court matchup, and maybe, Brad, chime in
on that as well.  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Well, we watched film and those are two great ball players.
All around. Davis, he's a great low post threat and he also can bring the ball
up and go off the dribble. So that's going to be something that we have to
look forward to. And Thomas, you know, I just seen that he was a great weak
side shot blocker. He had some amazing blocks the last game. So we want to
watch out for that. But I think that those guys, they're great ball players,
so we're going to have to come out ready to play.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: It's going to be a good match down low, man, it's -- we got two
big time front courts going at each other. So it's going to be a good battle
down low and we got to get prepared for them, like he said, Davis does a great
job getting position and scoring through you. And Tyrus is an incredible
leaper and athletic. And we got to do as much as we can to stop that and it's
going to be a team effort from all of us, and individually we got to do what
we got to do.  
Q. Coach, you guys scored a great win last night, the buzzer, LSU with a
really emotional win. Does the turnaround in this seem a little more severe
than usual even though you are playing for a trip to the Final Four?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know, last night it was obviously a good day for
both teams and we got back late last night, we ate, guys went to bed. Other
than Kenton, he stayed up calling everybody and that. Watching the VCR. He's
the one guy that can go without sleep. I guess.  
But then we got up this morning, let them sleep in and then we have watched
some tape and then we'll -- after we get through with you guys we'll go out
and do what we do as these guys mentioned, we're going to prepare for this
game like we have all year and have to get rested. I think right now that's
really important.  
But we understand, just like LSU, we all understand where we are right now.
Excitement of being in this tournament, that can carry you a long way as well.
But tomorrow, once it rolls around, we get ready to play, it will settle in to
what goes on between those lines.  
Q. I know that wisdom compels you not to look too far into the future but I
was there in Pasadena when your football team pulled the great shocker. How
much does that encourage you all? This is for the coach and the players. It's
a beautiful story being written in your athletic department. How much does the
football team's success encourage you all on this run?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, first of all, in Texas it wasn't a shocker.
(Laughter.) It was an expectation.  
I've said all along, I think that everyone that's associated with the
University of Texas and they come to Texas, whether they're an athlete or a
student, they come expecting great things to happen. We have got a great
university. We have got a great athletic director that gives us everything
that we need. I think that, and these guys can answer this, I think that
amongst the athletes on campus, we all pull for each other. I think there's a
level of excellence that we're all seeking to get to. We're proud of obviously
our football team, baseball team, swimming team, you go down the line. It's
not just those two programs. I think that -- and certainly in basketball we
know what we're chasing, but the expectations that we have for ourselves has
nothing to do with that, other than the fact that this basketball team here
came to Atlanta with the idea that we want to win two games and we can get
that done and we'll go home and regroup and try to go again.  
But we have had a great focus about ourselves all year, trying to take care of
what's right in front of us. And we know people are going to talk about Texas
and the athletic department. But we're all proud of it.  
P.J. TUCKER: Like Coach said, I think we probably put more pressure on
ourselves than anybody can ever try to put on us. So we expect ourselves to do
well and even with all the great teams we have had, at our school in football
and every other sport, I think that individually and as a team we all put
pressure on ourselves to go out and perform. So I don't think we get any extra
pressure from anybody.  
DANIEL GIBSON: Coming in, once you come into Texas, you automatically get that
feeling that you're striving for excellence and once you put on that brown and
orange, you're playing for your school. So definitely we always are proud of
the football team and other sports and every time you step out on the floor
you definitely are trying to do big things, just because, I mean, you're a
part of Texas tradition and that's tradition that's excellence.  
Q. Kenton, I was wondering, number one, do you enjoy the new-found celebrity
and spotlight you're going to have now? And number two, does that shot put you
in the same level as say Vince Young on Texas's campus?  
P.J. TUCKER: He walked into breakfast this morning with shades on.  
COACH RICK BARNES: And he actually did say Vince who?  
P.J. TUCKER: He had a new pair of shoes.  
KENTON PAULINO: You know, until we win the National Championship I don't think
anything compared to what Vince did, but you know, this new-found celebrity or
whatever you want to call it, I mean, no, I just take it for the moment. Guys
can tell you I never let anything get to my head. I forget about this as soon
as we go out there and we start shooting around and as soon as Coach starts
talking about what we have to do for LSU, it will be a memory until, until I'm
about -- until the season is over and all that stuff. But I just take it in as
it comes.  
Q. Coach, do you believe in destiny?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Ask me in a week or so and I'll tell you.  
(Laughter.) I don't know. Sometimes I think I do, sometimes I'm not sure. I
don't know. I'm not -- I haven't thought much about it. I believe that if you
work and you go about your business the way you need to every day and if you
keep focused and don't allow outside things to creep in and if you're chasing
something and if you stay with it, handle the ups and downs, I think that some
way, somehow, something good will happen. If it doesn't, you're going to learn
something from it.  
But I don't know, I don't know, I do think sometimes we -- things happen and
that's the word we use. But I haven't thought much about it just other than
trying to take care of the process we're going through right now.  
Q. Rick, there are so few great college centers anymore it seems like, can
you talk about Davis and his unique abilities at such a young age?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, the thing that really impresses you about him is his
skill level. He made a terrific play last night when he took the ball the
length of the floor, avoided a charge and picked up a -- put a blocking foul
on a Duke defender. And you got to love the way his personality -- the way he
plays and the way he carries himself. But he's a very skilled player, he's got
tremendous hands, great feet, great agility. He takes up a lot of space,
obviously. But he -- his feel for the game is something that you got to really
admire. He's a different type player than we played against. So he'll
certainly cause some problems.  
Q. Brad and Kenton, what do you remember about being in the Elite Eight the
last time you guys were in it and is there anything you would tell these guys
going into tomorrow night's game?  
BRAD BUCKMAN: The Elite Eight was unbelievable. You felt like were you a step
closer to getting to where you wanted to be. And you had to do whatever you
had to do to get there. And we had Michigan State and it was a hard battle
until the end. And it's always going to be like that.  
These games are not going to be blowouts, they're going to be close and you
got to be prepared coming down the stretch and know what you got to do, hope
it comes down to the last minutes of the game, because it going to be a drawn
out battle. It's an exciting experience and I hope we get a chance to win
again.  
KENTON PAULINO: If I had to tell the players on the team anything, I would
just tell them to enjoy this moment. Just enjoy the moment. And don't be
overhyped or -- just try to go out there and just play every game like it's
the same and just have fun and enjoy the moment. Do what you do.  
MODERATOR: We'll conclude with the student-athletes. They will go to the
breakout rooms and then we'll continue with Coach Barnes. Questions for Coach.  
Q. Mike Williams, nine points last night and LSU got a nice contribution
from Lazare off the bench. When you go to a guy putting a substitute in,
sometimes is it like, hey, if I get nine points it's kind of found money kind
of situation where you -- it just kind of bonus?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think offensively we're not asking Mike Williams to
score, we do ask him to take shots that he practices and shots that he makes.
And he did that. He's done that the last couple games.  
But what we have asked him to do when he goes out there is to really give us a
presence, to give us energy, to run down rebounds. And when I went back and
reviewed the tape last night, he made an effort every shot that went up. He
was making an effort to get to it some way, somehow. And defensively, last
night, it was a really tough matchup for both he and Brad. Because of some
foul trouble, they had to go back and matchup with Herber, which is a really
tough matchup for those guys.  
But Mike made a huge play for us last night where we were beat off transition,
off penetration out front and he came over and made a great play to stop the
penetration and recover back at that point in time of the game. And they
actually missed on the kick out and -- but, yeah, I think whatever he gives us
point-wise, I would -- you know, again, we're not looking for it, but if he
gives it to us, it's a great bonus.  
Q. Apologize for the football reference, but you know how the football
coaches carry the laminated card that tells them when to go for two after a
touchdown, do you have a laminated card, real or figurative, that tells you
when to call a timeout late in the game or when to let your guys go?  
COACH RICK BARNES: No, I would say overall that I think basketball coaches are
probably a little bit smarter than football coaches. You know. We don't have
30 seconds in between plays or whatever it is to call this, to set up a play
or that.  
But, no, I don't. During that last timeout we knew we had one and they would
have scored that basket with under three seconds we probably would have called
time. But because of where it was and I told the guys to -- if they score, to
get it in. And I didn't even want them to think about a timeout. I said if
they score -- but I knew if -- I would watch the clock and I had actually told
one of the referees that if we need a timeout, make sure you catch me here
because if it would have been under three I would have called timeout there
and tried to advance the ball to half court and we could have done that. But I
wanted them to go with it.  
But I wasn't going to call a timeout at the start of the second half. People
have asked me that, when they came out and hit two threes, I told them we were
up 12, the way we play it's a four possession game, and the way they were
shooting the three and we knew they were going to keep doing that. I told them
we were not going to flinch and at that point in time we were actually
guarding them really well, they raised up and hit two contested threes and I
couldn't tell them anything I hadn't just told them already coming out of the
locker room.  
And I don't think our guys thought I would call a timeout there. But very
seldom this year have I had to use timeouts to settle us down because most of
the time I normally probably save them more towards the end in case we need
them in special situations because our team this year is somewhat young and at
that point in time maybe use it to help them at the end of the game.  
Q. John Brady has certainly had his critics over the years, I think he's
obviously silenced a lot of them on this run. What are your impressions of
Coach Brady as a coach and anything you can share, I guess, about him?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, he works really hard. Obviously. Excellent basketball
coach. He's won everywhere he's been. He's done an out standing job at LSU.
Again, I mean this isn't the first time they have been successful. They do a
great job. You look the at his teams, they're sound. Last night -- I'm not
sure I saw a better defensive effort from anyone this year. They were
tremendous, watching that tape again last night. I think the mindset he's got
his team in and the relationship he's seems to have there is good.  
But looking from the outside in, you just got to be impressed with the fact
that they went through a league, won it, and are right here with everybody
else still playing.  
Q. I know mid-December must seem like an eternity ago, but can you talk
about the just how the team bounced back from those two games and were you
worried that despite the talent that maybe that this team might not be sitting
here today if they hadn't handled it differently?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We started the regular season, we knew we were going to be
challenged early with our schedule. We came, we won our first two games at
home and we went to Kansas City and had a game very similar to last night with
West Virginia except we were down. We were down I think as many as seven or
eight points in that game and won it on a last second play. But it was a
defensive play. LaMarcus Aldridge did it. And we turned around the next night
and played Iowa, a game that went right down to the wire as well, really. And
went home, played a few games and went to New Jersey, which is -- we knew
going it was basically he a home game for Duke, up there in the Meadowlands.  
And at that point in time everybody talking about one and two, I did not think
we were the number two ranked team in the country at that time because I
didn't think maturity-wise we were there. The game starts, what, eight nine
minutes into the game, Brad Buckman, who at that point was a huge part and he
still is, but he was playing great basketball, got hurt. So didn't play the
last 30 minutes of that game. So Mike Williams is thrust into a situation that
he's certainly at that time wasn't ready for. And we had to -- we came apart
because what we learned from that game was even when we came back in the
second half and cut the lead down to four or something like that, everybody
tried to do it by themselves. And then Kenton got hurt in that game. He
strained an abdominal muscle. We came home and had an exam period, getting
ready to play Tennessee and Brad Buckman was going to be out for three weeks,
so Kenton did not practice the entire week leading up to that game. Dan Gibson
got a concussion two days before and we had a lot of things going on. And
obviously Tennessee was a lot better than everybody thought and they came in
and played great and we were struggling and then after that we went through a
three week period where we did not practice five on five at all because we
didn't have enough people. And we broke it down and stayed in a half court and
then we won some games that we knew we were going to win.  
But I think our team was probably waiting to see because our next big game was
going to be against Memphis. And then Brad came back right after Christmas,
practiced, played his first game, came out, and you could almost feel when he
came back on the court, because he was playing great and then four minutes
into that game he turns his ankle. And then he doesn't practice anymore until
we go to play at Memphis and in the process there his grandmother died. He was
very close to her. But our guys never wavered. I think one thing when you
watch, when you get beat, whether it's by 1 or 20, you show guys -- I mean, we
always talk about what goes into winning, you have to teach young teams, and
what goes into losing. And I'm not sure our guys knew that early in the year.
But they figured it out and with the exception of one game this year, I think
our guys have had great focus and great energy and great effort.  
Q. You mentioned that one of the things you admire about P.J. is that he's
stubborn. Are you stubborn, why or why not, and are there some things that as
you mature as a coach that some of your mentors would share with you on how
you need to improve on this and you need to do this as you built the program
and as you learn how to get through the rigors of some of these big schools
you've been at?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I've been very lucky as a coach. I would say people that
know me would say I'm -- I think my players would probably tell you I'm a
little bit stubborn probably. But I've been very lucky. When I got into this
business I was fortunate to be around people at Davidson College and Eddie
Biedenbach and John Cochan, Tommy Badamarcka (phonetic), Bob McKellip who is a
coach there now who all were -- first of all, they talked about recruiting.
And so I came in knowing how important recruiting was, real quick. And then
leaving there, going to George Mason with Joe Harrington, watching him build a
program at George Mason that he was the first full-time head coach hired
there. I was the first full-time assistant. And that's why with a lot of pride
I see where George Mason is today because I spent five years there and
probably the most important five years of my coaching career.  
Because of what I was able to learn and who I was able to be around and
watched what was going on in terms of building a program there and then
leaving a year with working with Coach Sanderson who was the first guy I was
ever around at Alabama that talked about fresh legs. And knowing how to taper
-- and I remember this time of year or actually starting in early February he
would practice 40 minutes a day. And then leaving there and spending a year
with Gary Williams. The one thing I can remember with Gary was you know, he
was fearless. He would say, hey, we'll put anybody in the game and try to
steal a possession here or there and then getting a chance to go back to
George Mason and after one year going to Providence I wouldn't be where I am
today if it wasn't for Dave Gavitt being the Big East commissioner and former
basketball coach and he saved my life because I was probably over my head at
that point in time at Providence being in that league with the great coaches
that have gone through that league and I've been lucky that I've been able to
maintain a lot of those contacts and those guys still do call me after a game
and I listen to them. Because they have a different perspective not being
around it every day. And after every game I have certain people I want to talk
to and listen to what they have to say.  
But I've been very lucky with the people that have come into my life and I
will state this, I never worked for a bad athletic director. I always had good
ADs. I think that's very important. I always had people that have given me the
necessary tools to do a job and support you and understand the ups and downs
of coaching. But they're there with you. And that probably started with Jack
Zavitz, my first AD that hired me when he hired me he said we're getting in
this together and Jack helped me my first year too a lot. But once from there
going to Providence, Dave Gavitt, who has been a tremendous help to me in my
career.  
Q. In the tournament, it seems like there's so many timeouts in college
basketball it seems like almost every dribble is coached anymore. Especially
in the tournament where the stoppages last forever. Does it take some fate on
your part as a coach to say, look, I'm just going to let my guys play here
with the game on the line and maybe one of the biggest games of my career on
the line?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Not really, because we have talked -- now we worked special
situations and we talk about it. But during that -- again, just going back to
last night, we had talked about switching, we knew they were going to come
down and do something, because they're such a well-coached team. They weren't
just going to come down and raise up and shoot a quick shot. They were going
to do something. They had I think Herber driving against P.J. and get
everybody trying to look in and they kicked out and they did a little rub
screen and we were going to switch, but A.J. Abrams didn't switch out and I'm
not sure it would have mattered if he did, because of the size difference.  
But, no, we tell our players this time of the year that players make plays,
you got to make plays. And at the end, though -- and I told A.J. -- I told
P.J., get it out as quick as you can and A.J. push it and create traffic. What
we mean by that is get in there and get lost in the traffic and hope that they
help somewhere and try to -- we work daily on guys running, getting to spots
and it really -- it's -- that's our transition game. And you either do that
our know if you call timeout, one, you're going to allow them to set their
defense, which would probably be their 1-3-1, which we know that's hard to get
something out of that. But there was -- we knew what we were going to do. If
it would have been under three seconds, we probably would have called timeout.  
Q. You didn't get much from your bench in the first NCAA tournament game, is
there anything that you said to Williams and Abrams that day to challenge
them? And more generally, how have you brought them along, you said earlier
that Williams was put in a spot that he wasn't ready for early in the
season?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, Mike has continued to work. I think that the last
couple weeks, three weeks -- and sometimes as coaches, we don't know when it
clicks in. You talk and you keep going and you keep trying to come different
ways. But also I think you look at a guy like Mike Williams, he is sitting
there, he looks at Brad who has played a lot of ball for us. LaMarcus
Aldridge, P.J., and you have to admire a guy that will continue to come to
practice and Brad did mention it and Mike comes to work. And he kept working,
he kept grinding it out. And as coaches we tell our guys -- we told them and
again the guys mentioned, inches and possessions. And if we can steal an inch
there or a possession there, I thought J.D. Lewis, I told him first thing this
morning, I said, J.D. hadn't played at all and he went right in the game and
came up with a big steal for us. I said that could have been the possession,
that one inch, that one possession that we're talking about.  
But Mike has continued to work at it. I think that again I don't know why he's
different now than he was a month and a half ago, but he's comfortable. He can
shoot the ball. He's not looking to go shoot, which I think has helped him. I
think all kids, all players -- and I do think roles change throughout the
year, but I think that he was for whatever reason maybe trying to put too much
on thinking he had to score to get in the game. And he doesn't have to do
that. And last couple games he's been able to score because he's gotten lost
in playing his role. And A.J. has been a guy that has gotten better throughout
the entire year. And he's -- he had some moments early in the year, he had
some moments where he wasn't very good defensively. But his feel for game and
his confidence, I don't think that's ever wavered, but just his experience and
I think maybe even Mike, the experience they're getting throughout the year,
one is a freshman, one is a sophomore, it's probably helped both of them.  
Q. Last year the Katrina tragedy brought Texas and Louisiana together in a
very, very special way and now tomorrow there's a basketball war. Can you
speak a little bit about any rivalry that exists between Texas and LSU is it
strong and as rivalries go? How does it rank with any others you have?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know right now. We did play them I think my first
year. I think -- I want to say it was my first year we played down in Baton
Rouge and we haven't played since. They did play in a game I want to say two,
three years ago when they came to Houston and played a team and we I think we
played Seton Hall and I think they might have played Texas A&M back there, I
think. But they do have a very large population of alumni in the Houston area.  
And but in terms of -- I can't tell you when the last time the football teams
played. Again, basketball I know we -- well, no, I take that back, we got beat
by LSU I think my second year in Utah. When they had Stomile Swift, so we -- I
know we played them my first year and I think it was either my second year, it
had to be the second year. So we did play them in the NCAA tournament. And
that's the last time we played.  
So we have talked, we have been talking about the possibility of maybe having
a starting a series in Houston. Because it's again their alumni business
there, our base there, they recruit Texas heavily, as obviously as we do, but
other than that, I'm not sure I could call it a rivalry right now. Even though
we share borders.  
Q. As you prepare for LSU, how similar are you guys to each other? Is it
almost a mirror image type thing? And second part, the fact that they're so
young with so many freshman, is that a little bit tricky to gauge what you're
going to get from this them from one night to the next?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know if I can answer that and be honest with you in
terms of knowing them that well. What I'm getting from them right now is
watching tape. Watching them I don't know enough about them. Other than the
fact that I think that by now they're closer to being sophomores than freshmen
I think that they're -- at this point in time they're a talented team. They're
different and more athletic team than we are.  
But I think that, again, once you toss it up there and you get ready to play
and then last night I was really impressed with watching them play last night.
I thought defensively they were unbelievable. And I've seen Big Baby play
through the recruiting things and everyone knows what he can do.  
And the guy that I'm really impressed with is Darrel Mitchell. He's a guy that
he makes them go. He does a lot for them. And creates a lot for them. So
they're not just a one-man team. They wouldn't be here if that were the case.
A lot like us they have got guys like a Kenton Paulino that people probably
haven't written about this year and a Mike Williams, guys that can come in and
hurt you just as well.  
So we know and, again, we have talked about personnel and we try to relate
them to guys that we play against, but again, we -- it's going to be -- the
game's going to be different than what we played the last two weeks really
because of they're a much more athletic team than what we played in the last
-- especially in the last two games or three games.  
Q. Speaking of George Mason, do you have -- are there any people remaining
there whom you still are in touch with at all? And the second part is, do you
ever think how differently your career path obviously would have gone had you
gone to Charlottesville instead of staying at Providence back then?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, I do have two dear friends at George Mason. Carolyn
and Jay Marsh. Jay was the associate athletic director there still, Carolyn is
the basketball secretary. She and I worked together for the five years that
while I was an assistant and when I came back. She and I -- I can -- and
really do I consider them two of my dear he's friends and we do stay in touch.
I actually called this morning and we have talked. They have, Jay actually
left me a message this morning that Washington, D.C. has adopted the Patriots
right now and he says that they're really going through something they have
never gone through, something that I think that we all dreamed about back in
1980, I think they went Division I in '79 but '80 was the first time they
hired Joe Harrington as the first full-time head coach.  
And I'm excited. I'm really excited for them. Because that was -- and I
mentioned a huge part of my growing in this business, and in terms of the UVA
situation, I don't know, I don't know if it would have been one way or the
other what the difference would have been. I mean I grew up in that part of
the country and at that point in time wanted to coach in the Atlantic Coast
Conference and spend five years in Virginia, obviously, having a chance to go
there and even though it was only for a couple hours, you know, that's a great
university. It is.  
But I don't know, looking back, I don't know what would have been different. I
don't know. I know that staying at Providence ended up being a great thing
because it gave me more time to be around Dave Gavitt. Again, I think he --
his -- he's helped me more than he would ever know. And I think staying back
there at that point in time probably outweighed anything else at that
particular time.  
_MODERATOR: That will do it. Thank you very much, Coach._  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: First of all I congratulate LSU. They played a heck of
a game. I thought it was a very difficult game to score for both teams. It was
very physical, good defense, and there weren't a lot of open looks in that
game.  
Obviously they came up with some big plays at the end. I thought Mitchell's
three to cut it from 45-40 to 45-43 was a huge play in the game. And but
that's what that kid's done.  
He's been a terrific player for them.  
We could have a better offensive game, there's no question about it. But LSU
had a lot to do with that. Again, congratulations to them, I want to just say
that with my team, I'm proud of my team, obviously, they're 32 wins and 4
losses, and they have won championships and the two kids here have been two of
the best players I've ever coached. They have been part of 116 wins at Duke
during their four years, many championships. And although we have lost games,
they have always represented me, our program and our school and themselves in
the best possible manner.  
I'm proud of them, and I'm disappointed that we can't go on, but you got to
learn, not everyone -- you don't win all the time. You lose too. And you have
to handle losses with the dignity and class that you handle the wins. And
these kids have and again, congratulations to John and his kids on a terrific
effort.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. We have questions for J.J. and Shelden Williams and
questions for them._  
Q. J.J., there was a point in the second half when you cam out very briefly
and Mike was giving you some advice on the bench and then you went back in
quickly. Could you describe the nature of the advice and how you were trying
to work through this tonight?  
J.J. REDICK: He just told me to take 30 seconds, take a little break, and go
back in there and take my shot. Coach has always said that as long as we are
taking our shots, he's okay. He'll walk arm in arm with us off the floor. So
they didn't go today.  
Q. J.J., could you just talk about the difficulty in getting on track
offensively tonight.  
J.J. REDICK: As a team we didn't shoot the ball very well for the field. I
think that had a lot to do with LSU's defense. They really pressured the ball
when I would come off screens and try to use their longer defenders and then
it helps when they have shot blockers back there. The kid, Thomas is pretty
darn athletic and he altered a lot of shots and came up with five blocks too.  
Q. J.J., when you have that shot when you're up five, it rattles around and
goes out, are you thinking about that, that if you make that one, this would
be a lot different?  
J.J. REDICK: I mean there's a lot of ifs throughout the game. There's a couple
loose balls that we didn't come up with, that could have made a difference.
But that was definitely a big shot and the very next possession Mitchell hit a
three and cut it to two. So that was a big momentum swing. It could have gone
our way but it ended up going theirs.  
Q. I know he didn't have you the whole time but can you talk about Garrett
Temple and his defense?  
J.J. REDICK: Yeah, he's long and it was just a very physical game. So he was
physical with me as well and now I had a few looks there were pretty good.
They didn't go in, but overall, you know, he did a good job of contesting my
jump shots and when did I drive, they had shot blockers back there.  
Q. For both of you, wonder if you could just share with us your emotions.  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: Well, for me it's -- any time that you lose a game, I mean,
you feel bad about that particular incident and in this case there isn't any
redos or makeovers, so it's pretty much it for us. And it's a great deal of
disappointment, but it kind of came with the way that we lost and everything,
so I guess we both, I mean we have to look back on what we did throughout our
whole course of our careers here and remember those moments.  
J.J. REDICK: Well, I'm obviously really disappointed. And this definitely
hurts.  
The past four years have just been pretty amazing and I didn't want that to
end. And really I just, it's been such a thrill and a blessing for me to play
for Duke and to have the teammates and the coaches that I've had, I really
consider myself one of the luckiest people. That doesn't really help the pain
I'm feeling right now, but I'll be able to look back like Shelden said and be
proud of what we have accomplished.  
Q. For both players, your younger teammates in the locker room were just
saying how they hurt more for you two and for Dock and Lee than they do
themselves tonight. How does that make you feel and also, is there any kind of
sense of melancholy or unfulfillment that you didn't get a championship in the
four years?  
J.J. REDICK: Well, they're great kids and it doesn't surprise me that they
would say that. I know when I was an underclassman I felt bad when we lost my
sophomore year for Chris Duhon because I felt he deserved a national
championship. Or another one, rather.  
But they're just -- they're great kids and they have all got bright futures
and yeah, that's it.  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: I'm kind of going on what he said. Our teammates, they're a
great group of guys and it doesn't surprise me for them to say that. They have
been unselfish like that from -- during the whole course of the year. And
they're a great group of guys and I expect a lot from them in the next year
and the upcoming years.  
Q. You've reached this point of a season four times now, J.J., under I guess
difficult circumstances, how difficult, how hard is it to look at this and how
kind of -- the kind of season you had and to get to this stage and maybe not
show the J.J. Redick who has been here all season?  
J.J. REDICK: Oh, certain things are in your control and certain things are out
of your control. I'm not a great athlete and LSU has great athletes. And it
was just a very physical game and obviously I'm disappointed in the way I
played. But I've had a good year. Shelden's had a good year. We have had a
pretty outstanding year as a team. I'll be all right.  
Q. J.J., even after the Thomas did you think that made it 57-54, did you
feel like you were still going to pull it out? When did you sense that it was
that, that that was out of hope?  
J.J. REDICK: Well, we had the ball there and I think Thomas made a big block
on Greg. I think that was the possession. Greg made a good drive and Thomas
just made a heck of a play. When they got the rebound, I still felt that there
was enough time for us to, because they're not a great free throw shooting
team so I knew they would give us at least one miss and we just couldn't get
those rebounds. We did a -- you know, just, again, those are what if plays as
well.  
_MODERATOR: That will conclude it for the student-athletes. We'll excuse them
and questions for Coach._  
Q. This senior class has accomplished so much. What are your emotions that
they're leaving and that this is their last game?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, first, it's a bad night here, I can't get the
mics to work. But I thought that something was wrong there.  
For right now, for me, it's to make sure that these kids don't walk out of
here blaming themselves, and looking only at the loss. I've always said that
you want to end the season where you're cutting down the nets or you're crying
in your locker room. And our kids were all crying in our locker room. And
they, they have been a great group of kids. And led by these seniors. And this
is a team that had a lot of seniors and a lot of freshmen.  
And so it put a heavier load on those seniors and especially these two kids.
And I just thought that they were two of the best kids I've coached in my 26
years. Sean, Lee, Pat, and Ross, the other seniors, they all did a good job.
We had a great year. 32 wins, 4 losses. Championships. Finished the regular
season number one. I know we're not -- we weren't ever a dominant team. We
knew that. And so things have to go right for us to win. And tonight LSU just,
one, they -- J.J. made a good point, it's the first team we played all year
that could really block shots like that. It wasn't just their own the ball
defense or off the ball, their ability to block shots made us change some
shots inside. And I don't know if we have ever, we ever adjusted to that.  
Q. On similar occasions in the past you've described that the difficult part
of this is that it stops. You can't work with this group anymore.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah.  
Q. Is that the same tonight?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it is, but, I don't feel like crying, I feel
happy. Not that we lost, but I feel happy that I've had them. I mean how
lucky. We have been really fortunate with this group, these seniors, to have
four years like that.  
But the last 20 years, our kids have averaged a Final Four, three NCAA wins a
year, I mean they have been and incredible group these -- for me I've been
lucky. And I've been really lucky with these guys. And so I find it hard to
cry right now. I found myself saying a prayer afterwards saying, thanks. Just
thanks for letting me have this group again. And then whatever happens, you
can handle wins or losses. But the quality of people your with, that
determines the experience. And I've had a hell of an experience with these
guys. I'm a little bit surprised really that I'm feeling like this. Because --
but I just feel very lucky.  
Q. What would you blame for tonight's loss?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't blame anything, son, I'm not a blamer. I take
responsibility. I think we all could have done a little bit better job, but
the other team forces you into those situations. And the game is a game of
adjustments. And I don't think we ever completely adjusted to the physicality
of this game. And so they did. And they won and we shake their hands and
that's part of being a competitor. So there's no excuses or no blame.  
Q. Can you describe your decision to, with I think nine seconds left to pull
Shelden and J.J. out?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's an obvious decision. I mean, come on.  
Q. To honor them I'm sure?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, it's just to make sure that they get a chance and
for our fans and not just our fans, but basketball fans at that moment to say
thanks. And for me to do that, that's an easy thing to do. And it's obviously
it's a very appropriate thing to do.  
Q. You talked about their shot blocking, do you think your guys struggled
from the outside allowing them to pack it in a little bit more?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we didn't, you know, if you're not hitting, they
can pack it in. So we didn't shoot well, but I thought that at the very start
of the game we had a couple fast breaks and we tried lobs and they blocked two
lobs. And we talked about that before the game. That if we have a fast break,
don't throw a lob, try to get something strong to the basket. Because one of
the things that they do is they chase down, they chase you down real well. If
you get an advantage, they will chase you down real well. They don't give up
on plays. LSU is a team that doesn't give up on plays. And they can make a
play when you don't think that they can make a play. And I thought they did
that early and it knocked us back a little bit.  
_MODERATOR: I guess that will do it._  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: That's it. Thank you.  
_MODERATOR: Thank you very much._

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
_MODERATOR: We'll start with a brief overview from Coach Brady._  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I thought a couple things without looking at a stat
sheet. I thought that people were talking about match-ups. And what I wanted
our team to think about was certain players will be assigned to certain
players, but unless we guarded Duke collectively as a team, and everybody
carried out at assignment that they had, we weren't going to be able to guard
them effectively for 40 minutes.  
But that may have been the best defensive effort that we have had or that I've
seen one of my teams have. We knew we had to not let J.J. Redick get in the
offense. We were going to double team him. Follow him around, around the
double screens that they set for him coming out of the lane.  
We got good hedge, if there was ever any doubt that J.J. was going to break
clean, we were going to run somebody else at him, even if it allowed two
people to guard him and somebody else go free. Garrett Temple did a wonderful
job, but other players also did a wonderful job of carrying out the plan.
Shelden Williams came at us a little bit and had some success and at about the
10 minute mark of the second half, we went to what we call or red defense,
started doubling him every time he caught the ball. And we kind of eliminated
some of his effectiveness the last eight or 10 minutes. He got in a little
foul trouble and we tried to go with Glen to make it more difficult for him to
play the game.  
We also thought late in the game we could continue to advance the ball up the
floor quickly and try to get some easy baskets. And we did get a couple in
transition. Which was good for our players to be able to do.  
I thought that offensively we were good enough, but I thought defensively and
in terms of rebounding the ball it was as fine an effort as I've ever had a
team play.  
_MODERATOR: All right. Your student-athletes are Glen Davis and Darrel
Mitchell and Tyrus Thomas. And we'll start questions for any or all student-
athletes._  
Q. Darrel, they went up five, they missed a free throw, they kicked it out
to Redick and he missed a three. You hit a three. A six point swing. Do you
remember that part of the game? How big do you think your shot was?  
DARREL MITCHELL: It was real big. It got us back to where we were and our
intensity level. We knew they was going to give us a good punch and we wanted
to fight through, and that shot got us going again. And it was just one of
those things when Glen was in foul trouble, Tyrus was in foul trouble and
somebody else had to step up and me being the senior leader, I wanted to step
up and do that.  
Q. Darrel, what have you said to Garrett about the defense, I know it was a
collective effort but a lot of times he was isolated and J.J. pretty much and
the defensive effort he put forward.  
DARREL MITCHELL: What did I tell him? I told him he gets the game ball for the
night. Regardless of who scored the ball or who did what, he gets the game
ball. He held J.J. to nine points. He's the second leading scorer in the
country and for him to hold J.J. to nine points, it just shows how important
he is to this team and how special he is.  
He may not get the recognition and things that he should get, but tonight
showed and I'm glad he was able to step up on the stage and show it tonight.  
Q. Tyrus, on the run-out that you had against their press, did you know you
were going to the basket or was that a called play or did you just say, I'm
not going to hold back on this?  
TYRUS THOMAS: Well, we were in the double bonus so the objective was to get
fouled but I saw an open lane so I took it. And I just scored the ball.  
Q. For all three, Tasmin is not up there with you, but I'm going to ask you
about two plays, he knocked the ball lose on one end when Duke had it and then
got the offensive rebound at the end. Can you talk about would you guys be
sitting up there talking about a win if Tasmin doesn't make those two plays?  
TYRUS THOMAS: Everybody contributes to the team's victory and Tasmin is a
vital part of winning. He plays relentless and like everyone else and if it
wasn't for him we probably wouldn't be sitting up here talking about a
victory. So I'm just glad to have that kind of player on my team.  
DARREL MITCHELL: He's just one of those guys that you may not recognize
throughout the game, but at key points in time he'll step up and make a big
shot like you said. Grab rebound, and he may not be up here, with us talking
about this game, but he also was a big key to our win tonight.  
Q. For the players, describe your emotions in beating a team like Duke in
this game.  
GLEN DAVIS: It feels real good. All the hard work in the off-season that we
have done and just this team as a whole. I'm just so proud of us. The
chemistry that we have.  
To beat Duke, they're a great team. And that just shows a lot about our team.
And what kind of character we have. So it feels good, but now it's over. Now
it's another task at hand.  
DARREL MITCHELL: It's a good win like he said. The hard work that we did this
summer and coming into this season, that's what we worked for, to get to this
point and play teams like Duke. And for us to get this win, it just shows our
hard work has paid off and like he said, the game is over and we have another
big one Saturday.  
TYRUS THOMAS: I feel the same. Duke's a team that everyone either wants to
play for or against. And tonight we showed good character by going down and
against the crowd that was really wasn't with us and we came back. And we
showed a lot of character and we won. And it feels good to beat Duke. Which is
a great basketball program, but like they said, we have to just come back
tomorrow and go back to work and get ready for the next game Saturday.  
Q. The last 60 seconds that you had three or four rebounds, three or four
points, talk about how those last 60 seconds felt for you.  
GLEN DAVIS: Well, they were slow. If things didn't go my way today, they
didn't, and I've been put in multiple situations like that. When the ball is
not bouncing my way and I just wanted to do something, and that's what I was
saying to myself, I just wanted to do something to turn the game around, to
help out the team.  
And at that moment I seen the opportunity where I can get a rebound and I went
and got it. Twice.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Tyrus and also Glen, you kind of answered this a little bit, but can you
tell me, you struggled in the first half, only played 10 minutes because of
foul trouble, what was running through your mind at the half and what did you
think you had to do in the second half to get back in the game and help your
team?  
TYRUS THOMAS: I got in foul trouble but Darnell Lazare, he played a great part
today and we couldn't have won without him. So you know my main thing was just
to come back in the game and play smart and hard. Just to play hard. Just to
come back in the game, play smart and play hard and stay out of foul trouble.  
DARREL MITCHELL: He told me, we had to play out of our heads right now. And I
think we did. We adapted to the situation really, really well. And without
Darnell and those role players, Magnum Rolle, we wouldn't be sitting up here
today.  
Q. What do you have to do to stay in the game when you get in foul
trouble?  
GLEN DAVIS: Basically kind of put my mind at ease, because I wanted to do
something so bad, I was rushing everything and so that fourth foul kind of
humbled me down and really put me in my place to deliver for the team. And my
main thing was teammates was just telling me to play smart, play smart and we
got your back. So they did a great job of helping me and encouraging me to
stay out of foul trouble.  
_MODERATOR: Last question for our student-athletes._  
Q. Darrel, can you talk about one of the teams that you could face now is
West Virginia. You guys played them earlier. Can you tell me what you remember
about that game?  
DARREL MITCHELL: They got that difficult 1-3-1 zone and that's going to be a
challenge for us, but I think that we handled it well early in the season and
I think that now if we do have to play them, we'll be able to adjust more now
than we did then, because we adjusted to each other as a team now and we know
each other as well as brothers.  
But regardless of who we play, we have to come out because it's going to be a
tough game Saturday.  
_MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll excuse our student-athletes and then go with
Coach Brady._  
Q. Can you just talk about your emotions as you were watching the free throw
shooting at the end and if you sort of felt like it was going to work out your
way when you kept getting the rebounds off of second shots?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I didn't really make a comment or thought the game was
over until the nine second mark on the clock.  
That's when I realized that we were going to win the game. I was too wrapped
up in making sure we found Redick in case the ball came off or we were going
to our five switch defense, where we switched everything and we were going to
still double team Redick on the ball screen, but switch every other kind of
screen on anybody else. So I was making sure our players understood that,
regardless of whether we made the free throw or not.  
But at the nine second mark, I felt good about winning the game, but I never
looked at that this was a benchmark for our program or a benchmark for me as a
coach or a benchmark for our players or are they good enough, I didn't view
this game like that. I knew it was a big game, it was a Sweet 16 game, and
regardless of what would have happened, I feel good about myself, our team and
what we have accomplished.  
But this just adds to a really outstanding season that we have been able to
put together. And the thing that really makes me feel best about it is there
were times the second half we had four freshmen on the floor. We start three
freshmen, Glen Davis is a sophomore, we come off the bench with two freshmen
and a junior. And that's what really makes me most proud is our team has
developed to the point where it has the poise to beat a program and a team
like Duke in this setting and also being very young at the same time.  
Q. How many options did you consider on how y'all wanted to try and defend
Redick or did you pretty much know from the start that Garrett was going to be
the guy?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I said all that stuff in the paper about maybe we'll guard
Tasmin with Mitchell on him or Darrel Mitchell. That was all -- I didn't mean
that. We were going to guard Garrett on him from the beginning. Because those
other teams and coaches read the paper a little bit, I think. So I said all
those things, but it was Garrett Temple guarding him from the jump.  
We were going to double team him on ball screens and not let him get a comfort
zone of coming off the screen with the ball. We were going to bump him every
time he tried to go through the lane. Garrett was going to play on one side to
not let him come out his comfort zone side and then change and play on the
other side and play from behind him and he had a great amount of help with
that by the way we hedged him and doubled him.  
And we did that. Really the unique thing about it, you know, you can play good
defense, but when you can play good defense aggressively as we did without
fouling, I think that's a key.  
Glen and Tyrus got in foul trouble a little bit, but certainly to defend them
I think that was Duke's lowest point total of the season, certainly it was
J.J. Redick's lowest or maybe Georgetown held him to single digits this year
and they did a great job. We watched that tape three or four times. But to
guard effectively for an extended period of time without fouling is really
significant for a team to be able to do as aggressively as we tried to do it
tonight and I was proud of our team for being able to do that.  
Q. Can you talk about Magnum and Darnell and just how important they were
for this game?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, every successful basketball team throughout the season
has to have quality play from its bench. Our bench is not extremely deep as
all of you know from watching our team, but certainly Magnum Rolle has
improved and is getting better and better every time he plays.  
The only thing that Magnum needs is some strength. And I've said this before,
Magnum Rolle is on the same path as Tyrus Thomas, there's no doubt in my mind
that after a spring and summer in the weight room, Magnum Rolle is on the same
upward path that Tyrus Thomas was on last year.  
But nobody saw it because Tyrus Thomas was a redshirt freshman. Darnell Lazare
is as valuable to our team as anyone. And even as valuable as Darrel dare or
Glen Davis because if he didn't play as well as he did the first half, scored
some baskets, defended well, executes because he's an experienced player on
our team, we certainly wouldn't have been in position we were in the second
half to have an opportunity to win it.  
Q. Regarding Tyrus's play, how much do you think the blocked shots and the
broken up lobs and things really disrupted Duke and even demoralized them?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, a couple -- coupled with the way we defended J.J. and
the way we doubled Shelden Williams at the end, and in addition to what you
just said, the blocked shots, that's difficult for a team to handle. That is
something you don't coach. That's something that you recruit.  
There's two ways to play this, you coach them and you recruit them and then
you recruit them and you coach them. And Tyrus Thomas has a wonderful gift of
having the timing to block shots and he does help our defense a great deal, it
allows us to maybe put a little more pressure in the perimeter, do a few
things off of a ball screen to double J.J. Redick and let Tyrus roam the
middle and protect the basket. He certainly gives us an added dimension that
some teams don't have.  
Q. Talk about really the first seven, eight minutes of the game. You played
even to the first TV timeout and I think you guys got ahead, with your young
team, how much did that help their confidence and what as it went on?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: You're exactly right about that. We knew early on that Duke
was going to come out and try to pressure us and not intimidate us, I don't
like using that term, but really do what they do best and pressure and get in
passing lanes and get easy baskets.  
But our team was able to fight through that and we scored some easy baskets on
them. And we did a nice job of handling the first five to seven, eight minutes
of the game. And it was really important for that to happen because we came
into that TV timeout with a lot more confidence because we were able to fight
them off because that's something that our coaches and myself told our team
that guys, the first five, six, seven minutes they're going to really come at
you, try to get you on your heels, and if we can work through that, and stay
even, then certainly we'll be in good shape.  
And I think that's kind of what happened. The tone was set and I think they
knew they were in for a contest tonight. And that was something that was
important and our team was able to do it and you're exactly right for noticing
that.  
Q. I wonder if you can just talk about the way you guys played defense
tonight. You held them to the lowest field goal percentage and really got
after them. Just a comment about how you guys played defensively overall.  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, it was the best defensive effort I've had a team play.
But I've been at LSU for nine years now and if you look back, most of the
teams that I put on the floor have been in the top three in field goal
percentage defense, we have been a good rebounding team ever since I been
there.  
We were -- Florida beat us one tenth of a percentage point in having the best
field goal defensive team in the SEC this year and that league is pretty
athletic as you saw our team. So we have always put a premium on defending and
rebounding the ball. Tonight on this stage obviously everybody takes more
notice of it and I'm happy for that, for our players, but it's really
something that we have stressed since I've been there. This team is able to do
it a little bit better because Garrett Temple is a rangey guy with good feet
that's extremely smart defensively, well beyond his freshman years. Darrel
Mitchell is awfully quick. Tasmin Mitchell is the most mature freshman I have
ever coached. And then you put Glen on the floor with the length of Tyrus
Thomas, you have the makings of a nice defensive team.  
And all I've done is just tried to guide them in the right way, get them to
play hard, they responded to that and I think that's why we're able to do that
tonight. But I think the way we guarded Duke had something to do with it,
along with the quality of the athlete that I'm fortunate enough to coach.  
_MODERATOR: That will do it. Thank you, Coach._  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Sure.

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Mike Gansey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15636)

### [Kevin Pittsnogle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13763)

  
_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
_MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Beilein._  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Great basketball game. I didn't see the first one but I
understand that was a great game as well, the first game here. But a great
basketball game and I'm very proud of our young men the way they fought back
in the second half.  
We did not have a good first half. We buried ourselves a little bit. But we
came back and darn near won the game. So we're -- congratulations to Texas,
they got a heck of a team and they have got us twice now this year and but
they're playing a very good LSU team, because we saw them firsthand as well.  
_MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes._  
Q. Kevin or Mike, could you just talk about the swing of emotions there in
the last five seconds after hitting the shot and then having the shot just --
that whole sequence and what was going through your mind?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: Yeah, I mean, we hit the three and we thought we had a
pretty good shot at going to overtime but they rushed it down the court. We
hopped on our defense, they found a guy and he just tossed it up and it went
in. It was kind of an up and down situation, but that happens in basketball.  
MIKE GANSEY: Yeah, Kevin made a tremendous shot and it was just one of those
plays that there's still five seconds left on the clock and Abrams pushed the
ball quick and it was one of those plays. Paulino made a great shot.  
Q. Kevin or Mike, either one, what was said in -- did you guys like talk to
each other at half time, the seniors, after going down 12 in the first half?  
MIKE GANSEY: Yeah, we thought we didn't play one of our greatest first halves
and for us seniors we were just talking about that this could be it and we
thought we were a better team than what we showed the first half.  
And we came right out, Kevin hit a big shot and it got us a little bit of
momentum. Unfortunately we couldn't finish it out, but we just showed we had a
lot of heart in the second half. We're a team that's never going to quit.  
Q. Mike and Kevin both, after the way it ended, and as it sunk in now that
this is the end for you guys? I know you didn't expect it to come this soon,
but what are you going through right now after four years of this?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: I think it sunk in that for the seniors that it was our last
game at West Virginia for West Virginia and I think that's what we're more sad
about than losing the game.  
It's a great game. They made a great shot, they deserved to win, they're a
better team. But I think it's more or less that we're not ever going to play
again as a team because we have so much fun together, we love each other and
it's -- that's probably the main thing.  
MIKE GANSEY: Yeah, I think it's sunk in just for us five seniors never to be
able to go on a court together, organized game, and obviously to play against
another father like Coach Beilein, it's kind of sad it's come to an end. But
we have had a very, very tremendous time and we're all going to keep in touch
and be best friends forever.  
Q. Mike, what was your -- what was going on with you physically, especially
in the second half?  
MIKE GANSEY: I think Coach did a tremendous job just giving me rest here and
there because the last couple games I haven't been able to I guess play at my
best towards the end of the game. Obviously cramping up and my stomach, so I
thought Coach gave me a tremendous job, just giving me rest here and there and
I felt great towards the end. And if we would have went to overtime, I would
have been ready to go.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for Coach._  
Q. I was wondering, do you feel the same sentiments, the toughest part about
this isn't necessarily the loss, but that you're not going to have these
seniors and this team ever again to coach?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think that's what -- they love being together. We all
like the camaraderie that's established from whether it's the coaching staff,
the trainers, equipment men and all the young players. So that's the sad thing
-- you know, these five seniors and what they have meant to the program from
going to the NIT last year to this year. You work so hard and to have it end
one day is very difficult for everyone to grasp I think right now. We all know
one team's going to win. Everybody's going to have this feeling, Coach K's
team has the same feeling right now, but we gave it. I think they can rest
assured knowing they gave it everything they had over their time.  
Q. Coaches always replay everything that happens to them in a game. Is there
anything on the last play that you saw as it happened or since that you could
replay and say, we could have done something different?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: You know, and with a five, I think it was five seconds
when Kevin hit the three, it's just very hard with their quickness to get --
to match up and keep somebody from getting -- I don't know where it came from,
I would assume it was a couple steps off the three point line.  
I mean, if you -- at five seconds you can go right to the basket and it's, you
know, our kids can go from basket to basket in four seconds and lay it in. So
I thought we fanned them out enough but I'll have to watch it more to see if
there's anything else we could do. I certainly didn't want to call -- I had
one timeout left I didn't want to call a timeout and give them time to do
anything either and Rick felt the same way, just let them roll. And the ball
bounces around a little bit, we could still be out there playing.  
Q. The first half, was actually a bigger problem?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah.  
Q. Than the end of the game. What --  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I, you know, I'll have to watch the tape a little bit to
see, I just thought that a couple of our guys, they're such great kids, that
we missed a layup, we got the ball stolen from us, and they just mentally just
got a little down on themselves and they didn't play with the confidence that
they needed to play with against that team.  
I thought five minutes into the game I was watching the two teams play and I
said, we can win this game. And we were right there and we just made a couple
-- had a couple problem areas and I thought we dragged it through the rest of
the half. And they -- but they did what we expected them to do, they came
back, they forgot about that and just came back. And we took the lead again,
you know, so I mean, I just told them forget about the first half, you showed
me so much courage here tonight and how to play. That's what's really
important right now.  
Q. Obviously you guys struggled a little bit to stop Aldridge. Could you
speak a little bit to how good he is compared to some of the big guys you
faced this year?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Well, I think they only had three or four offensive
rebounds in the first half. But if it's -- you know, with the way -- as I said
yesterday in the press conference, that ball bounces straight up and it's
above the rim, that's where he got most of his points. They had 17 offensive
rebounds, I think, in the game. And they had 14 of them in the second half.  
So sometimes our great defense, we don't have a defense for that. We don't
have a defense for a put back. So it's difficult. It's a little bit like I
guess guarding the Craig Smiths and people like that that used to be in the
Big East and I'm trying to think of an Okafor when he was at Connecticut,
those type of kids that you do everything you can, and the 50/50 ball, they
just get it. Not because of lack of desire on our part, just he's a big
difference maker.  
_MODERATOR: I think that will do it. Thank you, Coach._  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 3RD & 4TH ROUND REGIONALS:
ATLANTA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+3RD+%26+4TH+ROUND+REGIONALS%3A+ATLANTA)

### [LaMarcus Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14213)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Kenton Paulino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15645)

### [P.J. Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13721)

  
_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
_MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Barnes._  
COACH RICK BARNES: First of all, I would like to say that there's not a
classier program and certainly not a classier person than John Beilein. And
I've never been on the end of one of these like this and I know it's gut
wrenching when you lose a game like that.  
But his team plays with so much character and heart. And I know Mike Gansey
struggled down the end and for them to fight the way they fought, it was a, I
guess the kind of games that CBS wants. Those threes, one right after the
other. But again our guys did a great job and we knew it would be a hard
fought game. But certainly I would like to congratulate West Virginia on a
great year and the way they run their program.  
_MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes._  
Q. Kenton, walk us through the last play. It looked like you were kind of
open coming down the floor. Were you waving to A.J. to try to get you the
ball?  
KENTON PAULINO: Yeah, the play was designed if they hit a three to get the
ball out quick and run it down the floor. And A.J. came to my side and I was
calling for the ball and he put it right on the money and I just shot the
ball.  
Q. Kenton when it left your hand, did you know it was in? Did you have a
feeling that it was in?  
KENTON PAULINO: When it left my hand it felt good, I had no idea if it was
going in. But I just took the shot. Luckily it went in.  
Q. Just a question, you had the big lead in the first half, what happened in
the second half that caused that to disappear?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Coach told us they was going to come out fired up. And I
think that they turned the intensity up on us and I think that for a moment we
didn't know how to counter it and Coach came to the sideline and said that we
had to pick our intensity up. And I think that once we did that that's when it
started getting close.  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Pittsnogle's last shot? It looked like
you got out on him okay but how scary is it going out on a guy like that who
can shoot?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: First of all, he's a great all-around player. Scouting him,
I knew he was going to be a tough job coming up into the game. But Coach said
switch everything and they had rubbed on me and nobody had done a switch, so I
just tried to contest it and he made a shot like he always does.  
Q. P.J., the way they were playing in the second half, and kind of turned
things around, obviously you wanted to end it there but if you go into
overtime, is that the type of team that you just don't want to take into an
overtime, to get some extra minutes like a team like that?  
P.J. TUCKER: A team, yeah, I mean I think Coach always talked about just
wanting to be out there, to play all day and all night. Just loving the game.
And you're driven by being when you're a kid in these type of situations. So
you got to love it and live it.  
So if we would have played eight over times, we would have stayed out there
and fought the whole night. I think that our team just didn't want to lose and
kept fighting. So I don't think it would have made a difference.  
Q. For any of the players, could you talk about the way Mike Williams has
been playing over the tournament?  
P.J. TUCKER: Mike's been big. Especially the last two games. Coming in and
doing his job, rebounding, playing hard, and he's scoring some big time
baskets today and got some big time rebounds, so Mike definitely came in and
gave us a spark. Down in the paint he was great. He came in and played hard
with J.D. and A.J. too, our bench was real good today.  
Q. Kenton, I was just wondering if you had ever hit a game winner like that
before as the time expires? 00:00?  
KENTON PAULINO: No, I never hit a game winner before. I can remember to my
junior year when I missed a game winner at Wake Forest, but I never made a
game winner.  
Q. Talk a little bit about the game coming up now, is it a bit of a relief
that you don't have Duke or are you leery of the next -- of your next
opponent?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We're not going to talk about the next game. We'll talk
about this game. We'll talk about the next game tomorrow.  
Q. Kenton, I know it's real soon right after the shot but have you just been
able to digest what this shot means to this program and maybe where it will
rank in Texas history?  
KENTON PAULINO: No, I haven't thought about it. I'm just glad the shot went
in. I really haven't thought about the importance or this and that. I'm just
living the moment.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. You're excused, gentlemen. Questions for Coach._  
Q. Is there any kind of pattern? When you're in a situation like that at the
end is there any kind of pattern they're following, guys are supposed to run
to a certain spot or are you just free for all?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Transition, we said if they make a three we're going to get
it out quick and run the transition game. I told A.J. to push it. That means
that we're going to run somebody right down the middle of the floor. LaMarcus,
P.J. took it out and we knew that we would probably get a look either from
A.J. if LaMarcus could get out in front. If not he knew he would have Daniel
or K.P. depending upon which way he went with it.  
But we said if they make a three, get it out and push it right on top of them.
And we did a really nice job of executing right there at the end.  
Q. Would you talk about the problems that someone like Gansey presents with
a coming off screens and shooting threes and also cutting and slashing?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I told him after the game I am not sure if I ever coached
against a tougher, more determined kid. Because I know he's not 100 percent
healthy. I could tell that watching him throughout the game. With the cramps
and what he's gone through. But they run that two man action over there, they
are great at reading and they can beat you a lot of different ways. You do
something, they counter it really well.  
He's the fact that they stretch you like they do and when Kevin Pittsnogle's
screening for him, LaMarcus would like to help, but it's hard to do that
because they will pop him and give him a pretty good look and he doesn't need
much time.  
But Mike Gansey just competes. You look at him and I think he's much
underrated in terms of his athleticism. When we played them the first time, I
remember when we looked back at the game and we talked about it and my players
made the comment that they're a much more athletic team than people give them
credit for. And but they're very smart, and they just really understand how to
play this game. And he's a perfect example of that.  
Q. Sorry if you answered this already, but I wonder if you can talk about
the lift you guys got from A.J. and Mike Williams tonight?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Mike's been really big. Our bench in the first half was
really good. I thought what J.D. came in and gave us -- he created a turnover
for us. But Mike is doing what we want him to do in terms of his -- you look
at his line tonight, I was just looking at it here tonight and the fact is he
had seven rebounds, two of them offensive, he was four for four. Didn't force
anything and he just went in and did the dirty work. His defense was really
good.  
It's hard for Mike Williams and Brad to guard a guy like Herber, a hard guy to
guard, because they will take him off the dribble and we -- in the first game,
tonight we came out different. We tried to get P.J. on him because he hurt us
so much in the first game when we got in some foul trouble with Daniel, we had
to go back to the big guys on him and they obviously went at that. But Mike's
defense overall in the being out there on the perimeter -- and he, with about
three possessions to go in the game, he made one great help situation where he
probably saved us a basket, and that was a big play. Again, it won't show up
anywhere, other than the fact that he helped the teammate out and recovered
back to his man.  
Q. Talk about A.J. too?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again, A.J., the season has gone along, he's grown more and
more.  
Q. A.J. Abrams?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Tough kid. Defensively he's getting better and better. On
offense he's the guy that I told him, I said, you better -- we really came
into this game wanting to throw the lob diagonal pass, first one he --
actually I said to him coming into the game, I said I don't care if you throw
it out of bounds, you better throw it and he threw it out of bounds and he
said, you said I could throw it out of bounds and he did.  
But the fact is he drove in there, he's got really good vision, he didn't have
a great night shooting the ball tonight, but some it has to do with the fact
that they really recover well from penetration and kickouts and but he's
really gotten better. He's getting certainly he's gotten more confident as the
year has gone on.  
Q. How important was the rebounding there down the stretch for you guys? Was
that the difference in the ballgame right there?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we went small, we haven't done that in quite some
time, but we went small because I felt like we had somewhat bogged down on
offense and P.J. went in there and he's a tough matchup, obviously. But you
look at P.J. Tucker, I mean he had six turnovers but you still look, he had 14
rebounds and the rebounding was huge. And when we turned it over there at the
end. LaMarcus -- P.J. threw it up and they deflected but LaMarcus said, you
get it on the rim I'll go get it, and we did talk about that to our team
coming in that we needed to really go inside and that's why we changed up on
offense.  
We tried to keep two guys down around the block and every now and then we
would float somebody into the high post but we just felt like we would take
care of the ball, get it on the rim, that we could do some damage there. And
we ended up with 17 of them and I'm not sure how many we converted back but
the fact that we gave ourselves a chance to have 17 more opportunities.  
_MODERATOR: Okay. That will do it. Thank you, Coach._  
COACH RICK BARNES: Okay. Thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 3RD & 4TH ROUND REGIONALS:
ATLANTA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+3RD+%26+4TH+ROUND+REGIONALS%3A+ATLANTA)

  

## March 22, 2006

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [J.J. Redick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14306)

### [Shelden Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15581)

  
_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
Q. How would you define this team's collective personality and how is it
dissimilar to teams you have had in the past?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think it's a personality that's still developing.
Because we have a lot of young guys who are emerging and have emerged quite a
bit in the last month of the season. So it's been a little bit different team.
I mean we have great kids who want to do what we ask them to do and they have
played hard, they have come to play all the time, so they have a good
personality as far as games go. And they get along well.  
Just a matter of -- we have 6 seniors and 6 freshman, not all from scholarship
players, so that dynamic I have never had before and I think they have done a
good job in bringing both those age groups together.  
Q. A lot was made few weeks ago is that J.J.'s emotional tank might have
been empty. I think he showed the ACC tournament and then this past weekend
that that's far from the case. Could you just talk about his emotional gas
tank, if you will, and I think had you mentioned even that you had learned
something from when Christian Laettner was going through a lot of publicity in
'92?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Christian was right at the end of the season. He just
had the shot against Kentucky. Next five days won every award that a college
player can win. Then he was asked to play and wanted to play of course in the
Final 4. So it was -- he never had a break from that Kentucky -- it was just
constant and constant attention.  
J.J.'s I think was -- we had clinched the regular season right around when he
broke the record against Miami. That's when we clinched the tie and because we
beat State, we were going to we were going to be the champions of the regular
season. And so much attention was focused on those records then and that
conspiracy of officials giving us calls, and those two aspects kind of -- it
was tough to concentrate just on the team and for two weeks I thought we
didn't play real well and I didn't think J.J. played real well. We just didn't
do well. I don't know if it was so much emotion as much as there wasn't a need
and there were a lot of distractions much more than emotion. And once we got
past that, finished the regular season, one we're trying to celebrate now.  
Shelden being one of the best shot blockers, trying to get together as far as
who we're as a basketball team, we had about three weeks of something that no
other team in the country had to deal with, and hopefully it's made us
stronger. But he's ready to go. I think J.J. is ready to go.  
Q. Your theory on how Shelden has been able to accomplish all that he has
but yet it flies under the radar?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I just mentioned part of my theory, not that it's a theory I
think it's obvious, there's only so much space in newspapers and there's only
so much time on TV programs and radio programs, and when you are talking about
something else and he's the poster child for having committed a foul or did he
commit a foul, then you are not going to talk about his accomplishments.  
That's sad. I have said that before and I still think it was sad. Thank
goodness he's a great kid. That never fazed him. He just went about his
business, and he's put together two great games in the NCAA tournament and is
getting probably a lot of recognition he would have gotten the whole last
month of his senior regular season.  
Hopefully we'll get a chance to do more but we have to beat a really tough
opponent tomorrow night and then would have to beat another tough opponent on
Saturday to keep it going.  
Q. Talk about the matchup between Shelden and Glen Davis tomorrow?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't like to talk about one-on-one matchups because
that's not the way we play defense. We play defense team man-to-man, and
because of how they come down the court, Shelden would be on Davis, but also
Josh would be on him. A lot of times their second big is the first guy back
especially on offense, he gets down the court fast and if that happens, then
Shelden would be on him. In transition.  
So neither one of those kids are kids that you are going to stop one-on-one.
You are going to have to get help, and when Davis has the ball you have to
give help. How we do that we'll see how we do that tomorrow or if we do it
tomorrow.  
Q. Talk about the physical demands on J.J. because of how he moves without
the ball and maybe how he prepared differently this season to have all the
energy he needed most season?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think he's just evolved each year as a better basketball
player, and the last two years he's made a year-round commitment to being in
exceptional shape. That means where you can handle the -- the things go on in
basketball, if you just focus on J.J. and just watched him, you'd be shocked
at the maze of things that he has to get through usually to get a shot. And so
when you are doing that, there are times where you can get distracted or get
down or get emotional about it which would take you away from the next play.  
And so one key words for J.J. is maturity, is handling the next play, whether
that be something where he thought he was bumped or he just missed, or he
didn't do what he was supposed to do to get open. He has got to play every
play fresh and got to play it with the same amount of energy. He has the
energy. And he has the maturity. That's why he's been a great player this
year. He's been an exceptional player throughout but he's a great player this
year.  
Q. With all the focus on star power, offensive players in the NCAA
tournament sometimes defense is overlooked. Your philosophy on defense in the
tournament, it is more important, is it different?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: For me defense is the foundation for a basketball
program and I think over the years it's one of the main reasons that we have
done well for regular season or in the post-season is because usually we have
been a very good defensive team. This team is a little bit different
defensively. We haven't been able to cause the turnovers in passing lanes and
full court pressure that some of my other teams have. We have relied a lot on
Shelden. Shelden has been a truly great defender. And helpside, on the ball,
you name it, and but usually if you win this thing, the team that wins it
plays good defense. Hopefully we're improving in that. We're going to have to
play real well tomorrow night.  
Q. Along those lines what catches your attention about LSU's defense how
good have they been in their two NCAA tournament games so far?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: They are very good defensively. They can block shots
first of all, so if you do break them down they have that last line of
defense. Thomas has been terrific in that, but Davis he takes up space but
it's not just his space because he has good feet so he can be a help defender
also and their perimeter defense although it's young except for Mitchell, the
senior guard, plays well together knowing that they have that last line of
defense so to speak, in those big kids, if they make any mistakes, so I think
they are a very good defensive team. I think they are really good team. They
have the best record in the SEC so they are very good.  
Q. Glen Davis said that there was an AAU event in Texas one time when you
were recruiting Dwight Howard. He said he kind of introduced himself to you
and you weren't really aware of who he was. I am sure this probably happens to
you often. Talk about whether you have any memory of that. If you really knew
who he was before he got to LSU.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It will be hard not to know who he was. (Laughter). I
don't know where that -- it's like a fairytale. One I won't be allowed to talk
to him because it would be a violation. So it -- of course I knew who he was.
How would he know that I was recruiting Dwight Howard? I mean, anyway, stories
like that are nice stories, okay. He's a helluva player. I know who he was. I
still know who he is. And I respect who he is. If I knew he wanted to go to
Duke I would have looked at him closer.  
Q. Yesterday we laid to rest a dear icon, Ray Meyer. Say a little bit what
he meant to you personally and your career and what he meant to this game. He
would have been here at this tournament?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Coach Meyer is the coach's coach. I am sorry that I was
not able to be there because of this or else I would have gone and gone there.
He was a real friend. The last time I saw him they had a little dedication for
me outside my old high school they named a street. Feel sorry for the other
people living on that street, but kids now are saying, What street do we live
on? Krzyzewski.  
But anyway, that's another part of that (laughter). But Coach Meyer was there
in a wheelchair and he always had that big smile. He had a big hug. He loved
the game and he loved the people. More so than I am not sure that anybody
loved the people of Chicago any more from sports than Coach Meyer. He was the
face of Chicago basketball and was a great example of what coaches should be
and many, many of the people in business, politics, in medicine, are were
former campers of his. He had them first grade camp up in Wisconsin where he
would talk about doing stuff under the stars, you knew you have been around a
bit to listen to him tell stories about him that were great.  
He had a great life and we'll celebrate his life for ever.  
Q. Do you go into a season with an idea as to how deep your rotation is
going to be or does that evolve as you go along? Also the -- this year's
rotation is about the same size as last year. Does that help these guys pace
themselves and know what to expect?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't go into a season -- expectations sometimes when
you have them, instead of being goals they become limits. I think it's -- even
like I have an expectation to make the NCAA tournament. Maybe then that's all
I want to do. So then you can never know about injuries or how kids are going
to develop. So I don't put expectations -- I kind of run motion offense, see
what guys are doing week-to-week and adjust accordingly.  
I think we have a solid 7-man rotation right now. It's more experience than
healthier than last year's. And we're fresher than we were last year at this
time. Last year we were kind of right at the end and then we played a team
that played great against us even if we weren't at the end they probably would
have beaten us, Michigan State.  
So we're better. Whether we advance after this, we will see. But we're better
right now than we were last year at this time.  
_MODERATOR: Thank you, coach._  
J.J. REDICK: We're really excited to be here. We feel very fortunate to be one
of the final 16 teams in the country. And certainly going to be a challenge
for us. LSU has had a great year, and they are a bigger team, with a really
good perimeter player, so it's going to be a big-time game and we're very
excited.  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: Kind of going along with what he said, it is a great feeling
to be in the Sweet 16, us being a part of that one of the 16 teams just is a
great opportunity for us and we played against LSU on Thursday and it's going
to be a great game. Two good teams, going to be a battle for 40 minutes.  
Q. Talk about the matchup with Glen Davis, just what your thoughts are after
getting a chance watching him on film and on TV?  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: He's an incredible player. Somebody for that size that moves
so well as he does, it's just amazing to watch. I know it going to be a very
physical game and low post throughout the whole course of the game. I know we
both are prepared for that and hopefully we'll play the game without any
injuries going on and hopefully we come out on top.  
Q. Did defense always come natural to you in high school? What has Coach
taught you about playing defense, do you think it's one of the overlooked
aspects of the team?  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: Defense was taught to me at early age by my father. That was
something that he taught me before I did anything else was bag player that
played both sides of the ball. When I first started out I was worried about
scoring points and not playing defense and he changed that around for me and
told me that anybody can concentrate on scoring but not everybody is
concentrating on playing defense. That's something that he taught me at early
age.  
Ever since then I have been becoming better and better at whatever my
defensive skills are out on the court. That's something that I took from my
father and have grown up to Duke and Duke has taken a great defensive team and
school. It's something that Coach K helping me out with, with defending on the
perimeter and defending like different guys in the low post.  
Q. Talk about what jumps out to you about LSU's defense, especially with
Tyrus Thomas back in there, playing a little bit more than he did when he was
injured?  
J.J. REDICK: I think it jumps -- what jumps out about them defensively is that
they are very long besides Mitchell, all their starters have really good
length and especially with Thomas back there, he tries to block every shot,
and that's an exciting play, it's a momentum play for them so we have got to
be smart when we take the ball inside.  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: Like he said, they are very long and pretty much every
position that they have and also every position that they have they are very
athletic. So we know we're going against a team that's going to be able to
compete with us on the physical side and also the athletic side too. We know
we have to be wise about our choice out there on the court offensively and
defensively.  
Q. I wonder if I could ask you to both of you being college seniors, have
you reflected on how much revenue college basketball players such as yourself
generate for the university and if you think college athletes should be paid a
stipend in addition to what they get just to cover the cost of a
scholarship?  
J.J. REDICK: We try not to think about that because we're amateur athletes. I
think for the most part we kind of just accept our plight that we're not going
to get paid.  
And I really don't think that college athletes should be paid a stipend. You
almost get into the thing where which should one player get more than another,
should a guy at a big school whose jersey sells for Nike, should he get paid
more at a low D-I school? Doesn't make sense. I think the easiest way is to
just have a system that's in place right now.  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: My feel on that topic is it is a very complicated topic, I
mean, like you said, we're amateur athletes and it should be kept that way.
There's a lot of issues that's raised who should be paid a certain amount,
should that star player get paid more than a walk-on player, it's a lot of
different things that could concert this raise issue. I think this system, the
way it is now, it's great for college basketball.  
Q. You never scored 20 points in a Sweet 16 game and some people would say
that it is because you get tired at this time of the year. Thoughts on that.
Did you do anything differently going into this season?  
J.J. REDICK: I can't remember what happened the first three years in the Sweet
16. Did we lose one of the games or something? I don't know. I can't remember
-- past is the past, to be honest with you. I really have no concern about
being tired. I think that's something that other people say to try to create
maybe -- plant a seed in my mind or something. But I am not tired. What has
happened in my previous three years doesn't really matter going into Thursday.  
Q. Little bit of a strange question. Glen Davis just told us that he's --
jokingly told us he's not a Dukey guy. What does that mean to you?  
J.J. REDICK: Well, I read one of his quotes from last week, where he's talking
about being in an AAU tournament sitting next to Coach K and eating a bunch of
cookies. I am not sure what he meant by that. I don't really know what a Dukey
guy is. I don't think we even refer to ourselves as Dukeys, so I guess a Duke
player if anything, is just a guy who plays hard every play and wants to win.
There's certainly a lot of players across the country that fit that profile,
but the coaching staff here is very selective with who they choose, who they
want to recruit.  
Q. J.J., a couple of articles written over the last couple of years about
how disliked you are as a player on the road. Do you feel like that's gotten
worse as the years have gone by, why do you think that that anger is directed
at you specifically?  
J.J. REDICK: I think there's been maybe a few more than a couple articles
written about that topic.  
I have always said that the biggest reason why people dislike me is because I
play for Duke. And I understand that. There's a fine line with Duke; you
either love us or hate us. And because over the past four years I have sort of
become one of the faces of our program, there's been animosity directed my
way. As the years have gone on, it's probably reached a pinnacle sometime last
year as a junior, and I basically heard everything you can say about me or my
family or my sexual orientation or my poetry or whatever, so it's now just
kind of comical to me, and any time we go on the road I think all of us look
forward to see what schools have, chants and posters, because it is funny.
It's not anything that I really get angry about anymore.  
Q. Any kind of comfort level here in Atlanta in this building given the
regional two years ago and some ACC tournament success here?  
J.J. REDICK: For us we weren't in the ACC tournament. That was a couple years
before we got here, but walking into this building earlier today brought back
really good memories of us playing here two years ago. For the seniors it will
be a little bit of a comfort level, but I think Texas also played here that
same Sweet 16 so they are going to have some comfort level.  
West Virginia is an experienced group in NCAA tournaments. I don't think it
really matters where they play. LSU is kind of just on a hot streak. They are
playing as good as anybody in the country. I don't think anything -- any of
that really matters.  
Q. Which have your major personal achievements are you most proud?  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: I am not really sure. Something that I never really thought
about. With me, being a defensive player, I guess, blocking shots would be a
key thing, and also I guess now achieving the rebounding record, I guess
that's probably the two most personal things that I can be very proud of
myself with doing.  
Q. What makes Coach so good and brings the best out of you players?  
J.J. REDICK: Coach is great every day. He's always got his on-switch turned
on. He's extremely competitive. He genuinely cares about winning and about his
players, and what he's done at Duke and just building a family and a program,
is just incredible. Just his day-to-day attitude of competitiveness and desire
to win is one of the things right off the top of my head that makes him so
great.  
SHELDEN WILLIAMS: I think for him to be very energetic day in day out, every
practice that we have he's bringing the best out of us, each practice, each
day, each game, each play, each exchange, and that's something that a lot of
people may take for granted.  
But playing for Coach K, it's something that is just a very special feeling
that he always cares no matter what the situation is, he's always there on our
side even if he is getting on us that day, we know that he's doing it because
he knows that we can do whatever that the job is and that's something that
Coach K brings to the table day in and day out.

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
COACH JOHN BRADY: We're looking forward to our game tomorrow night. It is a
great opportunity for our team. We have had a really fine season at this
point. We have done it with some young players. And we're excited about the
opportunity. We'll see how we play. We played a number-one-ranked team before
this year in Connecticut and played them pretty well earlier in the year at
Hartford.  
Duke presents a different challenge, with some different ways they score the
ball. They are very good defensively but our team is excited about the
challenge and we're looking forward to playing the game.  
Q. Of the 48 games so far 10 of them have ended with teams beating opponents
that were seeded anywhere from 5 to 12 spots higher. Is this the year of the
upset?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I think each year brings its own Cinderella types of
teams. I don't know if this is the year or not, but I do think there is some
parity within college basketball, particularly on one given game night. And a
lot of times -- I don't know if it's true for the OVC teams that are in the
tournament now, but a lot of times those teams are pretty good because they
are playing the senior laden teams, they have seniors on their teams. Some
cases fifth year seniors that make up those clubs.  
I think experience along with good talent can make for a good basketball team,
particularly as well coached as some of the mid majors are. I think any given
night, any good college basketball team can beat another one, particularly in
a tournament situation. Our particular team is quite young and, you know,
Northern Iowa came to our place earlier in the year beat us by one or two.
Very well coached, experienced team.  
So it's not surprising -- sometimes your fans don't understand that (laughs),
but coaches do, and I think that's what you are seeing now. There's good
players all over the country, some of the mid major so-called schools are
playing with some experienced players and they are very well coached. I think
on any given night a team can win a game if you don't respect the team as you
should, play as good as your particular team possibly can.  
Q. Last week in Jacksonville you spoke about how your team's approach is
kind of refreshing and kind of given you a different outlook on things a
little bit. I noticed A &M game during timeout in the second half where it was
pretty tense, one of your guys said something to you, you were trying to --
talk about how this team has been to coach this year and how it's changed you?
  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I guess my approach -- when you turn 50 you look at a lot of
things differently. This team is very close -- they take a lot of things in
stride, even when we were 8 and 5 early on, we lost to some really good
basketball teams. Even as young as we are, our team never got discouraged
about what was going on. I made a point to be extremely positive with this
team because of our youth. I wasn't going to have confrontations or challenge
them in a way that would create a confrontation. We decided early on to be
extremely positive.  
Our team has responded to that. We do have a none-serious approach, even with
youth. That's usually -- usually seniors and experienced teams handle
stressful situations probably better than young teams, but this team, even
though it is young, we have the one senior Darrel Mitchell, our whole team
attitude and approach has really been quite positive. And when you meet our
guys, if you ever talked to them, you will see there's nothing sacred in our
locker room. They make light of about everything that comes along, not in a
disrespectful way but in a positive if you know which.  
It's really helped me. When the shot doesn't go in at Connecticut to win the
game or you squander early in the season, a 10 point lead at Ohio State, you
lose a game by two on a three-pointer, our team has handled those things quite
well in spite of its youth. I think now we have grown to the point where we do
have experience even though we're still young and we'll see. We have another
big challenge tomorrow night and we'll just see how we play.  
Q. Pitcher going against Randy Johnson knows he's going to have to pitch a
pretty good game because the other guy isn't going to give up much. If you are
going in against Mike Krzyzewski, Mr. American Express, do you think -- I
really better be on my game tomorrow night or we're not going to have a
chance?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I did look at ESPN and I looked at -- they did flash Mike
Krzyzewski's tournament resume against mine. It did dwarf mine a little bit.
But certainly didn't intimidate me any. He just had some opportunities I
suppose and some different situations. I totally respect what he's done and
what that program is about.  
At the same time, we have beaten at LSU a sitting number one in Lute Olsen.
He's pretty good. We have played Connecticut to one this year at Hartford and
had a shot to beat them. And Jim Calhoun is pretty good. We have a guy in our
league named Tubby Smith that's not bad, another one named Billy Donovan
that's pretty good.  
In due respect to Coach Krzyzewski and his team, we have played against some
good coaches and some other mighty fine programs and have been able to win a
few of those games along the way. Now this is a different setting. You are in
the Sweet 16 now. It's not like a regular season game, but going back to our
team's approach, it certainly has been encouraging the way our team has
handled the success that we have had and also have handled the adversity that
we have had and we're just excited to play the game. Knowing we have to do
certain things extremely well in order to win the game, and I have tried to
deflect the matchups of a particular players, I have been asked a lot about
Glen and Shelden Williams matchup you just asked me about coaching against
Mike Krzyzewski.  
It's really about the LSU team and if our team doesn't do things collectively
very well, in terms of running good offense and executing and playing
outstanding team defense, because of all the situations that can occur when
you are trying to guard Redick, he can create other opportunities for his
players when you put a defensive emphasis on him. If we don't guard
collectively and do a good job from a team defensive standpoint regardless of
who is matching up against who, the game won't go our way. I have tried to
stress to our team that it's not about individual matchups or coaching matchup
as much it is about our team playing the best that it possibly can on both
ends of the floor.  
Q. Do you think that college basketball players in particular should get
more in a scholarship than what they are getting they are getting now, full
cost of what it is, and do you know of any scholarship athletes who kind of
struggle to make ends meet with what they are given?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: Well, I don't know what that has to do with our game
tomorrow night. I am for supporting the college athlete in any way that's
possible. That's a so open-ended question you talk about giving them some
stipends, and do you just give men's basketball and go to men's football and
go to women's basketball and after a while you add up the dollars that that's
going to cost -- it makes -- it already makes an expensive athletic budget
more expensive.  
So I don't know the answers to all that. But I know from my individual players
I am for supporting them in any way that's possible to make college life more
meaningful for them in whatever ways that we can decide to do that where it
doesn't put a very difficult financial strain on institutions I am for that.  
Q. With all the talk about star power in NCAA tournaments defense is kind of
lost and forgotten about, what is your philosophy on defense and the
tournament, is it any different, more important maybe, and on teaching defense
to kids, is that something that can be learned or is it more natural --  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I have always -- since I have been at LSU, we have always
been about defending and rebounding because on different nights the offense
can come and go regardless of the offensive scheme you may run or have drawn
up. Shooting the ball is a tough, difficult thing. That's what makes Redick so
special because he's so consistently can make shots guarded from three-point
line or better distance. But our team -- I feel like defending and rebounding
is all about effort and if you are a good athlete you can defend if demand is
placed on you and you are held accountable for doing that and you can rebound.
There's been good rebounding teams that aren't tall or athletic but they
understand how to find their man and block them out and keep them off the
board.  
I think every night it in the NCAA tournament you can certainly defend. I
don't know if every night you can shoot the ball as you would like. I think a
team that can defend consistently for extended periods of time and then once
you complete the defensive possession by making the other team miss finish it
off by rebounding the ball, I think those teams consistently have a chance. I
always thought that you can sell your team on defending that it breeds
unselfishness throughout your team. Players by nature think of offense because
how many players do you know that go into a gym with a ball and work on their
defensive slides? The first thing a player goes, when he says I am going to
work on my game, he's taking a ball he's going in the arena, he's shooting
baskets. He's not thinking about working on the other side of the game, which
50% of the time or more he plays defense.  
I think the key for the coach is to get his team to think defensively. We
tried to do that since I have been here. I think most of the time that shows
up in how we play the game.  
Q. I am you assuming when you schedule Cincinnati, Ohio State and UConn that
are hoping that it will pay off come this time of year. But after such an SEC
schedule, does it seem like light years ago when you were playing those guys
and can the team draw from having played the top-notch opponents outside of
the league?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: I don't know if it helps us right now because, as you said,
that was a long time ago. I think what it did to help a young team that we
have is to prepare them for the SEC schedule. I think it's an incremental
development of your team. We had a tough preseason schedule. It was 10 or 12,
13th in the country strength of schedule. I thought it was little better than
that. I get confused with the figures on the way they decide all those things,
but certainly I think that the pre-conference schedule helped us prepare for a
difficult SEC schedule, which in essence hopefully has prepared us to play a
team like Duke tomorrow night. I think it's an incremental sort of progression
that hopefully our team has benefited from.  
Q. For those of us who haven't seen Glen Davis too much in person, and
really only on television, tell us a little bit about his game on the court
and what you referred to earlier in terms of the locker room an those guys
being loose, my impression from what I have read about him is he's one of
those kind of guys tells a lot of jokes, so is he a factor in that?  
COACH JOHN BRADY: He's probably the key to our personality of our team and how
it is developed over the course of the season. Glen's game is a mix of power
and finesse. He's very good around the goal. He's not an over the rim guy.
He's an at-the-rim player. Being 6-8 1/2 with his sneakers on and legit 310 --
or between 310 and 320, I always say this, depending on what he ate the night
before, kind of goes up and down. But he combines power with finesse. He has
got a great footwork, tremendous hands, he can shoot the ball up to 17, 18
feet, good enough. And he can put it on the floor and go by you so he's a
pretty much of a complete basketball player.  
Defensively he leans on you. He can push you out of the lane, push you off the
lane, make you make baskets over him, which is all we try ever to get him to
do. He's done that quite well. I will tell you a story about Glen that I
shared on the court.  
We were playing Vanderbilt in the SEC tournament and Glen has had a terrific
first half and he's made several shots in a row and sometimes when players are
scoring pretty easily they tend to take a bad shoot and force one. He shot a
three-pointer right in front of our bench with five minutes to go in the first
half. And there was a break in the action and coming off the floor -- I was
walking on the floor and Glen walked by me and he said, Coach, in the huddle I
want you to yell at me for taking a bad shot. It caught me by surprise that he
would even think that way, and he looked book over my shoulder, he said, for
real.  
So I can't really tell a team what I really want them to do because I keep
thinking about the comment that he just shared with me, right before we broke
to go out on the floor, I said, Glen, by the way, that was a terrible shot you
just shot. Get right behind the goal where you need to be take a better shot.
He smiled and winked. He said, You are right, Coach. He went back on the
floor.  
I think he understands his position on the team and he wants to be treated
like everyone else and when he knew he took a bad shot -- first of all, it's
good that a player knows that he took a bad shot. Coming off the floor when he
shared that with me, make me yell at him in front of the team, I got on him
before the timeout. It shows the kind of personality that he has. That's the
way he is. He's kept our locker room light. And one unique thing about our
team that some of you may not know is our starting 5-plus Darnell Lazare, who
comes off the bench, these guys have grown up with each other and known each
other most of their lives. Tyrus Thomas, Glen Davis, Garrett Temple, Darnell
Lazare, Glen Davis, and even Darrel Mitchell, our only senior, they have all
played with each other against one another since they were in grade school. We
have got 4, 5 guys right from the Baton Rouge area, Tyrus Thomas and Glen
Davis grew up in the same neighborhood together.  
So it's a situation where they really have their own way of communicating.
They have their own language. I don't even know half the time what they are
talking about. I corrected them one time because I thought they were mad at
one another. They looked at me like I was crazy. They said, Coach, we do that
all the time. I said okay, I will just back out of here. They are a unique
group and it's been a pleasure to coach them and I think that's one of the
things our team has been able to handle the success and some of
disappointments we have had throughout the season because of how close they
are and how well they have known each other.  
_MODERATOR: Thank you, coach very much._  
GLEN DAVIS: Just I am here, man, I am just -- I am blessed, thank God that our
team is winning, just trying to seize the opportunity, man. You only get one
chance, you never know, you never know if you will ever see this podium again
or ever be put in a situation where you compete with one of the best teams in
the country.  
So I am glad to be around, y'all. Y'all guys are the, you know, yo to my fire,
you know, so happy to be here with this guy. I love this guy. This guy right
here, man, I can't say enough. Yeah, ready to go home and go to sleep in my
bed, that's about it. Hotel room ready, get something to eat. You know. How
y'all doing?  
DARREL MITCHELL: Thank God for this opportunity to be here, this chance to be
here, like he said, once in a lifetime opportunity to get to the Sweet 16 and
to play Duke makes it even more significant. But this is my last string, my
last go around, so I am real excited to be here and with us being dropped out
of this opportunity the first three years I have been here, for me to get in
my last season I am sucking every moment in and I am ready to go.  
Q. Talk about the matchup you have got with Shelden tomorrow I am sure you
have heard that several times before, I haven't heard yet.  
GLEN DAVIS: Shelden Williams is a great player. He's an all-American.
Basically I am trying not to get too excited because a guy like me who is kind
of low on the radar, is licking his chops right now because this is an
opportunity to show the world that you can play, that you can compete with the
best. So I am seizing the opportunity that I have to compete against one of
these elite players.  
I feel me being the competitor that I am, I am loving this, you know, this is
what you dream of. This is what the sweat and tears and all the hard work that
you put in, this is when you show, show out, and it's not a better opportunity
to show out on against Duke on a big stage.  
So I am loving this right now. But I am also at the same time respecting this
guy because he has proven himself in the amount of ACC and also in college
basketball. So I am ready. I am ready for it.  
Q. Your coach just mentioned that your weight can depend on what you ate
last night. Talk about the challenge it's been for you, about your appetite,
what a challenge it's been for you to get to where you are in this game and
maybe how hungry you tore get this tournament done?  
GLEN DAVIS: Basically, it's hard to create a good habit of eating right
because all your life you was able to eat chips when you wanted to and wanted
to do some things, wanted to eat some things that you wanted to. But my
determination to be the best player I can be has grown tremendously. I fully
figured out what I want to do in life and that's perform and play basketball,
so it's not a problem anymore. If that's what I have to do to change my bad
habits to be the best player I can be, I am giving up any kind of food you
want, I don't want to eat nothing. I am starving, so (laughs) basically it's
changed me as a person and it's hard work, man, really, really hard work.  
Q. Describe what it's like to grow up with a bunch of guys, as so many
people on the team have, and played together in college and specifically on a
stage of this magnitude when so many guys have known each other for so long?  
DARREL MITCHELL: Well, I think that's what kept us going this season
regardless of the tough pre-season we had with all those guys and with me
being from 60 miles away and knowing -- growing up with these guys I think
that's what kept us going and driving us here.  
We're like some brothers to each other. We do everything together. We fuss and
fight amongst each other and that just made us stronger this season. With us
having that close bond throughout the season, I think that's what is keeping
us from being and having a terrible season that some folks may have thought we
might have had. That's what kept us driving and pushed us throughout the
season.  
Q. Along those same lines, Coach, was here a little bit ago talking about
how nothing is really sacred in that locker room. It's quite a change of maybe
past years. Talk about how different it is in the locker room now and just
feeling around the team and how much the guys sitting next to you has caused
that?  
DARREL MITCHELL: My first season everybody had -- I think everybody had their
own separate goals and no one was really for the team, and now this season the
bond that we have, everyone is on the same page and everyone wants to do the
same thing. No one has their own individual goal to do this and that to get
where they want to go. Everybody is working hard together. I think that's what
that's what has got us here to the Sweet 16. Everybody, this was all our goals
to come here show up and do things in the turn. We did that in the first two
rounds. With Glen being a part of that, he's a big part of that. That's why
we're here. He's a load to handle and with him producing and carrying us the
way he did towards the end of the season just shows his leadership even though
he's a sophomore, his leadership role towards the end of the season he
basically carried us on his shoulders with me getting my injury and Tyrus
being out for the time that he did. He basically carried us on his shoulders.
He just showed up big for us and he's just a special guy. I am happy he's
still here with me for my senior season.  
Q. Talk about J.J. Redick, what you guys collectively as guards have to do
to try to slow him down?  
DARREL MITCHELL: Like Shelden, he's an excellent player. The team, their team,
they thrive off of those two guys. The offense is basically based around them.
So we're going to give them all kinds of different looks, I will guard him
Garrett will guard him. Garrett's going to give him a different look with his
length and I will give them a different look with my speed and quickness. It's
going to be a challenge for us tomorrow. He's one of those guys that if he
gets going you know he's going to be a tough guard. But I think if we can slow
him down and give him different looks, get him frustrated and try to corrupt
him as much as we can, that will an big key for us tomorrow night.  
Q. How tough a decision was it to give up football coming out of high
school, ever regret --  
GLEN DAVIS: You cannot regret it because you love -- everybody loves the game
of football. They like to play it. But my passion for basketball is no
question more than football. So it wasn't that hard, you know, because I gave
up something to do something I loved. So it was kind of easy.  
Q. How much do you hear from comparisons to Shaq and how do you compare
yourself to him?  
GLEN DAVIS: (Laughs). I hear it everywhere I go. I should have wore my shirt.
It says "I am not Shaq." I swear. Tell them. I got a shirt like that. It says
"I am not Shaq." (Laughs). I hear it all the time. Shaq is a great player.
He's top 50, greatest players that ever played the game. So to be to be
compared to him is -- thank you, I appreciate it.  
But, you know, me being the guy that I am, I am a competitive guy. I want to
have my own stamp immortality, you know, every guy strives for immortality.
Wants to live forever. You know, so Shaq is going to live forever. I can't --
I can't live forever being known as "baby Shaq." I want to be my own guy. If
the -- you know, the big baby forever, known as a basketball player, you know,
I know I am easy to adapt to because of my personality, but I can play the
game of basketball, so that's basically it. We got a couple similarities --
just domination, you know, we like to dominate, but that's about it. (Laughs).  
Q. Obviously having Tyrus back has been big help for y'all, specifically
how, what areas have y'alls game is that much better with Tyrus on the
court?  
GLEN DAVIS: Basically it makes -- so easy because his athletic ability jumping
and altering shots and his offensive game, you know, helps our team
tremendously. His impact, we need Tyrus to be successful to do some big things
here. He's big -- he contributes to our team in a lot of ways. So we're glad
that he's on his way back to being healthy and he's a tremendous player.  
_MODERATOR: Thank you very much._

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: What a thrill it is for West Virginia to be back in the
Sweet 16. And then to be playing a team like the University of Texas where we
have been watching them since we played in November and just like many of the
teams that are playing right now have a chance to win it all. And a legitimate
chance of winning it all. So it's a great challenge, great opportunity and
we're just thrilled to be back.  
Q. I know you don't like to give away secrets. How long have you been using
the 1-3-1 and what you liked about it and why you went to it?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: We started using it my last year at Richmond a lot more
than ever which would be now five years ago because we just did not have some
personnel to match up in the Atlantic 10, so we decided to use it. As we used
it more, we found out that it's so unusual that it will work at times against
certain teams and will work at different points in games and that we can't get
out of it quick enough sometimes as well.  
So it's been -- I won't say it's ever been any type of albatross for us, but
it has been a great way that we can stay in some games sometimes. If you stay
long enough in college basketball, you can win at the end.  
Q. You alluded to this a little bit, given the nature and volatility of
college basketball now, is what Duke has done over last 15 years at all
comparable to what UCLA did in the '60s and '70s? And could you comment on how
Jamie Smalligan has done during his red-shirt year left of Butler?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: This is all UCLA obviously it was incredible what they
did. I don't think anybody will ever match that. But I think from what I have
read about those the old NCAA tournament, I used to just follow UCLA and what
they were able to do, and Coach Wooden is probably the greatest coach of all
time. But I think the travel and adversity and things like that that someone
goes through a field of 64 for what Duke has been able to do has to be right
there with UCLA.  
I think getting to the final just getting to the Final 4 is such a monument --
or such a difficult task that it's almost what UCLA used to have to do to win
a National Championship. That's just -- that's not taking anything away from
Coach Wooden. What I am trying to do is say what Coach K K has done has been
incredible.  
Jamie has had a good year. I thought he had a terrific environment in Butler.
I thought the coaches were absolutely terrific to him. He realizes that I
think now, and looks for this opportunity to make himself a better player and
I think as many times he's showed that he has got some pretty good potential
for the future but still has some long ways to go in some areas.  
Q. Your senior class I know you didn't bring in a lot of these guys but some
you did. Talk about other schools you recruited against to get these seniors
to either think about Richmond or come with to you West Virginia?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Only one I didn't recruit to go to West Virginia was
Pittsnogle. The other four were all our staff. Pitts knew I was recruiting,
trying to get him to go to Richmond. He was a young man who we liked to have
at West Virginia now, that he was going to stay in the state and go to West
Virginia University if they wanted him.  
The other -- we sort of found guys that were maybe being underrecruited a
little bit. And Johannes Herber was in Germany. We had heard about him from a
friend of mine. And J.D. Collins we found in the last day of April and we were
looking for leaders and strong men of strong character that could run a team.
Patrick, you know, taking out the garbage one day I said, Do you have anyplace
to play next year? And we ended up getting Patrick. And Mike Gansey we had
played against in the A-10 when I was at Richmond, so as a result I watched
him on tape and ended up saying to my Richmond staff, These are the type of
kids we need to recruit if we want to win at a higher level. And when St.
Bonaventure had that bit of a mess that they had and we finally wanted to
transfer, he became a kid that we were very fortunate to get. Is that all
five? Yes.  
Q. What it is like to go around West Virginia and run into the legacy of the
Jerry West teams? I know you are asked this year in, year out, but I am
curious what it's like for you to go around what you hear from people, how
they feel about you bringing it back to a level?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think what is special about it is that I think before --
West Virginia has had great football tradition, but I know myself growing up
being a basketball fan, that basketball was the sport I followed from West
Virginia, and Jerry West. I think he and Hot Rod -- and Rod Thorn and Fritz
Williams all those guys, everyone who followed college basketball knew what a
great tradition they had there. And the tradition continued with Gale Catlett
as well.  
Jerry is something special. As a result we're just -- to be put in the same
type of category, when people say, hey, the last time they went to a Sweet 16
two years in a row was when Jerry was playing there or -- we're pretty proud
to be able to accomplish that.  
Q. What do people tell you?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I have had 1,000 people tell me that I used to go, you
know, in a pick-up truck with my father and drive up on a mountain and listen
to the games on radio. We must have had a heck of a gym because I have had a
million people say they saw Jerry West play. And but that's where I think that
a lot of people that would be the first baby boomers and those that had just
come back from service, and were in their 30s, you know, became in love with
college basketball was around Jerry and Hot Rod and Rod Thorn.  
Q. Last year your run was one of the more unexpected stories of the
tournament. This year not at all. How have you prepared this team for this
week given what they went through last year, given what they went through, and
have you noticed any differences in the way they've played this week?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Had I known we were going to do what we did last year I
would have kept a journal to try to duplicate what we -- everything from what
time we ate and everything, but I didn't do that. Trying to recall some of the
things.  
I thought what we have accomplished this year although because last year was
so unexpected has been even more complimentary to these kids and our staff
because of the expectations that to go through the Big East, 11 wins, then get
to the Sweet 16 again, it's -- I think it's been more difficult because we
just -- all of a sudden we were 10-and-0 last year then all of a sudden we
were 1-and-5 in the Big East and everybody sort of gave up on us and we made a
great run.  
This year we started 8-and-0 in the Big East, now we had to hang on for dear
life when we had five of our last eight on the road and I think our average
RPI was about 16. We got through that and then had some good first round wins.  
So I think our kids are experienced. If there's a downside to it, it's the win
over Wake Forest last year in triple overtime or double, whatever. It was such
a great win and we came off such a high. This time when we ended up being up
by 20 and then hanging on to win, just took a little bit out of us, a little
luster of the Sweet 16. But these guys got it back now. We're really excited
to be here.  
Q. Talk about your conference, you mentioned along those same lines having
four teams in the Sweet 16 still. Does that more prepare you for this NCAA
tournament or does it beat some teams down?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It's tough -- I think over the long run we'll be able to
know that answer a little bit better. When you see what's happened to go some
teams that played so well in the tournaments and got knocked out in the first
round, there has got to be some correlation there. I think we find out as we
continue to have games where I think we're up to 28 games and between exempt
tournaments, I think one of the things that Coach Krzyzewski has done a great
job of is keeping people fresh.  
What does it take to stay fresh down the stretch. Is hard work -- how much
shooting should you do? I think as we get into this, we have to probably study
that as coaches much more than ever. Coach Boeheim who never does a shoot-
around is a perfect example of longevity by doing less sometimes is more. So
in the league because we're beating each other up -- I have been in a lot of
leagues, Big East is by far to me is the greatest. But I am a bit prejudiced
there, but every league goes through that. There's not too many people and
coaches going to tell you at the end of the year we're not beat up.  
Q. When it comes to 1-3-1 zone does it really help a team if they faced it
once before in a season or no matter how much tape they have seen on it?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It depends because it -- we have played teams before that
absolutely torched it the first time and the second time weren't as
productive. We practice it almost every day but six people, seven people,
people running -- we don't know what people are going to do against it as
well. It's not a gimmick now. It's just a thing that we try to we have a
unique style just given what our -- whether our size, our quickness, things
like that try to play uniquely.  
I would think it would be better, how much better to not -- to face it for the
second time than it would be for the first time. Maybe just slightly. I hope
it makes -- (laughs) I hope there's no difference at all, but I know better
than that.  
Q. Talk about tomorrow night's matchup and specifically what you think might
be the one key of success for you guys?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: If we -- for us, usually comes around making tough shots
and our ability to make open shots. If we can get open shots we need to shoot
those at a very high percentage. You are not going to get very many open shots
against Texas but we'll get a few occasionally. If we get five of those we
have got to make four of them because you are just not going to get many of
those.  
With them, I think that we could be all over some of their guys and they're
still going to make shots. So the ball is going to bounce a little bit, you
know, it's going to bounce one team's way or another's at different points of
the game, and for us it's obviously very important that ball just bounces just
a little enough to the West Virginia guys.  
Q. Any talk of karma around here with what the football team did in this
town a couple of months ago?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: A little bit from the fans on the radio, I believe, few
people have mentioned it to me. But our football stadium is over here and our
basketball stadium is over here and we have only been home for 36 -- home for
about 36 hours before we left, and so no, I didn't pick up on a lot of that. I
know that would an great story line, but I hope there's the same -- I hope
it's the same result, that's for sure, but we would be lying to say that we're
feeling some spiritual advantage in here.  
Q. Would you briefly run through your theory on rebounding and against Texas
rebounding was 54 to 22 and you lost by one point, how that worked out. Could
you do that again?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: We wanted to get rebounds, there is no question -- worked
like crazy to try to get rebounds. And with our recruiting needs in future we
tried to address that. The truth is with some teams it's very difficult to
rebound. What do you do? You don't quit the season and say, okay, we can't
rebound, we might as well just mail it in. You try and find different ways to
play and as you inherit different teams you look at their strengths and
weaknesses and we try to combat our lack of ability to rebound with a
tremendous value for the basketball. And if we get outrebounded by 10 but they
have 10 more turnovers than us and we have seven and they have 17, then the
battle of possession is evened out.  
I would love to have a team one day and I hope to be able to recruit that team
that wins both the rebounding and the turnover advantage, then that's going to
be one tremendous basketball team we would hope. But right now, we just got --
we know our strengths, we know what our weaknesses are and we have to try and
get a good blend of those two and stay in the game.  
Q. Kevin, Ben Howland told the story that when he went down to Pitt that he
went down to recruit you but he knew right away that you were going to West
Virginia, is that accurate and who else other than Pitt was recruiting you?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: When I came out of high school was probably Pitt, West
Virginia and Clemson and he came down, recruited me, offered me a scholarship.
I was playing a summer league game. I wasn't actually sure where I was going,
but pretty much set in mind.  
Q. Your reasons for wanting to stay in West Virginia and how much of that
had to do with the legacy of basketball there and what people thought about
it, the tradition of Jerry West, how much of that just used to be such great
teams in the state?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: I never really thought about that. I didn't really know too
much about the basketball legacy nothing like that. Didn't really pay too much
attention to college basketball until I got to college or my seen in high
school. Wasn't really too worried about what kind of basketball legacy they
had. I wanted to go somewhere I could play and have fun and somewhere close
where my parents would be.  
Q. Talk about when you reflect back to a year ago your emotions going
through this tournament, contrast to where you are now clearly expected to be
here, how you prepared this week maybe differently than did you a year ago?  
MIKE GANSEY: I think this year we had a lot more expectations rather than last
year, last year we kind of came out of nowhere and made it to Elite 8. This
year obviously we taking very, very seriously because we're playing a
tremendous team in Texas. Last couple of days we practiced we're working hard.
Trying to go back to where we were last year. To do that we have got to be a
great team in Texas.  
J.D. COLLINS: I feel like last year we were struggling towards the end of the
year and nobody really gave us a chance in the game so we just want to go out
there and prove everybody wrong. As far as for this year, I think people
doubted us again, but we believed in ourselves again and we expected to win
the first couple of games. We have got to go out there and play fearless
tomorrow, just go out there and compete and try to pull the job.  
Q. Kevin, what were the repercussions of that Texas game for you personally,
those free throws, and how did you handle all that in the next couple of days
after it was all over?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: I kind of tried to forget about it as much as possible
actually. Missed two big free throws; really doubted myself after the game,
didn't want to talk to anybody. I got into the gym the next couple of weeks,
practiced free throws, a couple hundred a day every day until I made them.  
I have learned a lot from that game because I mean, the way we ended that game
we should have won and hopefully we can get it back.  
Q. Along those same lines, Mike talk about the taste I guess from that game,
the revenge factor, and if you were fouled on that last shot attempt?  
MIKE GANSEY: I didn't think I was fouled. I thought it was a tremendous call
by the ref. Aldridge came over and made a tremendous block. It was a tough
game for us to take in last time. I thought we had a great opportunity to win
and Texas just made better plays than us down the stretch, got a couple of
rebounds and it was just a credit to them and hopefully tomorrow we play
better and just kind have come out with a win and do the best we can.  
Q. In light of my question to Kevin before about the legacy of basketball,
for all three of you players, what is it like to be in West Virginia, what
kind of it interaction do you have from fans who might be happy about what you
have done for the program? What you hear from people in West Virginia about
what your class has done for the state?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: We have got a lot of fan mail, a lot of people come up to us
and thank us for just coming to school there and playing basketball after the
year they had before we got there. Just for the fans that we started with if
was 4,000 and now our stadium is now up to 15, 14,000 a game is just
tremendous to have that kind of fan support throughout the past couple of
years. Hopefully we can keep that up.  
MIKE GANSEY: I think a lot of people give us a lot of credit. I remember
someone was telling me yesterday, they are like, You guys have been the
greatest thing ever to West Virginia since Jerry West. You seniors are going
to go down as a great class. You guys, the thing you guys really stress was
team ball. That's what made you guys so special.  
When people can say that to us, it really means a lot because we have worked
really hard tried to represent West Virginia the best we could.  
J.D. COLLINS: The same minds with these guys. The fans really embraces us.
They come out and support us every time we have a game no matter where we're
at. I think they really appreciate what we have done. We have worked to go,
played hard even when times got rough we stuck together and we're just a nice
group of guys that in the community, when you see us out, we speak to
everybody, we're very polite. I think that along with what we have done on the
court have made the people of West Virginia really proud.  
Q. Any of you three would speak to what Frank, his development from last
year to this year, what he's meant to you guys and what he brings to you
guys.  
MIKE GANSEY: Without Frank we won't advance in the Big East tournament. Tyrone
Sally got sick. He stepped in, did a tremendous job. Someone like Frank, his
freshman or sophomore year, he didn't really play that much. Then last year
right at the end we needed him when Tyrone got sick he really stepped his game
up. He's become one of the better passers we have on our team and one of the
better all-around players. Without him we won't be this far as we're right
now.  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: I agree with Mike, he's a tremendous player. He's added a
lot to the game over the past summer. He's done so much like last year we
didn't know he could pass like he can this year, made some tremendous passes.
Everybody knows he can shoot the ball. He's a lot more athletic than people
give him credit for, gets a lot of loose balls and rebounds. Between this year
and next year he will be a ten-times better player too.  
J.D. COLLINS: Frank brings to the team a toughness. You can't measure that,
loose balls, rebounds he's not supposed to get he ends upcoming up with them,
and he's a great shooter, great passer like they said.  
I just think that he's brought so much to the team and toughness is the main
thing that we needed and he's filled in for Tyrone great.  
Q. Talk about the importance of the three-pointer to you guys and how the
personality of the team is when you hit them early and then obviously when you
don't hit them early in a game or if they are not falling.  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: I think as of late we haven't relied on the three as much as
we normally do through the beginning of the year. We kind of relied more on
penetration and kicking and getting 15 foots and jump shots. We really do rely
on the 3. And when we're hitting them early I think the whole team is on. If
we're not then it takes a little effort and time to get different types of
situations to get points.  
MIKE GANSEY: Just like Kevin said, last couple of games we haven't really
relied on threes.  
I think especially when we hit 3s early and obviously a lot of games this year
we have really hit a lot of them, that just feeds off our defense. When we're
hitting 3s everyone is getting excited. It helps us play better defense and
just helps us in other ways. Because they will worry about our 3s, that kind
of opens up some opportunities.  
J.D. COLLINS: With the three ball, like Mike said, it motivates us in every
area of the game, especially on defense. When I see one of these guys make a 3
early, I am feeling confident as well. I think that rubs off on the team and
gets us going.  
Q. Talk about the Big East Conference. Do you feel like it's by far the best
conference? How much does that help you guys in the NCAA tournament?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: One of the better conferences in the country, if not the
best, I think. We have had the top teams in the nation as Villanova and
Connecticut, both number-one seeds in the tournament and going through that
schedule that we have had this year just in the Big East conference and the
tournament, just is unreal. The type of competition you play against night in,
night out, you see one, two point wins every night. You don't see any blow
out. The physicalness of the game is just unreal.  
Q. Can you guys in maybe one or two lines best describe P.J. Tucker? Kevin,
you are kind of the dominating physical force. Kevin, P.J. is the same for
Texas. Describe P.J., who has the better tattoos, you or P.J.?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: He's definitely one of the best players. I think he gets
their team up and gets them going and he's one of their better players on
their team. He's a great player.  
As far as tattoos, I haven't really seen his because a little darker than
mine, so mine stand out. So I am not sure who is got better to the as to.  
MIKE GANSEY: He's a beast, P.J. That's one word to describe him. He's the
heart and soul of that team. He goes as the team goes, that's what makes him
such a great player. He's tough. He shows Texas toughness, and without him,
they won't be a great team. He's what makes their team.  
Q. What makes their zone defense tick?  
MIKE GANSEY: Think it's just our hustle and being active out there. I think
the last couple of games in the NCAA tournament I think our 3 zone has been
very, very effective. Before that towards the end of the year we really didn't
go through the three zone partly it's my fought because I wasn't as active. Me
being the guy at top I have to be the leader and show the hustle right away,
but it's just tough for teams to defends and just hustle and guys being at the
right spot at the right time is very, very key.  
J.D. COLLINS: The 1-3-1 gives opponents a different look, not used to going
against a 1-3-1 with the fastest guys on the baseline, the centers in the
middle, and then you have Mike passing you up top. Just being able to
assimilate that in practice you can't do it because you don't know everything
that we're doing is on -- I just think it's tough for people to prepare for.  
Q. Texas has one of the best front courts in the nation. Speak to that. Also
is it comparable to any of the ones that you saw in the Big East?  
MIKE GANSEY: I would kind of maybe compare them to Rudy Gay, Josh Boone and
Hilton Armstrong. Those three against those three, I think would be a draw.
Three tremendous athletes, three strong guys. Just like UConn, they rebound
very, very well and if you don't rebound with them you are not going to win
many games.  
Q. After the first Texas game when Kevin and Joe both missed those free
throws, did either one of you see any kind of reaction from Kevin in the days
after that game, and did you try to do anything to pick him back up?  
MIKE GANSEY: I could tell Kevin was upset obviously after the game. I know
when Kevin is upset he kind of keeps to himself. Next game Kevin had 27
something points on Kentucky, so I knew he was back to his old self. Obviously
Joe, Joe is obviously upset, but the next day he was back to his normal self.
I think they really put the Texas game behind them and moved on.  
J.D. COLLINS: If you are a competitor you will be mad if you miss those free
throws as well, but the game wasn't lost at the free-throw line. I think Texas
really did a great job of getting offensive rebounds, second chance points
when we stopped them at the end of the game. And as far as the mood after
that, like Mike said, 27 points in that game speaks for itself.

_ATLANTA, GEORGIA_  
  
Q. Physically if you look at your front court you should be able to dominate
West Virginia, but they do some things in their zone to kind of neutralize
that. Speak to that whole matchup, your front court matching up to their
zone?  
COACH RICK BARNES: When you run the 1-3-1 that they do, obviously going to
space you out, going to make you move out and space the floor. They do so much
with their zone. They adjust it, they -- sometimes they will be a little bit
more aggressive. They will get to you, pick up your dribble, back off, and so
they are to do a lot of the different things there, but then on the other end,
you got to guard them.  
That's where they too will spread you out and they are going to make post
players play perimeter defense. I think they are a more athletic team than I
think people give them credit for. I think that they obviously understand what
they are looking for. You look at their players in terms of really
understanding their roles, each individual roles, how they play off each
other, but they cause you problems because the 1-3-1, that's what they
normally like to go to on made baskets to try to space you out, get you to
play further from the basket and hoping you don't handle or get standing
really.  
So you have got to move the ball. You have got to make sure that players are
relocating constantly, that helps so you are not always throwing through the
defense. So yeah, they neutralize what they probably would lack in terms of
like of their physical height or something. But more athletic than anything.  
Q. Most people say that Paulino is the unsung hero on the team. Agree with
that, what has he brought to the table?  
COACH RICK BARNES: He has been the guy that probably everybody is talking
about. He's just kind of glued it all together. He does his job. He can do a
lot of different things. He's very quiet the way he goes about his business.
But we need him to play well. We do. I go back to he's made a lot of big shots
for us this year when a lot of attention has been given to a lot and lot of
other guys. People will be surprised how many big shots he's made for us when
we needed them.  
Q. How far has your team come from the team that turned it over 24 times and
just speak to that growth?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, you go back, this year's team, if you look at our top
6 players or 7 players, if you want to look at the top 7, we have got Daniel
Gibson, sophomore, you've got Kenton who's a senior. You've got Brad Buckman,
who's a senior. P.J. Tucker who's a junior but missed his sophomore year
basically, you got LaMarcus Aldridge who missed his -- basically his freshman
year who is a sophomore. Mike Williams, sophomore. A.J. Abrams is freshman.  
I would think people expected from this team and where we're right now that
this team has done a good job growing. I think that you go back to the West
Virginia game at that point in time, we threw the ball all over Kansas City,
and they capitalized on that end where we were able to even it out a little
bit in that game were even able to get back on the offensive boards and score
from there.  
But we have -- early in the year we did struggle turning the ball over. We
have been better as the year has gone on. That's going to be a big key for us
now. We have got to make sure that we get shots because if we turn it over 24
times here now we won't have a chance.  
Q. Considering the way West Virginia plays offensively and defensively
footballwise, it is like a team having to get ready for a wishbone team
because they are so odd. The fact that you played them earlier this year, does
that help a little bit that the players actually have been up both offensively
and defensively?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know if I will call it a wishbone more than I would
call it that fun and gun because they spread you out, they're going to shoot
25 threes. They average -- they make more threes than any team in the country.
It's almost like playing against a no-huddle offense. They are going to come
down the floor and they quickly -- they do a great job of flowing right into
their offense. They do a great job of creating offense with their defense. Out
front if you don't handle the ball well, those turnovers, those deflections
usually result in easy baskets on the other end.  
So you have ball handling is you have got to handle it. You have got to handle
the ball otherwise they will make you pay on the other end. But they are so --
they are so good at reads off their defense they do a great job of spreading
you, getting into their two-man games where even if you defend it well they
can still make shots. The fact is you know going in they are probably going to
shoot 25 threes, they are capable of making well over half of them.  
Q. Even though the Big 12 hasn't won a National Championship in basketball
yet and your team is still alive in the Sweet 16, is there any trend or
pattern there where would you say kind of the league is right now?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think the league is a young league. We knew that going in
based on what we lost a year ago. I have always said that I think the leagues
cycle, I have always felt that. That's why I don't know if you can ever -- I
guess over time numbers might say one league is better than the other, but I
think year in, year out, leagues just cycle.  
I think a lot of it has to do with some leagues lose players early. Some
leagues have players that stay around a long time, senior teams are always
extremely effective. But I think we went through a cycle right now. But I also
know that next year we have got a lot of guys coming back in our league that
had great success this year, so our league will definitely be better. I will
be disappointed a year from now that our league is not one of those leagues
that put six teams back into this tournament. Because in my eight years there
I think six of those eight, I think we have had at least six teams in, the
last two years I think we went five and four, I think.  
Q. I am hearing some frustration from coaches and players over late-night
drug test after those 10 o'clock games, also some people who would like maybe
time on the floor before the game, that type of thing. Anything about the NCAA
tournament operationally that you think they thought to take a look at?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, I think anything that you do that's of this magnitude
there's always ways you are going to try to improve it. I think the NCAA has
tried to do that every year. I do -- I am a believer in the pod system. I
think that there were many times that we would go into the NCAA tournament, be
at sites in the first round game, nobody's there. That's not what it's about.
Because when everybody thinks of this event they think of the excitement that
goes with it and players were disappointed.  
I remember one year going into New Orleans playing an early game there, I
think it was against Temple. I think that might have been my first year. There
was hardly anybody there, the bands were there, but so I think the pod system
has been good. I think it's tough when like we played Sunday then we turned
around played West Virginia, was in the same position where I think they had
to leave Auburn Hills and get back home, they had to fly. We busted back, and
long trip for us because of the rain. And I think if you had your druthers
you'd prefer to stay Friday, Sunday if you could, but again if it meant giving
up the pod system I'd say no.  
The drug testing, I think what is hard about that's just dehydration, that's
the hardest part. I understand that. I think we all understand that, and but
the hardest part afterwards what they really should do probably is do it prior
to the game, everybody is a little jumpy. They ain't going to the bathroom.
They'd get all the urine samples they needed. But that's the hardest part,
guys having a hard time using the bathroom at that point in time.  
But again I think this thing has grown so big, and it's the best sporting
event because it affects every state in the country. But I am sure one thing
about the NCAA, the practice time too, some coaches would tell you that they
probably want less time because most of us go work out a bit earlier because
we get on a schedule this time of year.  
Like today we'll go out and shoot. We did a little bit earlier, not very much.
You know, one thing if you had more time out here, you are probably go
somewhere, if you do walk-throughs like we do, I don't think I would be
comfortable walking through what we're getting ready to do tomorrow, not that
West Virginia -- they know us as well as anybody. You want some quiet. So
again, sometimes -- I like it right now the time myself because I don't want
to stand around there for an hour. I don't think -- our guys don't need to be
out there for an hour.  
Q. If you can get into LaMarcus's skill a little bit and for a center, is
that a rarity nowadays because you don't see the total package for a center it
seems?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I am not one that puts guys centers, forwards, I mean, I am
in the -- trying to get guys to do -- let them get where they are effective.  
And I have said it before, he's just getting started. Now he has got a lot of
different things he can do that he hasn't done yet because I don't think he's
quite comfortable enough putting it into a game situation. We know he -- you
know, physically people have always tried to get physical with him, push him
away from the basket.  
He can shoot the ball. He's very good shooter. He has got a hook a lot of
different things, really he hasn't shown yet. That's just a matter of time and
maturity that he can do it. But the best part about him, I have said this
before, is I am not sure I have ever been around a player that wants to be
coached any more than LaMarcus Aldridge. And defensively he's going to have a
very tough matchup tomorrow, but he will compete, and he does try to do that
night in, night out.  
Obviously people will talk about him not being as aggressive as he should all
the time, but some of that has to do with his youth. Again, what he's done
this year coming back from last year I think he had a pretty darn good year.  
Q. You talked about their ability to hit the threes and are you saying
basically that you are going to kind of give them that part of the game then
concentrate on other things neutralize other things to --  
COACH RICK BARNES: I didn't say that. No, no. We're not going to give them
anything if we can help it, because again when we watched the tape earlier in
the year, not only did they shoot some threes but they cut us up pretty good
to coming off the high post area and getting the ball there. They back cut us,
they drove us. They do a great job of attacking closeouts on defense where
they drive the ball on you.  
So we're not -- I don't want to give them anything, but there's -- we're going
to have to be conscious of a lot of things and one of it is the fact that,
again, if you give them 3 pointers they can make a bunch of them. They can
make them even if you are guarding them. We have just got to be real solid
defensively of the got to help each other. Can't get so stretched out. We're
worrying about our own man and we're not playing team defense.  
Q. Talk about memories from two years ago that team that you had, how
heartbreaking that was?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I was gonna tell the guy, we are going to give them threes.
You can write that if you want. The game here two years ago? Well, we go back
I think we were disappointed in that game obviously, what I can remember about
it was we were more of an inside team and we lost to Xavier, they were really
more after perimeter-oriented team. I just remember that we were trying to go
at them inside pretty hard and for whatever reason, we didn't -- we weren't
successful with whatever, I don't really remember. I guess you will ask me why
I got thrown out game is that what you want to get to.  
Q. Memories?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Memory was I got thrown out of the game.  
Q. Is that what you remember most?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I remember getting beat and getting thrown out of the game.
I railroad my conversation with the official. But --  
Q. Share that?  
COACH RICK BARNES: In terms of the game itself, again, it was close to the
very end but they beat us and just what happened at the end you hate to see
that happen, but it happened and it was dealt with, I think in the right way
by the NCAA, and but I haven't thought much about that since then.  
Q. You have a freshman Abrams who apparently against West Virginia first
time scored two points. Talk about Kevin Beilein said he's made your team
different over the course of the year and he's a different player now. Talk
about him.  
COACH RICK BARNES: He's different player. He's improved every area of his
game. He's grown. He's always -- back then, if you asked him that day, he'd
probably told you he was the best player. He probably blamed me for only
scoring two points. He's a confident player. He's a player that quickly earned
the respect of his teammates. But the fact that he was going to compete, he
obviously can shoot the basketball. We have all seen that all year.  
Where he's made his biggest gains has probably been -- he's definitely gotten
better defensively, got a ways to go, but has gotten better. He has got much
better understanding I think of playing the point. When he was a high school
player he had to score a lot, and coming in that's where he had to adjust a
little bit because he was thinking shoot first as opposed to setting his
teammates up.  
He's a really nice passer. He will have to be ready tomorrow. I am sure they
will look to put pressure on him in a different way. Teams have always -- try
to come after him this year, the way he handles the ball will be very
important part to us because we're going to need him out there tomorrow.  
Q. P.J., West Virginia has a unique offensive and defensive style. The fact
that you guys have already played them this year, does that help you a little
bit as far as preparation?  
P.J. TUCKER: Yeah, I think it helps both teams. We get a look at the game we
played. Get to see some of the tendencies of both teams. I think we have come
a long way since that game. It's going to be exciting game to watch and be a
part of.  
Q. When you guys look at their rebounding numbers, do you just lick your
chops and what how are they able to force you guys into 24 turnovers in that
first game? -  
P.J. TUCKER: Like I said it was early in the season. A lot of turnovers. We
were just giving the ball away, not being strong with the ball, little 1-3-1
they run is tough sometimes if you don't take care of the ball.  
We definitely capitalized on the boards, I think like we always do try to do
every game. They definitely helped us win that game and we will definitely
look at that coming into this game try to do that.  
DANIEL GIBSON: Definitely it was a game at the beginning of the year, and like
you said the defense is different from other defenses that's we have faced
before, so now I think coming around the second time I think we'll be more
prepared for it and ready to handle it and take care of the ball a little more
and yeah, definitely we feel like we have like one of the top front courts in
the country so we definitely think rebounding will be key tomorrow.  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, like these two guys just said, it was earlier in the
year but Coach also said that everybody is putting a big emphasis on how we
did it on the boards. He said we have to try to -- we wanted to look at them,
try to do something to counter them on the boards. We have to see what they do
and just try to do what we do.  
Q. Do you remember if most of your 3's that game were from the corners and
also what specifically were you guys doing wrong against forced the
turnovers?  
DANIEL GIBSON: Really I think I got a couple of 3s from the corner, but they
were pretty spread out, I think. But yeah, definitely we just have to be a lot
stronger with the basketball and make a lot of pass faking and be strong with
your passes. That's basically it, just understanding the value of the ball is
real important in this game, just you need to take care of it.  
Q. Talk about the heartbreak being here two years ago and losing and what
it's like coming back here?  
P.J. TUCKER: Yeah, I was here. You come in confidence, Sweet 16, got big goals
for yourself and your team to get far, so just to be back here we're happy but
we're not satisfied. We definitely want to take it further and like you said
we set a lot of goals for ourself the beginning of the year and now we got big
time opportunity to try to make it happen.  
So we're excited about being back in Atlanta and excited about making it
happen.  
Q. What do you think your defense is a little bit underrated, people don't
talk enough about Texas's defense what is the key to playing defense for you
guys in general and maybe in this game?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, I think -- I mean I don't think people look at our
defense, I think the things that we can do -- because I think we went into the
last game focusing on that they was a great three-point shooting team and who
was going to try to run them off the line and make them do different things.  
I think our defense is underrated. Going into this game we're trying to be
there on the catch when everyone catches it and just help everybody out when
things start to break down.  
P.J. TUCKER: I guess just consistency, just being able to go out every single
night and play hard, you know, are the biggest things. When it comes to
playing our defense, communicating. Those are the biggest things that we try
to do as a team, try to play hard, go out there and lay it on the line every
single night.  
Q. Are you surprised that the Big 12 has only one team still left in the
tournament and do you guys think the Big East is the dominant conference in
basketball right now?  
DANIEL GIBSON: I think it's definitely a surprise that Big 12 only has one
team standing because it was a really tough year this year. Every game was a
tough game, so you definitely would expect the other teams in your conference
to still be standing. But I also agree that the Big East is a powerful
conference right now. They have a lot of great teams.  
P.J. TUCKER: Big 12 you look at all the teams that are in the Big 12, Kansas,
OU, either one of those teams made pretty good runs to at least get here to
the Sweet 16, even further. It was kind of surprising to see both of those
teams go out in the first round. But the Big East is -- they have been a real
good conference this year. They got like five, six teams in the tournament,
and you know, you got to look for a lot of those teams to get pretty far too.
It was just a real good year for the Big East, I think.  
Q. After this week's practice do you guys feel like something clicked last
weekend that will carryover to this weekend that maybe wasn't happening late
in the season?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Well, I think we have been trying to go at it every year I
think we had ups and downs I think you have to go through it just to learn,
just to learn what you are trying to be around this time.  
So I think the last game showed that we're learning from all those games that
we had earlier in the year, just putting it all together. I think we should be
able to come out strong tomorrow night.  
P.J. TUCKER: I think all year we worked to get to this point. I don't think
you can expect us to play like we played against N.C. State earlier in the
year like in the Guardian's Classic because it just doesn't happen like that.
Each game you go in you try to get better, try to work hard to see where your
team is and where you need to be at the end of the year.  
I think we're just coming down to the wire now, we're going to play our best
basketball, play our hardest basketball and hopefully that will turn into a
good run for us here at the tournament.  
Q. If you look at the matchup physically, your front court should be a
complete mismatch with West Virginia's but they are able to neutralize that by
the one way they play their 1-3-1, talk about facing a zone and the problems
it presents and how you guys will fair against it?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, that zone, we had some problems with the zone last
time, I think like Daniel said we didn't past fake, didn't take care of the
ball as we should have. I think that 1-3-1 it covers. I am 6-11, theirs is
6-9. It kind of cancels us out for us being dominant down low. We have got to
do everything.  
DANIEL GIBSON: Definitely, I think the way that they played their zone is a
lot different from things that we faced, but I think in practice we have added
a few things that I think that we can counter and we can get our big guys more
involved. So I think that, yeah, definitely we have improved there a lot of
areas as far as handling that zone.  
Q. Back in November when y'all played them, can you sort of retell how that
whole last block came about, where you were on the floor, did you see Gansey
out the corner of your eye, were you right there, go into that block that won
the game?  
LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE: They called a timeout. Coach just told us we was going to
try to keep our man in front of us, just let them break up, don't let them
break back. He also told me that I was going to be on the back line. He said
if anybody gets behind me, just try to make a play on it. So I was on the
right side at half court and I was guarding my man. I saw Gansey out of the
corner of my eye. He was on the left side of half court and I just made a run
for it and I got the block and that's how it happened.  
Q. Talk about LaMarcus and the way he has grown and developed this year to
become a dominant offensive player, defensive player, rebounder for your
team?  
DANIEL GIBSON: Yeah, LaMarcus, as a group and as team, we kind of expected it
because of the way that he puts in the work and the time in the gym and trying
to get better. So when he came in, I kind of knew that he was going to
explode, but you really never know until you see it. He came out and just --
he's just been dominant for us in a consistent fact that every night. And it's
just been great to be a part be on the team with him.  
P.J. TUCKER: Yeah, he just works hard, man, when a guy like LaMarcus with a
lot of potential that can do a lot of different things, when you work hard,
you put the hard work to that, there's no stopping. Him working hard and him
not being satisfied with where he is and trying to get better, you just expect
that kind of thing to happen for a guy like him.  
Q. Mr. Tucker, how does your coach handle not yet having the trophy that so
many other coaches at University of Texas have right now, the National
Championship trophy? Anybody kid him about it? Do you Josh him about it? Any
envy?  
P.J. TUCKER: No. Everybody wants to win it. But he doesn't really -- I don't
think he puts extra pressure on himself or on us to feel like just because he
ain't got one that we got to do something.  
We want our coach to definitely have a trophy and be up there with those
coaches and be mentioned with those guys. But we're just going to work hard
and try to get one for him. I think all of us want to win it for him more than
we want to win it for ourselves. We'll try and do that for him.

## March 26, 2006

  

### [Randy Foye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13767)

### [Allan Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13760)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright and student
athletes Randy Foye and Allan Ray. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement._  
JAY WRIGHT: I want to first give Florida Gators and their team, coach the
credit. They played an outstanding game. I mean, we ran into a team today that
played better basketball than us today. I think we, obviously, can play a lot
better, can shoot a lot better, but when that happens, usually the other team
has a lot to do with that. They were really good.  
Joakim Noah was outstanding. We just -- we had a tough time disrupting them
because he gave so much balance to them, and just kept them under control. I
want to make sure -- I know we have to answer questions, but I want to make
sure that our guys and our team feel great about this great season they have
had and how I think they got everything out of what they had, and that's all
we can ask of them.  
We asked these guys to give he is everything they have. This team did. And
care about each other, love each other, and they did. So we are going to suck
up this hurt a little bit tonight, but I am going to make sure these guys feel
real good about themselves. I am going to start working on that right after
this.  
_THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for Randy and Allan._  
Q. Randy, Allan, I know it is early for perspective, but can you just talk a
little bit about how you are feeling right now and what you feel like you did
accomplish in your career here.  
RANDY FOYE: Right now it hurts like to know that we are not going to be able
to play next week in the Final Four. Not even that, just knowing that when
coach has the end-of-the-season meeting and gets ready for the individual
work-outs, that the same class is not going to be here.  
It is just hurt thinking about that. What we accomplished, I think that we
accomplished a lot like in our four-year career here. At the beginning it was
a struggle, but these last two years for the senior class and the junior class
that they went through with us has been great.  
ALLAN RAY: Like Randy said, this is going to hurt for a while, you know. If
you look back at the year we had, you know, we can't be disappointed. We had a
great year. We did a lot of good things. Just like he said, it just hurts, you
know. We are going to look back later on and just look at all the good things
we did throughout the year and we went out fighting today.  
Q. Allan, you had a number of shots that went in and didn't stay down. Did
you feel like you were getting good looks during the game or did they do
something defensively to kind of you get you out of your comfort zone?  
ALLAN RAY: I got a lot of good looks today. Like you say, a lot of them were
in and out. It is part of the game, you know. It just wasn't falling for me
today.  
Q. Can you guys talk about when you came out, you hugged Coach Wright and
had words exchanged. Can you share what you guys said to each other?  
RANDY FOYE: I just told Coach Wright "Thanks for the ride, thanks for pushing
me these four years for me being the man that I am today." He just told me
just keep my head up and keep working hard, and he would always be there for
me.  
Q. Randy, could you just comment on Noah a little bit, your impressions of
him. I noticed you were assigned to guard him at the beginning of the game,
just his impact.  
RANDY FOYE: His impact to the game is he brings like a ton of energy. He is
always running the floor, always on the glass, offensive glass and defensive
glass and he is out there. He is the leader. He is always out there talking to
the points guard, talking to the point guard, he has to keep his head up. He
is like the floor gym for them. He keeps everybody calm on the whole team out
there.  
Q. Randy, you did have it to 3 with 11:37 to go, you had just scored. In
your mind, can you remember about the next three or four minutes what
happened? Was it something you were doing that you couldn't do anymore? Did
they do something? How do you feel about how it got away from you after
that?  
RANDY FOYE: After we cut it to 3, it is just like Florida is a great team,
like all great teams are left, so we made a move, made a run to cut it to 3.
Much credit to Florida, they did what they had to do on the offensive end and
defensive end and turn it over and against us.  
Q. This is for Randy and Allan. Allan, you said you had some decent looks,
but it looked like both of you were working awfully hard for your shots, that
you certainly didn't get one right away and you had to work a lot for them.
Can both of you talk about that a little bit?  
ALLAN RAY: The defense also did a great job. You can't take nothing away from
Florida. Every shot was contested, you know. There were very few open looks.
Florida did a great job in contesting our shots and make sure that we took
tough shots.  
RANDY FOYE: Just like Allan said, Florida did a great job finding our
shooters, defending the 3-point line. Every time we took a shot, they made
sure it was a contested shot.  
Q. Allan, can you explain a little bit what happened on that technical foul
after Nardi went in for a lay-up?  
ALLAN RAY: Just a little pushing and shoving that went on and a couple words
were exchanged.  
Q. You guys pride yourselves on being able to rebound and stick with bigger
teams rebounding. You guys weren't that big on the boards tonight. How do you
explain that or account for that?  
RANDY FOYE: When you look at the stats, they can make you upset. When you look
back, you think what you could have done to change it, but you can't do
nothing now because the game is over with. Florida, they are great. They are a
great all-around team. Joakim Noah and Horford, they are just great on the
glass.  
_THE MODERATOR: Allan, did you want to add to that?_  
ALLAN RAY: No.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes._  
Q. In a game like this you guys want to walk away and feel like you left
everything on the floor. Do you leave the court feeling that way?  
RANDY FOYE: Yeah, I feel that way. We never gave up. We were fighting to the
end. Like he said, a lot of shots didn't fall, had a lot of bad breaks, but we
can't blame no one but ourselves. We know we didn't do it. As far as a team,
we feel like we left it out on the floor.  
ALLAN RAY: Florida, they matched everything we did, you know. We made a run.
They came out and stopped it, you know. If we missed a wide-open shot, they
came down to score, the transition, they got the stops when they needed to,
and they grabbed the big rebounds at the times that they did. Florida just did
a great job today.  
_THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student athletes? Okay. Randy, Allan,
thank you._  
_Questions for coach._  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Florida, obviously, having the four sophomores
pretty much played with a lot of poise tonight. Have you seen a team like this
this young play as well?  
JAY WRIGHT: No, obviously, we have only gotten beat five times. They beat us
pretty good. That is a good point, they did play with great composure. I think
their team is very unselfish, and I think that adds to playing with composure
when it's very obvious no one cares who gets the shots or the credit.  
I also think Joakim Noah and even Horford, for big guys, they handle the ball
against our pressure. That really helps guards with their composure because it
was always an outlet. Anytime our guards got into their guards, it was always
an outlet to one of the forwards. They made some more plays. I was very
impressed with their composure.  
Q. Jay, obviously, it was hard to score in the paint, especially in the
first half. I am sure you credit Noah and Horford. What else factored in
there?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think in the first half we were getting to the rim and we were
getting shots inside. Joakim Noah only had three blocked shots at half time,
but I think he might have changed maybe five or six shots.  
A lot of the plays where Kyle Lowry gets to the rim, fouls or scores, he was
-- Joakim is long enough that he could just change his shot without fouling.
Even Will Sheridan got in there a couple times, extra passes. You can tell
when guys miss shots above the block, when the ball hits above the block, that
means they are trying to get it over a shooter. He changed a lot of shots. You
have Horford in there, too. They really did a good job of using their length
to change shots.  
Q. How much can you see frustration level-wise?  
JAY WRIGHT: We talked about that at half time. I said he has three blocked
shots. Keep taking them. If he blocks them, he blocks them. Don't change
shots. That's easy to say as a coach. When you are a player, you know, you go
by your instincts. You go to put it up, you see a big guy there, you lost it
higher. That's where I think he is good.  
I think both of them, there were a number of times in the second half where we
drove, drew him, dumped it to Will Sheridan and Jason Fraser, and he recovered
and blocked that shot. So he is a unique player. He is -- there is not many
like him. I don't remember anybody that good defensively and offensively in
the perimeter and the post.  
Q. Jay got 73 shots before the game. If you knew you were going to get 73
shots, you have to figure you are going to win this game, right?  
JAY WRIGHT: It's what we try to do. We try to get our shooters shots and take
care of the basketball. We only had six turnovers. You know, at this point in
the season you are playing against great teams. You have your -- you get your
small chances. Getting it back to 5 at half time, I thought as poorly as we
shot the ball, I thought we couldn't shoot it as poorly in the second half, as
was mentioned earlier, and we got it to 3 and I thought, okay, we are not
making shots, we are battling, we are at 3. Now we are going to get this.  
We had a couple looks. We had an open 3 that went in and out, and we had
another break-away that we missed. I think somebody blocked it or changed the
shot, and then that was your chance. When you don't get that against a great
team, then they got an and-1 and I just -- you know, you only get so many
opportunities in a game like this, and we had them and didn't take advantage
of them and they closed us out.  
Q. Jay, I was wondering if you could talk about the technical and how it
seemed also at that point in the game it was back and forth, and it sort of
took the momentum out of your hands and it seemed like it put it in theirs.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, it did. It was a big turnaround because we had the ball. I
still don't understand what was called there. I never got a clear explanation.
I think they are correct. I just didn't understand it. But we had a break-
away, a foul was called, then the technical was called and they got the ball
back. And they hit a 3. Brewer hit a 3.  
That's early in the game. Those things happen. They usually even out in the
second half. You have to recover from that. That was early enough. If
something like that happens late in the game -- but that was early enough. You
have to recover from that. That's what good teams do. That's what happens all
the time.  
Q. Jay, I don't know if there has been a player in college basketball who
has gone through what Jason has gone through, and he probably played the best
game of his season today. I was wondering if you could just reflect on what it
means for him to have come up the today the way he did.  
JAY WRIGHT: I knew someone was going to ask that. I don't have an explanation
for how he does what he does. You know, he spends so much time on his body to
just get himself able to just be 75, 50 percent of the player he was. He works
his butt off. He really made an impact today defensively and on the offensive
glass, a lot of our missed shots, he retrieved and gave us extra
opportunities.  
He did a good job on Horford. I thought he did a good job, even though Horford
is a heck of a player, but he was a presence. That's something we don't have
unless we have him in there. Florida has two of those guys. Jason gave it to
us tonight. I was really happy for him. He is a beautiful young man, and I
know he will feel good about his last game.  
Q. Jay, is Taurean Green an underrated asset for them?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, he probably is because, you know, you don't talk about him a
lot, and he is very steady. He just controls the game, gives people the ball,
and you have to guard him because he can drill 3s, and he made free throws
down the stretch.  
I think one of the unique things about Florida, even as good as Joakim Noah
is, you can't say we are going to stop this guy. They are a team. Billy and I
talked yesterday at practice about how much we both just love our teams, the
kids. We love the kids. They love each other.  
It is just a joy to coach them. You can see that preparing for them. We told
the team going into the game we have to play a better team game than them
because they play great team basketball. Taurean Green is one of those guys.
He could be a guy that gets 19 threes up a game because he is that good of a
shooter. He does whatever is necessary in that game. Having that weapon is
valuable.  
Q. Of course, not to harp on the technical, but did the official give you an
explanation as to why you didn't get the free throw? That ended up being a
7-point swing.  
JAY WRIGHT: They say it was a -- I still don't know if there was a foul called
on the shot or if the guy -- I don't know if there was a foul called and we
didn't get the ball or shoot fouls. Again, it was so early. That stuff, you
know. You can recover from that early in the game easy. There could have been
a play later in the game that went our way that we don't talk about because it
went our way. Billy would probably tell you one of those.  
If something like that happened at the end, we had plenty of time to recover
from that. We still shot 24 percent from the field so -- that wasn't a big
deal.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach._  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you guys.

_MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We have from Florida head code Billy Donovan, Al Horford,
Joakim, Taurean Green, Lee Humphrey, Corey Brewer._  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, you know, coming into this game I want to congratulate
Villanova because they have had an outstanding season, and we have great
respect for their team, the way they played the game, how aggressive they are,
and just the way they have taken on every challenge. We beat a very good
basketball team.  
I told our guys there were going to be three things important in the game, and
one of them we did really well. I thought that our ability to rebound the
basketball, and we gave up entirely too many offensive rebounds, but we did
out-rebound them because of their poor shooting percentage, so to speak.  
I told them our turnovers were going to be critical. We did a much, much
better job in the second half taking care of the basketball. First half we had
too many turnovers. I have said this for a long, long time, the greatest
equalizer is the 3-point line. We were up by 5 and they had 16 offensive
rebounds, and we turned it over 10 times.  
That is generally a disaster for a very, very poor half. Because we defended
the 3-point line, that gave us an opportunity tonight. I think a lot of credit
should go to our coaching staff. All year long Larry Shyatt and Donnie Jones,
and Anthony Grant, in particular, those guys have done a phenomenal job in
terms of getting these guys to understand what they need to do to put
themselves in a position to win.  
They have done a very, very good job just being able to listen and pay
attention and focus in on some things that I think have helped us I will say
that last year's game helped our basketball team playing Villanova. I think
they had a chance to go against Foye and Ray, and the one thing that you can't
really notice on film with their team is their level of quickness at the 4 and
the 5, and the level of pressure that they place on the basketball.  
For a team that do not get a chance to see Villanova a lot, the first time you
see them, it's very impressive. I think last year's game gave us an idea of
what they are going to do and how they are going to play, and maybe helped
those guys a little bit in terms of understanding their personnel.  
I am very, very proud of these kids. It has been a remarkable run up to this
point in time just with so much uncertainty surrounding our season with people
leaving early, and these guys having to step up.  
You know, I thought all these guys played an exceptional game tonight. Joe and
Al did a great job on the backboard, eliminating and alleviating pressure. I
thought Taurean and Lee did a great job in the back court. I thought Lee did
about as good a job as you could do on Foye. The best thing about Foye, he
ended up with 25, but the big thing we didn't give him 3s. We gave him tough
2s that he made.  
Corey was a definite spark plug for us to start the second half because he was
in foul trouble, he did come out, make a couple baskets, and get us going. He
did some good things defensively as well. We are excited about the opportunity
to play next week. I am proud of these kids that are up here and every guy
that's in the locker room.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes. State your name and
affiliation right here in the front row._  
Q. Corey, I saw late in the game about two minutes ago when Joe gave you the
stay focused sign. You kind of gave it back to him. I know that has been
around a long time. How important it was not to get ahead of yourself and feel
that Final Four right there.  
COREY BREWER: You know, all year we have been talking about we have to stay
focused because that's what's going to get us to the Final Four. We have been
focused to this point.  
We were just telling each other we have to stay focused two more minutes, we
are going to Indianapolis. That's what we did. We are on the way to the Final
Four.  
Q. This question is for the four sophomores. You are pretty young, but did
you watch the Fab Five when you were in college, and obviously something about
you guys being sophomores, you come with poise and come with a lot of
confidence, but it seems like there aren't many teams out there that are led
by young players such as yourself.  
AL HORFORD: I went to high school in Michigan, so I have heard of the Fab
Five. They were a great team, and you know what I am saying. We just, you know
what I am saying, I mean, I have heard of them. That's the question. I know
they are an outstanding team, but we are a different team.  
JOAKIM NOAH: I don't know anything about them. I just know that Chris was on
that team, and Jalen Rose, but whatever. The Gators boys are hot right now, so
no comparisons, but we are very happy to be in the Final Four right now, and
just taking possession by possession, game by game, and hopefully we get a
nice little ring in Indianapolis.  
TAUREAN GREEN: That team Chris Webber called a time-out. That's about all I
remember.  
COREY BREWER: Me, too. They called a time-out on TV. I seen it. Fab Five
started baggy shorts. That's all I know.  
JOAKIM NOAH: They had nice kicks, too.  
Q. Taurean and Corey, would you talk about the job you had to do defensively
on Ray and Foye and Lowry.  
LEE HUMPHREY: Coach did a great job with the scouting report and made us aware
of what he wanted us to do. We thought Foye and Ray were shooting 3-pointers,
and we want to make them take tough 2s.  
We thought Lowry's strength was getting to the basket. The best way is to back
off a little bit and contain him off the dribble. We collectively, as a unit,
did a good job executing the game plan.  
TAUREAN GREEN: We knew that Ray, Foye, they were 3-point shooters. We knew
that Foye wasn't a good one-on-one player, so we tried to contain him and make
him take tough shots and stay up on Ray and just try to make him make tough
2s, like he said.  
Q. Joakim, can you address the fact that people didn't think you were going
to do much this year, except you guys.  
JOAKIM NOAH: It's a great feeling when you have a lot of doubters and prove
them wrong. I think it made us a tighter unit at the end of the day, but I
think that even throughout the season we have been through so many different
experiences, winning 17 in a row and losing 3 in a row. It's all about like
when you are young, and you don't play in those situations, you just don't
know. So I think that the more we play through these situations, I think the
better we are going to become.  
Q. Actually maybe Taurean can answer this: David had not played much in the
post season, some mock-up time. You needed him to come in and give you some
minutes today with the foul trouble. You talk about trying to keep him fired
up and keep him focused.  
TAUREAN GREEN: David hasn't gotten the playing time that he wants, but he has
accepted that and we tell him every day, you know, you have got to be ready to
go regardless. Anything can happen, you know.  
Coach told us today he didn't know what to expect. Corey got in foul trouble
and David came in, did a great job, and just stepping in and defending Foye,
yeah. He just did good things for our team and gave us an extra boost when
Corey was in foul trouble.  
JOAKIM NOAH: He has been working hard, too. During the week off he got extra
individuals with the assistant coaches. I definitely want to say, as a
teammate, I am really proud of a guy who wasn't able to play as much as he
wanted to, but he is not giving up. It is just a sign of his strength
mentally, like we definitely needed him today, and just him being ready and
working, doing a little bit extra to help the team just shows what kind of
person and what kind of character this team really has.  
Q. This is for Joakim. What were your thoughts going into the game as far as
Villanova's match-up problem with you? Did you know that they didn't have
anyone to match up with you?  
JOAKIM NOAH: First, when the assistant coach, when Coach Grant put the
personnel together, you should see that film. If you are not on edge after
that personnel tape, then there is going to be a problem because it's scary
when you see what those guys can do, especially when you are putting kind of
like a highlight film of certain individuals. I don't know what ours looks
like, but I wish I could see it. Villanova's is pretty scary. I mean, we were
definitely on edge, but you have to be ready for battle at all times.  
Q. Joakim, you mentioned about proving the doubters wrong. Suddenly you are
going to a Final Four. You guys may be considered the favorite now. How do you
all react to that?  
JOAKIM NOAH: If we worried about as many things -- if we worried about the
things that you guys worried about, our heads would really explode. I think
that we realized that we can't worry about what people are saying and we just
have to stick together and play basketball the way we know how we are capable
of playing.  
So it's great when you have a lot of praise, but at the same time you have to
stay level-headed, stay humble and be hungry, be poor, be driven. P-H-D.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks for that. We will take questions for Coach Donovan._  
Q. Billy, would you talk about the game plan and how it kind of unfolded
defensively for you.  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, you know, coming into this regional Anthony Grant, as
Donnie Jones, once we found out after beating UW-Milwaukee, the amount of tape
those guys watch and what they try to do, Donnie did a phenomenal job with
Georgetown. They are about as hard a team you could possibly prepare for.  
Anthony, and I think along with Larry, because Larry got involved in all of it
and tried to help out as much as he can, but it was hard because Larry was
watching BC. We didn't know who we were going to play if we beat Georgetown.
While Larry was watching BC, Anthony, I mean, he just did a phenomenal job
breaking it down.  
What I mean by that is he went about film a little bit differently. We try to
show personnel and then we try to show what they run. What he ended up doing
was he ended up taking every possession they had against BC so that our guys
could get a feel of what they were trying to do. The hardest thing with them,
with Ray and with Allan, is you can't do both. You cannot take away the 3 and
guard them, and Foye is impossible.  
In other words, our whole thing with them is, you know what, if they pull up
jump shots in the lane, they take runners in the lane, and we are giving up 2,
we are going to live with that. But we are not living with 3s.  
I think what happened was Anthony, it was over an enormous amount of film-
watching, a lot of preparation, a lot of time that went into that, and I think
against Georgetown Donnie Jones was creative in a lot of different ways as was
Anthony.  
It wasn't anything -- see, when you are breaking down a team and you have one
day to prepare, you can't overwhelm your guys with so much stuff that they are
out there thinking. You have to get it really where they understand this is
what we have got to do, and it's simple to them. I think Anthony did a great
job today breaking it down that way for those kids.  
Q. The big picture, two Final Fours in seven years now. Is that a pretty
good answer for those people you talked about yesterday who advised you not to
take this job 10 years ago?  
COACH DONOVAN: You know, I have said this before, one is I am very, very happy
I took on the challenge at Florida, but it makes you realize when you are at a
place like this, there are so many other people that are involved other than
me being a head coach. You have got a great, great group of assistant coaches,
a great training staff, great administration. There is a lot of things that go
into, I think, trying to build up a program.  
I can be the head coach and be a leader, but there are a lot of people who go
through this experience every year that don't get any recognition that play a
major role in all of this. The one thing -- and the reason I did come to
Florida is I just felt like, administratively, there was going to be a strong
commitment to basketball. They were going to try to provide the resources
necessary to compete with some of the better teams that were out there.  
You know, we had great fans, great environment, home court. I think that, you
know, it has been a lot of work, but it has also been rewarding in a lot of
ways.  
Q. Billy, you're coming back to Indianapolis, and you had a lot of NCAA
disappointment in six years, and now you are coming back with a pretty young
team. Just talk about the -- how this team came together and any harmony
coming back to Indianapolis?  
COACH DONOVAN: I really believe this, and I view things differently. During
the NCAA Tournament, if you get knocked out, there is always disappointment,
and sometimes we look at it as, well, if you get to the Sweet 16, Elite Eight
or do this or that, it's okay. To me, whether you lose in the second round or
lose in the Sweet 16 or lose in the Final Four, the goal is to keep playing
until the last possible day and hopefully end your season on a win.  
So I have really never been a big believer in buying into -- well, you know,
you have got to make a deep run into the tournament. The big thing with the
NCAA Tournament, in my opinion, is you have got to get in it on a consistent
basis to do something special. That's really what it comes down to.  
You know what, it ended disappointingly for us in Indianapolis five years ago.
It was a great experience, but it doesn't take away the hurt of being that
close and have an opportunity to play for it all and be on the winning side.  
We played a great Michigan State team that was better than us that night. To
me, I view it differently. I look at North Carolina, Duke, Kentucky, Kansas,
Arizona. The trick is you have to get in on a consistent basis. That's the
whole trick because if you don't get in, you can't do anything.  
So, to me, you know, what I am just as much happy about is that for the last
eight years we have been in every year. You know what over an eight-year
period we went to a Sweet 16, been to our second Final Four and, you know
what, we have gotten knocked out the first and second round a lot. That's what
this tournament is about. That's what it's about.  
So, to me, I am much, much more interested in getting in every single year and
giving yourself a chance to do something. I think too much is made of how deep
you go. I am going to tell you one thing right now, I would much, much rather
have gotten knocked out the first or second round five, six straight years,
and have an opportunity to go back and win it all.  
To me, it's not a lot of difference. When you lose, you lose. We are excited
about going back there. I am just disappointed that maybe it hasn't been in
Indianapolis every single year.  
Q. Billy, Villanova got it to 3. Taurean made a couple of shots, head-on
bank shot with 2 on the clock, and later on in that run he pulls up and takes
a 3 with 26 on the clock. I wondered if you obviously remember those shots,
just how big they were, and how much of an impact they had. They didn't get
another good shot at you the rest of the game.  
COACH DONOVAN: I think our basketball team is -- one of the things that we
have to get better at, and we don't have it, is we are not a basketball team
that understands all the time how to attack with a level of discernment and
decision-making. We have had some games where our guys stay aggressive, but
they sometimes don't understand how to back it up and still -- when you are up
by 11, 12, 13, with 2 to go, and you know they are going to pressure you, you
want to attack them for lay-ups and dunks and fouls.  
You don't want to attack and take quick shots. At the same point, when
Villanova started coming back, I thought it was important that we keep and
maintain a level of aggressiveness. That's what I have tried to do with these
kids this year, is not have them where they are worried about fear of oh, my
gosh, they are making a run and we have to screen better. No, we have to be
aggressive, and they are good decision-makers, play unselfishly, and we have
been able to play as a unit together.  
But I really think Taurean's bank shot was a big shot. I thought Lee
Humphrey's shot for 3 was big in the second half. Villanova made some big
shots last game against BC. BC made some big shots against Villanova. Corey
Brewer made some big shots against Georgetown. You need someone big to make
shots like that once in a while.  
Q. When this season began, what did you really think you had? Did you think
that this was feasible with as much youth and experience as you had?  
COACH DONOVAN: To start this tournament over again, I may not be sitting up
here, you know. It is a one-shot game, one-shot deal. Sometimes the "best"
teams don't always advance on in the NCAA Tournament. That's why there are so
many ups and downs, and that's why there are upsets, because there is one
game. One game, you don't play well that particular night, you are going to go
home.  
This team, starting the season I felt, as a coach, had all the team makeup.
They were unselfish. They wanted to win. They wanted to learn, wanted to work,
wanted to get better. I didn't know if we had enough experience that we would
be able to win basketball games, and a number of basketball games, because
they had never been through it before. I made this comment back in January or
February when we lost three in a row, I said it's good for our team because it
is helping them figure out how to win.  
We didn't figure out how to win basketball games when we were 17-0 because we
were always winning by 12, 14, 15, 18 points and they didn't understand a
missed block-out, a broken defensive assignment, giving up 3-point shots could
cause us to lose.  
Those three losses late helped our team. But I really felt like this team
would play hard, play together and give me everything they have. They have
done that. We have been fortunate it has carried over to Ws.  
Q. Billy, I apologize if you were asked this. This is the first time since
1980 a number 1 seed has not made it to the Final Four. I am just curious if
you think that's reflective of what's happening in college basketball.  
COACH DONOVAN: Well, I mean this with all the compliment you could probably
give a program, possibly give a program, we have entered a stage right now in
college basketball where 15 years ago it would have been maybe totally no way
a team like George Mason could go to a Final Four.  
It just goes to show you how many good coaches there are out there, how many
good players there are out there. On any given night anybody can beat anybody.
George Mason certainly has proven that in this NCAA Tournament over the last
two weeks.  
We, as coaches, use the word parody or whatever word you want to use, the
closeness of how this thing works out. I think sometimes people get so wrapped
up in this guy outcoached this guy, this guy outplayed that guy. It's not
about that. It really isn't.  
Sometimes it comes down to fluke plays. North Carolina won a national
championship, and the program got decimated with early departures, and they
had a fabulous year.  
George Mason has been on a fabulous run. Jim is a Providence college grad, I
have known him a while, happy for him and his program.  
When you get into the NCAA Tournament, if you restarted the program over
again, you would have different teams. That's what happens when you play a
one-shot deal.  
Q. Joakim did not score for a 25-minute stretch, didn't even hardly touch it
on offense. Was this a topic of discussion on your bench and what was going
on?  
COACH DONOVAN: You know, Bob, it was. We talk a lot about that. The problem is
you have to give Villanova credit because of their guards and the way they
front and play defense. I felt like the foul trouble with Corey Brewer,
Taurean Green, we had to play David and Lee Humphrey at the point.  
I felt their defensive pressure did not allow us to get it inside to him.
Villanova probably needs a little more credit. Once we settled in and were
able to weather the foul trouble, I thought the second half we did a better
job.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach._
