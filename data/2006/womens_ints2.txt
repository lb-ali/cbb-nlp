# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2006

  

### [Monique Currie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15647)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Mistie Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15649)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll start with an opening statement by Coach. And then I would
like you to address your questions to the student-athletes first, please.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just congratulations to Maryland. I thought they played an
outstanding game. I thought early on we were the aggressor and I thought we
did a great job. But I thought as the game wore on they became a little more
comfortable and when Toliver hit that shot at the end of regulation, that was
tough for us.  
But I just give them all the credit in the world. They didn't panic when we
went up 10 and stayed with their game and came out on top.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the players, please.  
Q. Mo, what was the feeling at half-time and when did you feel the momentum
shift?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I don't know. We felt great at half-time. I think we thought
we were playing pretty well. We wanted to do a better job of rebounding, but
we felt like we were in a good position to win the game if we continued to
play like we played that entire half.  
I think Maryland had the momentum for almost the entire second half. We didn't
really get a chance to go on a run and they went on a couple runs. And they
hit the big shot to take it into overtime.  
Q. Monique, I know it's difficult so quickly after the game, but can you sum
up your feelings and in having your career end and then what happened
tonight.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I don't know. Well, clearly right now I don't feel very good
about how things ended. It's a tough loss. I think we tried as hard as we
could and we left it out on the floor and that's all that you can really ask
for. But it really hurts right now.  
Q. Mistie, what did you see change in the second half?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: They went on a run and it shifted the momentum. That's about
it.  
Q. Monique, you said that you felt they had the momentum the entire second
half. Was there a point that you noticed where it really did start to shift or
was it something about the start of the second half?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: We scored the first basket of the second half. I think. And
from there we were for the most part exchanging baskets.  
We didn't really get the stops that we needed to get to maintain the lead that
we had. And they just slowly crept up on us and took the lead.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much, we'll let you head back to your
locker room. Congratulations both of you on an outstanding season. We'll go to
questions now for Gail.  
Q. If you could just talk about that momentum shift that they made, because
you were sort of trading baskets and they just kind of all of a sudden, they
were tied with you guys. Was there a point where you kind of started to see
that shifting and then catching --  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think it was gradual. I think they just continued to gain
more confidence the longer they played with us and they just cut into the
lead. Like Monique said, our defense in the second half was not nearly as good
as it was in the first half. They were better in the second half. I think they
became more comfortable. And they were just better and they hit some tough
shots, but they have been hitting those shots all year.  
Q. Were you surprised at all how cool their freshmen played under pressure,
they have been good all year but at that stage of the game with that whole
season on the line?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I seen it too many times. Every time their games go to
overtime, they won every game in overtime. So I've seen many instances where
the pressure is really on that they come through.  
Q. When you do have a lead and then you are going back and forth and just
swapping baskets and not getting that stop, you guys didn't look like it was
sort of frustrating you or bothering you, did you get any sense that your
players were sort of getting a little frustrated that they couldn't get that
stop?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, I think we all felt like we were fine and we were going
to get the stops we needed. They were hitting some great shots. And sometimes
you play great defense and a kid hits a fadeaway three, there's no defense for
that. They hit some really tough shots. So I told the team not to be
frustrated by that. They're great players, they're going to hit some great
shots. And as long as we continued to score on our end, eventually we would
get the stops we needed. I think we all felt that way. Unfortunately, it
didn't work out that way.  
Q. Did you think you missed a chance to bury them in the first half? You
must have missed eight or ten lay-ups and had a number of occasions to make it
a 15- or 20- or 25-point game?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, that certainly would have helped. We were so excited
coming out of the gate. We got great looks and didn't make them pay for it. So
I think that probably would have helped us a great deal had we put those easy
baskets down early and gotten an even bigger lead.  
Q. You've come close before, but never this close; you guys were six seconds
away. How much does this one hurt?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I don't know. I just feel utter disappointment right
now for my players and specifically for my seniors.  
So it's killing me right now. Not for myself, but for my players.  
Q. Before their final possession in regulation who did you want to stop or
was there someone you were expecting to take that shot for them?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: They have some great shooters. We know Toliver has hit a
bunch of big shots for them, but they got so many, Shay Doron, they have been
going to her, she had been hurting us on numerous occasions down the stretch.
So we really had to play everybody. And we switched on all screens, because we
knew they were going to set some screens on the ball to try and get somebody
open, and Ali ended up on Toliver, and she had to shoot over a 6'7" person and
she did.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Gail, I'll let you go back to the locker room and again
congratulations on a great season.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Maryland is now joining us in the interview room. Let's go ahead
and let Brenda make an opening statement and then we'll go to your questions
until the players get here.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, I think we were, I apologize, celebrating and
enjoying this party too long. But first and foremost, it's just unfortunate
that any team had to lose this game.  
What a great game. I thought Duke had a tremendous defensive game plan against
us, really took us out of rhythm for most of the game. And I tell you, Mistie
Williams, Monique Currie, did a tremendous job leading this team all season
long.  
But obviously very proud of these players, with the amount of hard work, the
poise, the confidence they played with, my coaching staff, the assistant
coaches, the support staff, everyone that is involved with Maryland athletics.
I tell you, the fans that were here, they came out in waves and the fans back
home and this is very exciting and we're honored to be the first women's team
to be bringing back a national championship.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Go to questions for the girls first, please.  
Q. Marissa, was there any doubt at all that once you got the game in the
overtime you would win?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Not at all. When Kristi hit that shot, we all went crazy in
the huddle. Overtime is our time. And Shay looked at everybody, what better
way to win a national championship than in overtime, which was our time all
season long.  
Q. Shay, can you talk about the injury, what happened, how did it happen?
And could you have taken the free throws, or did the coach have to call the
time-out for you?  
SHAY DORON: Well, I honestly I lost feeling in my hand for a good few seconds.
I was just trying to move it. I just fell really hard on my elbow and I guess
the vibration, I guess, I don't even know honestly what happened. Our hands
got tangled up and I ended up flipping over her shoulder, so I just fell right
on the elbow. And I wanted to take the free throws, but it was a good decision
not to let me, because I was very emotional and I felt like I could take the
free throws, but our coaching staff is the best in the country and every
decision they make I understand it.  
Q. Question for Marissa: A year ago you were here as a spectator, you and
Kristi, you provided the decisive points, can you just talk about that?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Well, last year when Kristi and I were here sitting in the
arena and we both looked at each other, at one point and I don't remember
which game it was, and just said we're going to be here next year and we're
going to win a national championship.  
Towards the end of the game at half-time my teammates we all just talked and
said, we have been in this position a million times before this season. We
just got to do what we have been doing all season and play as a team and we'll
come out victorious.  
Q. For the players, if you could each answer, Laura Harper was named Most
Outstanding Player, if you each had a vote, who would you vote for?  
SHAY DORON: Every player stepped up so big and in different games and that's
what makes our team so dangerous is you really can't pick out one player that
is outstanding, but obviously we all are. And Harp deserves it just as much as
everyone. But everyone is so important to this team. This team is so deadly at
every single position, which is why we won the national championship, because
nobody can stop us in any position.  
Q. Marissa, first half Coach got in your face big time. What was that
about?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: She knows that that's the best way to get to me, and get
through me. My attitude was horrible the first half, I was hanging my head
because I wasn't knocking down shots and had a lot of turnovers. It wasn't
anything negative she was just saying that I've been playing this game for so
long, just go out there, have fun, put a smile on my face and that this team
needed me in order to win, so I just had to pick up my attitude.  
Q. Kristi, tell us about that great shot and also tell us what your thoughts
were when you looked at the person in front of you as you were taking that
shot.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Oh, we had set -- Jeffrey had set the play to have me go off
one screen and then pass and then flare off another. But in my opinion big-
time players want the ball in big time situations. So I wanted to take the
shot.  
So I went off both and I just kind of saw an opening, and I saw Alison Bales
step up and I said, that's a big girl. She's very long, and I knew if I got it
over her, it felt pretty good. So as soon as it left my hands, I knew it was
going in.  
Q. Laura, what picked up in your game the last few games through the
tournament? What's different than like during the regular season?  
LAURA HARPER: Everyone's game should come out in the tournament. And the
Maryland girls are just hot right now, so. We're just hot right now. And
that's the best way to describe it.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Laura, congratulations on being named Most Outstanding Player.  
LAURA HARPER: Thank you.  
Q. As Shay mentioned, there are a number of members on this team who are
probably deserving of that as well, if had you a vote, what would it be? And
what was your reaction when you heard that were you named Most Outstanding
Player?  
LAURA HARPER: When they were about to say it I was chanting "C Lang" with the
rest of the team and I was like me, I was like, oh, I just wasn't really even
expecting it. I think my dad put it best when I gave him a hug. He said, "You
tell this team that it was a team MVP." We're like the true definition of a
team and tonight the better team won.  
Duke has very, very talented players but we played I think together, we stuck
together, we showed emotion like a team. I mean KT hit an MJ type shot.
Everybody came up big tonight. So you can't even really put an MVP on this
team.  
Q. Crystal, first half it looked like every time you touched the ball there
was Alison and Mistie staring you in the face. Talk about what you did to sort
of respond to that.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Well, I knew they were going to come out doubling, so our
coaches told me that that's what they were going to do and just look for the
open man and that's what I was trying to do.  
Q. Crystal, being double-teamed and not getting as many shots as you
normally would, can you talk about how Laura stepped up tonight the entire
tournament when you're being double-teamed like that?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Laura is a big player and she stepped up again for us. It
shows how great our teams is. We had five players in double figures and I just
love this team. I love this team.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Maryland is just hot right now. We're hot right now.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll let you head back to the locker room. And now let's take
questions for Brenda, please.  
Q. Coach, it seemed to start the second half you were desperately looking
for some kind of spark, the three-point play where Langhorne drives and also
gets the third foul on Lindsey, was that maybe the play that finally jump
started everybody?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, we talked a lot at half-time that we wanted to get the
ball inside a little bit more with Lang only having one touch, but, yeah, I
think that really got us jump started to get some emotion and get some energy,
and I thought at that time after that play our defensive intensity really
picked up.  
Q. Coach, I think you'll fight back a smile to know that have I several text
messages telling me that they're in the streets in College Park. If you could
just talk about where you've brought this program, that's usually a
celebratory dance for the men and to see that happen for your program after
four years, what does that mean to you to know the students are behind you?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I tell you I hope they're celebrating and being smart with
what they're doing back there. Because this should be a time for us to rejoice
and just enjoy the moment. And obviously with the University of Maryland and
our athletic department, each and every team is given that opportunity with
the support that we have from the day I was hired with athletic director
Debbie Yow, this has been so special.  
Our president, president Mote and the support that he gives and the support
and the backing we have here at the University of Maryland is tremendous.  
Q. You talked about the poise that your younger players have had and how
your freshmen haven't really been freshmen because they played so much. But if
you could talk about the way they stepped up especially in overtime, both
Kristi and Marissa to want the ball in those situations.  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think the biggest thing is we never really treated them
as freshmen. From the minute they stepped on campus they didn't act it or
behave like it. They wanted the pressure, they wanted the expectations and I
think you were able to see as the game unfolded our leadership and our
veterans really kind of kept us in the game, and then once our two young
players were able to settle down, they just played with so much confidence.
They have been there, they have practiced, they have put in the time, and they
knew they were going to be able to step up and perform.  
Q. You talked either yesterday or Saturday about the history of this
program, Chris Weller brought a team here 25 years ago, can you talk about
what this all means for people who have been with this program over that
time?  
BRENDA FRESE: It just continues the tradition. When you look back at 25 years
ago we were one of the first teams in the Final Four. And obviously what Chris
Weller was able to do with this, with Maryland, I'm living out a dream. She's
invested so much time and energy and for us to be able to continue on with
this tradition and bring back the first national championship, this is
something pretty special.  
But it speaks volumes of so many people that are involved that deserve this
credit for this championship.  
Q. Can you describe at all how you feel and how long you think it will take
to sink in?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that the thing I enjoy the most is just taking in
everybody else; Shay Doron and her emotions, these players, my parents, my
husband, who would have ever thought in my wildest dreams that I would get two
rings this year, one getting married and two a national championship. So it's
pretty surreal.  
But I think that the thing that's so special is just looking into the eyes of
each and every person, player, staff member, fan, just how much joy is out
there because they understand how much hard work went into this game.  
Q. Can you talk about the half-time message and what you believe really
sparked this team in the second half?  
BRENDA FRESE: We just really talked about -- I told them I was excited because
as bad as we played we were only down by 10. And that we were going to be able
to go out in the second half and we were going to regain our confidence and
our composure and we were going to obviously throw away the first half and
come out 0-0 and be ready to chip that thing away.  
So I think obviously us being able to get them in some early foul trouble and
then I just thought that our defensive intensity really picked up. Shay Doron,
Kristi Toliver, Ashleigh Newman, were really getting aggressive and starting
to chip away at their lead.  
Q. Could you give your version of your discussion with Marissa in the first
half and what you saw in her that you needed to straighten out?  
BRENDA FRESE: Just knowing her and kind of what she thrives on, I knew I
needed to be firm with her. I knew it wasn't going to be a coddling, it just
was a firm action in the sense of hey, we believe in her, she's got to snap
out of this, she's too great of a player to sit and get caught up in the
emotions of the game, and that she just needed to kind of snap out of it, and
that she's needed to start playing with poise and confidence on the floor.  
Q. Much is made about how young your team is, other teams that have come
here haven't been able to sustain a run like this for years to come. Can this
team continue to be good throughout the future?  
BRENDA FRESE: Hey, you know, on the outside, you say absolutely, yes. And you
hope that we're building a dynasty here. But each and every season defines its
own, the players define it with their character and really how they come
together, and so you really have to take each team as its own. I don't think
you can put any different, you know, added pressures and expectations, you
know. I don't even want to look ahead yet to next year, because I want to
enjoy this year. But every team is really -- it depends on your chemistry, how
much you click. And I'll tell you, of all the years I've been coaching, never
have I seen a team go through a season and play for each other the way they
played tonight. And how fitting. I mean this game, five players in double
figures, overtime win, just everything that was a culmination of this season
all wrapped up in this last game.  
Q. Will you talk about Laura Harper and her performance in the last couple
games.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'm so proud, obviously, to be able to see Laura Harper and her
being named the Most Outstanding Player. Obviously when you look at someone
like Laura and all the hard work that had to go into this season, she ruptures
her Achilles' tendon last season, sits out all year, loses the year, and then
for her to be able to come out and perform like she did in this tournament is
just a tremendous thing.  
Q. For that shot that Toliver hit to tie the game, was that what was
designed, was there ever any question that that was going to be the shot or
were you looking for something else and that's just kind of what you got?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, not exactly. My assistant Coach Jeff Walz did a great job
designing the play. We were on the bench and we knew the ball -- we knew we
were going to Kristi Toliver and we knew she wanted to take the shot. We were
setting screens, we were going to look for a little flare action. She decided
to dribble penetrate and keep coming off of screens. Hey whichever way was
going to make her feel comfortable I'm all for it, and she just stepped up
obviously and played with a lot of confidence.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Brenda, congratulations.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2006

  

### [Joni Comstock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13892)

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will let Joni start with an opening statement here and then
we'll go to your questions for either of the two of them.  
JONI COMSTOCK: Thank you Deb. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for
coming this afternoon so we can talk a little bit more about the tournament. I
also want to say, congratulations to the coaches, student-athletes, and
certainly to members of the media. I think that we have all worked effectively
together to continue to support and promote and develop women's basketball.
And I think all of us on the committee feel like it's been another great year.
We're looking forward to the final game tomorrow night and that it's going to
be just, again, just a great ending to a 2006 year.  
As we have the committee members talked in the last few days, we really again
feel like there have been a number of very positive things that have occurred
and I just want to take a moment just to mention a few of those that we really
consider to be highlights. First of all, of course, taking the opportunity to
celebrate the NCAA centennial was a great thing for us this year. The 25th
anniversary of NCAA women's championships and certainly as that centered
around women's basketball and honoring the anniversary team and all of the
festivities related to that.  
In addition, we were pleased with the results of our first move to Selection
Monday. We felt that there were a number of good things with that and
certainly the coverage by ESPN and the hour-long show that we had, we felt
that it was again a very great vehicle for continuing to promote and develop
women's basketball. We have had our 14th consecutive sellout here in Boston,
so we're happy about that and looking forward to a great crowd tomorrow night.
Our Regional attendance was up at all of our sites and that collectively
accounted for an additional 22,000 people seeing those Regional games.  
In addition, the Regional finals posted the second highest ESPN rating ever.
That was also a great thing and the Connecticut-Duke game was the most viewed
Regional in the ESPN history with a 1.95 rating. Overall ESPN has shared with
us that at least at this point their ratings are up over 22 percent. So that's
again certainly something to be very proud of and excited about as it relates
to the development of women's basketball.  
Again, I think it is certainly a tribute to not only the 64 teams in the
tournament, but all of them involved in Division I basketball. I think
certainly it's a tribute to the hard work of our committee and again the
support and the attention that we receive from the media.  
As with each of the years, there's a little controversy, each year, with teams
that maybe are disappointed and have questions about why they were either not
included in the 64 or where they were in the seeding process, and so that is
something that the committee continues to look at, to review very carefully,
because our commitment is to make sure that we continue to support and promote
and do everything that we can do to make women's basketball as great as it
possibly can and to reach its full potential. So again, I thank you for your
coverage and for all you that you do. I know that the hours that you put in
are tremendous and we appreciate it very much.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: And we'll go to questions for either Sue or Joni. Please.  
Q. Joni, you just mentioned 22 percent, is that 22 percent for the whole
tournament?  
JONI COMSTOCK: Yes. Yes. To this point, yes.  
SUE DONOHOE: We held our own in and had a little bit of a decrease first and
second rounds but our Regional semi-finals and Regional finals were so strong.
So overall for all preliminary rounds, we haven't gotten the overnights from
last night, so.  
Q. For both of you, as you look back over the years of growth in the
tournament, are there any particular milestones that strike you? And I'm also
interested to know, are there any particular sponsors from a corporate
standpoint that you can say have really stepped up and supported you more
recently than in the past?  
SUE DONOHOE: Well, I think that when you look at our, the last 25 years, it's
interesting, I had a chance to be in Norfolk as a graduate assistant coach.
And we had attendance of about 8,000. The lowest ticket price was 1.75. And
then five dollars and then boy, we popped it up on the top with a seven dollar
top ticket price. And I look at our attendance record now at 29,619. We set
that in San Antonio. We got a sold out TD Banknorth Garden, especially here at
a ticket price of $140. That to me speaks volumes. Certainly we have still got
a lot of growing up to do. But I think another thing that's really important
to note is as we have grown over 25 years, we have grown in a good way. Our
game has maintained what's good and wholesome about college athletics. And I
think that the more we grow and the milestones that we reach, insuring that we
retain that wholesomeness, that we retain what's unique about women's
basketball. So that would be my answer to that.  
To answer the second part of your question, certainly over the years, and I
hesitate to call out different corporate champions and partners because you
always leave someone out, but the NCAA's been fortunate over the years to have
folks that had a vision that had a connectivity to college athletics and
certainly to women's basketball. I think likewise our Women's Basketball
Coaches Association has had those sort of corporate sponsors and individuals
that really believed in our game. When you look at the exposure that these
corporate champions and partners are getting, and how the brand of some of
these corporate champions and partners connect with the brand of women's
basketball, I think that's pretty exciting. I think more and more you've got
folks out in corporate America that are seeing those connections between
college athletics and particularly women's basketball and what they want to do
to build their brand.  
Q. I'll just take the gloves off right away, there wasn't a little
controversy about the bracket, there was a lot. And a lot of that was that the
RPI seemed to be used when it worked like you wanted it to and it wasn't used
when you didn't. There was also statements made that were in direct
contradiction to things the committee has said before in terms of how they do
the bracket. What's the message teams are supposed to take out of this year,
especially a team like Western Kentucky that played a tough non-conference
schedule, had a 20 RPI, didn't get in, what's the message they're supposed to
take or is that message going to change based on the makeup of the
committee?  
JONI COMSTOCK: We just came from the coaches, we had an opportunity to really
talk with them about that very thing. And I think that, you know, these are,
they're controversial things, they again, as you said, there have been
disappointments. I also think at the same time that that represents one of the
really positive things in terms of the growth of the game, the parity, and the
depth of the really good coaches now that we have in the tournament.  
We shared with the coaches all of the things, I mean, no question about it,
the RPI is one of the tools, and I think the committee the way we like to
describe it is, it's one of the tools that to help us organize the
information. In addition to that, I mean, you're certainly one of the experts,
I don't need to tell you that we look at road wins, conference records, non-
conference record, the overall record, what they did in their last ten games,
what happened in the conference tournament. And we try to weigh all of those
things. And as much as we have tried to continue to maintain certainly
fairness and commitment to it, it is not a science.  
We also shared with the coaches that we're looking forward to our summer
meetings and we'll certainly listen to them and if we need to hone those a
little bit or even maybe identify some priority of those, the criteria that we
look at, then we will certainly consider doing that. But in the case of
Western, we shared with the coaches as I said earlier, that the best of my
memory, we were in a very tough situation this year because we had I think two
remaining slots and about 14 teams that we had to compare. We tried to lay out
the criteria as carefully as we could, and look at all of those 14 teams
across the board. And that's the difficult task of the committee that
ultimately those ten people had to vote and we had to select to the best of
our ability the two that were going to get those remaining slots. But Western
had a great year, we recognized that from the very beginning and we looked
long and hard and again. They were a great team.  
Q. On the selection conference call, your committee refused to name the
order of the how the No. 2 seeds evolved, and that's been done before. So my
question is, why the lack of transparency on that? That's something that
certainly has been put out there and been in the public before.  
SUE DONOHOE: We have, we have always, we have always given the one lines. We
have not given the twos, threes, fours. And so we followed the way we have
done it.  
Q. Is there a reason why you don't give that out?  
SUE DONOHOE: Well, part of it is is because of the decisions that the
committee has to make, once they start with the -- once they seed them, then
once they start putting them in the bracket, it's just something that we have
never shared. We have never, we never have. I don't know much to tell you
beyond that. We have always shared the ones, but we have never gone deeper
than that. Nor have the men's committee.  
Q. Just one last follow-up, is that something you would consider for the
future sharing that since you're not really sure why you haven't shared it
before?  
SUE DONOHOE: Well I think this: I think right now -- and I think any year,
somebody asked me right after the selection show, "Are you going to meet? Are
you going to discuss this this summer?" Because of some of the difficult
decisions that the committee made, we do that every year. The committee sits
down in the summer, in the fall, they sit back down in February. When they do
they're orientation meetings to discuss principles and procedures. I think
anytime we have got an opportunity to make the process better, we will. And if
that's, if that makes the process better, if that builds more consensus and
make it's more transparent, certainly we can talk about it.  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think the committee really views sharing the RPI, as Sue
said, beginning on what, I guess in January, of this year, that we're hoping
that that again is a positive step, that it takes away some of that veil, so
that people can understand what we're seeing, what we're looking at. And the
one other thing that I wanted to mention really and just in just looking at
all of this, we do have the criteria, but I have, I'm sitting here looking at
a number of the committee members in the back row and these women spend a
tremendous amount of time, all 10 members, watching many, many basketball
games. And while we take the criteria, we take the numbers, we take the facts,
we also watch those games, watch those teams. And we start doing that in
November.  
So that it's, that it is really as much as we possibly can. It is a fair
snapshot of the entire year of the teams' performances and trying to make sure
that we look at as many things as we can to again get the best 64 in there and
get them in the right place so that we're representing women's basketball
effectively and that we're providing a great experience for the student-
athletes.  
Q. In previous years the committee has taken pretty good steps to make sure
that teams playing within regions when they got to the regional level had
played on the same day so there was no competitive imbalance. Also that teams
reaching the Final Four had played on the same day. What I mean for example,
as an example, Maryland played, a team I cover, they played on a Saturday,
excuse me, a Sunday, Tuesday, first and second round. Had to play Baylor which
had played on a Saturday, Monday. Here at the Final Four, Maryland has played
a day earlier than the team they played last night. Usually the bracket is
balanced so those things don't happen. Was there something this year that
happened to change that?  
JONI COMSTOCK: Well, I think more than anything, what we try to do first and
foremost is get the teams in the bracket, in the right spot, keep them, as you
said, as close as we can to good geography, to not send them all over the
country. But some, you know, somebody has to play on those certain days. And
so that, we were aware of it, but we, you know, it just wasn't possible for us
to get all of the teams in the bracket so that they were nearby, they were
matched up with the right teams and that they were playing on those same days
for first and second round and regionals.  
Q. How do you see your audience as different from the audience for the men's
game and how does that affect the way you market your game?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think that there is a little bit of a difference. I think that
over the last two and a half years the NCAA, the Division I women's basketball
committee, the issues committee, has undertaken a branding initiative and we
have done a great deal of research to identify who is the women's basketball
fan. And we have done a lot of research to determine how do we change that
casual fan and make them a big fan. How do we take that fan that when they're
flipping television stations they might stop off and watch a women's game for
a little bit, how do we convert that fan to a face-painting, you know, wig-
wearing, fanatic in the arena? And we have taken on this initiative, we know
it's a growth process, with the initiative. But I think that one thing that
you see in the women's game, and we're starting to see little bit of a shift
in the needle, but we have still got our work to do here is, you've got fans
that are very, very loyal to their team. And they will support that team
through thick and thin. They may, they're bigger fans of their team and their
institution than they are of the game of women's basketball.  
So it's a challenge for us to maintain that fan base and that fan connectivity
with their institution and yet expand them to being a fan overall of the game.
So that as we're conducting first and second round sites, they have got an
opportunity on that first round game day to see four of the top 64 teams in
the country. Not only will they come see their institution, but they will come
watch those other three games because it's just good women's basketball. It's
a challenge for us and it's part of what we have got to do and what we have
got to continue to push in order not only to grow our championship, but to
grow regular season women's basketball.  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think just to add to that very quickly, I think two of the
things that have become very, very clear to me in just talking to people this
year is that everyone again recognizes the growth, the competitiveness, but
two of the things that continue to remain very much respected with the women's
game is the quality of play, the great coaching, and then also the
sportsmanship. And that people like to bring whether it's their children or
they like to come and they know that they're going to see again, just very
high quality basketball that's played the way we all want it to be played, and
with again with good sportsmanship. And I think those are definitely, those
are characteristics that our fans are looking for. And I'm proud that we have
in our game.  
Q. Since we have a little, this is for Sue, a little different dynamic going
on this week, any concerns that the game goes one-sided tomorrow night that
ESPN may start changing its focus during the broadcast to Wednesday's event
and the fact that all that's gone on, have you had any problems or anything
extra from your side of the fence?  
SUE DONOHOE: No, not really. We were made aware that WNBA wanted to bring
their draft here and we talked about it. First we talked about it with our
television partner, certainly with the understanding that the focus of this
weekend is on the two semifinal games and a national championship game,
tomorrow night about midnight or 12:30 they can shift their focus. Even as
recent as yesterday we had a direct dialog about that. If there's a natural
fit there to say, you know, a player A who may be a first or second round
draft pick, certainly, but the focus certainly to this point has been on the
women's Final Four, the two semifinal games and it is my expectation and my
understanding that that focus will continue throughout the game tomorrow
night.  
Q. I would like to know what are the factors you'll use in determining
whether moving the selection show to Monday was a success?  
JONI COMSTOCK: Well, I think that just one of the comments I would make again
is the committee has talked about it a little bit, we were very, very pleased
with the presentation of our tournament, of women's basketball, and we thought
that again partnering with ESPN and the way that show was presented was a
very, very good thing for women's basketball. We were down, Sue is sort of the
numbers expert, but we were down a little bit in terms of ratings for that
show. But my personal opinion is it's a blip, that we'll see it jump back up
and I think, again, I would defer a little bit to my colleagues in the back,
but I think that we all feel like we have to continue to separate and advance
the women's game and have it stand on its own two feet and that we did that.  
SUE DONOHOE: I think one thing, I think looking at Sunday evening, because of
the men's games that were on that afternoon, if we had, if we would have had
our selection show on Sunday evening, our selection show would have been about
43, 44 minutes, instead of that 60 minute show. I think the committee's very
aware of some of the challenges that it creates for media across the board,
for electronic and print media. They do. And the committee knew that when they
made this decision that it was, it was a bit of a calculated risk, but it was
a risk that they felt like that in the long run was going to help grow the
championship, grow the game, and again, what we're going to receive out of
Selection Monday is something that will grow over time.  
One of the things that certainly as we talked with ESPN about making this
move, some things that we felt like were really important, not only for
Selection Monday, but for the growth of the game, was an enhanced presence for
women's basketball during the regular season. I think we certainly saw that
from ESPN. We had our big Monday night. I think ESPNU gave us some women's
basketball exposures that we had not had in the past. I think we saw an
expansion of the bottom line. So all of those were parts of the discussion.
Not only was Selection Monday the decision to try and give women's basketball
a place to stand on its own, but also there were other parts attached to that
to say, let's grow during the regular season and then through the championship
as well.  
Q. Just one follow-up on that: Is there any fear that you, by the decision,
you might have alienated or hurt your coverage among the print or local
electronic media because of the time of that selection show?  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think that's something that we have to continue to evaluate.
Obviously that print media is extremely important to us. And so again, my only
comment would be that we're continuing to look at that and we want to make
sure that it's a good decision for everyone involved who is helping us with
the game.  
Q. If you guys both could talk about this: It seems like, I don't think
there's any question whether you admit it or not you have been hamstrung by
the fact that TV is now dictating a lot of what you do. You guys say you
agreed to it, I don't know how much in reality it's them dictating it and how
much it's you agreeing to it, but how much has that affected, for instance,
setting up the brackets, you have challenges that the men's committee doesn't
have, in terms of predetermined sites. You talk about the Selection Monday
show, that it's going to grow, what if it doesn't? Can you sort of talk about
that. Do you guys basically, are you taking a blind leap of faith that what
television says is going to work is going to work?  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think that one of the things, Michelle, you know, you make an
excellent point there, clearly I think the committee recognized the risk
involved in it. This was a discussion with ESPN over a number of years. We
didn't jump into it quickly, they have been suggesting it, we have been
talking about it, and what we try to do is, as Sue mentioned, make sure that
they were good partners with us, so that we could also count on some
additional things from them in terms of promoting that show, promoting the
tournament overall, and so.  
But you're right, it was a risk, and but that's what we have, we have felt
with any number of things with the women's tournament through the years that
we have had to look carefully, but take that leap and hope that we're doing
the right things to support and advance the game. And I don't see this as
anything that's any different. We're hoping that this is going to work out for
the best for the game. If not, I assure you, we will continue to look and
decide what we're going to do instead.  
SUE DONOHOE: A couple other things, I think that you have the media piece of
it and moving to Selection Monday, we spent a great deal of time visiting with
our coaches about Selection Monday, and there was a little bit of a split on
that. Some said, hey, jump out there, gives us an opportunity to stand on our
own, be on our own, get our own exposure and then you had some coaches that
said, you know, why? Why change now? So there was a little bit of a split on
that.  
But a lot of the things that the coaches were concerned about was how is it
going to impact us as a team to travel. If the men announce on Sunday, are we
going to be put at a disadvantage for travel? So those were certainly concerns
that we addressed with before the committee ever made a decision. And quite
candidly, we were better able to service our women's teams this year than we
have ever been able to do and it's because that our travel staff was able to
focus on the women totally without having to share focus with the men's teams
that they were trying to do. And I think another piece of that, not only are
you moving Division I men's basketball, Division I women's basketball, you're
moving Divisions II, III, you're moving ice hockey and you're moving a whole
lot of officials and committee members all at once. So certainly the committee
will continue to look at it, if we're going to grow, we're going to have to
take some risk, and the committee didn't take that decision lightly. I can
promise you that. They did spend probably two and a half, three, four years
just discussing the decision before they were ready to make it.  
Q. You mentioned a while ago that about two and a half years ago you started
some branding initiatives to try to turn casual fans into fanatics. Can you be
a little more specific about what you tried to do and maybe which ones worked
and which ones haven't?  
SUE DONOHOE: Sure. What we did, we identified five attributes that folks
identify with with women's basketball. And Joni mentioned those: High quality
of play, sportsmanship, role models, strong academics. Those type of
attributes that when folks think about Division I, Division II, Division III
women's basketball, they say, that's why I have an interest in basketball. And
so what we have done with the branding initiative, we have reached out to
Divisions I, II and III, because we feel like it's a grass roots effort at all
decisions, we have reached out to each one of our institutions, to the head
coaches, to the marketing director, to the directors of athletics to engage
them and get them activated in the branding initiative. Likewise we reached
out to our Divisions I, II and III conferences and we have asked for a
commitment and an activation from those groups. Last year at our women's Final
Four we had a meeting with our coaches, all of them, all decisions and it was
a call to action and basically here's our tag line for the branding
initiative, "It's all day, every day, our game." And we ask our coaches at the
Division I, II and III level to make that commitment that it is all day, it is
every day, and it is our game. And the measurable outcome for the branding
initiative is to increase our fan base. To increase it at every Division I, II
and III institution. To increase it during the regular season and during the
championship as well.  
If we're going to continue to grow the championship we have got to continue to
grow during the regular season. And so this is a collaborative effort in order
to try and achieve that. That's the measurable outcome, it will take several
years to do it. But it's been amazing to look at some of our institutions and
our conferences and how they have embraced the branding initiative and how
they're trying to roll it into their branding activation either as an
institution or as a conference. So we'll keep working on that.  
Q. In terms of Selection Monday, what sort of timetable have you given
yourselves to determine whether it's going to be successful, what outlets have
you given yourselves whether you can go back to Sundays or make other
alternatives? And also in terms of, have you discussed the travel and trying
to grow your fans, well, what considerations did you take with the fans when
you're giving them one less day to make their travel plans, which is already a
pretty expensive bill.  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think in terms of evaluation of Selection Monday, I think
again what we will be doing this summer is sitting down and looking at it when
we have all facts in about whether -- it's the gamut. You know, the ratings,
attendance, everything related to starting our tournament with that Selection
Monday. See what it looks like and then I think that it will be at that point
where the committee will decide even then if we feel like it has been a good
decision, and we're going to keep it, or if we do feel like it needs our
careful eye, then I think probably at that point we'll put a timeline on it
and decide what we want to do from there.  
Q. Is there any consideration to when you have the eight predetermined sites
for the first two rounds, having either a one or a two seed in each one of the
eight sites? So that in a market like Chicago they have two No. 4 seeds and no
1, 2 or 3 for the first two rounds?  
SUE DONOHOE: Steve, when the committee puts teams into the brackets certainly
they have the principles and procedures by which they put them in. Putting a
No. 1 or a No. 2 seed at a site is not one of the principles that they have to
follow. Do they look at it and do they try and do that? They do as much as
possible. But they can't do that at the expense of the other principles and
procedures by which they have to follow. When you look at your Chicago site
and they didn't have a 1 or they didn't have a 2, but you look at the 4's that
they did have, when you look at a Michigan State and a DePaul and a UW-
Milwaukee, a Kentucky, a Tulsa, you know, certainly you had a great site. But
if they can do that, they will do that. But it's not a principle that they
have to follow.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: I'm going to ask Coach to make an opening comment and we'll only
have the players in here for 15 minutes. Brenda will then stay with me for the
duration, which will be about another 30 minutes after that. So let's let
Brenda make an opening statement.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, obviously I'm extremely excited to be playing in
the first national championship game for our program here at the University of
Maryland. And I'll tell you, these kids, these players, have taken us for a
heck of a ride. We're just looking forward to continuing on with it.  
I think these players have shown time in and time out that they belong here.
And from the moment that they stepped on campus they have shown that they had
a big picture, one goal that they wanted to accomplish and they're one step
away from achieving that goal.  
I want to thank all of our Maryland fans. The amount of support that we had
here in the arena, that have come here, our fans back home, the incredible
support, the phone calls, the e-mail, the buzz that's going on around Maryland
athletics is something pretty special.  
Obviously tomorrow night we're going to have to come out, we're going to have
to have a tremendous game plan against a very talented Duke team with a
tremendous amount of depth and experience. And we're going to have to come out
and obviously be able to defend and rebound against them.  
Obviously a couple things that we're excited about, it's guaranteed tomorrow
night that there's going to be an ACC champion that's going to be a national
champion. From our end it's the fourth time playing Duke, so, again, I think
these players could give you the scouting report by heart at this point.  
We obviously understand how good and how talented Duke is. But I love where
we're at and where we're peaking and the kind of confidence we're playing
with, but Duke has set the bar in our league. They were the ones winning the
titles, winning the championship, and because of it they have all made us a
lot better and have made this Maryland team have to step up and play at an
amazingly high level as well.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the players.  
Q. For any player that would like to answer, do you find it either amusing
or insulting that the conventional notion is that this team is too young to be
having this kind of success right now?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: It is kind of amusing. We don't think that we're that young.
We don't think we're that inexperienced. We have all been playing basketball
forever. We have had overseas experience, with three of these guy, four of
these guys up here. So we're just out having fun, playing basketball, doing
what we do. And as long as we come out with a lot of confidence and keep
playing the way we have been playing offensively and defensively, we'll be
fine.  
Q. For Crystal, Laura and Shay, obviously all of those 14 losses to Duke
weren't yours, but how much of that at one point just became psychological and
do you think beating them in the ACC tournament kind of got that monkey off
your back so to speak?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: That's exactly what I said when we finally beat Duke, the
monkey is off our back. It was really tough playing Duke. They constantly beat
us. We finally got that win off and I think that mentally it's, that fear
against Duke is just gone.  
LAURA HARPER: I think that it's no longer a thing that we really dread playing
or we kind of get nervous or anything, I think it's just another ACC game that
we prepare ourselves to play. I think that beating them in the ACC tournament
definitely gave us the confidence to know that we can compete with them, we
can compete with anyone. So I definitely think that helped.  
SHAY DORON: Well, in the past obviously I just think Duke was better. And
right now I think that it's pretty even with the teams and that's why like
Harp said, we're not nervous and we have proven we can beat them and we know
we can beat them and play with them every game since this season. The last two
games we had, I mean, we had a huge lead on them at half-time that one game,
and so we were in the game with them for a while.  
So we know we can play with this team and that's the biggest difference is
we're just as good this year as they are.  
Q. Question for Marissa, do you see some similarities with the teams with
good post players and good perimeter players?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Definitely. I think we match up so well with them, we can
score from all five positions and they can to. The rebounding, the fast pace
tempo, it's going to be a very fun game, very similar to UNC.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: All right. I'm going to let them go. We'll take questions for
the coach now.  
Q. You were talking about your team peaking at the right time. Is this
essentially a hot team right now or just a team that has really found its
rhythm and groove?  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously a little bit of both. They're really gelling and
understanding whatever is working, they have understood in the NCAA tournament
if we need to go inside we're going to do that, if we need to go outside we'll
execute from that end. But I just really like to see just the amount of
confidence that they're playing with right now and just really playing
unselfish team basketball.  
Q. What is the difference, please, between the Duke team that you beat in
the ACC tournament and the team you're playing now? Have you noticed any
difference since that time?  
BRENDA FRESE: Wow, you know, I've just thought all season long in terms of
when you play Duke and try to match up with them, just they continue to have a
tremendous amount of depth, and I think they're playing with a lot of
confidence right now. I think Pokey Chatman said it pretty well in her press
conference that at one point when they were talking about Duke being down or
struggling in the ACC tournament, that we were all going head to head with
each other, us, Duke and Carolina. So I just see their seniors, their
veterans, really playing, they're poised and they're on a mission and both
teams are going to be hungry and want to win this game.  
Q. Marissa and Crystal played for Coach G over the summer. How do you feel
about that and has it made them better?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, they loved reading all the books that they got to read
this summer with Coach G and the homework assignments that she gave them. But
they really respected playing for her. Gail is a tremendous coach. I know they
learned a lot. I think it really got Marissa prepared for college. Marissa
coming in from high school, the level of intensity that needed to take place
in a practice, in Coach G's practice, got her prepared and made my job a heck
of a lot easier, with Coach G coaching her over the summer. And Crystal, she
just gained so much valuable experience being a leader, named the tricaptain
on that team.  
So nothing but positive things from them spending the time with Gail in the
summer.  
Q. I know that there were a lot of wins this season that your team could
point to as giving them confidence, but beating Duke in that ACC tournament,
did that sort of propel you to the run you've had through the NCAA?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think you can point back to so many of the key games
throughout the season. The Carolina win was pretty special at their place. But
the Duke win, as the players have mentioned, kind of was the monkey off their
back, so to speak, given the history and the tradition that Duke has had
against Maryland. And let's not forget the tradition that Maryland has had in
the past. I think people forget since it was in the '80s, that Maryland still
owns the most ACC titles and has done some pretty special things. So just
being able to get the talent back so we could be able to match up with Duke
and make it a competitive series.  
Q. I've seen a lot of basketball games, I don't think I've ever seen anybody
commit 12 turnovers in one game, let alone for a winning team. So what is it
about Kristi's makeover or whatever that makeup, that allows her to continue
to play and allows you to continue to have faith in her?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think the thing that makes her so special, as you
witnessed her having a tough night with the turnovers, but she kept her head
in the game. And how many freshmen do you know who would, or any player let's
not even tab her as a freshman, make that many mistakes and still be able to
keep their head in the game and stay poised and knock down some really key
shots. And I think we're losing sight of her effort defensively, what she did
against Ivory last night, keeping her in check and making her take difficult
shots. And then just keeping her poise for a 40-minute game. She's the
backbone of this team and she's come so far. In the past that 12 turnovers
would have affected her game and just the fact that she stayed in the game and
stayed positive with this team.  
Q. Duke has won its last two tournament games scoring more than 20 points
below its average. Do you see this as a positive sign that maybe they're a
little out of sync or a warning signal that they can win despite not scoring
80 points?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that shows you the sign of a great team when you can
pull out wins even when you're not scoring a lot of points or maybe, from our
end, at times when we weren't playing some of our best basketball and able to
pull out games, so I don't think at any point -- we have the utmost respect
for Duke, you can never underestimate them, because they're so talented, so
deep, they're so experienced, and they have one goal at hand as well.  
Q. You said something a few seconds ago, people forget in the past and you
said in the '80s about Maryland, a problem or the dilemma this sport has is
its past is always changing. In the '80s I'm not sure how many of us were
watching this. This sport had a full crowd last night and I've been where
there's no one there. What's the next step? How do these guys become a weekly,
daily, monthly event?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first it is my job to keep reminding people of history,
because we feel like it's pretty special at Maryland. But we just continue to
grow the game. And as we have this room filled with media and being able to be
our voice out there and being able to validate what a great game we have here,
to be able to have great games, in the semis and this championship game that
our audience is going to be able to view and then it comes down to the fans
and our supporters to be able to come out and be able to get in the gyms and
be able to fill this audience up.  
Q. You talked the other day about Shay committing, how crucial that was. How
about Crystal's commitment to you, coming that she was two-time state Player
of the Year, McDonald's All-American, how crucial was her commitment to the
program?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, obviously it was huge. We really felt like in the first
class with Shay Doron and Kalika France we were able to secure some of our
guard play. And then in that second class to be able to have Crystal Langhorne
when she could have chosen any school in the country, had narrowed her list.
We were in that mix with UCONN and Tennessee and Florida and Virginia and for
her to be able to say yes to Maryland, was a huge validation to our program.
And really I think opened up the doors to a lot of perspective student-
athletes and recruits out there that, hey, as they see these talented players
committing to Maryland, that Maryland is definitely a top choice.  
Q. We talked a lot about the experience factor last few days, can you
comment a little bit about Shay in that regard, her being sort of the one
that's been here there through the rise to a elite status?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought Shay played a really special game for us last
night. And really throughout the tournament a lot of negative things have been
said about her play and she doesn't need to show up on a stat sheet for us to
show how valuable she is to this team. I just thought her, her leadership last
night, she was really doing all the directing on the defensive end. Her
energy, what she is saying, what she's doing in time-outs, the amount of
confidence that she's really infusing in our players. Those are the unwritten
things that people don't see that she does behind the scenes and she's done it
all season long. It's why she's playing in the national championship game in
three years in such a short time of her career.  
Q. This sort of takes off on the last part of your answer: What was your
timetable when you got the Maryland job? How long did you think it would take
to turn things around?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I never placed a timetable. I never have been smart
enough probably to put a five-year or ten-year plan timetable to put that
together.  
When I spent my one year at Minnesota I remember walking in there and that
team had won eight games and I initially started out hoping we would win 10.
And once that team reached 10 wins in the non-conference play, we upped it to
15 and then to 20. You keep raising the bar as you see a team can handle those
expectations.  
So obviously we felt like as competitive as the ACC was, and where we wanted
to be nationally, that it was going to take obviously some recruiting classes
to be able to get in to reach that level. But I don't think you can set a
timetable or you can't measure, you can't measure a player and a team's heart.
And I think that's the thing that you're seeing with this team being able to
separate themselves.  
Q. Can you talk about the impact Alison Bales has on a game and how maybe
you can use maybe speed or quickness or something to counteract that?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think Alison Bales right now is playing at a high level. Just
watching her through the tournament she's really just been a consistent,
steady force for Duke. Obviously with her size she gives a lot of match-up
problems. And, yeah, you hope that you can use your speed and quickness to
combat the fact that she's 6'7".  
Q. Dissecting Kristi's game a little bit it seemed like you guys were bent
on getting the ball inside early in possessions, especially in the first half
and it led to a few turnovers, also seemed to work for some points. Was that
by design and can you afford to duplicate that strategy against Duke's bigs
tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: That definitely was the game plan. We felt like if we could go
at North Carolina inside, hopefully maybe try to get them in some early foul
trouble, we felt that maybe they didn't have as much depth inside compared to
what they have on the perimeter. But again, I think that you have to probably
read the flow of the game tomorrow night and from our end we usually have been
able to utilize what's been more successful, whether it's our guard play or
our post play, reading the flow of the game.  
Q. You and Gail a lot of people would say that have you a lot of similar
characteristics, meaning when you were in college both of you probably started
to feel like you wanted to become coaches. I wonder if you could sort of talk
about how much you two are alike and just the fact that you are fairly close
in age, in the same conference, and probably are going to be battling each
other for a couple decades at least.  
BRENDA FRESE: I've always had the utmost respect for Gail and I've told her
this time and time again, I just think she's such a class act whether she's
winning or in the moment of defeat she's always a class act with her opponent
and with this conference.  
And I think probably our similarities is we're both so darn passionate about
the sport, about the game, about our student-athletes, and about their best
interests. And I remember actually when I got the Maryland job Gail was one of
the coaches that reached out on my voicemail, left a message. Told me that her
job was going to get a lot harder because she obviously had been in the DC
area, she grabbed up Monique Currie, Wanisha Smith, a lot of talented players
in our area and she knew that that was going to be the first area and
territory that I was going to clamp down on, was just taking care of our home
state and our surrounding area.  
So first class all the way and it's just exciting for both of our programs to
be playing in the national championship game.  
Q. A lot was made about the kids making their first trip to the Final Four,
how about you? Were you a little anxious, nervous, coming into this weekend?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that you go through a whole range of emotions as you're
here and just thinking about the Final Four and a national championship game.
Yeah, definitely, nervous, apprehensive, then you go into emotions that I
remember yesterday kind of getting kind of choked up just thinking about what
this game meant and the meaning of it, and then actually as the days wore on
and got closer to yesterday's game, I just got a real inner sense of peace,
calmness, poise, confidence, and this is from our players' end and a coach's
end, why you've worked so hard. And you shouldn't have nerves at this point,
it should be a level of confidence, because you know you put in all the
preparation and the hard work to get yourself to this point.  
Q. When did you realize that you wanted to be a coach and you would be good
at it?  
BRENDA FRESE: Initially when I was in high school I knew I wanted to be a high
school coach. I kind of had set my goals there. And always remember my dad
telling me, "You can do more. Never underestimate yourself. You can do more
than you think." And it was really in college when I battled through four foot
surgeries when I was at Arizona, and thought I was going to play for the rest
of my life, like most players, and ended up losing most of my junior year and
then my senior year was completely finished with basketball.  
So I got the opportunity to coach at Pima Community College that year. I got
to do it all as an assistant coach. I got to coach and really felt like at
that time this was something that I really loved and didn't want to -- it was
kind of an extension to be a part of a team and to always be coaching you were
always going to be with some wonderful people.  
Q. Two things: One, what did you learn from the last three games with Duke
and maybe what will be your keys? And then second, your decision to open
practice, just wondering what that thought was.  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously with Duke you got to be able to defend, you got to be
able to rebound and they have so many key match-ups, obviously because they
have so much depth, every player that steps on the floor for Duke can score.
Their depth is tremendous. They go nine or ten players deep. So they can
really wear you down. We just have to -- obviously we have to make it
difficult for them in terms of our defensive plan and our rebounding plan.  
In terms of open practice, I'm probably different from most coaches and teams
in that I want the sport to become as visible as possible. And I feel like
that -- I don't have anything to hide. There aren't any secrets that go about
in this business and with this game. It's going to come down to who can stop
who tomorrow night. And I want to be able to give that kind of access to our
media, to still continue to get to know these players, our team, so that they
can be well received and so we can grow this sport, and grow it as far as we
can.  
Q. Can you talk about Marissa Coleman and her intangibles yesterday, passing
the basketball and also rebounding for you guys.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, Marissa was huge, close to a triple-double,
stepped up, made huge free throws for us, tremendous job being unselfish. She
was passing the ball inside and then stepping up and making some key shots and
getting on the glass. I thought her -- obviously her size on the perimeter and
the job that she was able to do on the glass, that's so similar to every
player on this team, whatever it takes to win is what Marissa is going to do.  
Q. You guys have really seemed to embrace the underdog role and keep using
the word respect or disrespect, why does it matter, I mean, as long as you
guys keep winning, why does it matter if you are getting respect?  
BRENDA FRESE: It really doesn't, I know these players in their heart they
understand and, hey, they're playing in the national championship game, but I
think that from anyone's end when you put the kind of hard work and the time
and the energy that you do in your sport, it is nice to be validated and
respected in your sport. And that's, you know, I guess the one last kind of
final stamp of approval that they're looking for.  
Q. Could you size up Newman's contributions last night and going forward,
because it seemed look she was, when you guys forged ahead, making some nice
passes inside, and not that she came from know where, we know of her, but
where is she going? Is she going to play tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Oh, yeah. I thought that Ashley and Jade obviously had a tough
game in terms of the foul trouble that they were in. Both of them. My gosh. I
mean they were so key in terms of the minutes that they did get when they were
in foul trouble, how they defended, and how they played. And I thought
Ashley's play, she's a tough, confident guard for us. And just like we have
seen all season long, different games, different players, step up and the
thing I'll credit Ashley with is she stayed in the game. It's tough when
you're in foul trouble, sometimes you lose your players and I thought she just
stayed poised, stayed confident and she's again going to be someone that needs
to come ready to play tomorrow night.  
Q. You've been able to bring Maryland to elite status in a very short period
of time. With the benefit of a top flight resources and a top flight
university, how far away do you think the women's game is from having a George
Mason and what will it take for that to happen in the women's game?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think we're continuing to keep growing this game, just like
the men have done. So we're obviously getting closer in terms of our depth,
this year you're seeing where we could have had a handful of teams here in the
Final Four. I mean I think a depth of 10 to 12 teams had that possibility. I
think that you're starting to see the resources and the support being put out
there by the administrators and we're just going to continue to grow the game.
I can't tell you how far away that's going to be, I mean, obviously, that's
where you're at, but I'm excited. Parity has arrived, look at this national
championship game and all of us just need to continue to keep working hard to
keep building it even further.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Okay. We're going to let Brenda head back to her locker room
area. Thank you.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Welcome to our press conference to discuss the NCAA's
partnership with Habitat for Humanity and a special Habitat build that's
scheduled for later this spring on in the day. With me to my immediate right
is Sue Donohoe, the NCAA vice president for Division I women's basketball.
Doug Bruno, the WBCA president and head coach at DePaul University. Lisa
Stockton the head coach at Tulane, and Lark Palermo who is executive director
of the Boston Habitat for Humanity office. We're going to allow each to make
an opening statement and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Sue.  
SUE DONOHOE: Thank for joining us this afternoon for certainly something that
we think is an exciting announcement. But more than that, it's a meaningful
tribute to one of our friends in the coaches association, and a very
meaningful way. The home team, NCAA Habitat for Humanity home team is a three-
year partnership between the NCAA and Habitat for Humanity International.
Through the Home Team the NCAA is providing volunteer relief and funds to the
area stricken during the recent hurricanes down in the Gulf Coast area.  
To date the NCAA's committed 2.5 million dollars on an annual basis to the
Home Team partnership and we will continue to provide volunteer assistance
over the next three years. It's our attempt to engage and involve our
membership and our student-athletes in the process of rebuilding an area that
was certainly devastated through the storms. To date we have had several
builds, we had a build at one AA football championship. We had a build at
Division II swimming and diving championship, and in Indianapolis this week as
the men's Final Four has been going on, they had a build and then our build
will take place in the city of Knoxville later this month.  
From day one the WBCA, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association has been in
partnership with our Home Team and when I first made the call to Beth the CEO
of the WBCA, and I said, "Beth, this is something that the NCAA would like to
do, and we would like to partner with your coaches and your membership."
Beth's response was "Count us in. We are on the team." So we're proud that the
WBCA's part of the Home Team and is going to take part in this initiative.  
The other part of the initiative that we're proud to announce today is that we
are conducting an online auction. The auction is live and it's ready to go
right now, and the items that we are auctioning will benefit the Boston
Habitat for Humanity chapter here in your home city. In working with Don
Sterling, Pat Henry, Harvard University and Northeastern University in
figuring out a way that we could leave a footprint here in the city of Boston
through the local organizing committee. It was our hope that through this
online auction we'll be able to provide benefit to the local organization as
well.  
As I mentioned earlier, the auction is live. It is on, it is live now. We have
four silver anniversary commemorative basketballs that have been signed by the
four head coaches of the women's Final Four teams that have been participating
at the Garden. Like we have one silver anniversary team that has been signed
by every member of the 25th anniversary team.  
So those items are available, you can go on. The bidding starts at a hundred
dollars for each basketball, and we're raising the increments at 10 dollars a
bid. So get on bid early, bid often and if you don't, I'll get on and bid
early and often over you. So with those comments, I will, Deb, turn it back to
you.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Okay. Doug. I think have you some comments for us.  
DOUG BRUNO: Yes, this is the ultimate time of the year for March Madness and
basketball competition. And Pokey, if you would mind just standing up and
Carla Berry, would you mind coming out and being recognized before we
introduce Lisa. In the midst of all this competition, coaches overcoming
adversity is what we do, but overcoming the adversity that these coaches have
had to overcome at the beginning and outset of their school year is something
that they don't find in any coaching book. It's something that they don't have
in their playbook. And Pokey, yesterday was, is playing for the national
championship, and she came over to the Jostens lunch to acknowledge Sue Gunter
and it was just a very just unbelievable experience for someone that just five
or six hours later is going to play to continue to fight for the national
championship.  
But she's got a perspective that's bigger than just the game and that's why
she was there yesterday. So Pokey and Carla, we just all like to acknowledge
and thank you both for seeing the big picture and also for what you did last
September as a LSU school when the tragedy of the hurricane hit. So thank you
very much for being here (Applause).  
Lisa Stockton and I have gone around and around. We were in Conference USA
together for a lot of years and some years, one year Tulane would win two, and
then two years DePaul would win two and we would fight back and forth. At the
same time, the relationship between Lisa and I was always a positive one, and
then you always knew that there was so much more there than just a coach. And
now this season again, school's going to start and Lisa and the others, other
universities located in New Orleans have to just up and take their teams and
fight for their lives just to stay alive. And go on live over at Texas Tech
and the University of New Orleans and Champaign. We have to go live at Tyler,
Texas and that's something that you just don't practice, and I, just on behalf
of the WBCA, acknowledge, thank, and just really acknowledge the stars that
you guys were this year and this season of competition and again, Lisa, we're
going to turn it over to you now and you can proceed and great job, Lisa and
you're really something special to our association. Beth Bass is going to come
up and answer questions because do I have to get back to conference captains
meeting.  
So we're going to conference captains, so Beth, if you don't mind coming up
and helping with the questions and I'm going to move on out. So Lisa.  
LISA STOCKTON: When Beth asked me to come and say a few words, you know, this
whole year has certainly been a challenge. We talked about what Pokey and her
staff have been through and all the teams in New Orleans. And I think you
really can take things for granted and just something so devastating can hit
your city. And I've been apart of a city that's one of the most established
and old cities in the country. And the university is 175 years old. And one
day it can change all of that. And we went into August just ready for our
freshmen to come in and life to start and to concentrate on basketball. Once
Hurricane Katrina came through, everything changed. And it is certainly not
calmed down since. It's been a rocky road. But I think that you look at that
and how people have handled these situations and organizations like this are
so inspiring for us.  
In New Orleans, when you drive into the city, you see a sign that says
"Recovery is a marathon, not a sprint." And I think that's what's very
exciting about this commitment from the NCAA and the WBCA and everyone
involved in this, because this isn't going to be -- people's homes and
people's lives will not get back together overnight. It's going to take a long
time. It's going to take a long-time commitment to building the Gulf Coast and
New Orleans back. And I think that we're very, very excited about this
opportunity and I'm proud of our Coaches Association for being a part of it
this.  
When our team was moved, we had four schools that took our athletic teams at
Tulane. We had a lot of damage to our campus. And we didn't know if it would
be a semester or two that we would relocate to Texas. When we were sent to
Texas Tech and those first few days after the storm, I couldn't believe how
many people contacted me or my assistants or administrators just about, "What
can we do to help?" And just at that time it was hard to tell then what we
needed. But one of my first calls was Beth Bass and she just says, you know,
"The association we want to do something, we want to do something to help. We
want to do something to make a difference," and I certainly think this
commitment is going to make a difference.  
When you're around this every day, we got going to work and I see the homes
and I work with people that don't have a home and they're not sure what their
future will be and that's when I really feel I've know about Habitat for
Humanity for a long time. And I certainly have respected what they have done
but now I feel it more than ever, just what a difference you can make in the
lives of people and I'm very excited about that.  
I think the other thing that is very special I think for people in Louisiana,
and I'm sure Pokey looking over there is in this first project the WBCA will
be working with will be dedicated to Sue Gunter. And I think that if she were
here, I'm sure this would be something that she would be very involved with
and very proud to be associated with. But she's a tremendous, has been a
tremendous ambassador of our game and just a legend in the state of Louisiana.
And I'm very proud that this will be dedicated to her.  
In conjunction with the induction to the Hall of Fame in Knoxville, there's
going to be a volunteers will build a habitat, a home to be re-assembled in
Baton Rouge, and it will be a home for a family in Baton Rouge, and I think
that's very exciting and it's a start to rebuilding, and our biggest obstacle
in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast is housing. So we really appreciate everything
that everyone has done and just speaking from people in it every day, we just
thank you so much.  
SUE DONOHOE: Thanks Lisa. Again the build's going to take place April 29th. It
will take place in conjunction with the women's basketball Hall of Fame
induction weekend and we're certainly pleased that the Women's Basketball Hall
of Fame will be a part of it. Interestingly enough, Sue Gunter is a member of
that Hall of Fame. And so there will be a lot of coaches that will descend on
Knoxville that early Saturday morning, there will be a lot of hammering, so
they say, they tell me, a lot of hammering going on but there will be a lot of
friendships shared and a lot of good memories made. Then the house will be
moved down to the Baton Rouge area, and it will be re-assembled there in May,
and then there will be another dedication service in Baton Rouge in early
June. So we're look forward to all pieces of that.  
As I mentioned earlier, in addition to that, we have begun an online auction
today and those proceeds from that auction will stay in this local community.
And we always try to come to a city and leave the city better than when we
came. And certainly that's our hope with the online auction and that the funds
that we raise in that auction will remain in this city and benefit this city.
And we have joining us today Lark Palermo, the executive director from the
Habitat for Humanity Boston chapter. Lark.  
LARK PALERMO: Thank you. On behalf of Habitat for Humanity International, and
Habitat for Humanity Greater Boston, I very much appreciate the generosity of
the NCAA and the WBCA, and also for giving us the opportunity to join you here
today.  
The teams who are participating in the Final Four have worked very, very hard
to be here. And I think it's helpful for everyone to understand that our
Habitat for Humanity families also work very hard for their homes. We're a
nonprofit organization and each family is required to participate in building
their home or someone else's home for a minimum of 300 hours. So we look for
300 hours of sweat equity from each family, as well as a requirement that they
attend 100 hours of home owner education classes.  
And after that, the families are paying off a 25-year mortgage to Habitat at
zero percent interest. So we have a lot of hard-working people, just like we
have a lot of hard-working basketball players at Habitat. This Home Team
partnership is a three-year partnership between the NCAA and Habitat for
Humanity International, which will be raising funds and providing volunteer
labor to assist in the long-term rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast.  
Currently here in Boston our Habitat has the largest density urban project
under construction in the northeast. We're building 22 units of housing in
five different buildings on Blue Hill avenue in Dorchester and this auction is
going to be a huge help to that project.  
I'm hoping it raises a lot of money. If we get a thousand or two thousand
dollars, we're in desperate need of power tools and that's probably what we
would buy. If they can raise $5,000, that's enough for us to buy cabinets for
a kitchen. And that will install a kitchen in one of our units. If we get
something like $20,000, we could easily invest it in a playground that we have
planned for our site there. And in fact, we probably could add a basketball
court. So that the children who are going to be living there, can practice
basketball and maybe be here one day in the Final Four.  
So again, I want to thank the NCAA and the WBCA for inviting us here and I
really want to thank you for your generosity. This is wonderful. Thank you.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you. Are there questions from anybody in the
audience at all about this partnership? If not, we congratulate the NCAA and
Habitat for Humanity on this wonderful project and we wish you the best of
luck. Thank you.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll allow Gail to make an opening statement and then I'll ask
you to point your questions to the players first and then we'll release them
to their breakout sessions and Gail will remain in here with me then for a
while.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just excited to be playing for the national championship. It
feels good to be able to say that. It's been a goal of ours all season long.
We're looking forward to just a tremendous game. Obviously Maryland is playing
excellent basketball and we know it's going to be a great battle.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll go to your questions, please.  
Q. Question for Mistie, can you talk about how badly you want to win this
championship, not only for yourselves but for Coach as well.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Definitely. For the past four years I feel like we have had
the teams that have had the ability to win, we just haven't been able to pull
it off. I think this team is more special than any team I've been on because
of our relationships we have with one another, as well as with the coaches. I
feel like together we are all like one team and we all have one vision and it
just seems that everything's being set up in the right direction and we just
have to finish it off this year.  
Q. For Alison: You played a pretty active center in Sylvia Fowles last
night. You played her to a standstill, a fairly active front court too. How do
you look at neutralizing what they do as far as quickness?  
ALISON BALES: Well, all three of their post players, Langhorne, Harper and
Perry are all really talented, really great players. And I think that we know
we have seen them a lot this season already and I think that we know their
strengths and weaknesses, and I think that we all want to do -- we'll have to
do a good job together on them.  
Q. Monique, what makes this team different than the Final Four teams you've
been a part of before?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Mainly our depth, and our balance. We have players coming in
off the bench who could very well be starting and who contribute a lot. And
our bench definitely makes a difference. When we came to the Final Four when I
was a freshman, we only had eight players. So that gets tiring playing a game
every other day for three weeks almost. So that's the main difference.  
Q. For Monique and Mistie, usually when one team beats another team as many
times as you guys have beaten Maryland, there's something more than just
physical there. Was there a point during those games when you like looked at
them and saw that maybe they were perhaps psychologically beaten, and have
they gotten some edge back by beating you guys in the ACC tournament?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: I don't think it was mental. Maryland's a great team. And the
whole entire ACC is just amazing. I think that Brenda Frese has done a great
job getting the players that she does need and she's a tremendous -- she
inspires her players to play their best every game. It's tough to be beat a
team three times in a row, North Carolina or Maryland. And we know each other
so well, it's going to be difficult to stop one another.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Yeah, we're both extremely familiar with one another and we'll
have to go out there and play hard, just like they will. And whoever wants it
more will pretty much win the game.  
Q. Monique and Mistie too, coaches are always telling players this is your
time, this is your special time to go out there and do what really you've
worked so hard for. In your mind, is this Coach's time?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I think it's her time. Most definitely. And we always talk
about or everyone always talks about that I wanted to come back so I could win
a championship. But for me, seriously, I wanted to do it for Coach G because I
know how hard she works and how dedicated she is to this program. And even
though we have been a successful program without a national championship, I
think that would definitely separate us from some of the other good and great
programs and put us in that elite class of programs.  
So this is for her. This is her team and she's brought us a long way and
developed this program into a national powerhouse, and to finally get a
national championship will definitely lead us in the right direction in taking
another step for the program.  
Q. This is for Mistie and for Alison: Looking at the two match-ups we saw in
the semi-finals, front court play really was a huge difference I believe in
both games. Can you talk about the pending matchup with this front court
against Maryland and how have they rated in terms of the front courts you've
faced in the conference and how have they prepared you for this game that
you're getting ready to play against?  
ALISON BALES: I think that Maryland is one of the most talented and also one
of the deepest. They don't have one post player that's of amazing quality,
they have three, especially in Harper and Langhorne. You have to be able to
guard both of them. You can't really help off one, you have to be able to stay
with both of them all the time.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, just playing them three times has prepared us for any
other front court that we have run into this entire tournament. All of them
are so talented and All-Americans and it just doesn't stop there. They're a
tremendous team and I think that we're as prepared as we can be at this point
in time.  
Q. This is also for Mistie and Alison: Kristi Toliver was saying that the
way to beat you guys is with speed, their front court is faster than you guys,
then they will beat you down court. I was just wondering how do you compete
against that kind of speed?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Okay. Um, well that's nice.  
(Laughter.) I think that our post players are very athletic and I think that
we have a height advantage and it's great that she says she can beat us down
the court. That just makes us want to work hard and make sure that we get the
job on defense done and that's all you really could say about that.  
ALISON BALES: I have no doubt that Kristi Toliver is faster than I am down the
court.  
(Laughter.) But I won't be playing against her, I won't be guarding her, so.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Lindsey, how has your perception of Maryland changed since the last
victory in the ACC tournament?  
LINDSEY HARDING: Again, it just shows how good Maryland is. The first time we
did play them we did win significantly, but I knew that they were going to
come back and come back stronger. We just can't sleep on them, we have to play
hard. I have a lot of respect for them and their program. And it's going to be
a hard fought battle.  
Q. Following up on Kristi, what she said, not so much what she said but they
seem to have a swagger about them, a lot of confidence, perhaps more than you
might expect from a young team. Is that because they're too young to know
better or could you sense that swagger developing over the three games of the
season when you beat them once easily and then it got tough and tougher and
eventually they beat you.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, they've gotten it done, they won big games, they bet us,
beat North Carolina, and here they are playing in the national championship.
So they earned that right to walk around like they -- walk around proud and
feeling accomplished, because they have accomplished big things, despite their
youth. They really don't play like they are a group of freshmen and sophomores
and a junior. So they need that to come out here and play. You have to have
confidence.  
Q. For Lindsey, given Kristin Toliver's comments do you feel like it will be
incumbent upon you to make sure that she doesn't run up and down that court as
freely as some people might think?  
LINDSEY HARDING: Yeah, definitely. I know that I'm going to pressure her to
make every shot of hers difficult. She's been throughout this tournament
hitting big shots for them and been playing with more confidence. So she's
been doing a great job with that. But it's definitely my job to slow her down.  
Q. For Mistie, is your dad going to keep his word and show up tomorrow?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: No. No, he's not coming. Nope.  
Q. Monique, there's a lot of story lines about you coming back and you just
answered one of those questions by saying "this is for Coach." Do you think
that maybe you're creating pressure to accomplish this for something outside
of this team, these individuals, the whole idea that you said in Bridgeport,
there's a knock on our program that we haven't won the national championship.
Is that creating kind of an external pressure that you have to deal with that
Maryland doesn't, as the upstart?   
MONIQUE CURRIE: That's a possibility. But this whole entire tournament is
pressure. And you're playing under extreme circumstances. You're playing some
teams that you're not familiar with, and with a short amount of time to
prepare for each team. So we have to prepare ourselves as best as we can, and
I think we work well under pressure and we feel like we have been the
underdogs throughout this tournament and we have come out and proved to
everybody else that we are here to play and we are here to win it all. And
that's what we plan on doing on Tuesday.  
But the pressure doesn't get to us. I don't think it has thus far and we just
play Duke basketball, and we have been successful doing that.  
Q. Question for Wanisha, you know what it's like to be a freshman point
guard when you have a lot on your shoulders, can you talk about how much you
learned last year and then what it's like having Lindsey back this year and
how good of a back court you guys have been together?  
WANISHA SMITH: It's great. I feel like my freshman year was a whole learning
experience. Knowing what Coach G wants for me and knowing how to run the team
at such an early age, and I feel like coming into the tournament with Lindsey,
it takes a lot of pressure off me and hopefully it will take a lot of pressure
off her with the way we perform. But I don't know, I just learned how to be
mentally prepared and that's kind of helped me.  
Q. For Lindsey, last night Coach G kind of complimented you on your
defensive play helping double down in the post against Seimone Augustus. Do
you feel that that's going to be another thing that you're going to have to do
tomorrow night too, given the front court you're facing or strictly are you
going to concentrate on putting pressure on the point?  
LINDSEY HARDING: It's going to be huge. Like Ali said before, it's going to be
all about team defense. Yes, we have to contain our own man, but we also have
to be in help, and ready to help our teammates out. So defensive rebounding I
feel is going to be huge in this championship game.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, we're going release you back now to your breakout
sessions. We'll take questions for Coach.  
Q. I heard you describe Mistie Williams as one of the most mature players
that you've ever coached. Can you just talk a little bit about her development
and what she has meant to this team this year.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Mistie, even when we recruited her, she was wise beyond her
years. She was the most mature recruit I ever had. She was always extremely
organized and thinking ahead and planning ahead and didn't ever act like a
freshman.  
I think she's grown into a great leader for us. And she's our most vocal
leader. She's one of our hardest workers. I think she's really developed her
game; when she came in she really didn't have any post moves and now she's got
multiple moves inside. She's become a good passer at that high post, can hit
the high post shot. And takes great pride in her defense as well.  
Q. Could you just comment on the correlation between Alison's ability as a
shot-blocker and rebounder to make you a faster team pushing the ball up the
floor?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I think Ali -- you know, Lindsey sets the tone for us
on both ends of the floor, but Ali really gets us going on both ends of the
floor. When she's blocking shots, I think it's extremely intimidating to the
opponent, and it also changes shots, it also gets our transition game going.
She gets the ball out quickly. It used to be where she would block the shots
and she almost blocked them out of bounds and now she's gotten much better,
she either blocks it and gets the rebound or she blocks it and her teammates
know to go after the ball. So she helps us.  
And when she's aggressive on the offensive end down low, that's just such a
big bonus for us as well.  
Q. You were asked the other day about the pressure involved with being a No.
1 seed again, not having any titles, you said you didn't think there was any
pressure. Why not?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Because I guess I've let that pressure go. I've let that
worry go about winning the national title. I feel like we're going to win it
at some point. I know we're going to win it at some point and so that's given
me great freedom, great confidence. I think I've learned not to try to force
it to happen.  
I think in the past perhaps I was so, I wanted it so badly for the team that I
tried to force it to happen and I found out that that's not really possible.
And just to try to control what I can, which is the preparation of my team,
and let everything else fall into place.  
Q. Could you talk about Monique's play this year and sort of that fine line
she walks between trying to be aggressive but not doing too much.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, it's a fine line. It is a fine line. And we have asked
her to really move the ball and shoot the ball less and like I said before, we
don't run many plays for her at all, which is different than we had in the
past. But the grand scheme was to make everybody feel important. So that if
and when she had an off-night, in a big game, her teammates would feel
comfortable and confident that we were still going to win. Because that they
knew they could score as well.  
So her minutes have gone down, her shots have gone down, her productivity per
minute has gone up. And she understands and accepts that that's made us a
better team. And the fact that we have really put an emphasis on our post play
this year has helped us. So she's been really the consummate leader for us in
that she's been willing to sacrifice for the greater good.  
Q. What, if anything, are you doing differently this week as opposed to
previous trips to the Final Four to prepare the team?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Not much, really. Just much more aware and have talked to
the team a little bit more about taking care of themselves, and resting.
Because it is very fatiguing and can be somewhat overwhelming, especially for
the young players with all of the media attention, and all the things that are
required of them. So I talked to them about telling their family and friends
and people that all of a sudden want to jump on the bandwagon that there's no
more room. And that we just need to focus on ourselves and get rest, stay in
the room and stay fresh and stay focused.  
Q. With what Monique said earlier about wanting to win it for you, can you
kind of talk about the relationship that you have being that she has came back
for her fifth year and overcame the injuries, decided to stay around with the
program?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I just have so much respect for Monique. I wasn't sure last
year if she was going to stay or go, if she would have gone she was going to
be one of the top draft picks and there were a lot of reasons for her to go.
She already had her degree. She could easily move on. But the fact that she
decided to stay really for her team and for her coaches as well, you know, to
try and do something really special while getting her Master's Degree I think
speaks volumes to the type of person that she is.  
Q. On Maryland's side what concerns you most, the brashness of their youth
or the fact that they can basically play free and easy because they weren't
expected to do this well this soon?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Hmm, that's a little bit of everything. They're an
exceptional team. They can score at all five positions and they got kids
coming in off the bench that are very good as well. They push the ball, they
play great defense. Prolific three-point shooting team and now Harper has
really stepped up, and really the last time that we played them in the
tournament that was I think a break-out game for her. So with the added
scoring, it makes it much more difficult to defend Langhorne. And she's very
special.  
So the fact that they are playing with great freedom, they seem to have a chip
on their shoulder while they have been here talking about respect and I don't
think anybody now could possibly not respect them. So it would be interesting
if they can still say that because in my mind they beat the No. 1 team in the
country twice. So I see them right now as the No. 1 team in the country. We're
just going to go out and try and beat them.  
Q. Could you break down maybe the three Final Four teams that Monique has
been a part of and is there something that separates this group from those?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: All I can say is probably the biggest difference in this
team and those teams we were extremely guard oriented the first two trips. And
with Alana Beard and Iciss, even though she was a post, she never scored
really in the post. She was a face-up post player, finesse post player so, we
are a finesse team, guard-oriented team and we didn't have great balance. We
had two really prolific scorers. This team, we're much more balanced. We have
got a good inside-outside attack. We made a concerted effort to develop that
post game and there's just much greater balance on our team. So that if the
outside game isn't working for us, we can pound it inside and vice versa.  
Q. You had Crystal and Marissa over the summer, what did you learn about
them and has it helped you prepare and how hard was it to let them go at the
end of the summer?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Crystal and Marissa, I mean, they're, we tried to recruit
both of them, we didn't even get in on Crystal, but Marissa we thought early
on we thought we had a pretty good shot at her because she and Monique were
pretty good friends. But they're both, not just great players, but they're
great people as well.  
So I think I spent half the time with Crystal, she would make a great play and
I would be on the sidelines cheering, "Yea Crystal," and then I would be
going, "oh my God." Because I knew I had to play against her for three more
years. So she's just an incredible player. They both are.  
Marissa, I said when we were recruiting her that I thought she was a
combination of Monique Currie and Alana Beard because she was strong like
Monique and smooth like Alana, and that's a pretty special combination.  
Q. I can't imagine there's anything new that you'll learn for the third time
around against Maryland, but can you give us your take on that impending
matchup between Harding and Toliver and how has that panned out for you in the
two previous matchups?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, the first time we played, Kristi was coming off of an
injury so she didn't start for them. But when she was in, she was extremely
productive. She came in, she hadn't hit a three in any of the games. I don't
think she had made a basket actually. She had played like five games before
our game and hadn't scored. And then she came to our game and she lit it up.
She's played very well, I think, in really all three of the matchups against
us. So they have done a great job when they get the ball into the post. I
think their post players have done a really good job of finding her and again
you have seen it, she makes big baskets for them. She has no fear, it's tough
to defend that little fadeaway that she's got because she creates space. So
you can be in her face but she take as little step back and it's hard to
defend.  
Q. Brenda said that one of her decisions to open practice today was sort of
like sort of expose women's basketball to a broader audience, can you imagine
on your answer sort of taking that hit for the good of women's basketball, the
day before a national championship?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I didn't know she had opened practice, so. No, I think that
it probably goes to everything they have done up to this point. They have
really opened up the doors, they have had the media on their bus and at their
training tables, and so it makes sense now that she would continue to do that
and her team has played extremely well. So I think I would worry about my
team's focus, but we're just in a different place, so what works for one team
doesn't necessarily work for another. But it's worked for them.  
Q. You talked about trying to force it to get a championship, what kind of
things do you think you did that might have been forcing it?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I knew Alana Beard was our best player, so we ran most
of our sets for Alana throughout the year, really because she was so good. And
when we got in the tournament I kept trying to go to Alana and unfortunately
she wasn't having one of her best nights. And instead of understanding
probably that I needed to have a team that was a little bit more balanced
throughout the season, I just, we were relying on one person. And I think too
there was a lot of stress involved because specifically her senior year we
were expected to win it. We were going, we were the No. 1 going into the
tournament. And we felt the pressure but we never talked about it, like it
would go away if we didn't talk about it.  
And I learned from that. I think to just really get a better feel for my team
and see how they're feeling, what they're thinking and sometimes they do feel
stress, and they need to get it out and sometimes you just need to talk it out
if that's the case.  
Q. In looking at the three games, the two wins and the one loss, is there
any one or two things that you look back at that game you lost and see, this
is why, this is what we didn't do that we may have done in the two wins? And
secondly, without giving away too many secrets, what do you feel is going to
be the key tomorrow night?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, in the third game we got outrebounded, so that's
always a concern for us. We take great pride in our rebounding and obviously
Maryland's an excellent rebounding team; they lead the nation. But that was
the game that we got outrebounded and they shot I think 13 more, made 13 more
free throws than we did. And in that last game, and I think it was, they were
much more aggressive than we were, attacking the basket. So therefore, they
got to the free throw line. So I think that we, they got us back on our heels
a little bit, specifically in that third game and we need to just be more
aggressive now.  
So I think the keys as always, it's not a cliche, but we all say it, it's
going to be about defense. It's going to be about rebounding.  
Q. How is your team feeling and what are they thinking? Are they nervous
going into this game? Are they feeling the weight of a great senior class
that's leaving?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No. Right now I think we're in a really good place. Even
before the game last night in the locker room while we were talking, you could
just sense a very quiet confidence. And it was good to see. And I thought we
started off real well. I think playing Maryland. And I said this when Maryland
played North Carolina, I think when you're dealing with a team that you're
extremely familiar with, I think that's a good thing. I think that for both
teams. I think that can help you forget about the fact that you're on the
grandest stage, and there's a national audience and you can just focus on the
fact that you know this team very well and there's a level of comfort when
you're playing a team that you've played several times before.  
So hopefully both teams, and I expect both teams to play an excellent
basketball game because there is that level of comfort between us.  
Q. You talked about relieving the pressure or at least not ignoring it. Was
there anything you did special to do that or to motivate the team. I know that
Maryland actually came by the Garden when they were in Boston to play Boston
College. Did you do that or anything like that?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, I've done that in the past several years and I felt like
that put more pressure on my kids, honestly. So I have done that probably on
maybe three different occasions where we were in the same city so I took them
around and talked to them. And sometimes it worked for us, we went to Atlanta,
and sometimes it did not.  
So I haven't done anything in particular.  
Q. Maryland played in the original Final Four, 25 years ago, but how do
these teams, your team and Maryland, represent the evolution of the women's
game in terms of size and speed, do you think that evolution is going to
continue at this rate or is it beginning to come into where it's going to be
sort of?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, I think it's going to continue to grow. It's amazing how
far our game has come and I think you're exactly right, you can see it with
now the size, the speed, the skill level of really many of the teams that were
in the NCAA tournament, Candace Parker dunking. You know, we are recruiting
players right now that are dunking in high school. Several of them. So it's
not just one player. I think that next year you're going to see several
players dunk. And the year after that probably even more. They're getting
bigger, stronger, faster, and I think that we're going to continue to really
grow at a very rapid rate.  
Q. I was wondering if you could comment on what a national title would mean
for this program as it relates to all the success that the men's program has
had at Duke and all the attention they have received nationally.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I think that we have established ourselves as one of
the premier programs in the country. Winning that national title I think would
just put a little exclamation point on it, and I think our men, they have been
great role models for us. And when I first came to Duke that was one of the
great lures for me was that our men's program was so successful and I thought,
well, if they can do this, and why can't we. We had the same academic, the
same things to sell, the campus, the student life, all, it's all the same.
Cameron Indoor Stadium.  
So if they can do it, you know, we should be able to do it as well. So it's
just a matter of time.  
Q. With the year Monique had as a freshman and just with everybody and then
she got hurt, was there ever a "what if" for that year because you guys were
so close and I mean, what if we had her on that team?   
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think probably at the time during that season and at the
end we felt like she could have been the missing piece, but there are probably
for every team there's wouldas, couldas and what ifs. So everybody has to deal
with some injuries. That was a significant injury for us, but we let that go
and moved forward, just like everybody else needs to.  
Q. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think Coach K went to several Final
Fours and walked away without winning a national championship. Do you see any
similarities in the past that in the paths that both of you have taken and
would you derive any special satisfaction if you win tomorrow?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Any time I can be compared to Coach K in any possible way is
a good thing. Yeah, I think, I know it took him several years, I don't know
how many, but we're just -- it would be very satisfying to win. I think that
everybody's, every coach's goal and dream is to win the national title, so
we're 40 minutes away.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Gail, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2006

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Erlana Larkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15661)

### [Ivory Latta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15658)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will allow the coach to make an opening statement and then
please address your questions to the student-athletes first.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Really proud of our team. I thought we had a great year.
Today just we didn't play well. Rebounding was a big key. We knew that was
going to be a big factor. And we just, we couldn't make a three point shot. We
actually took too many. I didn't want us taking that many. I wanted the ball
inside more, because Erlana was playing really well.  
But I think the good things are that they had 26 turnovers, and that we had 16
steals, and we did some good things. But they're tough and they, their inside
players were tough and I thought they were tough down the stretch. I felt like
we got the ball inside to Erlana there at the end and I felt like that she was
going to score and get fouled there, and I thought it was a big turning point
because that would have tied the game up. But it didn't happen, so that, but
anyway, we didn't have a good shooting night, especially from the three, and
the rebounding was a big factor.  
So I thought it was a very physical game. I expected it to be that way. But
again, we are really disappointed that we lost and we're not playing for a
national championship, but we'll have to learn from it and move on. We have
got a lot of these kids back next year. Both these will be back here and I'm
sure this will be motivation for them for next year.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the student-athletes.  
Q. Ivory, let me ask, how much effect did the fall have on you in the first
half as far as your ability to jump or take a shot or even concentrate?  
IVORY LATTA: It affected me a lot. But I tried not to think about it. I just
tried to go out there and play hard for my team and try not to think about it.  
Q. Ivory, why do you think you guys just had so much trouble getting
offense, things going offensively?  
IVORY LATTA: I think that, I don't think we had trouble, I think that Erlana
did a great job down there for us, there was a lot of calls that we didn't get
down the stretch. And I thought we should have gotten them. And like Coach
said, rebounding was going to be the key to this game and we got outrebounded.
That was that.  
Q. Ivory, could you just describe what happened on that play where you
injured your knee and were you concerned that you were going to be able to
come back and when did you feel like that was going to be so?  
IVORY LATTA: I just know I made a cut and I felt like I got pushed in the back
and I came down and I pretty much hyperextended my left knee and I just heard,
I don't think I can remember, Erlana was saying, "We need you," and that right
there, I just tried to forget about the pain and just try to go out there and
help my team win.  
Q. When you say it affected you, what did it take away from you for the rest
of the game?  
IVORY LATTA: As far as my cutting and pushing the ball up and down the court
as far as the things that I usually do and things like that.  
Q. Erlana, just could you talk about the balance side. Why were you able to
do what you did offensively?  
ERLANA LARKINS: I think they did a great job of double-teaming me. But I also
think I did a good job of finding my teammates and I tried to mix it up with
the reverse pivot and the shot and the right shoulder turn. I tried to mix it
up more, so I think that's why I was kind of successful.  
Q. For Erlana, what about the defensive pressure you faced from Maryland. Do
you think they had some more balanced scoring, more people crashing the glass
it seemed like? Did it seem like one against four at some times?  
ERLANA LARKINS: Sometimes it seemed like that, but I knew I had a five
teammates out on the court. I just think Maryland from the tip of the ball,
they wanted it really bad and they showed it out there today and they came out
with the W.  
Q. Ivory, you came down hard on the floor another play in the game, was that
from us just frustration? Was that just your body coming down? What happened
there?  
IVORY LATTA: When?  
Q. The last few seconds of the game.  
IVORY LATTA: Talking about the tie-up?  
Q. Yeah.  
IVORY LATTA: I just tried to tie the ball up. It wasn't nothing. I didn't try
to slam her or anything. I just tried to tie the ball up and she just twisted
and we both fell. It wasn't nothing at all.  
Q. Ivory, how much pain were you in and it just seemed to take a lot of the
joy out of the way you were playing and maybe your teammates, too?  
IVORY LATTA: Well, when I went down I was in a lot of pain and still is in a
lot of pain right now. But I tried not to let it affect me and I think that I
let my teammates down, you know. But like Coach said, we just got to look
forward to next year, and me and Larkins will be back and we're going to go at
it again.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll let you head back to your
locker room area. Now we'll continue with questions for Sylvia, please.  
Q. Coach, if you could just talk about Maryland. They seemed feel like even
now they still haven't really got a lot of respect and I'm sure that's because
they spent so much of this season in your shadow, Duke's shadow. Talk about
what this team can do. Obviously they beat you guys twice but what they can do
in two days here?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, they're a great offensive team, there's no doubt about
that. Their five starters are all very good scorers. But they can just all
shoot the ball. They got big bodies inside. They're just a great offensive
team. I knew we would have to score a lot of points to beat them. The two
games we played this year was 98-95 and 91-80, I believe, in the ACC
Championship game. So I knew we were going to have to score a lot of points to
beat them because they're just a very good offensive team.  
So, but you know, we'll learn from it.  
Q. Is there something they figured out about you guys or maybe they just
have a good match-up with you, have you figured that out?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I didn't feel like we were in rhythm today, especially
after Ivory got hurt. Because she's our spark that gets us going and all. I
just felt like that the energy that we normally have wasn't quite there and
when she got hurt there. And it was pretty physical out there. So, but we just
weren't hitting on all cylinders today like we normally do. I do think a lot
of it was because of when she hit the floor and everything, and Tangie was,
she was not her normal self. She was having problems breathing over on the
side and so we had to keep taking her out. And she couldn't, couldn't breathe.
And normally she gives us a lot of rebounds, and the last in the ACC
tournament she had, she usually gets a lot of rebounds and helps us a lot.  
So, but Maryland played a great game and it was just like I said, we're just
going to learn from it.  
Q. Jessica Sell hit those two threes and put you ahead for your last lead of
the game and you took her out almost immediately, can you explain that?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: No, I didn't take her out immediately; she was still in there
awhile. But she was tired. She was tired and she then, she asked to come out.
I didn't take her out immediately. But she -- and actually where we put her,
we put, let's see, we were trying to get some more rebounds, I think, but I
just took her out because she was tired and we were trying to mix it up
inside, outside. But those, there was really no -- and normally we have
several people that make threes, but we just, none of them were hitting those
tonight. Except Jess had two.  
Q. What contributed to your guys's inability to make defensive stops down
the stretch, especially a lot of them lay-ups by Maryland?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Yeah, our rotations on the back side and I felt like Camille
being in foul trouble, she wouldn't gamble, but I felt like some of our
rotations on the back side, they get the ball out of the trap and make the
extra pass, and they were getting some things off of that. So we actually came
out of those traps for a little while. But then as the clock ran down we had
to start putting more pressure on them again. But I thought they did a nice
job. We'll watch the tape, we'll come up with another scheme, so hopefully
we'll have something a little better when we play them next year.  
Q. Your trademark has been your team's ability to run but it seems like you
got caught in a half-court game. You almost chose to do that with Larkins
underneath.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: You're right, we didn't run. A lot of that had to do with
Ivory, you know, but we didn't, didn't push the ball like we normally do, get
it out and go. So you got to get the rebound before you can do that. Some of
that was our not getting the rebounds.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Sylvia, thank you very much.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Thank you.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're joined by Shay Doron, Laura Harper, Crystal Langhorne and
Coach Brenda Frese. We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Frese.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, all season long this team has played with a chip
on their shoulder and I really felt like they have had to fight for respect
every step of the way.  
I'll tell you, they got a lot of believers after tonight and the performance
they put on. And just a tremendous game, obviously from both teams. But for
this team, to be able to hold North Carolina to 70 points, that was our game
plan to be able to hold them in the 70's. Just to be able to keep our poise
and our composure throughout a 40-minute game. I'll tell you, it's just a
tremendous team win to be able to continue to keep taking steps with this team
and they just keep taking us for a heck of a ride. And I think you can see by
now what makes this team and this group just so special.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Go to your questions for the players first.  
Q. Talk about the job that Larkins did inside and what you guys did to
neutralize their inside.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: She's a great player and I think she just was getting
inside position and the until the second half we tried to contain her and have
somebody help out on Atkinson and help double on her.  
LAURA HARPER: She's just, like, really hard to guard. She was getting good
position, making really good post moves. She had a really good game. We tried
to contain her and try to force her to take jump shots as best as possible.  
Q. Shay, what was the game plan defensively on Latta and can you talk about
the job you did with her?  
SHAY DORON: The game plan was to keep her in front of us at all times. She's
very quick obviously and we wanted to make sure we contested every one of her
shots and get the ball out of her hands as much as possible. We doubled on the
top screen there and we made sure that she wasn't going to beat us on that
play she beat Purdue on.  
So we just were trying to get the ball out of her hands as much as possible
and get her to take contested shots.  
Q. Crystal, the pace seemed so frantic for both teams in the first half, was
there any thought of saying, let's slow down and kind of collect ourselves?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: We had a lot of turnovers and our coaches were telling to
us relax and we were telling each other to relax. Because North Carolina
speeds you up and we just wanted to take our time and take care of the ball.  
Q. Have you guys taken any inspiration from being the lone 2 seed from
Baylor's run last year, do you think about that at all?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Our coach has said that. She says a lot that Baylor was a 2
seed last year and they won it all and we can do the same.  
Q. You guys had like two rebounds in the first eight minutes and the coaches
kind of called you out on that. Crystal, Laura, was there something you did to
get the advantage back in the paint there?  
LAURA HARPER: Well, this whole time preparing, it's been stressing rebounding
and it was a little disappointing to hear such statistics from the coaches. I
think we just kind of buckled down and said, we have to rebound in order to
win this game and we want to win, so that's what we did.  
Q. Laura, what got into you and when did you think that this might be your
night?  
LAURA HARPER: Just from the beginning. I could feel that I was like Carolina
has so many weapons and so do we, I just wanted to play confidently and have
fun out there and that's what I did. I just had fun.  
Q. Shay, can you talk about the shot you hit with like a minute left, the
pull-up jumper from the free throw line?  
SHAY DORON: I had that same opportunity the first half and I kind of read it
wrong and tried to give it to Crystal, and it was a turnover. And at half-time
the coaches were like, "That's your shot. It goes in every time, so shoot that
with confidence." And it was the same play. They didn't step up on me and I
shot it and it just went in.  
So I was just playing what they gave me. So that was about it.  
Q. Shay, I wanted to get your thoughts when Latta went down with the knee
injury, how concerned were you that she would be able to come back and how
effective do you think she was coming back off that? Was she able to cut as
well? Was she as effective as she was in previous meetings that you faced?  
SHAY DORON: Yeah, honestly I didn't really see it affect her at all when she
got back on the court. I was kind of hoping she would get back on there.
Because I didn't want any excuses later. So we're glad she got back up and
she's a great player and I'm glad she did play. And she had a good game, but
we played such a great team defense and we came out on top.  
Q. Shay, can you talk about your confidence level coming into this. You
hadn't had a particularly great shooting performance so far in the tournament
and then made some big shots down the stretch. Can you talk about your
confidence there.  
SHAY DORON: Coach B tells me that I shot about ten million shots in my career.
So I can score, I know I can score, and when I shoot it, I can't think at all,
I just have to shoot because it just comes naturally. And when I do just shoot
it and not think about anything, that's when it goes in. So I just got to keep
my mind blank and just take what's given to me.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, we're going to release you back to your locker room now.
Thank you very much. We'll go back for questions to the coach.  
Q. How you doing? Did you want to substitute more freely tonight? Seems like
it was a more frantic pace and you didn't substitute at all. They all played
an average of 33 minutes.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought that it would have been nice to -- we got into
some early foul trouble. It really, we had to adjust coaching-wise when we had
Shay and Ashley and Jade in a lot of early foul trouble. So again, we would
like to be able to get everybody involved to be able to use everyone on this
team who has gotten us here.  
Q. If someone had told you before the game that your point guard would have
two assists and 12 turnovers, would you be surprised that you won? And I
wonder why at some point you had Shay bring the ball up and it seemed more
effective, and then you went back to Toliver, I wonder what your thinking was
on that?  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. When you look at the turnover stats to see that we
won the game with 26 turnovers and our leader at the point having 12 of those
turnovers, but that's just because -- obviously how aggressive they played;
they're in your shorts the entire game for 40 minutes. That's why we adjusted
with Shay and putting her at the point to be able to relieve some of those
minutes from Toliver. But again, we didn't feel like we could go too many
minutes with Shay at the point. Just because Shay, you know, Toliver's been
the one handling it for us all season long.  
Q. It seemed like a game for big players today and less so for the guards,
how come?  
BRENDA FRESE: That's what was working. It was who could stop who and obviously
they were getting a lot of easy looks in the paint. Larkins really was
extremely aggressive, but to be able to have the X factor from our end with
Harper and Crystal Langhorne really did a tremendous job. And I think that's
what make this is team so special is they understand whatever is working in
terms of a game plan, we're going to ride and we're going to go with it.  
Q. Towards that end, I think the conventional wisdom was that you and North
Carolina wanted to run. In hindsight it seemed like that you really wanted to
turn them into a jump-shooting team or did you?  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. We wanted to try to turn them this into a jump-
shooting team as much as possible. And we also wanted them to have to take
difficult shots. We wanted Ivory, we knew she was going to score her points,
but we wanted her to have to take some difficult shots under pressure. Just
have to work for every little thing that they were going to get.  
Q. What was one thing that you wanted to do differently defensively from the
first two times, maybe something they hadn't seen out of you?  
BRENDA FRESE: We definitely did mix it up this game from before. We actually
doubled Larkins any time she caught the ball in the paint. We doubled off of
Atkinson. That was something that we were looking at just to be able to
frustrate her. I thought we did a tremendous job at times getting that double
team, getting some calls with the jump ball. And then we wanted to double some
on ball screens that they were -- we saw that screen up top was a screen that
had really given Ivory a lot of easy looks going to the basket. Sometimes we
got it, sometimes we didn't. But we knew what we wanted to do in terms of
executing it out.  
Q. You had a pretty private conversation with Kristi Toliver. I guess it was
about 12 minutes or so into the first half, what did you guys talk about? You
seemed pretty aggressive with her.  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, just to keep her head up. Sometimes she wears her
emotions on her sleeve in terms of showing her frustration. I wasn't going to
let her show her frustration in this game.  
She did a tremendous job. The pressure that she faced for 40 minutes bringing
the ball up the floor, and I just wanted to stay firm with her in the sense so
she didn't allow herself to get frustrated and stay firm and in terms of her
believing in herself and her abilities, because she's such a great player.  
Q. Could you kind of go into this No. 2 trying harder thing and how many
times have you brought it up to your players that a 2 seed can come in and win
this thing?  
BRENDA FRESE: Actually I only brought it up today at shoot-around. I heard
that actually from the announcers over to the side that -- actually from our
SID Natalie had gotten it from the announcers that the last 2 seed, the last
two years the No. 2 seed has won the national championship.  
Q. Coach, not to take anything away from the rest of the players, but it
seemed like it was to some degree a one-woman show for them and could you talk
about your balanced scoring and how much that helped you tonight versus North
Carolina's sort of one option?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought that obviously Erlana played a tremendous game.
She really, I think they went with the game plan in terms of you ride that
out. She was getting some great looks, was being aggressive on the glass, but
it was nice to be able to see from our end to have that balanced scoring when
things would break down. We had so many options. That's what this team has
done all season long, is just continue to stay and be unselfish.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Coach, thank you very much. We'll let you head back to the
locker room area.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2006

  

### [Monique Currie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15647)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Mistie Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15649)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will start with an opening statement from the coach and then
please direct your questions to the student-athletes first.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just excited to still be playing. I thought that LSU is an
exceptional team and I thought that this was one of our best defensive
efforts, really of the year.  
So I'm just extremely proud of our team and specifically of their defense. So
I just, I give a lot of credit to Pokey, they have had a tremendous year.
Excellent team, great players, and but I can't say enough about my team and
the effort that they put forth, specifically on the defensive end.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the student-athletes.  
Q. For Mistie and Monique, can you talk a little bit about the job that the
front court did, specifically against Seimone Augustus. What was it that you
did that made it so successful, held her scoreless at the half?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: I mean, we worked so hard throughout the season on our
defense because we were so offense-minded in the beginning of the year. And as
the season went on we knew that defense was going to help us win games towards
the end of the season.  
So I just give them tremendous credit. They got a job and they nailed it. And
it showed.  
Q. Mistie, I would also like to ask about the job on the Sylvia Fowles that
was done. She was not allowed to dominate the game either on the boards or on
the scoring front. What did y'all do there?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: She's a tremendous athlete. And she's got great size and
she's just dominates every game. And we knew in order to be successful that we
had to shut Seimone and Sylvia down. And it was just I think the post players
did a great job in boxing her out; only three offensive boards and I'm just
proud of our team, our whole defensive effort.  
We got a job, Coach G really trusted to us get the defensive job done and
everybody, there wasn't one letdown on this team.  
Q. Monique, you were never shy of saying you wanted to come back for this
chance, how happy are you and excited to be here?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I'm extremely happy. I'm very proud of my teammates. I think
our win was really a team effort. And it just feels good for me because there
isn't any pressure at all for me to go out there and have to score 20 points
or anything like that. We just have a well-rounded team and they really helped
to get me where I want to be, and that's in the championship game on Tuesday.  
Q. Monique and Mistie, could you talk about the Maryland match-up in the
final and specifically Maryland's balanced scoring, how that makes it maybe a
little difficult to match up with them?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, Maryland is a very good team. They're young, but they
don't play like they're young; they play like they have been playing for years
together. They have a great point guard who leads them very well in Langhorne.
She's been unstoppable throughout the tournament, so we really have to focus
on rebounding like we have been doing, and taking care of the ball.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: That's pretty good.  
Q. Maryland obviously is your last loss before you went on this run, was
defense kind of what you talked about during that, like that little period you
took off where you came back or what? Monique or Mistie or whoever.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Definitely. Right when we lost in the ACC Tournament we knew
that there was breakdowns in our defense. And it was rebounding and our
defense. And we had two weeks, I'm grateful for having those two weeks where
we were able to just break down segment by segment and just really work on our
weaknesses. And I feel like that's really helped us with our confidence on the
defensive end. It showed tonight and hopefully it will show in the Maryland
game on Tuesday.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies thank you very much. Now we'll continue with questions
for the coach.  
Q. Just elaborate a little bit on the defensive scheme in regard to Seimone.
Did you want to have Lindsey drop off the point guard and double her if
Seimone was able to receive the ball?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Right, we did a couple of different things. We changed it
up. Initially we started in a little soft press, back into a zone. But within
our zone we had Lindsey drop all the way down to cover any curl cuts because
Seimone is so good at curling. So she, even though she was at the top of the
zone we had her drop in. And then on misses we were man to man, but we were,
she had all double responsibilities, Lindsey did, double responsibilities on
Seimone. Wanisha had Seimone with the understanding that if she did get the
ball, she needed to get her to put it on the floor so we could get a double
from Lindsey. And I just, I thought she did a great job.  
Lindsey was really incredible. The defense on Seimone was very good, but the
defense off of Seimone was probably better. Because they were the ones that
really helped any time she put the ball on the deck.  
Q. Was there something you saw on the tape that said that they were just
going to, that you wanted to give them pretty much any open outside look?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Several teams have played them in a similar fashion. You
know who the go-to players are on LSU's team. And we're not the first team to
sag off of white. She has seen that before. So we just tried to mix things up
a little bit so they didn't. I think once they become comfortable with
whatever you're doing, then they're very efficient, and so that's why we did
that. But we also changed things up and ran some zones at them as well.  
Q. It's hard to shut down one player, you shut down two. How remarkable, you
shut both down Fowles and Seimone, who have been dominating games. That has to
be even more impressive.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think that's really a testament to, one, our depth, but
our strength of the inside-outside attack. When you talk about that, you talk
about offense, but I think that truly it's our defense as well.  
Because when you double, Bales was in charge of double responsibility on
Sylvia Fowles. Lindsey had Seimone and Ali was responsible for doubles on
Fowles. So a double with a 6'5" and a 6'7" person probably they haven't seen
that all year long because we do have that size, and we have got depth to
continue to rotate fresh people on them.  
Q. Offensively did you try to take advantage of the height that you had in
the paint?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: We tried to. Didn't do a particularly good job in the first
half. I thought that we could have done a better job with that. But then I
thought in the second half we decided we were really going to Mistie early and
try and take advantage of the size. And she responded for us. I thought she
did that really well.  
Q. When Maryland pulled ahead for good then in the North Carolina game, all
the Duke fans stood up and started cheering. Almost a sense of relief that if
you were to go on to win tonight that you wouldn't have to go through North
Carolina. Was that something, did the team realize what was going on at that
point?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, we were in the locker room and we turned the TV off. We
were doing our own game preparation. So it didn't really matter to us who won,
they're both excellent teams. We have lost to both of them the last time out.  
So we were looking forward to playing LSU and hopefully having the opportunity
to play one of those teams again.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Gail, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2006

  

### [Seimone Augustus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14353)

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: LSU is entering the interview room. We'll start with an opening
statement from the coach.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Regardless of how disappointed I am in our inability to perform
better, it's not lost upon me how much Duke had to do with that and I want to
make sure that's clear because so often when you don't get things done, it's
easy to make it about yourself.  
So I definitely want to credit Gail and her girls for their ability to stick
to a game plan win, which maybe in their case may have been ugly for them, but
it was a win.  
But the bottom line is, the further you advance, the tougher the competition
becomes, the more locked in and focused you have to be every single
possession. It's not a game of halves, fortunate, we got into this point but
like I said, we could have helped ourselves a lot, had opportunities, I think
that it was the opportunity to cut it to six through a couple possessions it's
then double digits. I'm done.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the players, please.  
Q. Seimone, it might be difficult to feel perspective right now of your
career, but can you kind of put into words what your four years have been like
at LSU and your ability to go to three Final Fours?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: It's been amazing. It's a great ride. It's unfortunate, we
have been here three times and never got past the semis, but it's been a
tremendous time here. We have had great opportunities in front of us, for the
most part we came in, I did what I felt like I wanted to do for this program,
made history, and hopefully made my mark.  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Duke's defensive scheme, how they were
able to frustrate you. I saw you several times frustrated on the court and
things like that. What did they do to shut you down?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: Never frustrated. Just through the game I'm always mad if
we're not running the offense as effectively as we can. If you know anything
about basketball you could see the difference actually when we set screens,
made the right cut moves, doing the things we need to do and tonight that
didn't happen. We just were just standing around and it was easy to guard us.
We didn't make them guard us. But they did a great defensive job of sticking
to the script and doing the things they needed to do to force us into
difficult shots and turnovers.  
Q. Seimone, did you ever feel that you were forcing or that you needed to
make the offense come to you or do you feel that you stayed in your game as
much as possible?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: For the most part I felt I stayed in my game. I let the game
come to me. It's unfortunate that I didn't score like I normally score, but we
try to stay in a routine of getting paint touches, forcing them to play low
post defense and try to pitch it out. But like I said before, tonight it was
just a different story because of the way we ran our offense, it looked -- it
made it look a little bit more difficult because of the things that we didn't
do on offense.  
Q. Seimone, at half-time did you feel any frustration or was it growing at
all when you hadn't scored a point or how the game was at that point?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I wasn't frustrated that I didn't score a point. I was
frustrated at the way we played. I felt that we could have came out and played
a little bit better, had a little bit more energy. Could have fought back a
little bit more than what we did to kind of cut the lead going into half-time.  
I said this before, if I never score a point in the game and we win or we're
in a position to win, I'm fine with that. But I was just more than anything
angry at the fact that we didn't do the things that we needed to do to kind of
cut the lead heading into half-time.  
Q. Sylvia, how frustrating was it for you that they kept throwing big girl
after big girl at you and banging you around at 6'7 ", 6'5", coming at you.
How did that affect your game?   
SYLVIA FOWLES: It affected me a lot. As you can see, very frustrating that I
couldn't get a groove. But it happened. I was very frustrated and I couldn't
get no shots or do anything to help my team.  
Q. Seimone, I know that they don't have anything to do with each other but
after last night's men's game and the way that started off and you guys got in
into a big hole, did it ever enter your mind, oh no, here we go?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: No. I don't think the men's game had an effect on how we
played. We just came out and didn't do what we needed to do, and I think it's
been an ongoing thing for us, always starting out sluggish and having to come
back and make up the slack for what we didn't do in the five to 10 minutes of
the game. The men's game had nothing to do with the fact that we came out
sluggish. We were still proud of them, we still cheered them on regardless,
but we knew what we had to do and we just didn't come out and do it.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much. We're going to let you go back to
the locker room and now we'll continue with questions for the coach, please.  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the defensive scheme you saw and the
one they threw at Seimone. Obviously it had to be one of the most effective
jobs any team has done against you. Anyone come close to that this year?  
POKEY CHATMAN: You know, I guess I would answer it saying, no, because of the
end result and the number of points she had. But it's also easy for me to go
back and see why she didn't do that, and please understand I'm crediting
Duke's defense. I could do a better job answering that more clearly for you in
the fact that we didn't do the normal things when we saw the same defense we
had been seeing for three and a half years, four years of Seimone's career.
That's the part that's difficult for me to answer.  
Credit to Seimone because she garners that type of attention. It wasn't new,
it wasn't a different scheme, maybe it was at a different time of year and
they did it a little bit better, and we didn't equal that with the same
effectiveness.  
Q. She actually only touched the ball six times in the first half, that sort
of happened for the first five minutes against DePaul too, then all of a
sudden you started settings picks and screens and getting her open. Is that
what happened tonight but no picks and screens weren't being set properly?  
POKEY CHATMAN: A couple of things. We have three rules for a cutter when a
screen is set, and that's to wait, wait, wait. And that's being patient. A lot
of times when we were setting the screen for Seimone, it's not necessarily for
her to get a touch, she just draws a lot of attention. But if you don't set
the screen at the proper angle, if you don't wait for it and then when you
come off of it, two or three players don't guard you unless other people get
going. So it was a combination of things. Seimone leads in scoring, but it's
also team offense, where there's about three or four things that go into that.
The screen doesn't necessarily have to lead to a cut but it needs to lead to a
good angle and timing. The timing was off, it was all off.  
Q. Can you put into perspective what she has meant to the university and how
much you'll miss her .  
POKEY CHATMAN: Yeah, that's easy to do. I'm a realist. I'm good at
perspective, but I'm also emotional. It will take about two seconds to give
the proper answer to sum her up: Her legacy will not be this last game. And
that's as good as I can do. But I think that sums it all up. Because I've
always talked about Seimone and her ability to elevate a program and put us in
position to be on this stage. It's just unfortunate that this last attempt for
an advancement, we fell short and the manner in which we fell short. But I
don't think it changes what she's done for the game, especially at LSU.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Coach, thank you very much.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Thank you.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're joined by the Maryland team along with Coach Frese. We'll
ask the coach to make an opening statement and then we'll go to your
questions. Coach Frese.  
BRENDA FRESE: All right. Well, obviously we're extremely excited to be here.
We obviously also want to welcome Pokey Chatman and LSU to the ACC tournament
part two. And obviously want to extend an invitation out, we would love to
have them come join our league, if they would like to be a part of it.  
But we obviously feel very fortunate. We kind of feel like the new kid on the
block kind of coming in here crashing the party. Knowing that this team and
this program is obviously ahead of schedule. But I'll tell you, we're just
enjoying and loving every single minute that we get to be a part of this.  
It couldn't happen to better people. I tell you. These kids are the ones that
have taken us for this ride. They're a ton of fun to be able to be around and
I'll tell you, I think we lead the nation in smiles with how much fun that
we're having. But we are definitely honored to be a part of, it's a special
place, making history in our conference, and to really be a part of coming
here to the Final Four, and when I think back to four short years ago, when
this team and this season went through a 10-18 season, to the point of Debbie
Yow, when she hired me here at Maryland and having the same vision that we
shared together. And to be living out that dream is something that I tell you
is really a dream come true.  
Obviously from our first opponent, North Carolina, I think you could ask the
players, at this point I think both teams could give the scouting report that
they know each other inside and out. Both teams are excited about the match-
up, having split with North Carolina during the season. North Carolina
obviously has a wealth of talent and we're just going to try to go out and
execute our game plan, and we're probably the only team in the country though
that is hoping for overtime, because in overtime that's our time. So just
looking forward to getting out on the floor tomorrow night.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Thank you, Coach. We'll go to your questions now, please.  
Q. Brenda and any of the players, to what extent does the fact that you're
playing a very familiar opponent help you get over whatever concerns you have
about being here for the first time?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think it gives us a tremendous amount of confidence. You're
not having to use that first 10, 20 minutes, the first half of the game to get
used to each other's style. We already know from the tip that this game's
going to be a track meet, both teams love to score, they love offense. And I
think you're going to see a game from the tip that's just going to be up tempo
right away.  
Q. For those of us that didn't have chance to see the game with North
Carolina that you won, what went right that game in bringing that victory to
you?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that one we gained a lot of confidence. We were down by
about 10 or 11 at half-time. We thought that we had really not played a very
good first half. We didn't handle the press well.  
But the second half I tell you we came out, we boarded with them, we were able
to get a lot of second-chance opportunities. We just found a way. Obviously
everyone can remember the last second shot by Ashleigh Newman that sent us
into overtime, and the fact that going into overtime this team has gained a
lot of confidence.  
Q. Shay, in the last couple years you guys were one of the few teams that
haven't had as many problems with North Carolina's 1-3-1 press, why is that?  
SHAY DORON: I think the main thing is we have five ball handlers on the court.
Crystal and Aurelie, our post players, can handle the ball as well as
obviously the guards. And it's the type of tempo we like to play. We like to
play up and down and we kind of welcome the press. So not many teams press us
all year because we kind of feed off of that and we do well against it.  
So you just have to play smart and kind of read what happens and we do that
pretty well. And with all our experience, it just helps us a lot.  
Q. Coach Frese, how is your school's financial commitment helped you in
building your program there at Maryland over the last few years?  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, it starts with your administration. The support
that we have from our athletic director, Debbie Yow, from president Mote, you
know, they traveled to the ACC and the NCAA tournament, when you have that
kind of support and backing with your administration and your university, you
can see it across the board. If you look at Maryland athletics, every team has
the opportunity to be successful because of the amount of support and backing
that we have.  
Q. As the new kid on the block could you offer an opinion about your three
colleges who have been around the block here a few times?  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously I feel like I'm very fortunate because I get to coach
in this conference, in the ACC, so I get to go against Sylvia and Gail, so
I've been able to personally become better as a coach just from that level of
competition. And Pokey Chatman and I, we enjoy the time that we get to spend
together in the gym. The conversations that we get to have. So all three of
them, just your personal relationships and professionally, I think that you
can gain so much from watching, listening, and just the interactions that we
have been able to have.  
Q. Are you superstitious about anything and if so, what is it?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: No, I'm not superstitious at all. I just, I really don't
have any things that I do regularly. I just go out and I'm pretty, not
superstitious at all.  
Q. Shay, a few years ago when you signed with Maryland could you have
imagined being here, and what made you take the leap of faith that Maryland
would be a good place to go?  
SHAY DORON: Well, obviously me and the coach, I knew that we had the same kind
of mentality and winning drive, and the most important thing for me was the
coaches and I found that here at Maryland. So that's what really brought me
here. But from day one where the year after we had a 10-18 season, the locker
room talk was Final Four, national championship, ACC championship. So since
I've been there that's what we have been talking about since day one. And that
hasn't changed throughout the years and it's not going to change when I leave.  
So just kind of instill that mentality, that winning mentality, that we can do
it and we can play with anyone, and it's been there since I've gotten there.
So nothing's changed, it's just that this team, it's a reality and we
definitely expected it and for us it's not, you know, a quick thing and it's
not ahead of schedule for us, it's a right-on-time thing.  
Q. For the players: I realize the seeding is not comparable but at the same
time are any of you drawing any parallels to George Mason because probably of
the four teams you were the one that was the least thought to get to the Final
Four.  
SHAY DORON: Who thought that? Who always thought that? Not in our locker room,
we think that not only we're not the underdogs, but we should have gotten, we
could have probably gotten No. 1 seed at the Selection Monday show. But like
we said, the seeding really doesn't matter at this point. Everybody has to
play the same amount of games to get to the same point. We just want to play
hard and we know we can compete with any team in the country. We have proven
that time and time again. And to ourselves, unfortunately nobody really takes
notice. I don't know.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think actually nobody even thought that George Mason
would have made it to the Sweet 16 and we were expected to go further, so I
think we're a little bit different.  
Q. Coach, in light of the dramatic rise of your program over the past four
years, do you feel like your program is still maybe fighting for recognition a
little bit, within your campus and also in the community, and I wonder what
you guys, what kind of changes we have seen over the year, what you think
could still change?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that we don't spend a lot of time comparing and
contrasting. The questions that have been out there in terms of, do you feel
slighted, you know, the George Mason team and the attention they're getting
compared to your team. I'll tell you, we don't at all. We landed from
Albuquerque and we were on the front page of the Washington Post, Washington
Times, Baltimore Sun, USA Today, I mean that's some pretty big stuff for this
women's basketball team and this program.  
And the women's basketball world, I think this team has really shown all
season long that they have been fighting for the respect, just the fact that
they have known how good they are and what they're capable of doing. So we
really focus on the positives and the recognition that this program is now
receiving for all the hard work that this team has put in and it's definitely
well deserved.  
Q. Can you kind of tell me just challenges Ivory Latta presents to your team
and what you see from her as a player, what she brings to the court and the
energy to her team?  
BRENDA FRESE: I don't know if we have enough time to talk about everything
that Ivory does for her team. I mean first and foremost, what energy and
emotion as a leader that she brings for her team is tremendous. Then you go
into her basketball skills, the fact that she's one of the quickest, fastest
players from end to end. Always pushing tempo, can create for herself, for
others. She's extremely strong. Getting to the basket, being able to finish.
And obviously it's just, she's just a tremendous player.  
Q. Shay, and then Coach, what has Crystal meant to your team and what does
she do for you that makes your team successful?  
SHAY DORON: Crystal obviously is our No. 1 option and everything goes through
her and she spreads out game, especially for the guards and for the other post
players, because she draws so much attention. And the great thing is that as a
guard it's so easy to pass her the ball because you know Crystal is going to
pass it right back out when she's double-teamed, which she usually is. And we
just really trust Crystal and she's just powerful and quick, and she's just a
mismatch hell for any post player in the country right now.  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that the thing that makes Crystal so special is not only
what she possesses as a basketball player, because everybody in this room
knows what kind of talent she has, but it's what kind of person she is day in
and day out, just the way she takes care and handles her business, just how
she is about her teammates. I'll give you a small example, we were in
Albuquerque and you all watch and witness in the Baylor game, I mean, she
single handedly, her teammates were unselfish passing her the ball, she did a
tremendous job against Sophia Young and we get to half-time and the buzz in
the locker room is all about "Great job, Crystal. What a job. You know, keep
it going, "and her response is, "Thanks, guys, for passing me the ball." And
that's the kind of teammate she is; she's so unselfish. She's always about
this team, she doesn't have to score a point, and as long as we win and she
can do the little things, she's ultimately, she's an ultimate team player.  
Q. Brenda, was Shay kind of the one who kickstarted this whole thing for you
guys or a big part of that, especially getting the players you got and then
everything?  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. You think back to year one, Shay Doron and Kalika
France, who is injured, Shay was the first player in our program to verbally
commit and say yes to Maryland. And again, you have to remember, I mean she
committed to Maryland given the fact that our season we were 10-18 that year.
Her first year as a freshman, she comes in and leads this team to 18 wins. So
the fact that she believed in our vision, the fact that we had very limited
time to recruit her, I got the job in April, and we had less than what, five
or six months to be able to recruit Shay and get her to understand and believe
our vision. So I've always, I'll always remember just how special of a
commitment that was.  
Q. Coaches like to talk about the first five minutes of the first half or
the first half as being critical. In your mind what needs to happen the first
five minutes of the first half and second half to be successful tomorrow
night?  
BRENDA FRESE: We need to set a tone obviously from the tip and we need to show
that we came to rebound, that we're going to box out, because North Carolina
is so athletic, so strong, so aggressive, and we need to show that we can, you
know, that we have come ready and we're going to do battle and we're ready to
go.  
Q. I just want to ask you what kind of statement it makes for the league to
have three teams here to be able to start talking more about the ACC when you
talk about perhaps the best conferences in college basketball?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, obviously to be making history is something
pretty special. The fact that it's never been done before in a conference, to
have three teams and I think all season long everyone had talked about
Maryland and Duke and North Carolina as three of the top teams in the country,
but you didn't know how it was going to play out and what kind of success that
the teams were going to have.  
Now I think it really validates the three teams, the conference, just having
to go head to head all season long against each other.  
Q. Crystal, is there an ACC style?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think the three teams that are here, everybody plays a
fast-pace game. Everybody likes to run. And I think that's a trend a lot in
the ACC, everybody is very fast paced in the league.  
Q. For Marissa and Crystal, you guys started the season, at least in terms
of the polls, like number 14. When did y'all know or have a sense that this
could be something special?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think when we went down to the tournament in the Virgin
Islands, and I think we played really well and we played a Final Four team, a
team that was in the Final Four last year, Tennessee and we played a great
game and from that point we realized that we are a Final Four team and we can
make it to Boston.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I say the same thing. After that Tennessee game we fought
hard the whole game, and in the locker room everybody was very disappointed
because we now that game was ours, and we knew that when we played that game,
and it was in November, that we had so much room for improvement and that we
could get to the Final Four.  
Q. Crystal, can you talk about your relationship on and off the court with
Erlana Larkins and how you plan on defending her?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Well, I've known Erlana since my senior year of high
school. We were roommates at McDonald's. She's a great person. I loved being
around her when I was around her and we spent a lot of time together. We're
just excited about the match-up, I don't think I'll be guarding her, so Laura
Harper probably will, but we're just going to really need to contain her,
because she's such a great player.  
Q. Coach, I know this is not the first time this has happened, but it's four
women coaches of the four Final Four teams, and two of you sort of second
generation, you and Pokey, what does that say now about the development of
women and women in sports and women in coaching and all of those sorts of
issues?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think that you're starting to see, obviously, a change
in the game, first and foremost in terms of parity, you're starting to see a
lot of different names in teams that have the ability and the chance to be
able to get to a Final Four. We talked all season long, I mean, there were
probably 10 to 12 teams out there this year that had a chance to be sitting in
the position where we're at today.  
So never before in the history of our game have we had that kind of parity,
and you're finally starting to see a little bit of a change in the game in
terms of coaches that are retiring that have really paved the path. And from
my understanding, you know, I can reflect and feel how fortunate I am to be
given the opportunity that I now have from all these great coaches like Marsha
Sharp from Texas Tech, and Ceal Barry from Colorado, who have invested so much
time and energy to make this game be what it is now at this national stage.  
Q. Brenda, I wonder if you could talk about the team's health or injury
report. I guess Marissa succumbed to the dreaded virus the other day and how
is everyone else doing?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, let's see, of the 10 members that we have on our team,
seven of the ten had been hit with the virus. So our two healthy ones, knock
on wood, up here are Shay and Crystal, and they have not been hit. And we're
not planning on them to get hit until any time after Wednesday. I told them
they could go ahead and have that virus hit. And Angel Ross are the only
three. Aurelie is on her way out, she was inflicted with it, had to come out a
day later, couldn't fly out with the team, had to come out with the band and
cheerleaders and Marissa unfortunately was hit two nights ago, didn't practice
yesterday. But you can, as you can see by the smile on her face, she had a
little to eat for breakfast and I think she will be ready to go.  
Q. How are you doing?  
BRENDA FRESE: I'm doing great. Like I talked about, anyone who wants to go on
the Albuquerque diet and lose a quick five pounds...  
I am getting ready after the Final Four to write my book, "The Albuquerque
Diet." I think it will be a best seller. Great way to trim up before you get
out on the Final Four stage.  
Q. Coach, I would like to piggyback on something that Crystal said, she said
all the three teams in the ACC run. LSU will also run, maybe a little more
controlled, but they will run as well, is that maybe just, is that where
women's college basketball is going, a lot more running now and that type of
athleticism?  
BRENDA FRESE: In terms of the running style?  
Q. Yeah, as far as the women's game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Oh, absolutely. It's interesting as we gotten on the bus and
with the 25-year history, they have given us, we watched a lot of the games
with the old teams, watching that style of play. When you watch that film I
wish I had time to go back in the history and watch a lot of those games to
get even more knowledgeable. But absolutely you can see players are bigger,
stronger, quicker, faster, from the weight room you look at the LSU-Duke
match-up with 6'7" Alison Bales and 6'6" Sylvia Fowles, so you're not only
getting the size now, you're getting the speed and the quickness that the game
has evolved into.  
Q. Shay, what are your recollections of meeting Coach for the first time and
how is she different than the other coaches who recruited you?  
SHAY DORON: Well, I think her youth definitely clicks with us more because
it's just like you said, there's a wave of a new generation and you just kind
of see eye to eye more with that.  
But like I said, we just clicked in terms of winning personalities. Just by
having regular conversations with her and hearing about her future plans for
Maryland and all that just to me, I mean, it's just, it was very believable
and very realistic, and with the area and the whole east coast, it's just a
very recruitable school with the academics. So just like I said, just getting
to know her as a person and then in the recruiting business, you have so many
fake people and when you finally meet a real person, it's pretty easy to pick
them out and you got to just stick with that and get to know them a little
better, and I definitely felt that with Coach B and her whole coaching staff.  
Q. Brenda, as many years as you've been around the Final Four scene anything
being inside that's surprised you so far?  
BRENDA FRESE: I tell you, from a personal end, I swear every Final Four that
I've ever been to and I sit in the stands I always get teary eyed when I have
sat there and thought about the day that I would have the opportunity to coach
a team and be able to bring them here. And I'll tell you, it's something
pretty special. This is what you grow up as a little kid dreaming about. And I
know these players know this as well, I mean, to have the opportunity, the
fact that this team brought us here is something that's truly special and I
really feel like I'm living out a dream. I still continue to pinch myself and
appreciate the moment that so many people have always dreamed about and
coached their whole lives and may not ever get here. Players who work just as
hard as us that may not get the opportunity to be here. So I just want to
appreciate the moment to be able to be a part of something pretty special.  
Q. For any of the players that want to comment, just being a slightly less
experienced team than North Carolina, I just want to know how, what basically
having a win here in your pocket against them how that helps mentally going
into a game like this?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: With our youth, I just think we play fearless, we have
nothing to lose when we go out there; we just go out there to have fun and our
win against them at North Carolina, that game was a lot of confidence going
into the rest of our season and we lost to them in the ACC tournament and we
learned a lot from that game, and watching film and seeing that we lost the
game with rebounding and with our defensive effort. So I'm looking forward to
the game tomorrow night.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: All right. With that we're going to let them go. Thanks.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're joined by Coach Goestenkors and Alison Bales, Monique
Currie and Mistie Williams from Duke. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach and then go right to questions.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just excited to be here as I'm sure all the teams are. It
was certainly a battle to get here. And I think when you look across, we all
had at least one game that we really had to fight through that came right down
to the bitter end to determine who would get to the Final Four.  
So we are extremely pleased to be here and looking forward to playing LSU.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: And we'll go to questions.  
Q. Coach, three teams from the ACC and all three top three in the nation in
scoring in points, do you think this is the kind of venue for the style of
play of ACC and has it always been such a fast-paced style in the time you've
been there?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: It's grown. The style of play has certainly improved. I
think it's always been a running conference. I came from the Big-10, I was at
Purdue for several years and at that time it was more physical conference. And
when I came to the ACC, that's the first thing that I noticed is that there
was much more running and pressing in the ACC.  
I think the teams have just continued to improve from top to bottom.  
Q. Coach, I would like to piggyback on that question slightly, is the
running game instead of a trend, becoming the norm now in the women's game?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think more and more, you're seeing it more and more. I
think that the players, I think again it all comes back to the high schoolers
that are coming into college. They have been playing since they were in third,
fourth -- organized basketball now since third, fourth, fifth grade.  
So they understand the game and it's a much more exciting game. The fans like
it, the players like it, so I think we're seeing much more of it. So I do
think it's a trend.  
Q. Monique, you've stated before how you came back for this year for a shot
at the national championship. Can you elaborate on how much it means to you.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, it means a lot to be back here. I think we worked really
hard this season so that we could prepare ourselves to make this next step.  
It's been a goal of ours since the beginning of the year to win a national
championship and to get over that hump of getting past the Elite Eight and
finally making it here. It means a lot to me and it means a lot to my
teammates.  
Q. Gail, is there a moment you can point to, kind of an a-ha moment where
you said, it's not just us in the ACC anymore, there's other really good
teams?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't think a particular moment, I think we started to
see, probably not this year but last year, we have been pretty good for
several years and North Carolina has been nipping at our heels. We had beaten
them 12 straight times going into last year. So I think last year Maryland
gave us a good run and North Carolina beating us three times, I think that's
when we could see, we knew Maryland was young and they had good recruits
coming in and the rest of the teams were very competitive as well. So we felt
like -- I knew going into this year this would be the best year for our
conference. Clearly.  
Q. Coach, financially, your budget at your school, has it, have you seen
increases over the last three or four years in that budget or have you had the
money from day one to be competitive in the ACC?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think the budget continues to increase. I really don't pay
attention to it. I know I go over it every year, that's about all I know. So I
do what I think is necessary for us to be successful.  
My athletic director, I see red lines all over the budget. He hasn't done
anything other than that to me thus far. So it's worked out all right.  
Q. Question for Monique: Who inspired you to play basketball and why?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Who inspired me? I don't think I can like, necessarily pick
one person that inspired me. But in my neighborhood everybody played
basketball and at school everyone played basketball, so I just did that. And I
enjoyed it. I played in rec leagues from when I was in the third grade, and so
it was something that I was pretty good at and I enjoyed playing, so I just
started playing because everyone else played.  
Q. For the players, as students and athletes at Duke I wonder if you could
talk a little bit about how distressing the events are that are going on at
your campus right now and how they may impact you.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're not going to address any other questions regarding that
topic at this press conference today, so we're going to have to move on to the
next question. Next question.  
Q. For Gail, Connecticut slowed the pace down, obviously, and you called it
the prettiest ugly win or whatever it was. Do you expect more of the same in
the first game here being that there's only one team here that's not in the
ACC?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't think so. I think that when you get to this point
everybody, you know what got you here. You stick with what you're good at, and
LSU is a tremendous transition team. So I can't really see them letting the
air out of the ball at this stage in the game. They're too good for that.  
Q. The coaches talk about the first five minutes of each half being very
crucial. In your mind what do you need to see in the first five minutes of
each half to point towards success tomorrow night?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think aggressiveness on both ends of the floor. But also
poise. You want to say aggressive but sometimes you're so excited to get out
there that you turn the ball over. So you want to stay aggressive, have that
attack mindset, at the same time you want to show the poise necessary to take
care of the basketball.  
Q. Would you just offer a brief comment, please, on the other three coaches
in this tournament.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think Pokey Chatman has just done an incredible job
considering the adversity that their program has gone through over the last
several years with the loss of Coach Gunter and then with Hurricane Katrina. I
can't even imagine all that they have been through and she's really handled it
with great style and grace. I think she's an exceptional coach.  
Brenda Frese, she's one of the up and coming coaches in America. She is
extremely passionate and highly motivated. Does a great job getting her teams
prepared and making adjustments throughout the game. And I just have the
utmost respect for her.  
Then I think Sylvia Hatchell, she's Coach of the Year this year and I think
deservedly so. I don't think anybody came close to her this year in what she's
been able to accomplish with her team. They play, I think, one of the most
exciting brands of basketball in the women's game. I think that people love to
watch them play. I think they're good for TV as well.  
I think that they will get people that aren't typically women's basketball
fans, if they just tune in for a little bit, and see them play, I think that
they will come back for more. And I think she's just done a tremendous job,
really, with her team and this season in particular.  
Q. Question for Coach: How do you rate LSU's defense and do you see
improvement from the team that you played last year?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Most definitely. I think we're both improved defensively.
And I watched the game that we had with them last year and it was like a
slugfest. We were both, we walked the ball down the floor most of the time and
our defense, we both had numerous breakdowns defensively. I feel like we're
both in a different place now. We're both much better and specifically I think
Seimone has really improved her defense and Erica White, there's been a lot on
her young shoulders, but I think she's handled it tremendously. And she pushes
tempo, but she also does a great job pressuring the ball on the defensive end
of the floor. Then Sylvia, I think, last year she was still learning the game.
She was a great athlete, but not necessarily a great player. This year she's a
great player.  
Q. For Alison, can you talk about the particular challenges Sylvia will
present for you. You're one of the few players that she will have played who
is a little bit taller, she may be a little bit quicker than you, what are the
challenges and what are you going to try to do against her?  
ALISON BALES: Well, like Coach said, she's a great player and I think that our
whole post group will share the responsibility for guarding her. You will see
me and Chante, we'll all give her different looks throughout the game.  
Q. Can you just comment on that a little, please, Coach?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: She's, like I said, she's just playing a tremendous
basketball and she's improved her skills. She might be one of the most
improved offensive players of the year this year, from this year to last. So
as Alison said, I think it's going to take a team effort. And we don't
anticipate stopping her, that's not an issue for us, we know that's not really
possible, we just need, hope to contain her. And it's not as much her scoring
that really breaks you down as it is her rebounding. Because when one
individual gets 15 to 20 rebounds, it's very demoralizing for a team.  
Q. Coach, how important is this game for you personally just maybe get over
the hump and get this program winning a few more of the big games?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I really don't feel like it's important at all. I think
being able to get to the Final Four four times is pretty nice. I feel very
good about it. I know that our team is going to continue to be successful
throughout my career and so I'm not, I don't feel the pressure of trying to
win another game or win two more games. I know that we can. And my job is to
prepare my team the best way possible for them to do that.  
So, but other than that, I really don't feel any pressure.  
Q. Gail, do you feel that the rise of the ACC and North Carolina in
particular is finally allowing the women to sort of get their due on Tobacco
Road, or do you feel that you're still sort of fighting for recognition down
there with all of the tradition of the men's basketball?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think that we have had such great teams and in the
triangle area in particular, NC State, they were in the tournament again this
year, but they have been to the Final Four as well. So I think it's been tough
for us because we have great men's basketball teams, as well as women's
basketball teams, so and we love it because it's, we're a great basketball
school, and we really support one another. At times I think it's hurt our
attendance probably at all of our schools and media attention as well, because
there's only so much space in the paper and sometimes I think that with fans
they pick and choose what teams to cheer for and which games to go to.  
So we're hoping now that since there aren't any men's teams still playing in
the ACC, that perhaps some of them will, that haven't been women's basketball
fans but are Duke fans or North Carolina fans, will now watch the women's
teams play and hopefully come back for more.  
Q. Coach, I just want to ask you about rebounding. I know when you had that
stretch at the end of the regular season where you really weren't playing your
best ball. You were pointing to turnovers. But you're on pace for a tournament
record for rebounding and I want to know what's behind that or what you've
been doing differently to rebound as well as you have?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well since the end of the ACC tournament that our main focus
has been rebounding. So we have done -- many days we do warm-up drills, that
it's, 10 minutes of just rebounding. Totally breaking down the rebounding,
making sure we do the little things well. I thought we got to the point where
we were just trying to outjump people. In certain games you can do that but in
the big games you can't get away with that anymore, and we learned that the
hard way. And when we don't box out, we have been making players run. Since
the beginning of the season we hadn't done that. So we went back to some of
the things to make sure that the emphasis was to do the little things well in
the rebounding category and it's been paying off for us.  
Q. Mistie, for you, talk a little bit about the balance that you have to
have when you come to the Final Four, you want to have fun, there are
distractions, you got to focus and work hard, just balancing that, all that,
and if you could follow-up with how maybe Coach helps you guys stay a little
loose and enjoy it all.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's really important for us to really remain focused.
I remember my freshman year there's a lot of hoopla and a lot of stuff going
on and it's really easy to get caught up in all of it. I think that just with
the seniors, we're just going to be focused on keeping everybody under wraps
and letting everybody appreciate all of the things that are given to us and
all of the attention that we are getting, but at the same time we are here for
one thing and one thing only.  
And I think that Coach, we really haven't talked about it, but we can have fun
with each other and not necessarily worry about what's going on around the
Final Four and just stick together. Because that's what has made us so
successful is that we are here together and we have accomplished something
great, but we're not finished.  
Q. Monique, could you talk about what Alison has done to become a more all-
around player?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, I think she's just a lot more aggressive when she's on
the court, offensively and defensively. Last year we used to stress that we
wanted her to be more aggressive on the offensive end because she would be
aggressive on the defensive end, but then she wouldn't really demand the ball
and this year she's really done a good job of doing that and I think she's a
lot more confident, which helps her in games and be more willing to take
chances or make a move or shoot the ball when she gets it.  
Q. Is there a time you remember when she really demanded the ball?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, um, I don't know a time in particular, but when she
pulls me over and it was like, "I was open, you could have given me the ball,"
then I know that she really wants it and she wants to do something with it.  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about the impact that Abby Waner has
had in the tournament and whether she's been everything you expected or more
than you expected.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think Abby's, she's played her best basketball right now,
which is exactly what you hope for as a coach. I think she came in playing
great basketball and then she lost her confidence a little bit, which happens
with freshmen quite often. But she always remained positive and she fought
through and she never lost faith in herself. And I think that was huge and I
think her teammates really helped her through as well.  
But every time she shoots I think that as a coach and I think her teammates
believe it's going in. Sometimes it was to the point where we believed more
than she did. But I think that they helped her and we all tried to help her
understand that one, she can't be so hard on herself, which she is, she's a
perfectionist, and two, that she needs to shoot for us to be successful. And
we believe in her and I think that now she is believing in herself again,
which is important.  
Q. How big an impact has she been in the tournament?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, she's been huge. When she came in and she, last two
games in particular she's hit big shots right away when she came in. Even
though one was a bank shot, which she did not call, it was a three and it gave
us momentum and she had a big old smile on her face and that's what we needed
to see, that she was relaxed and ready to play and believed in herself.  
And even just the way she's carrying herself, even if she doesn't hit a shot,
she's carrying herself with such confidence and poise that I think that it
makes us all better.  
Q. Gail, and the players, what's one thing you have to do differently
against LSU compared to last year in the Regional?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I think last year we had eight players and when I
watched the tape again I could clearly see we ran out of gas. So I think that
this year we need to use our depth to our advantage. Last year it was a
disadvantage, and this year I think it could be an advantage for us.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Any of the players? Any different answer? If not, we'll move on.
No.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Just win. That's different.  
(Laughter.)  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Good answer.  
Q. Gail, can you think back to '99 when you as a new coach of a Final Four
brought a team that hadn't been to the Final Four before, what's that
experience like, say, from when you win a Regional final to maybe that first
moment when you're here. Can you talk about that.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think that the first year, in '99 when we came for the
first time it was coming off of a huge upset win over Tennessee. And so the
elation of that game was such that it almost overshadowed the fact that we
were going to the Final Four. Because it was a David versus Goliath, so that
was a huge story.  
So it was a totally a whirlwind from that point until we got here. And I don't
think I actually ever came down off of cloud nine until I was back home after
we had lost to Purdue in the championship. So I almost didn't have time to
really catch my breath and understand what was happening to us. And once you
get here for the first time, it is really, truly overwhelming with all of the
media exposure and all of the events that you're required to go to, the game
itself is just two hours and probably it's the one thing that you actually
want to do is play the game, but everything that surrounds it is extremely
overwhelming.  
Q. Gail and any of the players, what does Augustus do better than any other
player you faced this year, and do you think she's the best player in the
country?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Seimone moves without the basketball and reads screens
better than any player in the country.  
If she's the best player in the country? I think we have got a pretty good
player here as well. I think she's certainly one of the best players in the
country. It's hard to compare all the players because they all do something a
little different, we're comparing point guards, wings and posts.  
Q. Question for Monique: Could you talk about the way that LSU defended you
last year and what did you learn from that experience?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, Hoston guarded me last year and I'm pretty sure she will
probably guard me again this year. She's an excellent defender, she's long and
she's aggressive. She was all over me for the entire game and I just think I
need to do a better job of moving when I don't have the ball and definitely
setting up and using my screens to get open, because that's the only way I
could probably shake her off, because she is a really, really good defender.
But we set good screens, so I'll have to use those.  
Q. For the players, after the losses to North Carolina there's been a
perception that Duke may be the more talented team but maybe is not quite
their match in terms of physical and mental toughness. How do you respond to
that, that maybe you're more finesse than toughness? Have you worked on that
or is that something that you accept?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: I definitely don't think it has anything to do with, like, a
mental toughness. I definitely think with our size and the way the style that
we play that it's not as finesse as you're stating that maybe you've heard.
Our team is very physical and we play with a lot of heart and a lot of
passion. I just think that on those typical occasions, those occasions that
you're speaking of we just had defensive breakdowns and let them get on runs
and really didn't capitalize on their weaknesses and let them play to their
strengths. So we just really had to come back and kind of bring everything
back and just collect, and just kind of reflect on what we could have done
better and how we were going to change it. And I think that that two-week span
where we didn't play, we really just capitalized on how we're going beat any
team that we would face in this tournament.  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the 12 straight wins against North Carolina and you
guys are had such a good run there for several years in the ACC, do you feel
like that that has helped the whole ACC get better? Do you feel like the rest
of the programs realize they had to compete with that and that's brought
everybody up to this level?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I do. I feel like, and the other coaches told me that in the
ACC that they had to, they felt that they had to do a better job recruiting to
compete with us. Because we did go on that run where we won 50-some straight
games and I think that it really, it was tough at the time I'm sure for them
but at the same time it made them better because they knew the type of player
we were recruiting against Tennessee, and UCONN and they needed to recruit
against us as well. So I think the entire league has really stepped up its
recruiting efforts and you can see that when you look down the line the last
couple of years at the top recruiting classes, several ACC teams have been in
the top five.  
Q. Gail, you talked about just no men left for the ACC, but has it created a
buzz even within your area within Durham and Chapel Hill and then also within
the conference itself having the three teams?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: It has. Our entire conference I think is so proud and we
talked in the preseason about the fact that we had several teams we thought
could make it to the Final Four and that we thought we had the best conference
overall from top to bottom, but until you actually back it up in the NCAA
tournament, it's just all talk.  
So now I think that our commissioner, he's here, and the assistant
commissioner are here and I think they're so proud and to be the first
conference to have three women's teams in the Final Four I think is pretty
special.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: On that note we'll say thank you very much to these ladies.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will let Coach make an opening statement and go to your
questions. Please raise your hand so we can get a microphone to you.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Obviously we're extremely excited to be here and we have been
asked a lot of questions about being the third trip and, no, it does not
diminish it. It's just exciting and it's a credit to this team and what keeps
you focused on everything is the fact that you have a formidable opponent in
Duke waiting. The fact that they lead the nation in scoring, second in plus
rebound margin. Presents several problems to you, inside attack, outside
attack. I could go on and on.  
I was speaking to someone about game goals and that is to play a 40 full
minutes of Lady Tiger basketball, because that's what's needed this time of
year.  
Q. This is a two-part for Scholanda and Coach Chatman: Scholanda, how much
of an advantage is it to having been here three consecutive years? And Coach,
how much of an advantage is it to having a player like Seimone in this
environment who can take over and kind of win a game for you if she has to?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I think it's a bit of an advantage, just in having some
experience. That plays into being able to help our younger players along.
Everybody except for Kristen Morris was here on the team last year but a lot
of them didn't get the minutes as Seimone and myself did, and Sylvia too. And
just being able to talk to them and kind of coach them through and settle them
down a little bit, like Erica White playing a tough point guard position and
really this being the first time that she's having to carry such a heavy load
in such a big environment on such a big stage. Just being able to be her
support and help her through that.  
POKEY CHATMAN: I'll start with the Seimone question, because that's the
easiest one. Seimone, Seimone is Seimone and she's a joy to watch grow.
Obviously on the court because that's the part that gets rewarded the most,
but just as a person and how she's infected, affected, effected this team and
not at the expense of the team, and part of the reason why we're back here, we
all become better coaches, when we get players like Seimone Augustus. But just
in terms of being here again, just to expand a little bit on what Scholanda
said, I think it's huge in terms of the process of events that take place up
until the game. We understand it's going to boil down to 40 minutes of action,
it's going to take place in between 94 by 50 feet lines, but just in terms of
getting everyone ready and enjoying all the moments, because it's so unlike
anything else, but we enjoy it every time.  
Q. If there's one similar theme for all four of these teams it's they all
seem to run well or at least play very good transition basketball. Is that the
direction that the women's game seems to be going in general and is that a
good thing?  
POKEY CHATMAN: It's a good thing because generally what starts that transition
is a sound defensive effort in the half court. And that's a compliment to kids
at this level buying into that end of the floor, because it's not often
glorified. You credit them and you credit the coaches for making that a point
of emphasis. But we're okay with it moving in that direction because it helps
you utilize every facet of the game. It's no longer a half court game, it
involves every inch of the court.  
Q. Coach, this is your third straight year in the Final Four, I'm sure
there's a comfort zone, but in a way do you feel like an outsider to an ACC
party?  
POKEY CHATMAN: The comfort zone, that's for you guys to write about. It sounds
a lot better, it doesn't feel comfortable because of the field and that's just
a compliment to Duke, Maryland and North Carolina.  
I think it's tremendous that a conference could put three schools in this
event. And we can make jokes about it, I think I did last night, but that's
just a compliment to what they have done. You don't feel like an outsider
because at the end of the day it's the basketball game and everything you work
for for so many years coming up to this point.  
Q. My question is for Coach Chatman, how do you and your players prepare for
a big game?  
POKEY CHATMAN: Several things go into that preparation. The obvious is the
basketball, we watch a lot of film -- I'll back up.  
We rest. We make sure we feed them well. We practice a lot. We watch a lot of
film. We talk about those things. We emphasize everything that's gotten us to
this point and most importantly we enjoy it.  
Q. Sylvia Hatchell spoke for a few minutes about her relationship with you
over the last couple of years. Could you talk about that and also your
thoughts on the other coaches in the Final Four here.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Yes, through Sue I always felt like I knew everyone because she
knew everyone so I would hear all the stories from the Nike trips and how fun
they were, but I always felt like I knew them and I had to remind myself that
I really didn't; it was from a distance.  
But I remember when I was first named head coach in the Nike trip was in Tahoe
and of course they all had the gist of it, so they were enjoying it, having a
good time, golfing, on the yacht, and I was working trying to get my staff
together and I had a little bit more on my mind. But I just remember every
morning, every other morning just meeting up with her and having conversations
with her. It was a definite comfort level. I remember having conversations
with her husband and how welcoming she was just to talk basketball and share
some Sue stories with me and it's just a lot of respect, you respect them from
a distance and now to be up close and personal, I'm still kind of getting used
to being mentioned in the same breath as some of these coaches and what they
have done. I feel like I've been doing it for a couple of weeks and they have
been doing it for a couple of decades.  
So it's a compliment to me and you talked about the other coach, I mean, you
know, look at what Gail has done at Duke over the long haul and it keeps going
in an upward swing direction. And the record speaks for itself. And everything
Brenda's touched, she's turned to gold. And it's not a surprise to us that it
worked with her. All summer we watched the effort and I guess that's part of
the reason why they're all here.  
Q. For Coach, could you talk about Duke's rebounding prowess in the
tournament. They have had numbers in the 50s and 60 performance. What have
they changed from last year?  
POKEY CHATMAN: I don't think you change, I just think as a coach of Gail's
caliber, you find an area that you want to improve upon and you have players
that want to improve and want to get better and it's a mindset. And it's
obviously something that they emphasize. They made a living off of it in terms
of adding something else to their arsenal. And to me it's a mindset, because
we all can emphasize it, but until they buy into it, it's not really good,
it's just on paper. And it's a compliment to those players that want to
participate in the not so glamorous portion of the game because they
understand the significance of it.  
Q. For Seimone, I assume you came back to school this year for the chance to
win the NCAA title, and would you feel complete if you did not win it?  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Yeah, I still would be feel complete. I'll be disappointed,
but it wouldn't overshadow everything that's happened here at LSU through my
years here. I would still feel good about the situation and the fact that I
made the decision to come here and do the things that we have done as far as
making history here.  
Q. Sylvia Fowles, I would like to ask you, it's not that often, I don't know
how often I should say, that you play somebody in similar in height like
tomorrow night with Alison Bales. What is that like with somebody who has at
least an equal ability in size?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Believe it or not I like competition like that. I like somebody
who is taller than me, who I'm going and banging on. Alison Bales is just a
perfect match for me and we have to go out there and do what we have to do.  
Q. Wanted to ask the players, the SEC for a long time has been the premier
women's basketball conference and a lot of people are making a lot of the ACC
getting three teams this year, do y'all feel any extra incentive being the
lone representative from the SEC, a non-ACC school to try to win, and also
being Seimone's last year here and Scholanda's, to try to get that victory in
the first round?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: We want to do this for us. It's about going out there and
playing our best basketball. Laying out there what we're capable of. I think
we have all the tools necessary. We have the players, we have the coaches, we
have the game plan, we have Coach Starkey who stays up all night and breaks
down film, and he's the best at it. We have everything we need. And I think
that's the important thing. And that's the reason why we feel like we're
extremely capable of going out there and doing it. All those other things,
they're good story lines, and they will look nice on paper, but when it comes
down to it, it's everybody that's within this circle we want to do it for
everybody in there.  
Q. This is for Coach: Somebody said the other day that you would try to slow
Duke down kind of sort of the way that Connecticut did. Gail said she didn't
see you coming out of what got you here, that the transition game is what
you're kind of about. Without giving away too many secrets, is it your plan to
just play your game and just and let things fall as they may?  
POKEY CHATMAN: I don't think there are any secrets. I think we have 16 tapes
on Duke. It's never by design to slow a game down, you just go back and
evaluate how you've been effective. You can run in transition and not
necessarily get a shot out of it, and then make seven or eight passes in the
half court. It's not something that we're going to emphasize and say, don't
take a shot until under 10. It's not one of those things. It's just we have
been most effective when we have run half court offense and made the
opposition defend us to get to the free throw line. And if that means the game
ends up in the 50s or 60s, that's an area where we have been good, but it's
not something that we're going to try to emphasize.  
Q. This is for Seimone and Pokey: A lot of the national media has kind of
grasped on to the Katrina story with the men's team, and they have been
showing that, I'm wondering how many of that do you actually get, have you
gotten a lot of questions, comments considering that and is it something that
you feel you're playing for? Scholanda just said you're playing for the
school, do you also feel some state pride as well?  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Always. We want to represent our state as best as we can.
And, yes, we do hear a lot about the Katrina thing. And I think that helps
motivate us. We witnessed everything that happened firsthand and the way we
had to, I guess, adjust and adapt to that situation, only helped us with our
season as far as focusing in on what we have to do. Just those adverse
situations, it was much easier for to us come out here and play for this
extended period of time. The Katrina victims, they really helped inspire us.
We were able to go out and speak with them, try to help as much as we can. So
we feel like to some extent that we can give them two and a half, three hours
out of the day just to enjoy a good basketball game, that's what we're going
to do.  
Q. Coaches often talk about the first five minutes of each half being
relatively crucial, in your mind what do you need to see in the first five
minutes of each half in order for it to be a successful night tomorrow
night?  
POKEY CHATMAN: Not to take away from your question, I think coaches are
probably thinking of it more in terms of the first possession, because that
sort of sets the stage. You play in five-minute increments, you're playing to
be short. Compliment to the field and where we are, you know, we talk about
trying to make every possession our masterpiece. That could be on offense or
defense. And that's the approach we have to take. And that's the compliment.
How we want to play against Duke.  
Q. Coach, Scholanda and Sylvia I'm wondering if you can all answer the
question, is there something called the Seimone factor and can you describe
what that is?  
POKEY CHATMAN: How long is this press conference?  
(Laughter.) You guys get to witness a very small portion of the Seimone
factor. So much of what she's doing is signature Seimone and it's not that we
don't appreciate it, it's just normal. In the locker room, at team functions,
the star player being the biggest cheerleader or the silliest one on the team.
There's several things. And I'll compliment Seimone how she's grown as a
person, athlete, through this team, with this team, the community, and she's
the child that Baton Rouge raised. And to see her on this stage, to continue
to elevate her game is a compliment to her and we're all better people,
including Seimone. And she's always throwing it back at us because certain
times you get a player of her caliber and because of prior star players have
maybe certain expectations, and she extinguished them immediately. And that's
what separates her.  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Don't make me say good things about her in front of her.  
(Laughter.) Oh, I think that the biggest thing is outside of the basketball
things, I said this before, that all the trophies and the awards and the
accolades, I don't think that's what defines her. I think that the way she
carries herself with all of that weight is what defines her, just being so
humble and just not making you feel like she wears that all the time.  
I have told so many people we practice and play with her every day and you
forget sometimes that she's the national Player of the Year and this trophy
winner and that, because she just doesn't exude that every day and makes it
this big, big deal. She doesn't have the huge ego that she could walk around
with because of who she is. I think that's the biggest thing.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I kind of agree with Scholanda and Coach Chatman. Just the
person she is and all the weight she carries on her shoulders, you really
wouldn't know that she's the national Player of the Year, once you're around
her every day. But just her goofiness off the court and it just sets her aside
from everything.  
Q. Seimone, how good is basketball in Baton Rouge? Youth basketball, high
school. I know the men's team has some players, too. Does that city get enough
respect, because I don't think people think of that as being a basketball
hotbed.  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Oh, you have to put us on that. Let me see how I can put it.
In past years we were on top, but now we have declined a little. But we can
take on any Miami girl. We can beat anybody in Miami. But at the time when I
was coming up it was a very big part, basketball was the key thing in Baton
Rouge and we, I mean, that's mainly all we did. You see a lot of kids at the
parks and rec centers, wherever we could get a game, that's where we would be.
And I think like Coach said, that this helped me, the city of Baton Rouge
raised me.  
Q. Question for Coach: How important will your bench players play in this
game? Last year your bench players when you played Duke played a big part. How
important will that be this year?  
POKEY CHATMAN: Huge. I think that one of those bench players is now on the
starting five. I think Sylvia had 13 and 11 last time out. And we struggled
and she was a difference maker in that game. I think it's huge. But I think
every coach would say that, even more so for us because so often we have to
hear about Sylvia and Seimone and I think we're a two-man roster sometimes,
and that's early in the year. You get to this point, everyone understands that
there's a reason why those kids are at the forefront of what you do
offensively. But I think from Florence Williams, I mean everyone, you know,
just in terms of how we need to play in order to be successful is why they're
important.  
Q. For Scholanda, I guess, so often this year you played as the favorite,
you're going into this game as the underdog, you said before you didn't need
any extra motivation, but do you like that challenge at least?  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: It's welcomed. We still have to go out there regardless and
play good basketball. This time of year, I don't think there are any
underdogs. These are four great teams that all want to walk away from here
Tuesday night with a national championship. And that's what you have to go out
there and fight for. You have to go out there believing that you're going to
go out there and play your best basketball and that you're capable of doing
that. When you put that on the floor, that's what has to be done. You're going
to have two great teams going against each other, where no numbers are going
to matter.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Any final questions? If not, I'm going to let them go. Thank you
very much, ladies.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're going to let Coach Hatchell make an opening statement and
then we'll go to your questions.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I believe you were a former coach. Giving all the
information. That's good.  
We're, of course, like all the other teams, excited to be here. We're just
enjoying the experience and having a lot of fun. This is a special team, as
you can tell. These young ladies up here, and we're just excited about playing
a great Maryland team. We have already played them and we know what a great
team they are. So it should be an exciting game tomorrow.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions.  
Q. If there's one thing that seems to tie all four teams together it's they
all run well, at least they are very good transition teams. Some of it is ACC
style, but is this also now the trend in women's basketball?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well I hope it's the trend in women's basketball, because I
like it. But you're right, that's a very similar characteristic of all the
teams; they go up and down the floor, run the ball well, they all have a
strong inside-outside game. And just good balance, good flow. And I think all
four teams here are a lot of fun to watch play.  
So I agree with you 100 percent.  
Q. Coach, to flip the coin on that, how important will it be for your team
to execute in the half court set if Maryland is able to take you out of the,
or at least not take you out, but at least limit your abilities to run?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I think Maryland likes to run too. They score a lot of
points. Our games this year it was 98-95 and then 91-80. That's a lot of
points for both teams.  
Plus I think it's great for women's basketball that people see the talents and
the skills and abilities of all the players. But we're known for our fast
break, but of course if you know our team, and our coaches, we keep a lot of
detailed stats and records in our grading charts and all that. And actually
our percentages in the half court offense are above 50 percent this year. So I
really think that we have executed well in our half court offense, especially
when we had to. Now, yeah, we like to fast break, but when we need to run a
half court offense, we have executed well, especially in pressure situations
down the stretch. And especially in some recent games.  
Q. Sylvia, as the dean of the coaches here, would you just offer a comment
on your colleagues, especially the young Coaches Brenda and Pokey, please.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, dean, man, you make me feel old.  
(Laughter.) The only time when somebody says dean that I think would make me
feel real good is they compare me to Dean Smith, to tell you the truth.  
But it's an honor to be here and I think we got a lot of good young coaches
now out there. Pokey was a great player and took over for Sue Gunter and just
again, she has brought her expertise as a player to the game. Her intensity or
her passion. I've gotten to know her real well in the last few years. We have
a special relationship. We have talked a lot about on Nike trips and other
times about transition game. I think we have a lot of the same philosophy with
motion offenses and defensive concepts and stuff, so I really have enjoyed the
relationship I've built with her.  
And then in our league, you know, the team or the coaches, it just gets better
and better every year. I know a few years ago we played Minnesota, whenever
Brenda was there, we played them in the NCAA tournament and we beat them in
Chapel Hill by just a point or two. And I said right then, you know, I told
Minnesota they better take care of her or somebody is going to grab her and
they did. But Brenda has done a good job at Maryland and she and I have talked
about a lot of things. She's asked my opinion about some different things, so,
but it's great for the game, especially in our league.  
And of course Gail has been at Duke awhile. And we're just big rivals, but we
have a healthy rivalry. We have tremendous respect for each other and our
programs and I think we make each other better. So it's just a lot of fun
right now to coach and to see a lot of the younger players coming, a lot of
the younger coaches coming through and actually last night at the banquet and
I was thinking about a lot of the young former young players that are now into
coaching and some of them that are assistant coaches other places and I was
just thinking that a few years from now a lot of these kids are going to be
head coaches, so it's a lot of fun to see them carrying on their passion and
love for the game.  
Q. Coach, you obviously have a lot of success then you had a stretch against
Duke where it was kind of tough. What turned it around for you and you just
talked about how you made each other better, what did they do that made you
better?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, it's called Alana Beard graduating is what it's called.
It was hard for to us beat them when Alana Beard was there. But again, like I
mentioned, I think in our league, not just Duke, but all of our teams, we make
each other better. The level of our conference competitively has increased
tremendously in the last few years and it's not just Carolina, Duke and
Maryland, I mean Boston College was almost here; we got a lot of great teams
in our league.  
So, I think that again, you know, we have gotten some great players and in our
recruiting the last few years, I think our style of play fits our players. And
as a coach, when I was younger, I wanted to prove myself as a coach, but with
different things that we accomplished. Now I don't have to prove myself as a
coach, the main thing now is I just want my players to experience success and
I want to see the smiles on their faces. I want them to have fun and I want it
to be one of the best times of their lives and I just want to help them grow
as basketball players and as people, and that's where I get my enjoyment from.
So I'm having a blast.  
Q. What are the things that your team has to do to match up against
Maryland?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: What do we need to do to match up with Maryland? Well, maybe
we need to recruit you.  
(Laughter.) Well, we have already played them a couple times and I just think
there's a lot of good one-on-one match-ups on the floor, at every position.
They're outstanding and we are too, I think a lot of the little things will
make a difference, I think it will come down a lot of it to rebounding, and
just whichever team the ball is going in the hole for tomorrow.  
Q. To the players, Maryland was the only team that defeated you this year,
do you think whatever questions you had you solved in the ACC tournament title
game or are there still some things you have to be concerned about tomorrow
night?  
IVORY LATTA: Could you repeat the question, please?  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Maryland was the only team that beat you this year. When you defeated
them in the tournament game do you think you solved all the holes they might
have found or are there still some things you as a team have to be concerned
about tomorrow night?  
LA'TANGELA ATKINSON: Well, since we lost to Maryland, we improved in practice
and we got better throughout the game. So just improving throughout practice
and the rest of our games we kind of solved everything during practice.  
Q. Coach, with Ivory, do you almost have to suppress some coaching instincts
with her, I mean there are things you would maybe normally tell a player not
to do that you have to let her do? And I think maybe the answer is yes, maybe
Ivory might want to comment on this too.  
IVORY LATTA: That's for the coach.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I think with accountability and responsibility, when
you show those characteristics, you get more privileges. And Ivory has proven
herself to me when she came in as a freshman. I let her make a lot of
mistakes, because I knew that it was going to pay off in the long run. Of
course she was skilled when she came in, her ball handling was excellent, her
three-point shooting was excellent. But I think that her knowledge as a point
guard, her decision making, just her experience, the experience in our league
has just paid off tremendously for Ivory, but I've coached her long enough
that we can look at each other and pretty much know what we're thinking and
she knows what I want done out on the floor, and I can make a little gesture
to her and she knows exactly what I'm talking about without saying anything.
But again, because she's been accountable and showed responsibility on the
floor and decision making in pressure situations, then I give her more freedom
because she's proven herself.  
IVORY LATTA: Yeah, right. I think Coach pretty much said it all. But it comes
down to, I think it all goes down to confidence and she has a lot of
confidence in me and that right there just builds up my confidence to go out
there and perform to the best of my ability, but I'm just happy that she's
given me the opportunity to go out there and do the things that I do. That's
my girl.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Sylvia asked Gail this question just a little while ago, but do you feel
like the rise and the success of the ACC has finally kind of allowed the women
to get their due on Tobacco Road or do you feel like you still need to fight
for recognition, considering the tradition there?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, basketball is basketball and our men have had a
tradition for a long, long time. And it's just, there's just no rivalries and
there's just nothing like ACC basketball. I grew up a men's basketball fan.
That's one reason why I wanted the job at North Carolina.  
It's a wonderful environment to be in. You just can't express what the feeling
is like when you're in the area we're in, of course on our campus it's
tremendous. It's just such an honor to be on that campus with former coaches
like Dean Smith, Bill Guthridge, now with Roy Williams there, it's just so,
it's a basketball coaches heaven, paradise really, and then with all the other
coaches coming in, I've made friends with a lot of the coaches, of course all
the women's coaches, but men's coaches too. A lot of them when they come to
town they will call me up. Bobby Cremins and I are good buddies, and Dave
Odom, he's out in South Carolina, so it's just a wonderful feeling, I guess
you could say with the relationships that we have and I don't look at it as
men and women's basketball, I look at it as ACC and basketball. I think the
women have really put the ACC on the map this year with three teams being in
the league. And I'm telling you, the ACC women may be better next year. I know
you think, well how can it be better, but it could be better because I think a
lot of the teams are going to be even better next year.  
So, but all the coaches get along well, it's a tremendous relationship that we
have, yesterday some people were asking a lot of questions about us and Duke,
you know, yeah, we're eight miles apart, but we have a lot of respect for each
other and we make each other better. I think one reason why we're both here is
because we make each other better.  
So it gets some attention at times but I think both teams do really well to
keep things in perspective. And we really, like I said, we both have
tremendous respect for each other.  
Q. For Ivory, you've been on TV enough now that you're a recognizable face
around America. And you really are emotional on the court. Some people have
said that sometimes it looks as though you're showing up the other team or
like Diana Taurasi before you, people kind of have a negative impression, some
people, and a lot have a positive impression, can you comment on that?  
IVORY LATTA: No, I just came to the conclusion. No matter what I do, people
are going to say the things they want to say, but as long as I'm out there
having fun and enjoying myself and my teammates enjoying it, as long as I'm
not doing anything to hurt my teammates or disrespect my coach or my school,
I'm just going to keep doing it. And until coach says, hey, you know, don't do
that anymore, then I'm not going to do it. But she knows from the bottom of my
heart that I'm not going to go out there and do anything to disrespect the
other team or disrespect the university. I'm out there having fun and I'm
going to keep doing it. My little dances, my smiles, my anything, I'm just
going to have fun out there. That's what she always tells us before we leave
the locker room is main thing is to have fun. And that's what I'm going to
keep doing. Yeah.  
Q. Coach, along those similar lines can you kind of put into words what
Ivory does, both with her play and her mentality to kind of help the team and
also you've kind of compared her ease in front of the camera with I think a
Marian Jones, the last point guard, can you kind of expound upon that too a
little bit?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, first of all, Ivory is a great kid. And let's start
with the foundation, because I'm very southern, as you can tell, and there's
an old saying "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." And she has a
wonderful family. Her mother and daddy, just the environment she grew up in,
we had time I could tell you about her home visit, that must have been what,
close to a hundred people at her house there. And the whole house was full, we
had the windows up, people were sitting in the windows, they were sitting on
top of the furniture, it was just unbelievable. We had a big feast, a big
feast. And it was on Sunday, went to church together and then went to the
house, all teachers were there, and family members and all the boys that used
to play on the court with her. It was a wonderful day. What a great time we
had.  
But Ivory is first of all, she's for real. She's for real. And she has a heart
and a passion for the game of basketball. Ivory is very concerned about her
image. She wants to project a strong positive image to everyone that is
involved with the game. She has tremendous respect for everyone on the court,
the opponents, the referees, the media, everyone. She's just, I think she's
great for the women's game right now because she's such a positive role model.
And she's very concerned and very aware of little kids. If she's in a big room
full of people, I mean, even if the president of the United States was
probably in the room and there were little kids in there, Ivory would go to
the little kids. I don't know if she's drawn to them or they're drawn to her
because of her size.  
(Laughter.) Stop kicking me, Ivory. But she's just has a heart and a passion
for the game. And again, even though Ivory gets some individual awards, she's
really all about her team. She wants to uplift, to lift up her team and bring
recognition to them. And just the example is that the ACC Tournament there, in
the final game, when the clock was running down and she called her, one of her
teammates that had played a great game. Erlana and gave her the game ball,
wanted her to have the game, the ball the last few minutes. And then when they
gave her the MVP award, she looked at me and says, "I don't deserve this,
Erlana does." And I said, "Well, tell her that."  
So she's always lifting up her teammates and trying to make them better and
just a great kid. And her excitement and enthusiasm and passion for the game
it makes people smile. It makes people feel good, it makes people smile. I
can't tell you the number of letters and phone calls and e-mails we have
gotten from people that have just said how she brightens their day.  
And again, and I'll finish, and I know I talked too long here, but I've been
coaching a long time and one of my main goals, well right now the first goal
is to win games for the University of North Carolina, but second of all is
promote the game. And I feel like the way we play and having a player like
Ivory sells the game of basketball. Because I want people to fall in love with
women's basketball. And that's one reason why we go up and down the floor.
Because I want them to score a lot of points and make it exciting and fun. I
don't like low-scoring games. I made the comment, it's sort of like watching
paint dry. I like to go up and down the floor and that's what we're all about.
I don't like slow games.  
Q. I'm going to hold you to five minutes on this one. Seriously, Coaches do
talk about the first five minutes of each half. The importance of the first
five minutes of each half. What do you need to see in your mind in the first
five minutes of each half for it to be a successful night tomorrow night?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Intensity. Aggressiveness on offense and defense. The
intensity level. And we have started this year mostly well. We did not start
well in the Purdue game. But then in also a few games in the second half we
come out of the locker room not with the intensity level. I call a quick time-
out and then we get to the intensity level that we need.  
So I think just the intensity level that we come out with on both ends of the
floor.  
Q. Coach, for three teams to be from one conference, do the stars kind of
have to align to get these teams all here?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, it's interesting how all three teams got here, but I'm
not surprised at all. Because they all deserve it and they're all very, very
good. So I'm just glad we're all in different brackets. So we could be here.  
I'm not surprised at all. That is just how good our conference is. And it may
be even better in the future.  
Q. Ivory, I could tell by the look on your face that when she was describing
the home visit that's pretty much how it went. Can you explain why everyone
was there, I would think you would want to have that to yourself?  
IVORY LATTA: Yeah, that many people I think that was pretty much my whole
town. So I don't know. I just know that they have been following me throughout
my whole career at North Carolina and they're very supportive and I just know
that when I told them that North Carolina was coming, everybody just wanted to
come. So my mom, she cooked up a big feast for everybody and we didn't know
that many people was going to come. People started showing up that I ain't
know who they were. I'm like, all right, they coming with North Carolina
shirts on. Well, I'm like you know what, just go ahead and enjoy yourself.  
But they have been very supportive with me throughout my career. And I just
can't thank them enough for the things they done for me.  
Q. Coach, do you think in the past women's players more reluctant to show
emotion on the court and was there more so than men's players?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I don't know. I never really thought about that, to tell you
the truth. I don't know. Maybe you ought to ask the players that. I don't
know. I'm usually not speech less, but I don't know.  
LA'TANGELA ATKINSON: I don't know.  
IVORY LATTA: Oh, I think it's great for the game to be honest. Because they
say a lot of women shouldn't do a lot of things and men are able to do it, but
whenever we go out there and show emotion and just show our passion for the
game also, and we like to go out there and fight hard and dive for balls and
hustle and play with a lot of intensity. So without emotion in the game, I
think that it would be pretty much boring, yeah. I think I think that sums it
all up.  
Q. Just a follow-up in that vein: Isn't it fundamentally sexist to criticize
women for doing what in the men's game would be celebrated as attractive
flamboyance?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I don't know. I would have to think about that a little bit.
We just try to do what helps us be successful. In being emotional on the floor
and showing our, like Ivory said, our passion and enthusiasm for the game, it
helps us. And I'm going to tell you, we enjoy it. We show our love and our
heart and our passion for the game and for each other and I let our players
have a lot of fun out there. They enjoy the experience and they enjoy each
other, and the chemistry on our team is absolutely incredible. Just because we
got a lot of great players on our team, but they know that they are ten times
better with each other than they are by themselves.  
So they work really, really hard just to keep that chemistry going and to let
each other know how much they appreciate each other. And I think that's real
important. They are constantly giving words of affirmation and affirming each
other and how important they are. So, but the emotion out there, I don't know,
I just know I used to think that men's coaches in women's basketball they
could carry on on the sideline and if they got a technical, that was fine. No
big deal. But if a female coach got a technical, then, oh, you know, that
was... and I know, I've felt that way. So maybe that's in the same ballpark, I
don't know. But all I know is that we're going to play with a lot of heart and
passion and have fun.  
Q. Coach, just wondering if any of North Carolina's opponents came up with
any creative schemes to stop Ivory and slow the transition game down, any kind
of novel defenses?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, let's see, trying to think. We have played some great
teams. They played a lot of good defense. Tennessee put a big player on her.
We have had some of them do that. I think that from my perspective as a coach,
as teams try to double her or put a big player on her, or different things
like that, then I'll tell her we'll run something to get a mismatch or make
them switch off, or if it's a trap, then we'll do something to let her break
the trap or I have two point guards in there lots of times, if you watch us
play, then the other one will bring it up the floor and then that -- if there
are two of them trying to guard her, then somebody is open.  
So again, we have had -- I tell you, when we played the first game in the NCAA
tournament, Riverside. Yeah. And it was at Vanderbilt and we sit underneath
the baskets, there the benches are on the end and so we were sitting
underneath the basket and I noticed that when they would shoot the ball, all
five of them just took off running to the other end of the floor, but none of
them went for an offensive rebound. I looked at my assistant coach, I said,
you think they were afraid of our fast break there? All five of them, not a
one of them went to the offensive boards. They would shoot the ball and take
off. All five of them. So I felt that was interesting.  
(Laughter.)  
But I don't know. There's a lot of different strategies you can use. But
again, Ivory is not our whole team. We have got a lot of good players on the
floor. Camille can play point guard if she needs to. Sometimes she brings it
up the floor because she throw it in for us. Tangie can bring it up the floor.
We put Tangie in the middle, we give her the ball and then she attacks the
basket. So we have a lot of things that we can do. So it's just not Ivory.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Thank you very much, ladies. Appreciate your time up here.
