# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Chameka Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13905)

### [Sophia Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13856)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
SOPHIA YOUNG: Credit to Oklahoma State, they have great tradition.  
Q. Can you talk about the shooting, shots not following, particularly in the
first half?  
CHAMEKA SCOTT: One of the worst offensive games ever. Just shots weren't
falling. We were getting open looks and they were shots we've been practicing
but they were not going in for us tonight and that's hard to deal with.  
Q. Did you try to rebound against Courtney?  
SOPHIA YOUNG: Courtney is a great player and she's big and she is physical and
she uses her body very well. Sometimes it's difficult to get around her. She's
a great rebounder and give her credit.  
Q. You guys seemed a little rattled at the beginning of the game, do you
think that first play of the game, that fast break pretty much set the tempo
for the game?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: No, I don't. I didn't think we were rattled. I just
thought we missed shots. I mean, gosh, we shoot 79 shots, that's special. Look
at what we shot from the field. Always give credit to the opponent. Some of
those that we missed were great defense, I would say the majority of what we
missed were wide-open looks and that was probably their game plan was to make
other people beat you besides Sophia, and we didn't get it done. You can go
from top to bottom, everybody that played got wide-open looks. At this level,
you've got to nail shots. We didn't do it.  
Q. Chameka, when they are hitting 3s like they all seem to be daggers, how
hard it is to defend them?  
CHAMEKA SCOTT: With them having three-point shooters, it spreads the floor a
lot but at the same time you just want to help inside the three-point game
which is good for them I guess. And once they got hot, you know, they were on
a roll and the shots were falling for them, and they kept going in that aspect
of their game. I guess we were just not getting out far enough and they were
hitting.  
Q. Particularly in the first half, did frustration start to set in, and did
you feel like that affected your game at all?  
SOPHIA YOUNG: Yeah, I would say that. I was feeling a little frustrated, not
anything they were doing, just like not hitting my shots.  
Q. You shot like 23 threes and I know some of that was late, but was there a
lot that you did have to maybe match their threes or anything?  
CHAMEKA SCOTT: Well, no, I just shoot 3's all the time and, you know, just as
a shooter you don't want to let the first couple go. Like I said they were
giving us looks. We kept trying, but they just were not falling. I don't think
there was pressure in that sense at all. We were still trying to play Baylor
basketball.  
Q. Can you talk about just the physical nature of play in the lanes today as
far as toward the end of the game, it was really evident that it was a very
heated match-up?  
SOPHIA YOUNG: We knew that the game was going to be physical coming out
because that's always been the type of game that we played. Courtney and Leah
did a really good job of trying to keep the ball away from me and, I don't
know, it was just a difficult game and we knew it was going to be like that.  
Q. Can you talk about the last minute, you were maybe wanting to get
Courtney to the foul line and see if you could come back on the offensive end
and get something going?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: We were trying to foul her, maybe her shoot free
throws, hope she would miss, come down the offensive lend and get a bucket and
get the lead. We started doing that early in the six-minute mark and you
didn't want to wait too long. I thought we cut it nine, I wanted to play good
defense and Tisdale and went and fouled. I didn't want a foul.  
But they are the better team. They are better than we are. So to elaborate on
your question about losing three teams, you beat somebody three times, you're
better than they are. So they are better than we are. We are both going to go
to the NCAA Tournament and hopefully going to make a run and hopefully
represent the Big 12 well.  
Q. As poorly as your team shot in the first half, you were still in the
game?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: That's unbelievable. That's unbelievable to shoot 19
percent. Not only did we shoot poorly, Oklahoma had 19 turnovers at the half.
Just wild that you would even think we would be in the ballgame at that point.
I think that's just the guts and the will to win and the effort that they gave
on the defensive end of the floor. It's just we couldn't buy a basket from the
perimeter.  
Q. Can you talk about the difference of this year and last year, last year
you were on the big winning streak and run?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, you want to win the Big 12 Championship
outright, and we didn't do that. We came in second.  
So we are going to erase all that have from our minds and we're going to take
tomorrow off and we are going to get ready to practice on Monday. In a lot of
ways, leaving the conference is a breath of fresh air. We don't beat up on
each other. When we go to the NCAA Tournament, it's really a breath of fresh
air for all of us.  
Q. This game had a Sweet 16 type of feel, do you think it's like a game you
could see a few weeks down the road?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Sure. Hopefully you can draw upon the fact you don't
like sitting up here losing so you get in the gym and shoot some shots and
make some buckets.  
Q. The 20 out of 79 shots, do you think their defense was obviously --  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Their defense was good on Sophia. Very seldom do you
see a team where someone steps up when Sophia is not doing good; then you have
Chameka that steps up, but to have the entire team, the entire team offense,
it's a mystery to me, too. If I could bottle it up and tell you what happened,
I'd sell it to every coach in America. First of all, I always give credit to
the opponent. I thought their zone defense made us take those threes, for a
reason. There was a reason they were playing zone defense. So give those guys
credit.  
But at this level, you've got to nail wide-open shots. And we've got pep
people on this team, we go to Iowa State and played zone before, we go to
different places in this league and we've hit those shots. Didn't hit them
tonight. Not a person on our team did.  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Sure, it's called good coaching.  
Q. What is it about your team this year as they have tried to forge their
own identity as opposed to last year's team what makes you feel good about
this team?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Last year when we sat here, we were reining conference
champs and we won a National Championship yet. We did not have anybody on the
team that went that for to the NCAA Tournament. We have four or five that have
been to the NCAAs and understand what it's all about. I think that they will
lead and guide the younger players and we'll make a run and be as tough as we
possibly can. How far we go remains to be seen.  
Q. Can you talk about the role Jasmine played in keeping you in the game the
in the first half?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, Jasmine, she did a very good job. She tried to
generate some offense. Jasmine is very good in the Open floor. She did her job
to keep us close in that ballgame with Tisdale in foul trouble, I thought
jasmine did just fine. She made a few steals defensively. She tried to
generate things in the Open floor for us to create some excitement. I thought
that she did just fine.  
Q. Are you surprised more teams haven't tried to send Paris to the line that
much the way you did today earlier this season?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't know. If we had not been behind, we wouldn't
have done it. It's just the flow of the game and coaching and trying to cut
the lead. You've got to do something. You've got to make some changes. Our
best option was just to put her at the line. She was 6 for 15, so it worked in
a lot of ways.  
Q. You guys played two really good games that you guys seemed to have
control of for large part of. Wonder if you can talk about what kind of
improvement you've seen out of them or maybe whether they are peaking, just
seemed like a different game than those first two.  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, I think you want to play well when you're
heading into the post-season and I think now that they have got their freshmen
and they have played this many games, they probably understand the Paris's
strengths and weaknesses better, as older players do.  
The more you play together, the better you get. They are playing very good
basketball right now. I hope that they and all of us that go to the NCAA
tournament can do very, very well.  
Q. When they are hitting 3-pointers and when they have their perimeter game
going, how good are they?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: How good are they? Well, you've got to take your
poison. Do you double-down in on Paris or do you go out to the three? Very
difficult to guard both positions, and that's what they bring to the table.
They have a big presence inside. Yet if you double-down in there, they are
going to kick it out from the three. You know, I thought Abiola defended as
good as she could. She has a lot of skills and banged in there as much as she
could until she fouled out. I thought Higgins hit some big shots for them.
That's what you do when you are heading into the playoffs, you've got to have
players make plays.  
Q. Sophia called this her worst offensive game ever, but it wasn't like they
took a shot without three players on her so, what do you tell her now?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I go and tell her and all the team, this game is over
with. We are going to go back and we are going to get rested tomorrow and we
are going to come to practice Monday and we are going to go to the selection
show and we're going to play the last part of our season. And our season is
broken down in four: Evaluate what you did non-Conference, what you did in
Conference, what you did in the Conference tournament and now let's see what
happens in this last part of the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Erin Higgins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13855)

### [Courtney Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13851)

### [Leah Rush](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14237)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH COALE: I am so proud of our kids. I thought they competed together and
showed their unit throughout the 40 minutes. It was a heck of a fight. They
played really, really hard. We had to play through them in order to win this
championship, so I am most proud maybe of our poise. I do realize that we
probably set the game back about 15 years by our turnovers, but to win in
spite of that, you throw them the ball 32 times and you're still able to win,
there must be some other things that you're doing pretty well.  
So just really, it's an amazing accomplishment to go undefeated in this league
and then to be able to sweep the tournament as well, I think is a reflection
of what these kids are made of.  
Q. Courtney, and Erin as well, the reason I don't bring you up in this,
you're playing on the perimeter and I know it's physical out there to, too,
but Courtney and Leah, could you talk about how physical of a game this was
inside and the things that they got into?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I thought it was a very physical game. I'm a big girl and I'm
scratched up, and I feel like I was stepped on. They played us tough. It was a
very physical game, very physical on both sides. I mean, it just was what it
was.  
LEAH RUSH: I agree. The refs let us play and especially that second half, they
were not calling a lot. So you're going to get the opportunity to play like
that, I think you just have to get after this it.  
Q. Just the stretch of free throws at the end it looked like there was's
point where you looked a little mad maybe or motivated?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Just the story of my life. I guess I like making them at the
very end of situations and, I don't know, I try, guys. I don't know what to
say. We practice and we run and my teammates are going to be upset about it in
practice -- (laughter) at least we won, that's all that counts.  
Q. You hit four in a row, or five in a row, whatever, but before the stretch
of you hit four in back-to-back possessions, any particular words of
motivation from your sister or any other teammates?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Most definitely. I think they all aim to me and said:
"Dribble, dribble, dribble, watch the basket and then shoot." That one really
helped.  
And also, on a serious note, I think the biggest thing, I probably missed
about ten in a row and they said, "Don't worry about it, who cares about that,
this one is what counts." Finally it was able to sink it and that was the best
thing in the word. You can't do that without good teammates.  
Q. What was going on in the locker room considering they shot 19 percent and
they were only down by four because of the 19 turnovers?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Well Coach Coale came in the locker room and said, "you have
17 turnovers," and our wise-guy assistant coaches said, "no, it's 19." That's
pretty horrible when we are still up by four.  
Coach Coale said, "Don't worry about it, start over and we can win," and
that's what happened.  
Q. For Courtney and Leah, can you talk about Sophia Young, the way you
defended her, it took a while before she really got going and talk about your
defense on her and maybe the team in general on her?  
LEAH RUSH: Personally, just the last couple of games, she tore us up. She's a
great player, and the only way you can do anything on her is to prevent her
from catching the ball. So into was the strategy all along, just to front and
prevent catches. Laura came in towards the end of the game when I was in foul
trouble and did a great job on her. Laura, she can get after it on defense.
Just a team effort there.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think it says a lot for Sophia when our whole thing is don't
let her get going and she still has 50 points or whatever, that's pretty big.
As a team, Laura and Erin -- Laura and Leah -- not Erin, but Laura and Leah
did a great be job of fronting her and I just did a great job on the back
side. Sorry.  
LEAH RUSH: She's still learning our names (laughter).  
Q. Courtney, I'm sure people have fouled you before, but have you ever had a
situation where people were just shoving you away from the ball and you were
just begging the referee to call foul?  
COURTNEY PARIS: No. I've never had anyone play so physical. And, I don't know,
I'm young, you know, it kind of threw me off a little bit. Kind of got riled
up there a little bit.  
You've got to do what you've got to do. Like I said, the refs were calling
that way and we are were able to do physical things and that's just the way it
was.  
Q. When the refs are letting you play and letting it be physical, do you
think that gives your team an advantage a little bit?  
ERIN HIGGINS: I think that Courtney being the physical player she is, it might
be an advantage for her. She might not get into foul trouble, or the smaller
players maybe not as much. When it gets physical, sometimes that's when it
gets the most fun and I think Baylor might agree that this game was really,
really fun to play.  
Q. Do you think it's an advantage for your team when the refs let you play
and be physical?  
LEAH RUSH: I think it can be. For the Courtney, she can create spaces for
herself. Our team as a whole, we'll play as hard as anybody out there. Baylor
is tough, though. They are the same. They are strong and physical. So I think
Erin nailed it, it was a fun game on both ends. Any time you can play and run,
it's fun.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Since I'm the biggest person on the court, I guess I should
say yes, it's to our advantage. I don't know, like these said, if they are
rushing you while you play and you're able to be physical and do some thing on
both sides, it makes for a bit more of an interesting game and I would say a
little bit more fun.  
Q. Erin, can you talk about how good of a team you guys are when you hitting
from the three-point range, and how you felt throughout this tournament
yourself?  
ERIN HIGGINS: I think when we can hit from the perimeter it's a huge advantage
for us because they are forced to come out of whatever type of double-teams
they are going to bring on Courtney, or Ashley, for that matter.  
When we are not hitting shots, people can just sit back and that makes it
harder for Courtney. She's got to work hard and she gets a bit more tired.
Anything we can do on the perimeter to help her out, that's what we're here
for.  
Q. Towards the end, you guys were pulling away and you were having fun out
there, could you tell midway through that they were frustrated or could you
just see that look this their face like nothing was going right for them?  
ERIN HIGGINS: We could tell just a little bit they were getting frustrated,
just the way we guarded Sophia, it was frustrating but she didn't get as many
touches as she's used to getting. Baylor is a great team, so you know that
when they are down, you know they are that not out. We knew we had to keep
coming and rebounding and making plays, and give them credit, they never gave
up.  
LEAH RUSH: I don't think there's anymore to it. I think basketball is just a
game of run (ph) and whether they were having a low spurt or a high spurt,
it's going to keep coming in waves. As our team, we never let back too much,
just put it on repeatedly.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I mean, I guess, like these girls said -- repeat the question,
please. (Laughter).  
Q. Erin, three-point shooter, that's a nice NBA 3 that you shoot.  
ERIN HIGGINS: Thank you.  
Q. Courtney, I believe your sister did say, "Dribble, dribble shoot," I saw
her motion that in the circle, was that really the motivating factor to get
you back into those free throws at the end of the game?   
COURTNEY PARIS: I think so. It's days like these, I think it's special to have
your family and my twin sister, who is one of my best friends as a teammate.
She criticizes me a lot but stuff like that, that's pretty cool.  
Q. Leah, can you comment on, Courtney shows a lot of emotion and a lot of
motivation on the court after every play, not only when she scores but when
other players score, talk about what type of role she plays on the team as far
as motivating?  
LEAH RUSH: Well, I think, you know, more than just her -- all of the emotion
you guys see, the plays she makes, that's what motivates me. I can't speak for
the rest of my team, but I catch myself running down the court over and over
just shaking my head and laughing, the things she does. Because she not only
can guard, this kid, but her blocks, it's just ridiculous. So that's something
that I like to see. But certainly any time all of get-up kind of stuff, things
fun and it brings excitement to the whole gym I think, our fans everyone and.
We feed off that and we feed off the fans.  
Q. You've beat Baylor three times, and the other times you had to come-from-
behind to do it. It felt like you guys took control from the beginning, maybe
didn't pull away, can you talk about the dishes in the third game?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, you know, I was thinking, as heavily as we're playing, at
least we're still ahead, which we had not been at the other two meeting. I
felt like if we could just sustain at half-time where we could get in that
locker room, I thought if we could sit down and look at each other and realize
what we were doing, how fast we were going at offense, and we did that at
half-time and our second half was much better.  
Again I credit our defense for limiting Sophia's touches and not letting them
get comfortable. They so need the ball to go through her to generate offense
and they made tough shots and they this made a few of them. But still to go in
with a four-point lead with all of those turnovers --  
Q. How good is this team right now?  
COACH COALE: I think we are still getting better. Obviously we have some room
for improvement. But they are just a resilient bunch. Sometimes at this time
of year, it's obviously about how good you are, but it's also about how you
are together, and I don't know if I've been around a team that's any better
together.  
And I mean that in never way, not just in passing the basketball, not just in
helping on defense, but just the way they steer themselves together down the
stretch. We needed to get out of their way, let them do it.  
Q. Did you consider taking Courtney out, I think with about 3:41 left, and
it's obvious they were going to start to attack her, did you consider taking
her out at that point?  
COACH COALE: We did but we needed her to defend and rebound. You know, she had
four fouls and we had her out for a little bit and things just get a little
shaky sometimes when she's not out there down the stretch. So we felt like her
presence was a tremendous factor and I have to credit Chris Reid (ph), our SID
at the end of the table, he says, "Why don't you throw the ball inbounds?"
Hey, that's a real good idea.  
"Hey, Courtney throw the ball inbounds." We were yelling, stay out-of-bounds.
Stay there, we'll go.  
Q. You talked about how much Courtney has improved this year; how good she
can be?  
COACH COALE: I think that's the thing about Courtney that may be we don't step
back and realize, and maybe everybody will after the season is over, but as
good as she is, she can get so much better. And there are so many little
things, she's a conscientious kid and we have already been through the whole
apologetic thing she did when she comes out of the game. She says "I'm sorry
for the 26 rebounds." But she doesn't like to do things wrong and as a result
of that, we pick on her like crazy and she does continue to get better. Her
defense tonight, I think instinctively and the principles she's been taught
and the I think sting of when to go and when to shade and when to recover,
it's extraordinary. You just give her a little bit, but she's going to be
something math he is tinge.  
Q. Is a game like this more of a statement or argument for Player of the
Year?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I don't know about that. Sophia Young is a terrific
basketball player and she's had a terrific season, she's had an amazing career
at Baylor. Courtney Paris is special. She might be a once-in-a-lifetimer. She
got her MVP at the tournament, we won the championship, let's get on to the
next thing.  
Q. Can she stay out-of-bounds, and -- inaudible -- just how you're playing
at the he end of the year?  
COACH COALE: Yes, she can stay out-of-bounds if she wants to. I suppose if
they ran over there and tackled her, that would be an additional -- but as far
as the final four, I've been asked a lot of questions about this team and the
similarities to that Final Four. Player-for-player, strategically, not really
many similarities. We didn't have a big go-to post. We lived and died by that
perimeter shot and our ability to get to the free throw line. It's just a
different makeup. We still try to play fast but it's a completely different
team.  
That bunch that went to the Final Four, they were so good together, the
smartest thing I ever did was -- inaudible -- throughout the NCAA Tournament
and this bunch is a lot like that. They are a little younger, don't have that
experience of the Final Four group and the two Sweet 16s and it was their time
and they were going to make it happen. None of these guys have been past the
first or second round. Experience is a little different but I tell you what,
they are something special, when there's something on the line, there's
something special there.  
Q. On the seed, 1 or 2?  
COACH COALE: In my gut I think they will give us a 2. I think if we can win
this conference tournament and go undefeated in league play, you deserve a 1.
But they didn't really ask me and I don't figure they will call. So we'll go
play wherever they tell us to play.  
Q. You talk about your aces and your 3-point shooters, Courtney is obviously
going to play well, but when they are going, how different are you?  
COACH COALE: I felt like tonight's game was boiled down to the people around
Sophia Young and Courtney Paris. In the first half, we're not even in a
position to fight for a championship in the second half. Erin kept us in the
game. There's no doubt about that. I think that was the big difference in that
game in the second half. She was hounded from baseline to baseline, to hand
the ball to Courtney, to get us some sets, she made some transition baskets,
she guarded, she came up with rebounds, she managed the guard, she did all the
things a premiere point guard can do, and nobody ever talks about her. I tell
you, she runs the show.  
Q. Do you think that because they were shoving Courtney away from the ball
like that, do you think she concentrated more down the stretch on dribbles?  
COACH COALE: Free throws are about repetition and certainly about
concentration. With Courtney, she does whatever she needs to do to win a game,
and her will is incredible. She realizes that, hey, to get this thing over
with, I have to make a couple of free throws. Her passion, you go through a
season and you have this moment that you hang on it, I will never forget her
face turning around and looking when she made that first free throw. I just
sat back and thought, gosh, I have a great job.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Angela Tisdale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16382)

### [Sophia Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13856)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Wow, survived another one. I want to compliment A&M as
I did Kansas State. Their defense, just defense does exactly what Gary asked
them to do. They play hard, they gamble, they make it tough on you, they
contest shots. I just thought that they gave an effort that was just
outstanding.  
I'd like to also compliment our basketball team. I thought when the game was
on the line, we did exactly what we needed to do to win it. Angela Tisdale
stepping up and making free throws like a warrior for you, and defensively she
did some good things for us down the stretch. I thought the last stand for us
defensively was very good. Good ballgame.  
Q. Sophia, you showed as much emotion after the game as you have all season,
did this mean more since it was so hard-fought?  
SOPHIA YOUNG: This game gave us another shot at Oklahoma and I think coming
into this tournament, that's what we were really hoping for. And it meant a
lot because just we're trying to win a tournament. I guess we're just all
excited because we played so good tonight and I thought everybody stepped up
and played well.  
Q. Angela, take us through that last sequence when you thought A'Quonesia
was going to try to shoot the 3 and what y'all did?  
ANGELA TISDALE: We knew A'Quonesia was going to shoot the free throw, we
switched on everything to make sure she didn't get a 3 off.  
Q. You said to us last night that you needed her to step up as a
quarterback, you said she was a sophomore. What did you say to her last night
to get her to step up? And what do you think about the performance of
Franklin?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, I told Tisdale after the game, I put my arm
around her little head and told her I loved her and she came through in the
clutch and no matter how bad things go, she's our point guard, she's my point
guard.  
ANGELA TISDALE: I think A'Quonesia is a great point guard. She's an Aggie, but
we're good friends and she's going to be a great point guard throughout her
years.  
Q. Angela, do you like to be at the free throw line at a time like that
where it can mean the game?  
ANGELA TISDALE: I don't know if I like it, but if I make it, I do. (Laughing).  
Q. With the style that they play, and I know you've seen it, is this a team
you don't want to face too many times in a year?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: There's a lot of them in this league I don't want to
face. Gary, he just creates havoc on the defensive end, and the uglier the
game, the more it is to their advantage; just the kids play so hard for him.
That's a sign of his players believing in what he's instilled in that program
the couple of years he's been there.  
To say playing against him is any different than anybody else, no, there's too
many good teams in this league. It's a different style than a lot of people in
this league.  
Q. Sophia, can you just elaborate on getting a third chance at the Sooners,
pretty excited with that chance and now you have a couple days to get ready to
a big game against them?  
SOPHIA YOUNG: There's not really much to elaborate on. We just wanted to get a
shot at them and we're finally getting that chance. I think it's going to be a
really good game and I hope a lot of fans come out to watch us because it's
going to be a great game.  
Q. Can you talk about Sophia's performances the last two nights, two of her
better performances in her career, and how she's peaking right now and kind of
carrying the team?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, that's what All-Americans do. When the game is
on the line, she wants the ball, she makes big shots, she makes defensive
stops for you. She's a leader out there. I can't think of other adjectives I
can use to describe her. I've used every adjective I know. She'll go down in
the history of Baylor as a two-time Kodak All-American because I anticipate
she'll make that this year.  
She means so much to our school, our community, our program, central Texas.
Sure, she's a great player. But if you ever get to know Sophia, you love her
just as much because she's a great person.  
Q. Coming into a game like, this do you feel you do have an advantage
because of your free-throw shooting?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, we're actually shooting the ball pretty well
from the line. If you'd asked me that about four months ago, three months ago,
I'd have said, no, I don't want it to come down to the free throw line.  
But we have players that since Conference has started, especially Abiola and
Sophia, they are shooting around 70 percent. Tisdale from last year, she's at
a much higher percentage from the foul line. You don't want to ever be that
close, but she was the one you wanted the ball in her hands, and I had Jordan
Davis in there who missed very few shots throughout her career at Baylor. So I
think we had the right people in the game and made sure those people touched
the ball.  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about your defensive performance, you held
them to 30 percent shooting.  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, we mixed our defensive schemes, played a lot of
zone and -- did I use that word, zone? Isn't that what I played in the Final
Four last year? You do what you have to do; that's respect.  
They are very good off the dribble. We felt like if we could mix their
defenses, it might be to our advantage. I thought doing that was to our
advantage, and they also mixed defenses. It was one of those games where
probably both coaches did a lot of things that are uncharacteristic of their
philosophy.  
Q. Coming out of that time-out with about 12 seconds left, what were the
assignments on the defensive play there, that last play?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, let me take you back, was it 17 seconds she made
the two free throws? I called a time-out, we had two team fouls to give before
they shot a bonus and I wanted us to get as close to 10 as I could, and then I
wanted whoever was guarding the ball to foul. We did it a little bit sooner
than I wanted, I think we did it at 12. And then they threw it in and we made
sure we switched on everything with the understanding that the worst they
could do was tie it on a 3. Just switch on everything, make sure you contest
everything, you don't foul.  
Now, I thought about fouling again, and then I just, as coaches do, you make
split-second decisions and I thought if I foul at that point, then the next
foul would put them in the bonus. So we just made a very good, aggressive
defensive stop right there.  
Q. Oklahoma had a pretty easy game tonight but had a tough game yesterday,
and you've had two tough games, but now it's 1 and 2. Can you talk about what
a showcase this will be for the Conference on Saturday night?  
COACH MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I hope it will be a showcase. I hope that both teams
play well. I hope that the fans are entertained and I hope that the television
audience is entertained. You've got what you had during the regular season.
You had the No. 1 and the No. 2 teams facing off in the championship of the
tournament.  
You have two teams regardless of the outcome of the game, they are probably
going to get either 2 or 3 seeds in the NCAA Tournament. I think when the game
is over, regardless of who wins it, we're both going to go, wheww, because
when you get to the NCAA Tournament, teams don't tend to know you as well as
we know each other in the league.  
Q. With both your games with Oklahoma going down to the wire, how important
is experience going to be for you guys?  
Jordan: Well, they have experienced players, too, so I'm not sure that I
understand your question. I just think it's going to come down to players
making plays.  
They are not going to change a whole lot. We are not going to change a whole
lot. You have two very, very good basketball teams that have great players,
and I said this before, when you go to the NCAA Tournament, which we both
will, you'd better have a great player on your team, and both teams have that.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Erin Higgins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13855)

### [Courtney Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13851)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
Q. You guys have talked all year about how they have to choose one, whether
they cover Courtney, cover you guys or whatever, is this the best you guys
have played in terms of everything being on at the same time in the first
half?  
ERIN HIGGINS: I would say so. I think the main thing was, is we went inside
early, Courtney and Leah both were doing a really good job of getting
offensive rebounds.  
Q. Talk about how important it was that you were able to rest your starters
a lot?  
COACH COALE: I think it's really important. I'm really proud of that second
group we had coming in there, they played hard, they made big plays, big
shorts. Ashley played really, really well and gave us a big spark when we had
a couple of turnovers. It's good to rest her legs. We have a day tomorrow
where we can kind of collect ourselves and get back to focusing on us for a
day.  
Q. Erin, you've been here four years, what is tonight, especially the first
half, rank in terms of how well you guys played?  
ERIN HIGGINS: I think it's pretty high up there. I can remember kind of the
same scenario two years ago when we were here against Kansas State, just
everything was going for us, everything was going well for us, we were having
so much fun. Like Courtney says, it's a bubble. It just doesn't seem like
anything could waver us one way or the other. It was so much fun, and I
thought about it when I was on the bench; it's just like Kansas State two
years ago, and look what happened.  
Q. Coach and Erin if you could both answer, did this feel like a Big 12
semifinal tonight?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, because we were in Reunion Arena and the crowd is full of
-- the fans are from a variety of schools. You look up and the Baylor people
were lingering in and the Tech folks were lingering in, and it's the hoopla
that surrounds it all. You're playing here with all of the banners above. It's
not necessarily so much about what happened in those 40 minutes as there is
just a special spirit that surrounds this event.  
ERIN HIGGINS: I agree with that. I think that our fans were really, really
great. They really got us going once we hit some big shots and they got into
it. I think this is one of the biggest crowds we've had down here Reunion
Arena and they were unbelievable.  
Q. Courtney, you could have gone as long as you needed tonight, but was it
sort of good for you, 17 minutes; in Iowa State game yesterday was pretty
taxing, was it a good thing to have a little bit more time to rest and then
have tomorrow to rest?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think whenever you can rest your legs, it's great and that
was good for everybody. I had a lot of fun just watching and seeing Beky and
Ashley and Krista and those guys go at it. It was a good break and
entertaining.  
Q. As far as if you can just talk about what Leah meant to you guys tonight
and what she's meant as a teammate all year for you.  
ERIN HIGGINS: I think Leah has been the epitome of the most selfless teammate
you can have. She goes from being one of our leader scorers last year to
giving up some points because she's guarding the best players and blocking out
the tough people. She's completely selfless. She cares more about the score
board and how we're doing as a team, and I think that she's grown in that
sense from last year to this year. She's completely invaluable. You can't
replace her.  
Q. Oklahoma wins the rebounding by a wide margin and you get ten rebounds
yourself, but talk about the role that plays for this team, because very
seldom this year has Oklahoma lost a rebounding battle.  
ASHLEY PARIS: Coach talked about before the game that if we in the game get
more rebounds than the other team, we're most likely going to win, and that's
the case. I got a lot of rebounds tonight, and it's just my teammates making
it easy for us.  
Q. How much of an impact has this been to you the first year to be a part of
a tradition of playing for Oklahoma, because this is a dream come true, how
does this feel, and talk about the performance of your guards.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I don't know, like when I was being recruited, coach coal talked
to me about all of the things that could happen here. The coolest part is
coming and look at us now, like it's happening and her vision was true and I'm
just happy to be a part of it.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think the same thing. I mean, even before coming here, it
was just looking at what they already had and their relationship off the court
and just Coach Coale's confidence and their swagger. You know that you're
going to be special here and us with them -- doing what we're doing right now,
so it's just pretty exciting to see it all happening.  
COACH COALE: I probably think if there has been a surprise or if there's been
a development in our team from what maybe people thought at the outset, to
where we are now, it's been the play of those point guards, the development of
Britney Brown and Kendra Moore. You could just sense Britney's confidence, her
attack mentality. She's really sort of known, quote, unquote, as a defender,
but you saw her get to the rim repeatedly. She's taken great care of the
basketball. And Kendra comes in and continues what Britney starts.  
So having both of those guys playing in a tandem has really been the reason in
my opinion. Some nights we shoot it really well and some nights Courtney gets
36 and some nights Britney and Kendra just right the ship and that's the
reason we're able to go 18-0 so far.  
Q. Courtney, is the way you guys played tonight, is that what we can expect
you to play the rest of March and next season?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Well, I certainly hope so. I mean, I think we're able it do a
lot of special things if we're able to play like that. That's fun and that's
what basketball -- that's when basketball gets perfect, when everything is
going well and you're having fun and you're staying together and everybody is
a part of it.  
Q. We talk a few weeks ago about if you go 16-0, what about an NCAA seed,
and I'm just wondering if you think that kind of performance gives everybody
something to think about if you maybe should be in the running for a 1 seed?  
COACH COALE: Certainly, I think it makes for some interesting conversation
around that selection table on Monday. I think we have to follow that with
similar performance on Saturday, but if we do, absolutely, particularly when
viewed in light of what has happened around the country in various Conference
tournaments: Rutgers going down and LSU going down and Stanford going down.
And it's happened -- I don't know of a league off the top of my head, I guess
Ohio State squeaked by Purdue in the championship game. And maybe if we can
take care of business on Saturday with some sort of exclamation point,
certainly creates at least a cause for a conversation about it.  
Q. Could you address the luxury of being able to rest your starters so
much?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think, also, I just spoke about the guard play and one of
the reasons we were able to come out unscathed in Conference play. I answered
one of the questions last night about Courtney, you know, is she going to be
worn out -- well, we were able to play her, 24, 25, 26 minutes on a number of
occasions in Big 12 play. And she has young legs, she's 18. When she's a
senior, this conversation might be just a little bit different. But right now,
when you were 18, couldn't you do just about anything?  
So we get a chance to rest her, she plays -- and trust me, she's already given
me grief about 17 minutes, "What's up with that Coach, 17 minutes? Ashley has
played more minutes than me." I already heard that.  
So, yeah, it's nice to have. Both she and Britney particularly, because their
tasks last night or yesterday afternoon were so large, both of those guys,
they just went at them and went at them. Britney had to guard Medders all
night and Courtney we were throwing the ball to her and they were making her
score offensively. Yeah, it's go to have them on the bench and get those other
guys minutes, too. We're going to need them down the strep.  
I don't think it matters who we see. I don't think it's about who we play, I
think it's about how we play.  
Q. He stole my thunder with his follow-up question. You look down the list
of wins and the only one with an OT next to it is Baylor, a really good game a
couple of weeks ago. If it is Baylor, does that just seem like the way it's
been setting up all season long that you would meet in the championship
game?  
COACH COALE: I don't know. I think that Baylor is clearly -- and you guys gave
me all kinds of grief for saying this during Big 12 play, but clearly they are
the second-best team in the league, they finished in second place and they
separated themselves, is my point, from the guys that were behind them.  
I think what Sophia Young does for that team and the sense of urgency that
she's playing within her final season, a valiant opponent, and they still
carry that National Championship banner around, it's theirs until somebody
else takes it in April. We'll play whoever it is.  
Q. In the name of looking ahead, is this what we can expect you to be like
next season?  
COACH COALE: Well, I hope not, I hope it's better. When you get a year older
and a year wiser and better condition and understand things intently at a
different level, I hope it's getting better and better. If it's not, I'm not
doing my job.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH STEIN: I thought Oklahoma, obviously they were hitting on all cylinders
early, and I think that's a lot of credit to them. I think they are an
outstanding team. I think that they showed why they won the Conference.  
But I'm very proud of our team. I think that we fought back, things were to
the going real well for us, we were missing a lot of open shots, but I thought
our kids came out the second half and gave everything they could and really
worked hard. We'll be okay. I mean, obviously, sometimes you have one of these
days where things are not going your way and that was today for us.  
But this team has accomplished a lot. I don't think that we should forget
that, and you know, I think the main thing for us is to get ready for the NCAA
Tournament.  
Q. Does this leave a bitter taste in your mouth, how much does it take away
from everything else you guys did and how hard you worked to really improve
from last season?  
LaTOYA BOND: I think we're upset. I mean, we wanted to win and, you know,
we've still got the NCAAs and we've got to keep our head up and focus on that.  
TIFFANY BROOKS: It's not going to take anything away. I think we've worked too
hard this year. We're not just going to lay down. We'll take this as something
to learn from and we're going to regroup and continue.  
Q. Is it still disappointing?  
TIFFANY BROOKS: I would say a little bit. We worked hard out there. We never
gave up, we fought back, we left it out on the court. I think we came back out
the second half and we worked hard, played hard and tried to come back.  
Q. What goes through your mind after such a brutal first half like that?  
TIFFANY BROOKS: Just wish we could have it over again and start all over. We
got off to a bad start, and like I said yesterday, we're usually doing that. I
mean, we've just got to learn from it. Like I say, they got off to a great
start and, I mean, we didn't and we were not, you know, hitting. You know, at
halftime we just came in and tried to regroup and get, you know, to run the
offense and play better defense.  
Q. Tiffany, can you talk about Oklahoma's offense, they played six-of-nine
3-pointers in the first half, when they do that and have Courtney Paris on the
court, can you talk about how difficult it is to try to stop them?  
TIFFANY BROOKS: It's very difficult. Courtney Paris is a great post player.
The only way you can try to contain her is to double-team and when you double-
team, you leave people that are open on the perimeter. That's just a gamble
that you have to take. Tonight they were knocking them down.  
Q. At the beginning of the game, when they are playing like that, did you
guys feel at all unprepared for them to come out that strong and that on
fire?  
LaTOYA BOND: We know what a great team Oklahoma is. I think they came out ask
they ran the ball. I think we just were not prepared for that, we were not
getting back and we were not matching up. But they didn't surprise us. We knew
Oklahoma was a great team.  
Q. LaToya, can you talk about your troubles offensively, you didn't get many
shots off, was that something you guys were doing or is it something their
defense was doing or what was doing going on there?  
LaTOYA BOND: Oklahoma has great defense. They play a 3-2 zone and we just
weren't moving on offense. We became very stagnant and just didn't get any
open looks.  
Q. It seemed like you kind of came out shooting and really attacking the
basket, did you feel like there was more responsibility on your shoulders to
take those shots?  
TIFFANY BROOKS: I did a little bit. With them playing zone a lot, there was
gaps, and so I felt like I had a great opportunity to attack the basket and
started to get easy baskets for us.  
Q. Can you talk about how good Oklahoma is now, and how good they could be
next year with everybody back?  
COACH STEIN: Well, obviously, that's not something I like to think about,
having to prepare for next year already. But they are an outstanding team. As
I told Sherri, I think they deserve a No. 1 seed. Surprised they have not
moved up in the rankings.  
I would hope the Selection Committee would really look at that and the
strength of our Conference. For them to basically be able to go through
everybody like they are, an outstanding team in the fact that we were going to
try it do some things with Courtney Paris. But at the same time, you're giving
somebody an open look and they are too great of shooters. And their spacing is
very, very good. I mean, it's not easy to get down there to trap Courtney
because of their spacing and because of their movement.  
So Sherri has done a great job of getting them to run an offense that creates
a lot of trouble for a team to trap someone on the block and to cover
everybody else, too. When you've got a Higgins on the outside that has a range
10 to 15 feet behind the 3-point, I mean, it puts a lot of pressure on your
defense. And obviously, we did not do a good job of doing the things we wanted
to do today. They took that game plan and threw it right out the window that
first five minutes. But that's a credit to how good they are.  
Q. You worked so hard this year and tried to rebuild the program from last
year, and you came such a long way, how much does this loss hurt after that
and all of the work you guys put in?  
COACH STEIN: Well, I would tell you that we don't like losing, obviously, and
this team has taken losing very hard. But they have also looked at themselves
internally just to see what we have to do. They are reflective of the things
we've got to do and they have usually responded.  
No one thought how we played today would happen. We knew what they were going
to do. It wasn't anything out there on the floor that we didn't know that they
were going to try to do. It was just fact that we didn't have our A Game today
and you can't beat Oklahoma when you're not playing at full capacity. And
again, that's a credit to Oklahoma.  
Q. Going back to something you said yesterday, do you think Oklahoma came
out a little pissed off today?  
COACH STEIN: Well, believe me, that first five minutes, I definitely thought
they were a little pissed off. I was a little pissed off at Femly (ph) myself.
(Laughing).  
Q. Three time-outs in the first ten minutes of the game, you mentioned
having to scrap the game plan in the first few minutes. Why did you have to
take all of those time-outs, to throw their momentum down?  
COACH STEIN: Yeah, you know, our team, one of the things that we have to do,
we've had to make adjustments all year. Meaning, this year, psychologically to
how we prepare for everything, it's a first time for a lot of things.  
And so this is a first time we've been in the semifinals. It's a huge day for
Missouri women's basketball. Our kids, to their fault, they really want to
please. That's where they feel the pressure; it's not the pressure of winning,
it's the pressure of they want to please everybody. They really want to make a
hit on the Missouri history books and they really want to do these things.  
You know, it's a great day and I don't want to lose sight of that. But
sometimes when you want something so badly, sometimes you overreact; sometimes
you underreact; sometimes you freeze. But once our team goes through a
situation like this, we have always responded ten times better. We'll be able
to handle it so much better the next time. I think that's what I know about
our team, and then we'll continue to focus on that.  
Q. Carla was saying she thought the most important thing was tone in
practice the next few days and not letting this linger over. Are your kids the
type that they can make that happen, or do you sort of have to get their
spirits up?  
COACH STEIN: We don't have any real natural leaders on our team. That is
something that we've had to teach probably a little bit more. But I think that
what I've seen in our team, especially prior to coming into this tournament,
was the fact that we've had a lot of kids trying to step up and do all of the
right things.  
Like I said, we don't have natural leaders, we don't have a lot of vocal
leaders. They all just kind of want to prove it in their own way. Tiffany
brooks is a great example of that. She knew what she wanted to do, she was
trying to do it has hard as she could, and that was her way of stepping up.
You're not going to see Tiffany any clapping hands and running all over the
place and high-fiving people, either. At the same time, we have to build off
that kind of energy. We're getting there, and that's us being in a position
now of being able to do those things.  
Q. Yesterday you guys felt really confident about the NCAAs, after this
loss, do you still feel confident about the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH STEIN: Absolutely, absolutely. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.
You know, like I said, and this is what's frustrating about being a coach and
having to hear questions like that. It's like, you know, do you guys not
realize how good Oklahoma is? I don't think it says anything about how bad we
are; I think it's telling you how good Oklahoma is.  
As I think you heard them say, that's probably the best first half they played
all year. You know what, if it takes that to beat it, so be it. I'd rather
have fun have to play like that. If they came out and didn't play well and we
were losing by that much, I'd be extremely disappointed. That's going to
happen in sport. You know, our kids are not going to hang around crying about
it. We're going to respond in a very positive way to this.  
Q. In that same light, do you see either of the teams tomorrow having a
chance Saturday to beat Oklahoma?  
COACH STEIN: You know what, I think both of them have an opportunity. And the
reason is because I think that like Baylor, for instance, those kids have been
through the Fire. They kind of know the expectations. That's something we were
still learning on how to perform in a semifinal and get there. Baylor has been
in that experience before.  
Now, A&M, I don't know, they have a lot young kids but I think Gary Blair is
one of the best coaches in the country and he's done a great job this year. I
tell you, it's going to be very tough to beat Oklahoma, but I think that those
two teams are pretty good and if they are playing well, they have got an
opportunity.  
Q. The 2002 OU team with Stacey Dales, Rosalind Ross, do you think this
year's team, even though they are younger, might be better than that team, or
what are your thoughts?  
COACH STEIN: You know, that's tough to say. But I mean, my first impression is
absolutely, just because they are so deep. I think that those kids on that
team, a lot of their starters played a ton of minutes, you know, and really,
like say Stacey Dales, you don't want to take her off the floor. That's what I
talked about with Oklahoma. They are just so deep, they have so many kids that
come in and the intensity that they play with, every single one of them, and
the confidence they play with is incredible. I think that's a credit to
Sherri.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [A'Quonesia Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13857)

### [Takia Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16383)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH BLAIR: Folks across the nation just saw a great ballgame, a great
ballgame, a great defensive ballgame. They had one thing that we didn't have,
and that was Sophia Young. She scored 29 and the rest of their team scored 25.  
Our kids fought. A'Quonesia got into foul trouble and we had to play small
ball. I thought we did a very good job. Patrice Reado did a tremendous job for
us on the defensive end gathering the loose balls, but it's just hard to stop
some of the shots that she had. One of the keys in the ballgame, they scored
five-out-of-five on inbound plays in the first half. That's 10 points out of
their 28, and they probably scored a couple in the second half. I don't know
what it was, but they executed and we just didn't do a good job there.  
But my outside people here, they played awfully hard. Their defense was good,
just like we played them before. Their perimeter defense, perhaps we should
have thrown it inside a little bit more. But when we did throw it in, we
either scored or missed.  
But I'm just excited to be a part of this. I'm excited to be a part of a great
basketball game. And for the people that weren't here, they missed something.
The people that were home watching it on television, I know they are excited
about women's basketball, particularly at A&M and Baylor, 90 miles apart. I
think we've got the makings of a great rivalry, and a good, friendly rivalry.
That's what you need, and you have that in women's basketball between those
two schools.  
Q. Looked like you sent a message to the committee tonight on selection
about giving you a decent seed. You shut them down and they didn't make no
3-pointers tonight, and of course your performance of your players there, what
does it mean to you, Coach?  
COACH BLAIR: When losing hurts worse and winning feels good, it's still a loss
to me. But I've got pride, I've got pride that these kids, they just work so
hard. I mean, this little 5'3" energizer bunny here, she's going to be special
for us here in years to come. It means something.  
It starts over there; they defended her pretty well, but the shots she missed
in the first, most of them were promote I hope. Second half, she hit some
tough shots and got back into the flow. Her drive through the middle in the
second half, I thought that was a crucial play. We were hoping it would open
the eyes of some of our other kids, because we had to drive the ball to get to
the foul line, or hope to get to the foul line. We just didn't do it enough.  
But this means everything to me, particularly back in my hometown here. There
was a lot of people from my South Old Cliff (ph) days that were here today.
We're building a national power. We're not building a regional power, and it's
going to get done here at Aggie.  
Q. If you could talk about the physical nature of the game tonight, banging
the whole time, and also their defense, the way they changed it up, going to
zone a little bit and how that affected you guys all physically.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: We knew Baylor was a great aggression team. We wanted to
come out and kind of play up to their aggressiveness and play with them. We
didn't want to, you know, show them that we were soft. I mean, Baylor is a
great defensive team. I mean, they made us think a lot, changing up from zone
to man, zone to man, and back and forth.  
But we have to think on the fly and Coach Blair has taught us well and he did
a lot of situational things in practice to get us ready on smart defenses. So
basically his preparation helped us out with preparing for Baylor switching
defense.  
Q. A'Quonesia, can you just take us through the last play, what you saw, and
kind of how you had to react in a split second there and switch direction?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Once again, we were going for an open 3-pointer, but
Baylor's great defense, they were switching everything. Sophia ended up on me
at one point in time. But just them being tall and me being 5-3, I really
could not see over. So Coach Blair had taught me always to keep the ball in my
hands and value the basketball, and if I don't see open players, then keep the
ball in my hand. So that's what I did, and for the last, you know, three
seconds, and got off a shot.  
COACH BLAIR: I don't mean to correct you, but next year, it's A'Quonesia.
That's all right, because I'm proud of this little kid and I've got some
tongue twisters for names, but she's going to be heard of all over the
country. And it's special, A'Quo (aqua), that's like running water or
whatever, but we're running as a point guard right here. But she's special.  
Q. Can you talk about how you closed the gap, took it down to the end, do
you use this as a positive going to the NCAA Tournament, how you took it down
to the final, one play away from winning the game?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Most definitely. You know, we're in the Top-25, but
Baylor is in the Top-10. That's where we want to be. And so being able to see
them as a great offensive team leading up into the NCAAs, that's a tremendous,
tremendous motivation for us to keep playing like we're playing and get to
that next level.  
TAKIA STARKS: I think it was a really great game. Like Coach said, they
matched us up, we matched them up. It was a great game for people to watch at
home on television. Coach always tells us to take everything as a learning
experience, and we will take this game as well. Going to the NCAA, it's
positive to know that we can play with the top teams and we'll compete.  
COACH BLAIR: I brought my book to Waco for to you sign, you weren't there, but
I brought the Dave Campbell book. I went to the bookstore and bought it, it's
a very, very good book. Tell those young whippersnappers out there to buy that
book, now. So that's a legend they are just leaving right there, folks. That's
a legend. Do your history.  
Q. Kim talked about it's kind of a relief to get back into the tournament
where you're facing other teams besides the Big 12 teams. Are you just
relieved and excited to get out and show what this team can do with other
teams besides Baylor and OU?  
COACH BLAIR: You bet. I want to get hot in the tournament. We had a run in '98
at Arkansas when people overlooked us. We're different than I think any team
in the nation on the style of ball that we play. The closest team that sort of
is like us would be Rutgers because they are a very defensive-orientated team,
or Temple up in the East.  
But I like our style and this is a style that we recruit. I'm looking for
complete players, and I think we're developing those kids. I mean, most of the
time we had three freshmen and two sophomores out there on the court tonight.
And bringing kids in, it's special. I'm looking forward to the NCAA
Tournament. They can send me to Connecticut, West Lafayette, Anchorage;
Cattlegap, Egypt; it doesn't matter, okay. Just send us somewhere, and
hopefully our fans will follow.  
But it was special. Did you see all those Aggies standing up there today? That
was special, and it's going to start being a tradition here. But we're looking
forward to going to the tournament.  
I'll answer one more thing on that zone question back there. When they
switched to the zone in the first half, that changed the whole tempo of the
game. Because it was becoming a track meet and the track meet favors us, okay,
because Young cannot go down there and do her thing as much. She's still going
to do they are thing. But I thought Kim did an excellent job switching to the
zone, turning it into more of a halfcourt game. Even though we were tired, I
thought I had fresher kids coming off the bench and I thought that was a great
move on her part to switch.  
Q. Young did job on her the first nine minutes but after she was struggling,
did you do anything differently; the first eight or nine minutes, she scored
about six points in the second half?  
COACH BLAIR: I think four of those six she scored to in the second half were
ESPN highlights that we're going to see on the show tonight. The ones she
finished last night were in overtime. The one-second play in the first half,
and then she did it again in the second half. What do you do? You just get
down and bow to her and you're there to give her a graduation gift come May. I
mean, we did all we can do with her. She's just that good. And she works so
hard.  
I think what was hurting us more was when we were throwing the ball up to the
free throw line and lobbing it back that way. Anytime the ball is on the wing,
we can cover that with our help side because they were not reversing the ball
very well. But when the ball got to the top, they hit her a couple of times
and she's got tremendous hands.  
Q. Talking about your excitement for the NCAA Tournament and so forth, how
much of that is that you will get some relief of not playing any more Big 12
teams for a little while?  
COACH BLAIR: It doesn't matter. I just want to dance, baby, it's been a while.
It's been since 1993. This watch here is a 1993 NCAA watch. This is all I
wear. There's no Rolex over here, okay. And I'm going to get a '06 NCAA watch
and we're going to dance and we're going to have a good time.  
Folks, I appreciate all the coverage, everything. Y'all have been tremendous.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH PATTERSON: I thought it was just a great Big 12 tournament basketball
game. Two teams really battling possession by possession. Obviously Sophia
Young just dominated most of the basketball game in the paint, like she is
known to do, but I thought tonight she was just tremendous, her numbers across
the board are just as good as it gets.  
So once again, I think Sophia was by and large the difference-maker in this
basketball game and just great credit to the All-American and I think one of
best players in the history of Big 12 women's basketball.  
Q. The last shot with time running out, was it just too wide open?  
SHALEE LEHNING: You know, in that situation, it's kind of hard to think of
what to do, time is running down and you've got to think fast, but I just
tried to get the best shot I could I guess. You know, I think it was a good
look but it just rolled out and that's the way it went.  
Q. You had a shot there at the end of regulation, your off-balance three,
talk about that and what was going on down in the final two seconds when you
hit that shot?  
SHALEE LEHNING: I just tried to get open and my teammates do a great job of
trying to get me the ball, I just square up and see a little bit of the room I
could and tried it get a shot off and it went in.  
Q. Jessica, can you talk about how physical the game was down there in the
post for you guys?  
JESSICA McFARLAND: Well, the game was definitely very physical. I mean,
Sophia, she had 35 points and they were not easy points. We were banging as
hard as we could in there. I think we all have battle scars. It was just a
tremendous -- we put everything out there and it was just a great game for
both teams. They ended up scoring more points, that's how it goes.  
Q. Can you comment on your player that was hurt earlier? And Shalee scored a
lot last night but was only able to get a couple of points tonight?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think the difference tonight obviously was -- the first
question, she's got a headache, so she's probably, I don't want to diagnose
her, but she's got a headache. And she really did, hit her head really hard. I
know when I first went over there, she was really having a difficult time
focusing and getting attention, any kind of look in her eyes that looked
attentive, so I know she really took a big hit on the head. Hopefully, you
know, she'll be feeling better later tonight and tomorrow, but I know it was
significant.  
As far as Lehning goes, the difference tonight was Baylor decided to guard her
very tight, and I really only recall a couple of possessions when they looked
to give her that space on the perimeter, anyway. And so they defended her
significantly different than the night before.  
Q. Last night, Shalee did her thing, and tonight Kimberly really steps up
and of course Claire does her thing, can you talk about the progress of this
team in the last couple of games, especially maybe since the last time you
faced Baylor?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think our team has continued to improve and evolve. You
know, particularly this last, I would just say these last five games,
especially. I feel like individually, and collectively, they have begun to
understand a higher level of accountability, they have greater confidence in
their own roles, they have greater confidence in -- greater understanding I
think of how to complete possessions and not get overwhelmed emotionally about
the nature a game can take on, deficits and leads and losing leads and
regaining leads, which, you know, I'm always fascinated by everybody
overanalyzing that, anyway.  
It's a game, it's 40 minutes, you know. It's probably not going to be nip and
tuck. I think our team has learned how to keep it closer to nip and tuck, and
that's made us better down the stretch. It's a team of young players that are
very, very hungry and extremely competitive and very coachable and they just
keep working at it. I think it has shown itself to be true that, you know,
they are continuing become a better team every game we play.  
Tonight was another big step. We just played a Top-10 team to overtime, and I
think we are playing like a Top-20 basketball team. I think we are a team that
is more than qualified to be in the NCAA Tournament. And I know we'll have the
opportunity to play postseason either in the WNIT or the NCAA Tournament, and
we're looking forward to continuing to play and get better.  
Q. If you ended up not making the NCAA Tournament, how do you approach the
rest of the postseason with your team?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I don't know from the NCAA's point of view, if they
watched that game, I would think they would put us in without the blink of an
eye, you know, or even our last three games. I don't know that you could play
any better, short of winning a basketball game. And if we are not admitted
into the NCAA Tournament, we will be ecstatic about the opportunity to be in
the WNIT Tournament.  
I think this is a basketball team that wants to continue to play. It's an
opportunity to do just that. The WNIT is a great opportunity for a team like
ours. If we end up in the WNIT to continue to advance and develop and compete,
that's what we love to do. So we are hopeful for an NCAA Tournament bid,
certainly, but we know that when it comes to NCAA Tournament bids and
selections and seeds, anything can happen.  
Q. If the law of averages had worked out and you won one or two, would that
have made a difference getting into the NCAA?  
COACH PATTERSON: Speaking of overtime, especially as a team that's as young as
ours is, it's incredibly impressive that they have been able to press games to
that point. Relatively speaking as inexperienced and young and sometimes
shallow, you know, as we can be, in terms of depth, I think pushing the game
into overtime and being able to battle it down another five minutes is a great
thing.  
You know, certainly, I'm very proud of our basketball team for being as
competitive as they have been all year. I think there are a couple of games in
there, I think there were two overtime games. The overtime game against
Nebraska I think is one that we didn't compete nearly as well as obviously we
did against Texas and against Baylor. I would say the same for the Missouri
contest. But I think it team is very, very tough-minded from that standpoint.  
Q. Comment on Claire's game, I think she's put four pretty productive games
together for you now as a leader.  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, I think we've got great consistency from Claire the
last stretch, the last four games. I think she's been very focused going in
and you know, we've seen the intensity of effort on both the defensive and
offensive ends that gives our basketball teams a chance to be good and gives
her a chance to be her best. And I think the numbers that she's put up have
been very impressive and numbers that she's more than capable of bringing to
the table.  
She's as athletic of a perimeter player with as versatile a package as we've
seen. I think it's been a big factor in the success that we've had these last
four games to see her emerge consistent and competitive in these games.  
Q. You just went against probably the best post player in America, how much
does that help them, how much of a learning experience is that, and second,
she's has had an up did and down year, how big of a game was this in terms of
hitting big shots for you?  
COACH PATTERSON: It was a great game for details and very big. It should
really boost her confidence, her understanding of how she can impact a game. I
think we're seeing her willingness to take big, important shots, improving and
becoming a part of her arsenal. I think tonight what was interesting was we
really had offensively, we had two perimeters that contributed for us with
production, that's Dietz and Coggins. That puts even more pressure when you
don't have a third perimeter that's producing offensively after the two or
three spot, not at the point spot but the two or the three.  
I thought Dietz played with a lot of responsibility on her shoulders, too,
which was big, not only because you're being defended by the great athletes of
Baylor, but also because you're not getting that production from your
perimeters off the bench. So you know you've got to bring it, and I think
that's a maturing experience for Dietz and I thought she handled it very well
and it's great to see her willing to take the big shots down the stretch.  
Great experience, it took Marlies awhile to get on track and in a flow
offensively and defensively. The first four or five minutes were not good ones
for her, and then all of a sudden she emerged on the board. She began to stop
conceding some things and by the time the game was down the stretch, she was
just a tremendous factor on the boards ending with 11 boards and defending.
Every single pass, I thought she defended well into the post. It's just Sophia
was that good to make shots over our players. It's an amazing thing on the
back end of that, because I don't know that we could have asked her to do much
more. She had a few possessions that were a struggle for us.  
Same thing with JoAnn, this should be a great learning ground for them, two
freshmen lining up against one of the best ever in the Big 12. She took them
to school offensively in some respects, probably more so McFarland and Hamlin
than Gipson. I think Sophia made that many great plays and is that great of a
player that her elevation, she got deep a lot, but those two are -- they are
getting better and I hope that this is like an experience that they had
against Courtney Paris.  
I thought that helped prepare them for lining up against Crystal Kemp, and
hopefully this experience, once again against Sophia is going to help them
learn a little bit about being more aggressive offensively and in their own
games and also help them defensively as we go into the postseason and have to
defend any number of great posts.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Kiera Hardy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13848)

### [T.K. LaFleur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16381)

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH YORI: I heard about 20 minutes ago Coach Blair was talking about
wrapping it up, about 20 minutes ago. (Laughing).  
Very competitive game. I thought two teams really fought hard and went after
each other. I was happy with the effort that we put forth. They are extremely
athletic. Hence, the differential in the area of rebounding. Yes, we needed to
box out more, but this is a very, very athletic team that we played against
tonight. I thought our kids competed very hard. Kiera made a lot of plays,
obviously, on the offensive end and kept us in the game from that standpoint.
But we also had some other players step up, TK being one of them.  
I like what we did. I thought we competed hard, and that's what we ask from
our players every night.  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult A &M is to defend?   
KIERA HARDY: They are already difficult as it is, so you've just basically got
to try to play them the best way you can. She was feeling it tonight and I
mean, that was one of the big keys.  
Q. Can you talk about them, their defense and what makes thing so tough on
that end?  
KIERA HARDY: They are a very physical team, probably the most physical in the
league. When you play them, you have to be ready to play and know that they
are going to play their hardest and you have to bring it. So you can't whine,
you can't complain about being physical because that's what the Big 12 is
about. If you don't bring it that night, they are just going to hurt you real
bad.  
TK LaFLEUR: Well, they are physical. You just have to find a way to beat them
at their own game and be physical back. When they are ganging you up, you just
have to be strong and know what you're doing and not hesitate on anything that
you do and relieve pressure as bet you can.  
Q. Kiera, you had a tough night the first night with A &M, did you have
extra incentive tonight to show a little better this time?   
KIERA HARDY: I really have this thing backwards, all I wanted to come out and
do was play the best way I could for us to win. Regardless of scoring or
anything, I try to do what is needed of me and tonight, scoring was one of
them.  
Q. What were you willing to give up, you can't cover them all at all times,
did is that correct surprise you?  
COACH YORI: No, they are a great dribble jumpshooting team. You know, you
don't want to allow them to get all the way to the basket. Our focus was to
contain dribble penetration. They didn't get a lot of things going all the way
to the rim, but they shot the dribble jumpshot well, Starks being the main
force there.  
But then other kids shoot the dribble jumpshot well, and those are tough shots
and a lot of them were challenge shots. You know, I think we wanted to force
those shots and then we wanted to do a better job rebounding. They just got
too many opportunities on their offensive glass.  
Q. You were up at half, what were you talking about in the locker room, what
were you thinking it was going to transpire from there?  
COACH YORI: Well, we needed to continue to do the things that we were doing
and do them a little bit better. I thought we didn't handle full court --
their full-court press very well in the first half. We had not -- when you
have one day to prepare, not even a day to prepare, and you know, you don't
see that kind of pressure every night; and we talked about that and handled
that a little bit better which I thought we did.  
But obviously, you know, defensively, I thought we got a little tired in the
second half. I thought that was definitely a factor. We played a lot of kids,
a lot of minutes and you're trying to slide your feed and guard, and I thought
that was a big factor, but at halftime we felt good. We talked about
rebounding. We talked about trying to do a better job there and obviously that
didn't happen.  
Q. How do you think A &M's style of play will translate into the NCAA
Tournament, considered a physical tournament?   
COACH YORI: Well, I think it's unusual, and so I think whoever draws them --
it's hard to simulate, and whoever draws them has to find a way to simulate
that and hopefully I think one of the things that we like to do against a team
that plays that kind of pressure is play against some guys. You know, we don't
have guys to play with in our shoot around today, but I think that will be a
difficult task to simulate for a team.  
I do think, though, the fact that they have a little time to prepare and when
you have more time to prepare against a pressure team, I think that you
naturally can handle it a little bit better.  
But, you know, I think that A&M is going to make a great run. I think they are
a quality team. I think they are different than a lot of teams you see. You
look at them and you think, you know, they are not that big, but they are a
great rebounding team, despite the fact that they are not that big.

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Lyndsey Medders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15520)

### [Brittany Wilkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13842)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
BO CARTER: Coach, we'll get your thoughts first about the game.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: First of all, on behalf of our program, I want to thank
the people of Dallas for what they did for our tournament. It's a great event.
Honored to be a part of it.  
Also want to thank the Big 12 for putting on a first class show. It's an honor
to be a part of this league, and I don't think there's any doubt that Iowa
State in the last two days did a pretty good job of representing, not only our
university, but our league.  
I said yesterday, I haven't been as proud of a team as I was yesterday. It's
not even close to how proud I am today of the effort of our kids, our fans. We
played as hard as we could play against a great team. I have always been
someone that absolutely refuses to allow our players, our team, to be
evaluated on what happens on one scoreboard, in one gym, in one building. We
won a lot of things today. We lost one ballgame today, but we won a lot of
other things. And Oklahoma is a great team. But I think we did everything we
could. They were just a little better and that's the nature of this
tournament.  
But I couldn't be more proud of the effort of our team.  
BO CARTER: Thanks, Coach. And we'll take questions for the Iowa State players
by raising your hand.  
Q. Bill, would you just talk about your strategy against Courtney Paris.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I'm going to say right off the bat that I know people
will critique, especially Brittany and Lisa Bildeaux, because they had the job
of guarding Courtney Paris. And that was my decision. It wasn't their fault.
Oklahoma is too good spreading the court. We decided to take, try and take
away as many 3-point shots as we could. Try and make it tough on her, if we
could. At our place we doubled her. We did a great job. Held her to 15 points.
They light us up for 13 threes, that is the way we decided to play it. And
she's a great player. She's as good a player as I've ever seen, coached
against, and that was a decision, basically, shoot until her arm got hurt and
hope the rest of them miss.  
For most of it, we were okay. At least we were in the game. But we couldn't,
with our personnel I didn't think there was another way to guard her and like
I said, every one is going to see 36 and say, oh my God. And like I said, I
take full responsibility for that 36. Because they did exactly what I told
them to do and how to guard her.  
Q. Brittany, talk about your game today, the shots. It seemed to keep
falling inside. Talk about what it was like for you today, your game and how
the shots just couldn't go down for you.  
BRITTANY WILKINS: I think you got to just approach any game, whether you're
playing Courtney Paris or any other post player, that you got to rise to the
challenge and obviously she wanted to stay in the game as well, and you got to
just make strong moves around her. And I was able to do that tonight and my
post play or my the rest of my team helped me just get the ball. And, yeah,
like I said, I mean, taking off what Coach said, I think the game plan was
great and we did what the Coach wanted us to do and put ourselves in a
position to play, give ourselves a chance to win the game. I'm just proud to
be a part of this program and, yeah, I mean I credit my teammates for getting
me the ball and helping me out that way.  
Q. Brittany, can you talk a little bit about, Courtney said that she felt
she was wearing down towards the end of the game because she just had to work
so hard to score early. Did you sense her wearing down and did you kind of
take it to her at that point thinking that, I can get something out of this?  
BRITTANY WILKINS: Yeah, she even said that herself in the paper, like one
thing for her is just playing all 94 feet and wearing her down that way. And I
think that is one thing that we did notice. We were able to get the ball
inside and score a little more. She was getting a little more tired there, but
we just had to keep plugging away and hope that he we could get some shots on
the inside and keep guarding her as hard as we could.  
Q. Lyndsey, was there a thought when you came back and took the lead late
that you had them at that point or did you know it was going to be tough
still?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: No, you know, we're they're the No. 8 team in the country. So
they're not going to give up. They have a lot to play for just as much as we
do. Our game plan worked perfectly until Higgins hit that three. We were going
to let her score, we just didn't want her to get that three off. Higgins got
that three off and that put us in a hole. I think we went down two at that
point.  
So our game plan, I thought it was a great idea by the coaches, by Coach
Fennelly and when Higgins hit that three though, that was kind of just, it hit
us in the heart, because it was everything we didn't want to happen at that
point. But they're the No. 8 team in the country for a reason. So we knew they
weren't going to give up on it.  
Q. That three-pointer, it was really big. It was from way out, too. When you
saw her let it go, did you think that was out of her range or anything?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: She's probably one of the best three-point shooters from
there. Once she got it off, it was a good chance it would go in. She's a great
shooter, a great player. That was probably the shot that put us under.  
Q. When you put that late run together, was there ever a sense of being down
before that run and then things just started falling for you? The late game
run that you guys came back, ended up taking the lead. Before that, you know,
it kind of seemed, it appeared like they were pulling away. Was there any
sense of frustration before that run?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: Not really. We been down the last six games that we have been
down or every time we won in the last six games or something like that, we
have won the game, so I think we were down 11 with seven or eight minutes left
to play. People hit big shots, we were able to get stops on defense, get some
good transition looks. So this team, they don't give up. I think that's
because we follow the lead of Brittany; she won't let us give up. She gets
offensive rebounds. When you got a teammate like this, who fights as hard as
she does every possession, she battles and battles, and we were just kind of
following her lead. She didn't give up and neither did we. It's kind of been
the story all year.  
BO CARTER: Ladies, I want to wish you guys good luck in the post season. We'll
keep Coach for a few more minutes. Thanks for joining us. Good season.  
Questions for Coach? Raise your hand, please.  
Q. Bill, along those same lines with the post-season you said at the
beginning of the year to get in the post-season is the main goal. For this
team to play in the NIT, is this going to be good for this team with everybody
but Brittany coming back?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I hope we get picked. I hope we get to play. We're 17-12.
I think we have had a pretty good run. I think we showed the kind of team we
can be. Especially in this tournament. I think this team would like to keep
playing. I think they leave here disappointed, but at the same time with some
renewed enthusiasm actually. I don't think this team's ready to quit. It would
be nice to go for our younger kids to get some extra practice, extra games, it
would be nice for Brittany and Kandice to play again, so, no, we would be
honored to play again and hopefully -- I don't get to pick the teams, but if
they're interested, we would love to play.  
Q. The past few weeks now you've been saying how important it is just to
finish strong. That's the type of team you wanted to see. Is that what you saw
these past couple of games?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: No question. I never had a team finish this strong ever.
This team, playing six players and banged up, and what we went through
yesterday and what we had to go through today and being on the road both games
and just, that wasn't about basketball, folks, that was about some young
people that have great pride in themselves and their program and their school.
That wasn't coaching, that was something inside of them that I don't know
where they got it from, but for two days in a row and they have done that
lately, they just kept plugging away and battling to the very end of the game.
And that's what I told them. I said, if they can take this with them for the
rest of their life they're going to be pretty smart people and pretty
successful people. And they're hurting right now and that's a good thing.  
You ought to be disappointed when you stick your heart and soul into something
and it doesn't work out. But like I said, at the very beginning, I am very
proud what they have done and very proud of how they finished this portion of
their season.  
Q. You're down three with 10 seconds to go, something like that. Looked like
you were going inside for a basket and free throw, is this it?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: We were trying to go for a quick two or in and right back
out. Because they were trying to collapse. We wanted to get the three. They
were switching everything, so we were trying to go quickly to the basket, take
the two and a foul or if Brittany caught it, pivoted, try and kick it for the
three and hopefully go inside out instead of outside in because they were
switching on the perimeter, and we knew we would have a tough time getting
that off.  
We noticed when they played Texas Tech we watched film and Tech was down three
and they literally put five people on the three-point line and switched
everything. So we thought maybe we could get an and-one and score quickly or
get the kick. We had a good look at it, it just didn't go and that's
basketball.  
Q. You said that you doubled Courtney in Ames, and then you come back single
coverage today. Talk about the frustration of guarding her for the next three
years in this conference as an opposing coach.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: You had to remind me. I only have to play her once
though. The person that will whine the most is Gary Blair when he gets up
here. He'll whine all the time. "I got to guard her for six more times?" I'm
sorry.  
And I have started a petition that the WNBA can draft kids early.  
(Laughter.) There's no way to guard her. There isn't. If there is, I don't
know anyone that's found it. But the way we guarded her tonight is the way
this team had to guard her to have a chance to win the game. And you need her
to miss a few times. The only way to guard her is when she's sitting next to
Sherri, that's the only way to guard her and unfortunately we couldn't get
that done either.  
So she didn't miss enough. She's a phenomenal player, an amazingly composed
freshman. Very talented. And to Oklahoma's credit, they have allowed her to be
the star of the team. They have allowed her to be the focal point and they
figured out that's how to win. They have a lot of juniors that have maybe
stepped to the back, Erin Higgins, Chelsi Welch who I had in Korea, Leah Rush,
I've always been a fan of hers. Those kids have decided, to their credit and
Coach's credit, to allow someone else to be the focal point of their team.  
But the bottom line is they're the Big 12 champion and it's a great lesson for
you all of us to learn. We can all be successful but it doesn't have to be
just me. And surround yourself with great people. Courtney Paris is a great
player and she's impacted the league already and will impact the game for a
long time.  
BO CARTER: Coach, we wish you well.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Again, thank you every one. Appreciate your time,
appreciate all you do for our sport. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [LaToya Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14298)

### [Alesha Robertson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13852)

### [Marsha Sharp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13845)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_BO CARTER: We'll have Coach Sharp deliver an opening statement for us and
then we'll ask questions of the players for just a few minutes._  
_Coach, your thoughts about the game._  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: First of all, congratulations to Missouri. I think it was
an important basketball game for both of us and they really played well. I
thought they played really consistently. They made some plays at a lot of
different positions against us. Their guards were big and powerful. They
curled off of some things that we had difficulty trying to defend because of
their size and strength and athleticism. And I think that it's one of the
reasons why they won so many basketball games this year. And we really
struggled to try to maintain some consistency there.  
Obviously we got in foul trouble and took some of our weapons away from us for
probably way too long for us to have a chance to stay in the game.  
But I'm proud of our team. I thought they really fought for a long time today
and we had some people that played a lot of minutes in the game and at the end
they were still trying to make sure that they tried to put them on the free
throw line, play well as far as trying to follow the game plan and make some
big shots to try to keep it close and keep us in range.  
I can't fault anything that happened with our kids. They have been warriors
and have tried to fight through some things and keep themselves alive for a
while, and hopefully the committee will reward that and they will get to play
another day. But regardless of that I was really proud of their effort and I
thought that Missouri probably deserved to win because they were able to make
more plays consistently on their side of it.  
_BO CARTER: Thank you, Coach. And we have Alesha Robertson and LaToya Davis
with us. Please raise your hands for questions._  
Q. For both players, you guys go up by 10 early in the game and they come
back and just keep the lead the rest of the way. What was the difference after
that run that you guys had early on?  
LATOYA DAVIS: I think the difference was that they went on the run after that
and we couldn't really answer, and like Coach said, they made plays
consistently and we didn't.  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: I think that when we started out with that run at the
beginning our adrenaline was really high and they hit a few shots and came
back a little bit and we -- every time we got on a run, they got on a run.
They just kept coming back at us and it caught up with us.  
Q. Alesha, there is some kind of erratic, unexpected officiating calls. Was
that hard for you to guys to maintain consistency throughout all that? Did
that affect you at all?  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: Well, as a player, you just got to learn how to cope with
those officials and just learn how they're going to call the game and then
once you do know, you just got to play. You just got to play like they're
going to call it. So if they're not going to call anything, you might as well
foul.  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: I like that, "coping." That's good. That's good.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Did you guys kind of feel is sloppy at times or was it something that the
Missouri defense was doing?  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: Well, sometimes we didn't really, we weren't really, it was
hard to play together there for a little bit. Just because their defense was
really well prepared. And I just think that our execution just got out of hand
there for a little bit. But I think we got back into it.  
LATOYA DAVIS: I don't think it was really sloppy. I think that just when we
had open looks we couldn't really finish our shots or go get the rebound. So I
don't think it was sloppy, we just couldn't hit anything.  
Q. How much not having Erin Myrick out there affected what you were doing
out there?  
LATOYA DAVIS: Well, Erin Myrick did play a big role for us, and we lost
Chesley Dabbs early in the season, and we just had to learn how to step up in
those places and that's just what you got to do when you lose a player like
that, is just step up and try to fill in that spot. And I think that we did a
really good job of that today.  
She's a big enforcer inside but when you lose her, you lose the power but then
you gain height with Patrice. So I think she did a great job filling the role.
It was a terrible blow that we lost her, but I think that Patrice stepped you
know and did a really good job.  
Q. LaToya, do you think you guys should a tournament team?  
LATOYA DAVIS: I think so because we have a whole bunch of heart. We never give
up. And I think we played hard enough to show the committee that we are a
pretty good team.  
So I think we should get in. But that's their choice.  
Q. Along those lines though, are you going to be sweating it out for the
next few days until Monday?  
LATOYA DAVIS: I just take it day by day and wait until Monday happens. Coach
says we're going to meet Monday and we'll all get together. I don't think
we'll be sweating it out but I think that we'll be anxious to see if we get in
or not.  
_BO CARTER: Ladies, we'll dismiss you, but good luck in the offseason and
we'll keep our fingers crossed in the post-season._  
_We'll take questions for Coach Sharp now. Thank you all for coming._  
Q. Can you state your case for a 17th straight NCAA bid?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Well, first of all, I think the Big 12 is a good
conference. That in itself should help us.  
I think that when you finish fifth in it and your RPI was still below 40, I
think when we started the tournament anyway. We had about the sixth or seventh
best strength of schedule in the country. When you combine our non-conference
and our conference games, and we had some pretty significant wins, I guess
when you look at it now against Baylor and A & M and Louisville, and played
Oklahoma very well, I think, both times we played them, hopefully those will
be good things that will help us.  
Obviously we had some, a few losses that we needed to not have, probably in
their eyes. So we'll see. But I think it probably depends on some other
conference races and how they finish, and if there are any upsets along the
way and some different categories like that. But I think that hopefully we
have shown them enough that we could be in. I think that obviously our non-
conference schedule should be the part they look at. They talk to you all the
time about they will reward you for playing a good non-conference schedule,
and we'll see if it was good enough to help us this time.  
Q. Were you surprised at all about how well Missouri shot and how much they
were able to score?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: I thought they shot better today than they played, than
they shot in the last several games they played. But not better than they shot
during the year. I think they probably have regained a little bit of focus. I
don't think there was any question they knew what was on the line today for
them, and they really answered that bell. They played very well and shot it
very well. Early on in conference play, they shot it consistently like that.
Maybe the last couple of weeks they have struggled a little bit more from the
field, but not today. I thought they shot it very well.  
Q. What's life been like for you since your announcement?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Well, it's been fairly hectic. There have been a lot of
things that I wanted to -- a lot of people I wanted to talk about a lot of
things I wanted to take care of and a lot of e-mails and notes and cards and
calls and things like that, which have been incredible. They have been
amazing. And people that I will always appreciate for their thoughts during
this time. And it's been a really important time.  
Obviously I've been trying to be focused on what we were being about as a team
and some days that was easier to do than others. But I think that's both
gratifying in a way, obviously there are moments when you think about things
that you won't ever probably do again and that's a little bit difficult. But
the most important thing to me still has been to try to coach this team and to
try to get them where we wanted to be, and those were the distractions I
wanted to avoid, so that I could do a good job with them until the very end.
And that part has been hard for me to deal with a little bit.  
But our players have been outstanding. They have fought through it and they
have been focused and they really tried to make sure that they brought it
every day and gave us a good look. And our practices have been solid and they
have been good. And that I'm really grateful for that. It's helped us to
really maintain some semblance of order, I think, in the last couple weeks.  
Q. When did you know that Erin would not be able to play?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Well, she was available. We probably could have played her
a little bit. I was a little concerned about trying to do that. With as little
preparation as she had had for this particular team, I felt like that because
of their size that maybe we were going to be in a situation where Patrice
could be effective and Patrice has a very little longer arms than Erin anyway,
and we thought defensively we might be as good today without her. And if we
had a chance to win today, I wanted to be positive that she was available
tomorrow, because she does do a good job against Courtney, and we felt like
that would be important. So we were trying to pick and choose a little bit. I
think if we're able to play in the NCAA tournament, she will be available.  
Q. First of all, her injury is a sprained knee, is that what they diagnosed
it as?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: I think that's right. Yes.  
Q. And do they give you any kind of idea -- basically it's a day-to-day
thing or how long is it looking?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: I think. So I think she will be available if we, if we
want to play her, if we get an opportunity to play in the tournament.  
Q. And as far as that goes, I asked the players, how about, are you going to
be sweating it out for the next few days?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Obviously we would like to be in a little bit better
position. You would like to know that you're in, be a lock to be in. That's
been something that we haven't been that concerned about. We have always been
thinking about seeds. The last 15 years or so. So it is a little bit different
scenario for me to deal with than I dealt with in a long time but, yeah, I'll
be a little nervous and anxious for a few days here.  
_BO CARTER: Coach, congratulations. We'll be keeping our fingers crossed for
Monday. Thanks._  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Britney Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15521)

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Courtney Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13851)

### [Chelsi Welch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15522)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_BO CARTER: We'll have Coach Coale give us a briefing opening statement and
then our players are coming right behind. Coach, congratulations._  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Thank you, Bo, I appreciate that. They are coming, but I
lost them in the hallway.  
Give Iowa State a ton of credit. I thought they were just fantastic, and I
thought they played with a great sense of urgency. Made plays when they had to
make them. We got up 10 they could have just said, oh, they won the league.
They went 16-0, we're done. But they didn't. They kept fighting.  
We were fortunate, and we were fortunate we did some things down the stretch I
think that good teams do. Blocked out, got a very big rebound, executed a set
to get Erin the three. Good screens, good spot, good pass. And then Erin had
to make that shot. And that's not an easy shot to make. Even if you are a
great three-point shooter.  
So once again I think it's our poise, composure, our confidence together that
enabled us to win this one. Hats off to Iowa State. Bill just does an
incredible job.  
_BO CARTER: Thanks Coach. First we'll address questions to the players. Raise
your hand and we'll bring a microphone to you, please. Thank you. Questions
for the players._  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about their defensive game plan against you. You
wanted to get it inside early. Saw a lot of single coverage early it looked
like. Is that what you thought kind of helped get you rolling and get the team
rolling today?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think whenever we -- teams give us single coverage,
obviously it's a lot easier for me to score inside. One thing about that is,
and somewhere two minutes left in the second half, I was worn out. So I mean,
I thought that was a pretty good strategy. And down the end it was harder for
me to finish. So I got to work on that.  
Q. Any of you can talk about this. When you're the favorite, the underdog
keeps hanging around and hanging around, you're down two, three, five. How
much does that start playing in your head at all, knowing that you guys are
the No. 1 seed here?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Well, we knew they were going to come out and give us our best
effort. They played well yesterday and we knew they were going to fight for
the entire game today. And they did a good job. I'm just proud of our team for
just coming back and making runs and making plays when we needed them.  
Q. Chelsi, you guys had the 10-point lead, they scored on seven consecutive
possessions, after even up to that point they just would not go away. Was
frustration setting in at all? Did you ever like just say, this isn't our
night, or anything like that?  
CHELSI WELCH: No, I don't think that ever went through our head. They came
back. Every ran we gave them they answered back. And that says a lot for their
team and what they have for the future.  
But at the same time we did the same thing. And ended up doing it for the
longer period of time and came out with the win. So that's a credit to our
team.  
Q. Brittany and Chelsi, can you both comment, Courtney's 36 points are the
most ever in the tournament. Can you just talk about how she played today and
then what you thought of her performance.  
CHELSI WELCH: Court knee was huge. Every time she got the ball I knew that she
was going to go up and score, get fouled, and every time we just tried to get
her the ball every time we could because if they're going to single coverage
Courtney, we know that she's going to be able to go inside and score.  
BRITNEY BROWN: I started not even rebounding, and that's a bad thing. So.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: These girls are way too honest sometimes.  
Q. Sherri, can you talk about Courtney and coming into this tournament and
the pressure there is and how she handled that as far as it being such a young
player and being a freshman and coming in here and doing what she did today.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Well, the only time, to be quite honest, that I felt like
Courtney was a freshman this year was the first week or two of practice. She
just has never, when the lights are on and everybody's looking, ever looked
like a freshman. I thought before we went to Ohio State there's all this
national build-up of supposedly the best center in the country, Jessica
Davenport against the freshman phenom from Oklahoma. Every paper is talking
about it, ESPN is talking about it. I'm thinking what is she going to do. And
she was unbelievable. She was the best player on the floor that game. I don't
think anybody would argue that.  
So there's never really been a situation in which she's looked like a
freshman. So I had no reason to think that she would today. She really didn't.
Except she kept apologizing to me when she came out and I'm not really sure
why. I'm like, "You almost got 40," yeah, okay. You tell me I'm sorry too
much.  
Q. Sherri, was there ever a time in a tournament like this where you were
pretty sure you're in the NCAA tournament anyway, is there any way you would
have a letdown against a team like this?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Well, I hope we're in that tournament. You know, I
understand your question and where you're coming from, and I've had national
media ask several times in the last week, how do you feel about a conference
tournament? And you don't stand to gain anything. Look what happens to
records. Look what happened to LSU, etcetera, etcetera. And I don't look at it
as anything except post-season conference tournament. At the end of this week
they're going to hand a trophy, and anytime they're going to hand a trophy,
we're going to go fight like crazy to make sure they hand it to us. That's all
it is.  
Q. Courtney, why were you apologizing to Coach?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think I wasn't making lay-ups, you know. I forgot. I say
sorry all the time, and the girls hate it. When I mess up, I say sorry. That's
how I feel about things.  
Q. At what point did you realize that it looked like they were going to very
rarely double you and that you were going to get the ball every time down
court?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think right at the beginning of the game, and normally I try
to put myself in situations where I can get open easily and have a quick
score. But when they single cover, I just took my time and backed down and was
able to feel like kind of bully my players into making an easier lay-up. So I
would have to be a lot more patient and that's what I like to do.  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about the match-up with Brittany Wilkins a
little bit and what that was like. Stuff like that.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Well, she is, she didn't, I don't think she guarded me until
the end there or anything. But, I don't know, at the end of the game she was
tougher. And it was tough guarding her and I'm glad I was able to come up with
that stop at the end. She's a tough player. As well as all the other Iowa
State girls. And they played us hard today.  
Q. Sherri, could you talk about Erin's last shot. I think you called that
play, right?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: We did. It's a play that we run all year long to get her
open, make defenses choose between Courtney and the three-point shooter. And
they did a good job because they switched screens and they were so far out on
the 3-point line that Higgins was pretty deep. I'll have to go back and look
at the film to see exactly how deep she was. But if she crosses half court,
that's kind of her range. We're not too worried about it, and I was standing
right behind her and I told her afterwards, we were at K State a few weeks ago
and she shot one that landed, like, four feet right of the rim, and I was
standing right behind her and I thought, I think she's aiming at the
McDonald's sign up there, because it's not even close.  
Standing right behind her tonight, as soon as it left her hand I knew where it
was going. It was dead in the middle of the basket. I just felt like we were
going to Courtney and everybody knew we were going to Courtney, and, yeah,
probably there's not much you can do about it sometimes even when you do know
that. But she was getting beat up and they were maybe going to foul and let's
just get Higgins a wide open three, and that's why we're 16-0 in the
conference, because it's not just about Courtney.  
And I know you look at the stat sheet and you go, oh, Courtney Paris has 36
and there's only one other player in double figures. No, ask Bill, he'll tell
you, that's what, why do you think he guarded us like he did. Because Erin can
score, Britney can score, Leah can score and those guys continually all year
long when their number has been called they have showed up. Whoever it was;
Brittany down the stretch, whoever. Tonight it was Erin.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Not a bit. I was wishing I called it earlier in the middle
of the 10-2 run they made. I was wishing I had called it. I felt like the same
thing was happening. It was just a cluster down on the block, so much
attention there and it was real physical, and if we could get something out on
the perimeter, and I should have called it earlier, and maybe it wouldn't have
come to that.  
Q. Sherri, Iowa State's always been a good tournament team. Is this one of
those teams that you don't necessarily want to face in a tournament like
this?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Absolutely. I would have never told these guys that, but
when I saw that potential, I just think Iowa State is two things: No. 1,
they're offensively so explosive. That no matter what your lead is, you're
never safe. They can come back from a 15-point deficit in no amount of time.  
The other thing about it is Bill Fennelly is really, really good. And he's
going to do something different than what everybody else has done and he's
going to break our rhythm or make us change things. I felt like they had a lot
of energy coming in. I think with Lyndsey healthy they're just as dangerous as
anybody in this league.  
So, yeah, it wasn't my choice for sure.  
Q. Courtney, again, on the subject of Brittany Wilkins, she had 28, you had
36, did you, as the game sort of went down to the end, have any sort of
feeling that it was you and her sort of battling it out and then you blocked
her shot at the very end, and I think that of all the things you did tonight
it pleased you the most, and could you talk about that blocked shot and the
tie-up.  
COURTNEY PARIS: She's a great player. No doubt. I remember from the first game
seeing her, she's a big girl who can shoot threes, drive, post. And I was
like, oh my God, Leah, you guard her. But, no, she's great.  
The coaches have been giving me trouble about being a defensive player I guess
and I've been like, my whole big thing is I'm not that good at defense. So in
practice that's what they're all, "Courtney, three steps, three steps." So I'm
like you guys, the other coaches think I'm a great defender.  
So I was happy to get that stop and come over to the bench and tell her, I
told you so.  
SHERRI COALE: Yeah, right. That's exactly what she didn't say.  
_BO CARTER: Ladies, thank you. We'll keep going with Coach now. If you'll
raise your hand._  
Q. I asked the players about this, but one of the things that I talked to
Coach Fennelly about this yesterday is one of the things you do as an underdog
is just try to stay in the game and hang around to the end and cause
frustration. Were you worried about that when you look up at the board and
it's getting late?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I can't say I ever worried about it. We have been in a
bunch of close games this year and our guys have gained a great deal of poise
from being in those situations before. I just have almost sometimes maybe too
much faith in these guys, in that I don't want to call a time-out and I think
they can fix it through their judgment and their decision making down the
stretch, and just even though I think it was 2:34 when I looked at the clock
and I thought okay, they're going to be in it until the buzzer blows. That's
just the way it is. Because up to now you keep thinking, here goes our 8- or
10-point run, and then it's over. 2:34 I looked up there and said, it's going
to go to the wire. But I like our odds when it does. We have been there too
many times.  
Q. Courtney talked about being, getting tired there in the last 10 minutes
and obviously she never seems to look it, but as you guys look toward the
tournament and it is more physical and you know teams are going to be keying
on her more, do you worry about her wearing down in that game after game where
you're playing so quickly back to back?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I really don't and I'll tell you why: Courtney is an
exceptional athlete. We have had an opportunity because the people around her
are so skilled, and so basketball savvy that we haven't had to play her 35
minutes a game all year.  
Now at this point last year when I have Dionnah Jackson out there and she's
played 39.6 minutes a game, every single game, she's going to get worn down.
The thing about Courtney is, she's not been beaten up all year because we have
played her, I don't know, what did she play? 28 minutes, something like that a
game. We had an opportunity to rest her. Not wear her out on a daily basis.
And she has an extraordinary recovery time.  
She may be tired right now, she will be fine tomorrow. She takes care of her
body and I'll promise you the people that try to wear her out get tired, more
tired than she did.  
So she usually wins that head-to-head battle. And she's just a competitor to
an extraordinary degree. How do you explain she goes to the line and makes
free throws when the game is on the line all the time. I don't imagine that
she's going to allow any sort of fatigue, and do I think for at least a high
percentage of the time, fatigue is so much mental you can overcome so much of
that. Particularly you're talking about what? Three weeks. Three weeks? In
what? Six games after this tournament? So, yeah, she, her mind will beat the
matter.  
_BO CARTER: Coach, congratulations. See you tomorrow._  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_BO CARTER: Coach, first, congratulations and we'll have you deliver your
opening thoughts and then we'll ask questions of the players and then dismiss
them. But thanks for joining us._  
COACH CINDY STEIN: Thank you. I just am extremely proud of this team. My voice
is a little gone from yelling.  
I was just very proud of them. They fought through a lot of things. And I felt
like our four days of practice prior to coming here were extremely sharp. They
were very focused, and I think they proved that today. Texas Tech is a very
good team. We did not want to be the team to beat Texas Tech because of Marsha
Sharp. But at the same time we wanted to make sure that we did our thing and
we couldn't focus on that.  
But Marsha Sharp is an outstanding coach. And we think the world of her. So
this was a very tough, emotional game, because of our respect for her, but we
really wanted to make sure that we made our presence known. The last two games
we kind of wanted to redeem ourselves with this game and I think our kids did
a great job of doing that.  
_BO CARTER: Thanks, Coach Stein. And we'll take questions for the players
now._  
Q. Tiffany, will you talk about their inside game and they had a lot of open
lay-ups that they missed and you guys were making it hard on them inside.  
TIFFANY BROOKS: They're very tough inside. They have great post players. We
knew it was going to be a hard game for us defensively to guard them. We just
tried to keep them, keep ourselves in between the basket, and I think they
still did a great job though.  
Q. LaToya, you guys got off to a little bit of a rough start there and I
think maybe down by as much as 10. Can you talk about how you regrouped,
especially like when Christelle went out, you guys sorts of regrouped and came
back and took control of the game.  
LATOYA BOND: Well, we have been down at the start and in a couple of games
during the season. We were off and on getting off to a slow start. But we knew
that we didn't play yesterday, they played yesterday, they were kind of warmed
up and we just had to come out there and warm up, get our offense going and
just had to kick it in gear.  
Q. LaToya can you talk about playing against Erin Grant and what it was like
to go up against her, and did that kind of get you going seeing her play?  
LATOYA BOND: Not really. Erin Grant, she's a great player, point guard,
everything. And I knew that when the shot clock was getting down that she was
going to look to take it to the basket, and I was going to keep her in front
and pressure her. She's a great passer, so I just tried to play her straight
up though.  
Q. Both LaToya and Tiffany, can you address the situation where LaToya, when
it was crunch time, you took the lead, started to drive, but Tiffany, you
didn't let her do it by herself. Can you talk about that and how tough was
that .  
TIFFANY BROOKS: LaToya is a great penetrator and you just got to get out of
her way because she's amazing. Just a great point guard, great leader. But
this is her senior year and I wanted to help her as much as I can. So when she
penetrates it opens a lot of things up for us because they collapse and we try
to sit out on the perimeter and do what we can to help her.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
TIFFANY BROOKS: I just needed to step up. Last couple of games I haven't been
doing what I needed to do and I felt like I needed to step up in this game.  
Q. LaToya, same question.  
LATOYA BOND: About me or? I think the past couple of games Tiffany has really
been stepping up, and that's really what we need. We're going to need
everybody, not including, not just the five people out there on the floor but
everybody from the bench, and I just think Tiffany's been stepping it up the
last couple of games and that's really helping us out a lot.  
Q. Coach, what did y'all talk about in that time-out with about 13 and a
half minutes left after Tech had pulled within two of y'all?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: We just tried to keep everything very simple. We weren't
doing some things defensively, obviously, we knew they were trying to get to
Davis so, we were looking to trap her. And make them have to kick it out and
go to somebody else, because that was kind of their first option. And then
offensively, you know, we weren't setting very good screens. We were going too
fast to do what we needed to do. We needed to have more patience. We tried to
keep it simple. There's not a lot of magic to it. I would like to say that I
gave them such inspiration, but I know better.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the team's offense output today. They shot
really well, played real well.  
COACH CINDY STEIN: Well, I feel like it's a carry-over from practice. I felt
like we been practicing really well and sharp. And our kids have been very
focused. And we have tried to get a lot of shots in, obviously. And that's
something that when we get five kids scoring double figures, that's always
good. And that's our offensive set.  
We know, LaToya and Christelle are going to get a lot of touches and that's
evident. But like Tiffany, she had some mismatches on her, we were able to,
when Grant was guarding her, to try to get her some close-to-the-basket shots.
And things like that.  
And the kids are smart enough now where they're figuring that out on their own
on the court and obviously that helps. I also thought we had great play off
the bench. Cassie Drew coming in and doing a very nice job, obviously that
helps.  
Q. LaToya and Tiffany, if you guys could both address this. You had a really
difficult time getting much done in the paint against Oklahoma when you met in
the regular season. What do you have to do differently when you face them
tomorrow?  
LATOYA BOND: I -- I don't know.  
(Laughter.) I guess we just got to look for the post players a lot more. Move
around our offense, maybe hit a couple of outside shots and maybe that will
open it up on the inside.  
TIFFANY BROOKS: I think the key for us is going to be good defense. The Paris
twins are great post players, very difficult to stop. I think we just got to
play good defense, keep her in front and offensively, you know, just run our
plays and set good screens and things will open up that way.  
Q. LaToya, let me put it this way: With Courtney Paris in the middle, how
much room is there left for you to drive?  
LATOYA BOND: I don't know, I mean like Coach Stein says, I mean, I get a lot
of touches and when I drive to the basket, every one collapses. So I may not
get all the way to the basket, but at least I'm going to be looking for my
teammates to kick it out and hopefully hit some open shots.  
Q. Coach, do you think that Texas Tech is worthy of an NCAA bid?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: Absolutely. I think they're very deserving. They had one of
the toughest non-conference schedules to play. And this league is very tough.
And honestly, I think that they should be looking at at least sixth in our
league with a RPI of three; it's an incredible league. And I think that we
would be doing a disservice if they didn't take six, at least.  
_BO CARTER: We'll take a final question for the players._  
Q. LaToya and Tiffany also, what's it been like the last week and a half or
so with all the turmoil at Missouri and your coach told me yesterday that
actually there's a lot of pressure in people coming up and patting you on the
back and saying, keep it up, you're what Missouri has going at the moment. Can
you address that?  
LATOYA BOND: Well, me personally, I don't really feel any pressure. I just
want to go out there and play hard and work hard and win. People have been
coming up to us. I mean, this team, we have broken a lot of records, done a
lot of things other teams in the past haven't done. And we're just not going
to stop after breaking one record or anything. We're going to keep working and
continue in our success.  
TIFFANY BROOKS: Like LaToya said, I think it's good pressure. I think it will
motivate us. Push us hard to go harder in practice and just work harder.  
_BO CARTER: Ladies, thanks, we'll keep Coach Stein for just a few more minutes
but good luck tomorrow night._  
_Questions for Coach Stein. Thank you._  
Q. I guess you guys think you probably made your case for the tournament as
well.  
COACH CINDY STEIN: I don't see how we couldn't be. You know, I said this
before, I don't get wrapped up into what everybody else is saying, I feel like
if you take care of things, they're going to all work out. I don't feel like I
got to boast or pump up everything that we have been doing. I feel like that
should already be happening. I think that the Big 12 conference is a great
conference. And we got an excellent reputation. Unfortunately we have got a
lot of commentators on TV that are from the SEC and we got to get maybe Stacey
Dales-Shuman working a little bit more for us.  
But honestly, I don't know how we couldn't be in. But at the same time, we
don't have that invite yet, so we're trying to get the automatic.  
Q. You didn't come into the tournament on a -- you lost two games at the end
of the regular season. Were you concerned at all about your team's mindset
coming into this?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: I was concerned because I felt like our last three weeks
and I told our team this, I felt like I was trying to pull juice out of
concrete. Because we didn't have any energy. And that was a concern of mine
from that aspect. But I felt like the last 10 games you look at, we were 6-4
in the last 10 games and we were still, in this conference it's tough. So it
wasn't like we were playing a lot of slappies. We were playing some really
good teams.  
So we have, you know, I feel like I didn't worry about what we had to do here,
it was just, as I told our team today, we won every tournament we have been in
this year and that's our focus. That's why you come to Dallas. That's why you
play, everyone's trying to win the tournament. And you let everything that
happens along the way, you got to have it be accountable and you got to accept
whatever happens. And we're just going to keep fighting.  
Q. Seeing Iowa State stay with Oklahoma, does that give you help?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: I think it just pissed Oklahoma off, I'm not sure. I'm not
sure that's good or bad. But you know, I don't know.  
We haven't really thought about Oklahoma, to be honest. We're just trying to
focus on Texas Tech and I told my staff we'll really concentrate on Oklahoma
when we have that opportunity and that's why our kids don't know what to say
to that because we haven't, we have been totally focused on the game at hand.
Oklahoma is a great team. They're a great team. So we're going to show up, you
know.  
Q. Could you talk about that. You guys did get off to that slow start and
then Christelle picked up her second foul. But then it seemed like EeTisha
especially really took a lot of responsibility for defense, and just talk
about what she did for you.  
COACH CINDY STEIN: Oh, Tish was unbelievable, I mean she just, and Tisha in
many ways is our emotional leader anyway. She really gets us fired up and
going. She did an incredible job defensively and offensively. And she's been
doing a great job for us, in fact, we're playing her out of position. She
probably should be inside. But she is such a great defensive player, and we
want her to cover up some of the best guards in the country.  
So she's been doing everything she can for us to win and she really picked it
up today.  
Q. Did you think that Texas Tech might play with a little bit more emotion
because of Coach Sharp? Did you feel like they were kind of less emotional
than you thought they would be?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: I wouldn't say that. I know that, I think, they might have
felt a little pressure to win for her. I know that those kids love Coach
Sharp. And I know that they really wanted to win. I'm sure they're
disappointed. But I wouldn't say that, you know, it wasn't an easy game to
win, so I don't think they gave up. So that's an incredible team out there.  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about Courtney Paris. She had 36 and 16
today down low. Is there any way to stop her? Have you guys have even thought
about a game plan for her?  
COACH CINDY STEIN: What number is she again?  
(Laughter.)  
Q. No. 3. Big girl.  
COACH CINDY STEIN: You know, Courtney Paris is a great player. Everyone's
tried everything against Oklahoma and we'll do the same thing. We'll try
whatever we can. Obviously the main thing is run the floor. Get back. You got
to do whatever you can to keep her away from the basket. She gets close to the
basket, you're dead.  
But Oklahoma is not just Courtney Paris. And that's why Oklahoma is so good. I
tell them Courtney Paris has double, Ashley. And then every kid on that team
has a double to them. You got Britney Brown and Moore. And they're all got
doubles. They're ten deep, at least. So that's why Oklahoma is so good. So
it's just not Courtney Paris but we'll do whatever we can on all of them.  
_BO CARTER: Coach, congratulations again._  
COACH CINDY STEIN: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Morenike Atunrase](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13854)

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH BLAIR: We put them to sleep across the country on that one, didn't we?
I've seen all the other media room, all the others were full, even the writers
went home, they were bored to death. If you all want something with TK, she
had to get ice down. She had cramps the last couple of minutes, so that's why
we had to take her out, as hot has it was.  
But give credit to Nebraska. Hardy came out on fire and most of the time we
had our best defensive players on her. We had Starks on her early and we had
E-Roy on her. And basically in the second half, Mo hit her a few times, a
little bit taller, had to shoot over her a little bit more, and we slowed her
down a little. By them not having at driven full strength to play her normal
30 or 35 that made a huge difference in the game because they had to keep
rotating people. But give Nebraska credit, that girls has been playing with
mono the last four or five games, hard time in and out, and the other kids
have stepped in and done a good job.  
Folks, you saw three very, very good basketball games tonight. You saw two
teams play hard tonight in the last game. Neither one of us played well. We
make no apologies. But at the same time, I'm happy to move forward, get this
one out of the way. Hopefully we can play a little bit more poised,
particularly on the offensive end. They were doing a good job of taking away
our driving names. We had them 19-8, I think, something like that, and then Mo
drew a second foul which was a careless foul and she knows that I felt like I
could hold her out to the half. As ugly as the game was going, she probably
would have picked up her third foul, and I put in TK and she picked up her
third.  
We'll just go and enjoy the game. I'm sure y'all have a lot of questions about
my offense that didn't work too good. I think you've got a lot of questions,
my point guard didn't have a good night, but she hit the free throws down the
stretch. She's been there all year for me. That's the most turnovers she's had
all year. But don't worry, she'll play a lot better tomorrow night.  
Q. Can you talk about what you thought the offensive problems were, it
seemed your team was struggling, can you talk about the struggles and what you
thought the problem was tonight?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Well, TK and myself got in foul trouble pretty early. That
put two shooters on the bench, so we had to look on the bench for other
shooters. But the guards that we had in really kind of stretched our offense
well. Erica had some nice 15-foot jumpshots, Danielle Gant can also shoot the
15-foot jumpshot, but they were mostly playing a second-off man on us. We were
also rushing our shots on offense. We just didn't penetrate their defense as
well as we usually do.  
COACH BLAIR: These are the most mind-boggling stats I've of seen. We shot 44
percent, 43 percent from the 3 and 70 percent from the line. It sure didn't
feel like it. I think because of the 19 turnovers.  
Give Danielle Gant a lot of credit. I know she had a lot of rebounds at the
half, and that kid just knows how to play. She knows how to play. That's how
good this league is with all of the freshmen in the league. This kid didn't
make any all-freshman teams, but by gosh, she made my first team, and that's
the one that counts. There's so many good freshmen in the league, you can't
have a ten-man freshman team, about this gets pretty special and it's going to
get better and better.  
Q. Why do you think that Danielle is such a good rebounder, what is it that
allows her, especially with her size, she's not particularly big, but she has
amazing numbers?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I don't think it was anything she learned while she was
here at A&M. She's a great fundamental player all-around. She knows the game
well. She just looks for it, she always presses the boards. Even in the
summer, we knew she was going to be a great rebounder. Like I said, I think
it's just her fundamentals.  
Q. Is it a sense of relief getting by the first round, you're guaranteed to
play more than one game up here? And all three games the favorites really
struggled at times, are you glad to put this game behind you and get a win up
here in the Big 12 tournament?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Well, yeah, we're going to watch film and correct our
mistakes and come out and just come out here ready to play the next game and
take it game by game.  
Q. How tough was it to play teams that are fighting for their lives, the
lower seeds? They know they have got to put everything on the floor, and
you're in a position now being the hunted.  
COACH BLAIR: I think you saw that in four games today. Four games today, the
team that played yesterday, was fresher, their offense was working better, and
the four teams that played on their first day today like us and Baylor and
Oklahoma, we all struggled. That just comes with the territory. But I think we
all rebounded, we found a way to get back in it. I think all four of us, there
wasn't any upsets today. We almost all struggled and we almost all lost.  
But, hey, it was hard. Before each ballgame, I put that little plus on my hand
at the scorer's table. Everybody thinks it's a cross. That's a plus. That's
for me to try to stay positive during the game. I needed a couple more
positives all over my body in that ballgame because I was getting frustrated,
our kids were getting frustrated. I didn't do a good job of coaching, getting
us under control today, and I think that had a lot to do with the chaotic
play.  
I could see how we were struggling on offense, so I tried to get the tempo
faster and uglier, faster and uglier, thinking we could get a couple of layups
off of it which we did. But at the same time, I did a poor job of coaching. I
think we did a good job of preparation and I did a poor job of coaching being
able to get into the continuity set. And when I do a poor job of coaching, my
point guard usually follows right behind me and she usually struggles.  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, can you talk about playing Baylor for a third
time this year?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I'm not going to think about that until after midnight. It's
just about midnight. I'm not looking forward to that.  
You know, I've been seeing 3s ever since I got here, I see Courtney Paris with
a 3. I saw Hardy wearing a 23. Now I've got a 33 tomorrow. I'd love to see a
43; that means we got by Baylor. But it seems like anybody that's got a 3 on
their number is a big-time player.  
Sophia Young, that last shot she made in overtime, was one of the most
incredible shots I've ever seen. The kid has so much energy and so much pride
on how she plays the game. That's what separates, that's what makes her a
Kodak All-American. That's why she'll be drafted in the Top 3 players in the
country. She's just special. But she has fun. She plays with a smile on her
face, and that's something that more of us need to do, coaches and players:
Play to enjoy the game.  
And I'm not looking forward to playing Baylor, but, I'm very happy to play
Baylor, because how we played tonight, I thought we were going to be getting
ready for another game at another venue. But we're here. We haven't won since
1998 here. We're going to enjoy it, we're going to get better, we're going to
rest. But for once, I need that rest to play the 8:30 ballgame.  
Q. What did you see that made you decide to start Gant for tonight?  
COACH BLAIR: Just flip of a coin, mainly because of the boards. I figured we
would struggle early offensively and she could get me some put backs. I
figured she might be able to give me some transition baskets because she can
go coast-to-coast with it. And all it was was a hunch. I might go back
tomorrow and put in Reado because that might be a better matchup there. But
another unheralded kid that I thought did a good job today was Micheaux. She
was throwing her body around and the refs all day were letting all of the
teams play. That fits our style very well. I thought Micheaux did some things.  
But remember, the key in the second half was when TK went off. When TK went
off and hit all of the big shots in a row, she started feeling it. That's the
TK that was playing the early part of Conference play, and that's how she
looked. This has really been her best game since then. I think it's probably
the first time she shot over 50 percent in quite a while, but she hit some
tough shots.  
Q. You said it's an ugly game, but you all shot 56 percent in the second
half, what did you see that you did like in that half?  
COACH BLAIR: When you're playing that fast, you're taking the other team out
of the flow of their offense, okay. That's what we do defensively, whether
we're pressing or playing halfcourt defense, we're not letting you play pretty
ball, okay. So we force people to do things that we do not want to.  
We could have made it a lot easier on ourselves. Just think how many
transition baskets we screwed up, okay. Almost three out of four in
transition, we screwed them up. Did I answer that question right? Probably
not. Do you want to try it again?  
Q. Your defense obviously is feeling what your offense is trying to do, and
did you see that, how you would like it to be in the second half?  
COACH BLAIR: I liked our defense early. Really with hearty hitting those shots
that she hit, some of it was just hearty. Sometimes you have to pat the kid on
the back and say, hey, that's No. 23. She did a great job. She has a great
step back move. She played I thought very average I thought the night before.  
I thought the key to the game was really we also slowed down Howell a little
and if Howell had played as well as she played the night before, we would have
had a whole lot of trouble. Even though she scored a couple early ones on us,
I think we wore her down a little. You wear Hardy down in the second half by
the pressure that we put on.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Jasmina Ilic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13849)

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

### [Jackie McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16379)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I just have to say how proud I am of these girls. You
know, we just spent quite a bit of time in the locker room just talking about
the progression of this season, and just how far we've come. I don't think
that the record reflects the heart, the desire and the improvement of this
particular young group of young women.  
And I think it starts with Whitney Law, our senior. Obviously she's got a lot
of heart, she's got a lot of energy. The two players I thought really stepped
up tonight, Jackie McFarlund and Jasmina Ilic did everything they can to carry
this team. We don't have great depth. Foul trouble, if any game this year was
a concern, this was the night. Nebraska is easily the deepest team in the
conference, and we just could not put ourselves in a situation where we were
coming up with three or four players with foul trouble. We just were not very
effective on the defensive end, particular in the post when Jackie or Jasmina
has got to play within foul trouble.  
Q. They had an 11-point lead and you guys came back and tied the game, and
actually took a lead, rather, did you feel at that point that you really had
something going, and what changed the momentum right there? What made it kind
of get away from you?  
JASMINA ILIC: We always get ourselves in those situations to fall behind and
then try to catch up. I think we did a very good job today executing and
getting stops on defenses and then scoring. We came down and once again we got
the score even and then we lost the lead. But I think that we learned how to
play and how to come back and keep fighting and stay together all the time.  
JACKIE McFARLUND: At that point whenever we took the lead, you know, I
definitely thought we had the momentum. It was our turn to make a run. I
thought we had taken our best shot. I think they came down and hit a three on
that next play and that kind of hurt us, but we were still in it that whole
time. I think towards the end, it really was just that depth issue that really
came into play.  
Q. With the way the first half ended, can you talk about how that took away
some of the momentum from you?  
JACKIE McFARLUND: I definitely think, you know, it was a very poor ending to
that first half. They didn't take it from us; I think we gave it to them, and
I think it was more just us knowing that it was stupid decisions, stupid
plays, and we had a letdown, we can get that right back. We can keep ourselves
from doing that. It's not like they were beating us; we gave that to them.  
Q. Did you feel like you got double-teamed more than you were accustomed to,
and did that frustrate you?  
JACKIE McFARLUND: I don't think I got double-teamed any more than I'm used to.
I think I had more trouble telling where the double-team was coming from.  
Q. When you did take the lead, you were scoreless for almost the rest of the
game, was it tough to get the right shot that you wanted or needed?  
JASMINA ILIC: I don't think so. I think within the offense, we got everything
we wanted. It was just a matter of time of executing the plays and getting
those put backs. Then we startled fumbling the ball, we didn't put it in
people's hands. The play was run very good and we got the open shots, however
either the pass was kind of a little bit off or somebody flipped a ball. But I
think we executed our offense very good and we found open players in the paint
from the double-team, as Jackie said.  
JACKIE McFARLUND: I thought we had some good looks and open shots, and a few
turnovers in that session, too, and they were unforced turnovers, really.  
Q. How do you feel about the promise for next year?  
JASMINA ILIC: Well, I think everybody has had a great learning experience this
year. From the beginning, we had a lot of ups and downs, but I think in each
game everybody grew a lot, and we start like -- everybody was getting
accustomed to a new style of play to each other, what everybody got to do. And
I think you saw in this game everything we can do great, and so many things we
can do even better.  
So I think the whole team is looking forward to next year. We're going to work
hard in the summer getting ready for next year and I think it's going to be a
very, very good year for all of us.  
JACKIE McFARLUND: I am excited because we are going to have 16 players, and
that is going to make a tremendous difference just in practice and workouts
alone. Just with numbers, the more people you have, the more you're going to
push yourself, the more they are going to push you. You cannot take a day off
when there's other players waiting to step up into your position. It's going
to make the whole team better, competition-wise, it's going to be great.  
Q. Do you think the depth was really a huge factor, and after you did take
the lead and they were able to outscore you 14-5 or something like that down
the stretch?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think depth has been an issue for us all year.
However, when it got down to that particular possession where we were up one
with the ball, I thought we had the ball in the wrong players hands. And I
thought we made a poor decision on the shot selection.  
And to me, at that point, you know, I needed somebody to step up, get the
ball, take control and make the most of that opportunity. And we didn't do
that. We left the ball in Caley's hands and it was almost like a prayer. It
was almost like, I'm going to get this shot off; where when Caley is at her
best is when she's setting screens and moving and making things happen. I just
thought that particular possession, we made probably the poorest decision of
the night on what to execute and how to finish that.  
Depth has always been an issue. But to get back to your original question, I
think we just made poor decisions down the stretch. Whether it was fatigue,
whether it was inexperience, whether it was who had the ball in their hands, I
can't really answer that. I think it was different almost every possession.
But we made poor decisions down the stretch.  
Q. Can you talk about Caley's intensity on rebounding really helped you get
back in the game?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I do. I think it's really hard to keep Caley off the
floor. I take a look at her progression versus Hannah's progression. Hannah
went into it due to injury. She was thrown into it; she's been up and down.
Caley has probably been the most steady of all of the players because of the
way she has progressed in her control. If I were to sit down and talk
basketball to any of my players, Caley is one of the smartest basketball, as
far as basketball knowledge, she gets it, she understands it, she reads it,
she studies it. I thought she did make some key plays. I think she knew time,
I think she knew tempo, but I think there were some freshman mistakes.  
Q. Can you talk about what was the most challenging part of the season for
and you also what was the most rewarding?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think the season was more challenging than I
anticipated. I would readily admit that, and to my teammates -- to my coaches
and my team. I think about the Big 12, I think about the competitive nature, I
think about the recruiting, I think about the whole picture.  
The most challenging was game by game, learning the players, their
temperaments, their abilities, their deficiencies and how to get them to play.
The one thing that I didn't have to -- really wasn't challenged with was
finding roles and working people in. I didn't really have any options. So that
was the easy part. I knew this is the hand I was dealt, this is my team and
this is where we're going.  
The most rewarding was the improvement from day one. They have always given me
everything they have had. They have always given -- they have got heart, they
have got energy, they have got desire, I love them. But, there are times where
we went here and up and down.  
I would love to go back and I know I've told you this several times, I would
love to go back and play our non-conference schedule. Again, knowing how much
farther they have come game by game and it's the result of playing in the Big
12; it's a result of playing Texas to a four- or six-point game; it's a result
of playing Missouri; it's a result of getting beat at Baylor. This team has
learned a great deal, and I know they are walking out of that locker room and
getting on that bus feeling proud, and this record just doesn't reflect the
things that they have learned.  
I did enforce to them in the locker room that, you know, this summer is so
key. And it starts in the weight room, it starts with our speed, strength and
conditioning coach to get our bodies to the point where we are strong and we
can absorb the physical nature of the Big 12, and they have got to recommit
themselves now.  
Q. Can you talk about how Jasmina and in this game has competed?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Jasmina had a great game against Nebraska the first
time, she had 36. It's just a good matchup for them. Their 3 player they put
on her is typically more of a 4. She has the ability, they are afraid to come
out on her, because they know she has got the ability to go by them. They
sometimes leave her open to get her shot. I think she has confidence playing
against Nebraska. I think Jasmina has had some wonderful games, and some games
where we really needed her a lot more than she's been able to perform.  
I would say this is one of her best all-around games, northern Colorado was
one. If you were going to look at the Big 12, I would say she's had the most
success against Nebraska. I think she understands that we need more of a
complete game from her, not just scoring, and we're better when she's giving
us her complete game.

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH YORI: Well, you know the old saying in March is survive in advance, and
obviously that's what we did. And it wasn't the prettiest of games, but we
found a way to get it done. At this time of the year, it doesn't really matter
how you get it done. You just need to get it done.  
And Colorado played really well, they played really hard, they played with a
lot of emotion, a lot of energy. They came here with the intention of winning.
It's interesting, we played a lot better lately than we played tonight but I
thought Colorado played us hard. I thought we got good bench contributions
particularly out of Danielle Page and TK LaFleur. Even though we didn't win
the battle of the boards, we competed in that area, which is always important
for us, and we won the battle of turnovers, which is something that we would
have expected in this game.  
Q. Talk about taking a while to get a handle on the game to finally getting
the lead, how frustrating was that and what did you do to get over the hump in
the second half?  
KIERA HARDY: I think any time you play a team three times, you come out not as
fired up, and they came out ready, ready to play us today. They knew that they
didn't want to go home. It took us awhile to get into the game, and once we
got settled down and got used to the environment, I thought we played together
and did what we had to do to win the game.  
DANIELLE PAGE: I thought coming into a new court, I thought we had to get used
to it, get used to the rims. And it's postseason play and everyone steps it up
a notch. It took us two or three minutes to step it up a notch like every
other team does. I definitely thought we did it later in the game and I think
it showed.  
LaTOYA HOWELL: Like Kiera said, I think they came out really ready to play.
It's hard to beat a team three times. Ilic, they hit some tough shots and put
them on our back a little bit, we had to pay more attention to her and so
other people were able to open up and get some pretty good shots.  
I think we were able to find our rhythm and make a run and it wasn't pretty,
but we were able to pull it out.  
Q. Kiera, when they took that lead with four or five minutes left what did
you feel you needed to do to regain control of the game?  
KIERA HARDY: Just stay poised. All year long, we've been either down or up by
one or in those type of situations so, basically just stay calm and I thought
we did that. We executed better towards the end when it counted.  
Q. Can you talk about what you were trying to do to McFarlund and frustrate
her with double teams?  
COACH YORI: Well, we didn't double her much the first two times we played
them, but individually I thought we did a good job on her in both games. We
felt like, you know, after looking at the film and identifying their
strengths, we felt like it was -- and I think, you know, we just felt like
Jackie is really a competitor, and I felt like she was going to try to have a
big game and I think she is that kind of kid. So we made the decision to
double-team her, and we did cause a little frustration there.  
But in doing so, that also means that we are in rotation a lot and you end up
giving up shots. Case in point, to Jasmina Ilic, we gave up some shots out of
rotation and lost her there.  
Q. Was there one thing in particular that you were not doing well when they
got up by 11, was it getting out of rhythm or anything in particular?  
COACH YORI: Well, I didn't think we were in rhythm the entire game
offensively. Just we didn't play well on offense overall. I didn't think our
execution was very sharp. We didn't stay organized enough. We were impatient,
I thought particularly in the first half. Just we did not execute very well,
overall, throughout the game and I thought it caught up to us.  
I do think, though, you know, that Chelsea Aubry's three-point shot was a huge
shot, and they take the lead and we do a nice job executing out of a staggered
screen and got her a shot.  
Q. Your thoughts on tomorrow's matchup with A &M?   
COACH YORI: I wish they were the tired team. (Laughing). You know, they play
with enough energy as it is. They will bring a lot of energy to the basketball
court tomorrow night, and will pressure and will get up and guard and create a
lot of things obviously for their offense from their defense. The first time
we played them, we had 25 turnovers. We dug ourselves in a huge hole. We were
down 19-4 the first time we played them. You know, that was part of a coaching
decision on my part. They hit shots from the perimeter, first time we played
them, and everybody in the game, and as the game got going, I thought we were
more competitive.  
But, you know, bottom line is, they are a team that's playing with a lot of
energy and their defense is -- if you thought tonight was ugly, you know, wait
till tomorrow night. (Laughing).

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Joann Hamlin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16376)

### [Shalee Lehning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13847)

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I thought it was a really well-executed basketball game
by our team defensively. I really appreciate the intensity that we brought to
the floor, real high level of accountability on the strengths that KU brings
to the basketball floor and I thought that gave us a chance to be competitive.
Both of these two, Lehning and Hamlin, obviously really established early in
the basketball game that they were going to be factors for us offensively. I
thought that was absolutely huge. JoAnn did a great job of running the floor.
Shalee stepped up and just did a great job as always, distributing, but more
than that, I think looked for scoring opportunities when they were afforded.  
And all of that was just I think real big to us getting off to a good,
aggressive start in the basketball game, which we knew would be critical
because of the emotion that Kansas would be playing with, with Hallman and
Kemp obviously as seniors in their last Big 12 tournament, and just the fact
that this is a great rivalry game. And so I was really proud of the overall
defense first and foremost that we brought.  
Q. Shalee, would you talk about wanting to more of an offensive floor
early?  
SHALEE LEHNING: Individually?  
Q. Yeah, scoring-wise.  
SHALEE LEHNING: I just wanted to come in and contribute in any way I could.
Tonight they were tagging off on me a little bit, when I made that first shot
it gave me confidence. I just tried to take whatever I could, and they were
actually falling.  
Q. Did you feel disrespected at all early when they were letting you
shoot?  
SHALEE LEHNING: No. That was just a part of their defense. They were just, you
know, helping our post players, which shows that they were doing a great job,
but at the same time, that left me open, so I just shot it.  
Q. JoAnn, talk about the post game, the physicalness, it looked really
physical out there tonight but looked like you all kept your composure?  
JOANN HAMLIN: Yeah, it was pretty physical. All of our post players did a good
job of keeping tempo and everything. We did good job, we're both good players
and nothing dirty goes on down in the post.  
Q. Scoring has not been your forte throughout the year, in these last two
games against KU, you've come up with big points, is that something they are
doing defensively or you're just falling into your own as being a scorer right
now?  
SHALEE LEHNING: I think it's a bit of both. Like I said the opportunity was
there for me to take the shot and so I did. It's not the fact that it's KU.
Just that I'm coming into my shooting technique and a little more confidence
that I'm willing to take the shots.  
Q. Talk about what makes this group a dangerous team facing Baylor tomorrow
night.  
SHALEE LEHNING: You know, we just have a lot of players that are willing to
step up. We have a lot of depth. On any given night, you know, different
people step up and we have our inside game that's really doing a great job of
creating a big presence and that sets up for the outside. When we transition
and hit shots and stuff, we can be pretty tough.  
Q. This is your first Big 12 tournament and first postseason game and both
of you guys were on your game from the start, JoAnn, you didn't miss a shot,
four blocked shots, and career-high for you, Shalee. Can you talk about your
feeling coming in, sometimes it can be an intimidating tournament, did you
guys feel that at all or what were your emotions?  
JOANN HAMLIN: Well, actually I was really nervous before the game. But once
you get out there, you know, and the ball goes up, it's just you get into a
flow and all your nerves go away and you just put all you have out into the
court. We really wanted to put everything we had out there and we really
didn't want to go home tomorrow.  
SHALEE LEHNING: Definitely it's a remarkable feeling. This is a game we love.
There are some nerves before the game, but at the same time, we use it as
positive motivation to give us energy and enthusiasm coming in. To win our
first Big 12 tournament game is just a great boost for us.  
Q. JoAnn, you're going against one of the best post players in the history
of the Big 12 tomorrow, can you talk about what you guys try to do to slow her
down, if you can?  
JOANN HAMLIN: Sophia is a great player. That's one thing you can try to do is
just slow her down. She's going to make good shots and she's going to make
great moves. She's All-American. We just have to be active on defense and see
what we can bring tomorrow.  
Q. Can you explain Shalee erupting tonight, is that something more you
wanted from her game or something she has not shown so far this season?  
COACH PATTERSON: It's just part of the evolution of her as a point guard. As
we have wound down through this last quarter of the season, I think if you
were to watch film, you'd notice that she had become more and more willing to
think a little bit about taking the shot. And as teams began to really not
play her, you know, it just became a more significant and important element to
our offense.  
I think in the first three-quarters of this season or maybe even 3/5ths of the
season, it wasn't necessary. You know, you've got a great point guard running
a very, very young basketball team, second leading rebounder on your team, one
of the nation's leaders in rebounds and assists, actually second in the nation
in the combo there. And so there's only so much you want to bring to the
table.  
In the meantime, you are running the show and we just felt like it was part of
the evolution for her, you know, and as Shalee has demonstrated all season
long, she understands the game and as she has begun to understand the
significance of not being guarded, she's assumed a greater sense of needing to
be a scorer. It's always been more about need and not necessarily a gap or a
hole in her game. It's been part of the evolution.  
And at the same time, I think she's gotten better as a shooter just like
hopefully a lot of our younger players have. I think we've seen that with
Gipson as well, and with Zanotti, as well.  
All credit to Shalee Lehning; it's one more element of the incredible
basketball she brings to the floor. I've said all season long, I think she's
the best play-making point guard in the league, I just think it's part of the
total package, and we'll see more of it. I don't think we'll see a lot of
20-point-per-game nights because I don't think we need to. But I think that's
just growth and understanding a little bit more about what your basketball
team needs from you without losing the strength you already bring. Some
players could not have brought that dimension until a year from now, but
Lehning is that good.  
Q. Just want to commend you for putting four freshmen on the floor. I also
want to respond about Gipson and McIntyre, they handled the ball well and got
in some good minutes, what made you decide to put them in and give them a lot
of play in this tournament this year?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think Marlies is one of the great young athletes and
players, freshmen in our league in my opinion. We didn't do a great job of
involving her offensively tonight as much as I would have liked. I have a
great deal of confidence in her, and I think we saw just a little inkling of
what she can bring down on the block. She was not as necessarily aggressive
offensively tonight, but didn't necessarily need to be. Again, we did not give
her a lot of touches and opportunities.  
Twiggy I think has in particular over the course of the last four or five
games, she has stepped on the floor, she has been a factor offensively, she's
done a great job running pick-and-roll offense, staying aggressive with her
3-pointer. Which again, it's interesting tonight because you have Shalee
assuming a scoring role and you have Twiggy distributing more and running
offense, and their roles are reversed. Typically you are getting 12 or 15
points a night from Twiggy and tonight she didn't really look for her shot a
lot.  
I think both Marlies and Twiggy were bringing great on continuity to our
offense. They defended extremely well. I loved Marlies's activity on the board
and she is just a warrior in there, and she can go get balls like no one else
on our team. Those two did just a tremendous job for us, and it's not all
about scoring if you've got other people taking up that slack.  
Q. Talk about the adjustment preparing for Baylor now, where do you go from
here for Baylor?  
COACH PATTERSON: They are just fabulous basketball team and we understand
that. I think Sophia Young is one of the best post players obviously to have
ever played in the Big 12. I think she's one of the top five ever.  
We have our hands full. For us it's just stepping on the floor and bringing a
real high level of accountability and attention and effort and intensity to
our defense. And then on the offensive end, I'm hopeful that, you know, we can
do a good job with their pressure. They are a great defensive basketball team.
We know we're going to have to be very good, and you can't string together
wasted possessions against a team like Baylor. It's part of what separates
them is their great play-making ability. They are very balanced, so that's why
they are one of the higher seeds in this tournament. And we know it's a great
challenge, but we just appreciate the opportunity and I think again for us,
everything will start with trying to generate some intensity on the defensive
end.  
Q. Can you just talk about JoAnn, how important it was that she knocked down
all her shots and she had the four blocks, seemed like she had a very strong
game here.  
COACH PATTERSON: I thought JoAnn was huge tonight. You know, she ran the floor
extremely well, she was so active against Crystal, and I think Crystal is a
tremendous player; again, one of the best post players the Big 12 has seen. It
amazes me how every night people know they have to defend Crystal and she
leaves the floor with double digits and almost double-doubles game in and game
out, particularly in the last year and a half.  
So for JoAnn to go in and stay really active with Crystal to bang and to deny
her some touches I think was huge emotionally for her team and technically.
She ran the floor so extremely well. She was aggressive, just that player that
you hope can be a great presence.  
So for tonight, I thought that JoAnn put on the shoes very much like a Crystal
Kemp puts on for her basketball team game in and game out. JoAnn was that
player in the pivot that everybody was looking to, to kind of play off of and
play around when you needed to and she was there for us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Erica Hallman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14233)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

### [Crystal Kemp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13846)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH HENRICKSON: Certainly disappointed with our play and performance tonight
and not much different than the game at our place which was disappointing.
Seemed to allow us to shoot uncontested shots and defensively they were solid
and did a nice job. Two rookies that did a lot of scoring for us, Crystal Kemp
and Erica Hallman, besides those two right now we just don't have much
offensive firepower as those two. So you slow those two down, there's a pretty
good chance we're going to struggle, and in turn it's more magnified when we
do not create offense from our defense and allow teams to shoot layups.  
Q. Can you talk about your game tonight, and Kansas State put pressure down
low, talk about dealing with that for the second great game and did you do
anything in practice preparing for that?  
CRYSTAL KEMP: I probably didn't play as strong as I should have, especially
out of the double looking for other players. One of those things that I tried
to take off-balance shots and I could have been a lot stronger in the double
today.  
Q. Erika, it seemed like they had their way on the 3-point line, how much of
that was adjusting to the different screens?  
ERICA HALLMAN: They did a great job chasing me off-screens and switching
screens. They threw a lot of different things at me. I got a couple looks but
unfortunately I was not able to knock them down.  
Q. Can you talk about your NIT chances, w NIT, what makes the team
attractive?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think it's the team that plays an apply good, good league
and handles our games in non-Conference and a couple of games, not the last
two counting and a couple one-possession games, we've got a chance for those
to go either way. For us, it's an opportunity to play in postseason and we
just hope the committee gives us the nod and we would be thrilled with the
opportunity quite honestly.  
Q. Crystal your last chance to play K-State, what were your emotions after
falling behind early and coming back?  
CRYSTAL KEMP: It felt a little reminiscent at first, but I think if we would
have continued to try to fight and slow up some of their options and play
strong defense and do what we wanted to do on offense, we could have played a
better game. But unfortunately we just came out and played the way we did.  
Q. With the future of the season up in the air right now, how are you
feeling about playing on or not?  
ERICA HALLMAN: Well, I definitely would like to play on. We haven't made it to
the postseason since we been here so, if we get the opportunity, we just have
to make the best out of it.  
CRYSTAL KEMP: It would definitely be nice to be able to continue to play,
especially trying to leave off on a better note than we did these last two
games. That's really one of the most things I'm looking forward to.  
Q. Your emotion in the last two games, you feel like you did too much or you
tried to do too much?  
CRYSTAL KEMP: I don't think we did too much. We probably could have did more
as far as getting prepared. But there's really nothing more you can do. You
can't teach anyone to have heart and go out there and play hard, and I don't
think we did that today, at least not for 40 minutes.  
Q. What's most frustrating about losing for the second time in six days, and
like Crystal said, reminiscent of Thursday night?  
COACH HENRICKSON: It's certainly not executing a game plan and not being --
not having the focus and attention to detail that you need to play at this
level, because it's a great league and great coaches and great players.
There's not a lot of wiggle room for us and not a lot of wiggle room for a lot
of people in this league. Just you're playing teams that are good enough to
beat you, and it will be magnified and you'll end up on the wrong side of a
20-point loss if you beat yourself.  
So it's a combination of certainly a lot of teams in this league are good
enough to beat you that you just cannot come out possession after possession,
beat yourself and not being focused on the defensive end and rotating. There's
Not too many teams in this league you let them shot layups are going to come
out on the other end, and they are not going to let you shoot layups now.
Rotate and get to the rim and keep that from happening.  
Q. Is Kaylee just in a slump or are they doing something to take away her
strength?  
COACH HENRICKSON: No, I think right Kaylee lacks the discipline to take an
off-balance shot. They chased her, we worked on moves to get separation shots
and they put her down once. I thought she practiced better the last couple of
days. I was disappointed for her. For her to not being able to make that
layup, it's just undiscipline. Kaylee pucks (phonetic) like a cheerleader now
when she shoots a layup. How that discipline goes straight out, I don't
understand it. For a senior, it's tremendously disappointing for her to be
that undisciplined with the ball.  
Q. Talk about Kansas State's defense tonight and what they did against
you?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right now, with Kaylee struggling and they are not going to
let you catch shooting threes, they are going to chase you and rag you out on
screens. We have to be able to shot fake, separation, use your screens, change
your pace, change your speed. With Erica, we run a lot of things with Erica,
they do a nice job of switching screens and rotating.  
Right now we don't have a lot of separation speed on the perimeter to get some
room her. Crystal starts a game by not being very strong and not commanding
the ball and not great effort up and down, and three seniors, that's going to
be tough play this time of year. They have to be better and they know that.
But they rotate well and you know, unfortunately played a couple of kids every
possession that you don't have to guard.  
Q. Shaquina got some big minutes tonight, what were you looking for in
her?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I felt like if she could create off the dribble, for her,
she's got some separation speed and can get some room. I thought her first
possession, she makes a great pass to Crystal, gets the layup defensively,
thinks she can hug and bother a little bit, we get to go in to take the jumper
going left for the pull-up jump we need, and that was good. And at times she
played well and obviously being able to run her at the point a little bit, and
getting Erika back to some offense that we run to give her some green. I like
can her athleticism and she played with discipline for us today, which is
important for us, and all of these kids. Hopefully we let her play more next
week and if not, work like crazy to play better and come back next year.  
Q. This senior class endured a lot of ups and downs; what memories stand
out?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think the three, they have been coachable since they got
here, tried to make some changes and certainly wished for their senior year to
have gone better. But unfortunately it's not the way the script ended for
them. I think they have grown and learned a lot in the last two years about
discipline and commitment and what it takes to be successful as a human being,
not just as a basketball player. And even if we might have struggled, not have
the success on the court that we would have liked for all of them to have,
hopefully when they walk away with the administration and support of Kansas
has helped them to understand and be quality people and grow and flourish and
have opportunities in the rest of their lives; what it feels like to be part
of something very special.  
And, you know, also hopefully this group will look back in a few years and not
very many years and we're achieving the kind of success that I came to Kansas
to achieve and we will do that. And those three kids can look back and say,
well, I was a part of that change and I was a part of that process.  
Q. Did you come in with a monkey on your back as a victory that you need to
get?  
COACH HENRICKSON: No. The schedule played that out. Obviously we didn't know
we were going to play them, but they have a good basketball them team. They
have some young kids playing awfully well for them that we knew would play
well. We thought they would be great college players. There's just so many
good teams in this league, it's hard to look at one and go, that one really
bothers me more than someone else. All of the teams in this league are good.  
Q. Kaylee's ankle has been bothering her did that factor in tonight?  
COACH HENRICKSON: No, she's fine.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Heather Ezell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16373)

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH FENNELLY: Welcome to the Big 12 tournament. Could not be more proud of
the effort of our team. We beat a tremendously talented team, Hall of Fame
coach. Down seven late in the game and I think if we would have left, everyone
would have said, that's okay, with what happened to us a couple of months ago
in Austin. As gutsy an effort as we had in a long time. We challenged our
efforts to come and stay, not to have to go back to school; didn't want to
pack; my wife wants to go shopping, spend money. But tremendous effort,
tremendous finish, and we're honored to be playing again tomorrow.  
Q. Can you just say what it was in those last seven, eight minutes that got
you on that roll like that?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think far too often, there's a lot of us that want to take
credit. The players did it. They just willed themselves to things, Megan and
Lyndsey have led this team all year. I think they just kept plucking away. We
have come-from-behind a lot. In our last four or five wins, now five, we have
been down at halftime. You want to be around people that just don't quit
fighting and competing, and I've been honored to be around this group all year
and they have kept plugging away. We have had some ups and some downs, but we
made some huge shots. I thought we guarded at some critical times, but the
bottom line is, you've just got to will yourself sometimes. Everyone was
tired.  
I think this group of kids gets along great together and they figured out a
way to win a game. And we changed defenses almost too much. But, you know,
when we made a couple big threes and we got Brit the ball a couple of times,
kept us in the game, we always made one more pass before we got knocked out.
It was close. We were on the ropes a few times and we always made one more
play and that kept us around.  
Q. What was your strategy when Brittany got in foul trouble? You put her
back in the game during that huge run.  
COACH FENNELLY: Pete Gizel (ph), who was the coach at Notre Dame, the
assistant when I was there, he said, "I don't want to be the richest man in
the yard." And Brit is our best low-post player, and we were going to win or
lose with her.  
And to be honest Coach Gizel (ph), he talked me into it. He just said, "Coach,
we can't wait, we have to go." If you look at our team over the last few
weeks, when Brittany is out of the game, we have trouble scoring on the block
which makes it harder for our perimeter players to score.  
You know, you have to handle it sometimes and it worked out. We got some good
decisions, got her the ball and maximized her time on the court. But it was a
gamble, and really, Coach talked me into it, and glad he did.  
Q. On the intentional foul, what part of your anatomy or what part of your
uniform got grabbed?  
BRITTANY WILKINS: My hips, actually. I just felt two hands on my hips and I'm
not going to go any further than that.  
Q. How big of a play was that that that allowed to you take time off the
clock?  
BRITTANY WILKINS: Yeah, I think it gave us a chance to score. When it gets to
a situation like that, wish I would have made both of them, but great down the
stretch there. Putting the free throws in, I think it was a huge advantage for
us, it gave us some momentum. We were kind of, I don't know how you say this,
but we like getting the ball taken away. I felt like I was getting fouled but
can't really argue with the refs at that point.  
So, yeah, it was a good game and competitive. Definitely, this is Big 12
basketball and everybody is throwing up elbows and things like that and you
have to play through it.  
Q. Heather, the past few games, not much scoring, what changed now, as
opposed to the end of the season when the season was wrapping up?  
HEATHER EZELL: I don't know, just seemed to get out there today. You know, you
lose, you're out. So it's time to no matter what, no excuses, put the ball in
the hole, doesn't matter what's going on. So kind of got that mentality, and
if I was open, I was going to put it in.  
Q. Explain how a 30-point loss turns into whatever this was, a victory that,
seems unfathomable.  
BRITTANY WILKINS: It is a bit, but we didn't play our best game down there.
Our scout team plays harder defense on us the past few days than I think even
Texas did. So we were a little more prepared for that.  
We had a great game plan, Coach Fennelly and the rest of the coaches, they put
us out there and they put us in the situations. Like Coach Gizel (ph) said,
"You lose and you go home." I told everyone last night specifically that I
unpack everything in my bag. So when you're out there in the game, the last
thing you want to think about is now having to go back to the hotel and pack
up and now you've got to sit in class tomorrow. So that's not really my style,
class. Just kidding. (Laughter).  
So I think that's part of it. And we just -- I think we were a bit more
prepared this time and knew what was coming so it was not such a Shock right
out of the gate.  
Q. Your freshmen really kept you in the game and the experienced players
finished it off for you, when it got to the point where it was there to win.  
COACH FENNELLY: I agree with that. I think Heather, you know, we challenged
Heather pretty hard in practice the other day, and to her credit, she stepped
in and made some huge shots. It seemed like every shot that she made was at
the perfect time. We got the open court. They are going to guard Lyndsey hard;
she had some looks; she made them. And at the end of the game, when you get
into tournaments, you have to have great guard play when we have in Lyndsey
Medders. You have to have the leader on the block, which we do in Brit, and as
aggressive a defender as we've had in a long time in Megan.  
Those kids, you have to make a decision the last four minutes, take care of
the ball, make the decision where the ball goes, who shoots it, step up to the
free throw line and do the little things.  
There's no question the experienced players have an advantage, but at the same
time, too, we're a team that's not played a lot of players all year, and at
this point, everyone had to contribute. And I thought they did. We struggled
inside a little bit, but we made some plays down the stretch.  
For us to outrebound Texas by nine is maybe the stat that I thought I would
ever see against a Texas team. That said, we were playing hard, we were
competing and we shot 52 percent the second half. And no one -- I'm not very
bright, but when you make baskets, you look pretty good and that's why they
call it basketball I guess. For us to get 72 points, that's an explosion for
us recently. That was kind of cool, yeah.  
Q. Heather, you are a freshman and this is your first big tournament kind of
situation, did it feel any different than a regular game, and it looked like
you responded really well?  
HEATHER EZELL: You know, it's no different, it's getting on the floor and
playing basketball. We obviously had a few more things pushing us with the
tournament, like we talked about, where if you lose, you go home. Now, you
know, we're playing for a little bit of pride in the Big 12. We didn't, you
know, do great in the season, so we just come in here now, and it's just
another chance to get back at people that got us in the regular season.  
Q. Coach talked about the different defenses that you threw at them, did you
get a sense that was affecting them on the offensive end, and what gave you
confidence that you could do this today after what happened in Austin?  
BRITTANY WILKINS: Well, I think the defensive plan the coaches came up with
was great. I think any team if you change defenses on them, that always throws
you out of your rhythm. Coach told us that; be ready for any possession that
we're going to change and I think that does throw them off. You've got to
change your zone offense to man offense and that give them some off-shots, and
that's what we wanted to do, is get Tiffany Jackson away from the basket and
get them shooting those kind of shots instead of off the block.  
I told these guys after I fouled out, I said, hey, remember what they did to
us down in Austin, and that was a game we'll remember and that kind of stuck
with us. I think we remembered that at the end and hopefully they remembered
that, too, and we can use that as momentum going into our game to, even
playing OU, what they did us at home, the Big 12 opener, they beat us at home.
We remember that kind of stuff, and hopefully we can teach our young kids how
important that kind of stuff is. It's that you remember losses like that, and
learn from them and we can use them to our advantage.  
Q. On dead balls and free throws, you were really encouraging the team to
hustle down there every time. Why was that so important, and what difference
do you think that made down the stretch?  
COACH FENNELLY: We were pretty tired. And I did not want Texas even to have a
glimpse that we were struggling. So I was just -- every dead ball, every
situation, get down the floor, act like you're ready to play no matter what
the score is, get to the other end and let's go. It's like you watch football
teams when the quarter changes, you just run to the other end of the field to
the other. I think it sends a message to yourself more importantly. I wanted
our kids to just keep fighting and get to the own end. If they being looked at
us like, well, maybe they are not ready to quit yet and whatever, but you know
it's not something we've done in the past that much. I just felt like we
needed to keep them energized because we only played six players. We were
really tired at the end.  
You know, I just did not want us to have any sense that we were going to show
any sign of relaxing, because they are too good, too athletic, too good, too
big, too strong and we have to find other ways to beat teams like that and
that was one of them.  
Q. In the last ten minutes, it looked like Brittany was the All-American the
way she was playing in that game. Talk about her and the whole season she's
put out for you.  
COACH FENNELLY: Well, it's the first time I've been asked about Brit, and I
will tell you, and I will mention it to the coaches in our league, I was
extremely disappointed Brittany Wilkins was not an all-conference player. You
look her numbers, seventh in the league in scoring, rebounding, field-goal
percentage, blocked shots if you would have said in the last ten minutes who
is the all-Conference, I think it was Brittany Wilkins.  
Tiffany Jackson is a great, great player but Brittany Wilkins has done a
phenomenal job for this team all season. She did it again tonight. She's our
only true low-post presence and just kept fighting through it. You score 19
points against a team like that, you're doing something right. You know, the
good news is we get to keep playing, and Brit gets to go out there one more
time.  
Q. They had their way with you in the first half under the basket, and the
second half you clogged the middle a lit bit maybe.  
COACH FENNELLY: We were worried about Erika and Daria can't on the perimeter,
and we were kind of thinking we were going to trade twos for threes maybe. And
they spread us out so much we could not get to the rebound and so we gambled a
little bit. We changed our defense, and we changed our rotations and tried to
rush the shooter a little more starting out with them. So starting inside and
just tried to clog it up as best we could, get some -- get a tip rebound, get
our guards in, get in there and rebound. You know, we lucked out a little bit
because Erika had a couple looks and Daria, that's the nature of the game. We
could not continue to keep spreading our defense out and let them call us on
the block.  
That's the way we always have to play, you kind of -- luckily the second half,
we made the decision to do it that way most of the second half. We changed a
little, but we just felt, when we got down ten the first half, they were
fighting each other for a rebound a couple of times. We had to gamble, and
luckily they missed a couple of shots that probably they would normally make
and the ball bounced our way.  
Q. It's hard to say from the outside, but what's your thoughts on what went
wrong with Texas this year? At the beginning of the season, a lot of folks
thought they could win this conference, and now they are not even going to go
to the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH FENNELLY: Well, I don't know, I think Texas is a very talented team.
They are playing what lot of young players, and maybe in spots that are not
normal with some injuries. I watched their Duke back when Anysha (ph) got hurt
and I thought they could play with anyone.  
You look at their record, Jody, I'm surprised the Lakers were not on the
schedule. Come on, a lot of us would be 13-15 if we played that schedule. I
think Jody has done a great thing every year for women's basketball. She
challenges her team, challenges the Big 12, she puts the league out there --
we see her in the Bahamas. They play great and we're in the airport, we're
coming back to play I don't know who, and they are coming back to play
Tennessee and Duke.  
I think we have to be very careful about over evaluating a great program, a
great coach, a lot of great players, and just, you know, things happen, things
fall together for one team. They didn't fall together for Texas this year. And
believe me, I'm in no position to critique what Jody Conradt does or says. She
forgot more about the game than I'll ever think about.  
They are a great team, great program. And, you know, that's what I told our
kids, we not only beat a good team, we beat up one of the storied programs in
this country, and that's something we're very proud of.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [LaToya Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14298)

### [Patrice Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16375)

### [Marsha Sharp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13845)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: We knew today was a must-win for us in order to extend our
season, have a chance to play in a couple of weeks. We understood the
importance of this game, and I felt like we prepared well for it and we had
some players that really stepped up and gave us some good minutes.  
There were a couple of keys I thought, that first of all, I thought our
ability to rebound in the first half and make it one-and-out for Oklahoma
State was a big factor for us. I thought we played good defense and limited
the touches that they had too deep on the block. The times where we had
struggled with Oklahoma State in our two previous games were times whenever
their post players got to catch it too deep in the paint and made plays
against us and we tried to avoid that today as much as we could.  
Obviously it was a blow to us to lose Myrick early, and we're going to do an
MRI and try to assess where we are with that this afternoon. It's always
important that you have players that are ready to take that challenge and step
up and come make some plays for us. I thought Patrice Edwards and Teddy
Griffin both filled in there very well and made some big plays for us on both
ends to give us a chance to win. I'm proud of us and we're real excited about
the chance to play again tomorrow.  
Q. When you saw Erin Myrick go down early in the first half, did you kind of
tell yourself that maybe you would have to step up today?  
PATRICE EDWARDS: Yeah, I did. I know what it means to get hurt, so I'm always
ready for the opportunity to help.  
Q. LaToya, Coach mentioned how important this win for you guys was, can you
just talk about that?  
LaTOYA DAVIS: I think this was important, first of all so, we could play
another day and not go home early. We even want to try to get in the NCAA
Tournament. I think this gives us momentum to go in and play tomorrow and
hopefully keep on winning and planning and get to a championship.  
Q. LaToya, could you sense or could you see how frustrated Oklahoma State
was; they were chasing records.  
LaTOYA DAVIS: I could not really see that. Oklahoma State is a great ball
team, even though their record doesn't show it, they are a good ball team and
they get better every time we play them. Overall they are a great team.  
Q. You mentioned the defense, how much did they step up in those three or
four possessions when you could not get the basket?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: I thought obviously we didn't score a lot of points in the
game or in the first half, and so our defense had to be where we really got
our lift. I think to hold any team to 15 points talks about the fact that
you're limited and the number of shots you're taking and they are probably not
getting very many boards and sticks.  
We also did a pretty good job of keeping them off the free throw line. So
there's no question, and that's been the case most of the year for us. We have
to defend people well to hold people to low number of points to have a chance
to stay in games.  
Q. At this point, you know, every game it seems like it's a one-game season
depending on the tournaments and stuff, but have you got yourself maybe
thinking of a career's worth of memories popping into your head knowing that
the end is coming in the next couple of weeks?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Yes, there have been moments where I've thought about, you
know, when this is done that I'm going to have a lot of thoughts of great
games and things that we've been able to do. Our staff sat this morning at
pregame and talked a little bit about all of the things that we had
experienced together at Reunion Arena and obviously there have been some great
memories in here for us, because we played a lot of big games before the Big
12 was even formed when the Southwest Conference was here.  
So there are moments when those things are happening, and I'll tell you,
whenever the ball is tipped, that all goes away, and there's not anything in
my mind at that point but how to make these guys have a chance to win. I never
had a thought about it the whole time that I was on the court today from the
tip to the final buzzer. This was all about this team and trying to get them
to the next round.  
Q. It's been about two months since you saw Missouri; talk about the game
tomorrow and your thoughts about it?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: I'm excited that we're playing a team from the north. I
think to make have an opportunity to play someone we haven't seen but twice
already is in some ways a little bit of a help.  
I think we're a different team than we were that day in Missouri and certainly
they may feel the same way. But I do think that we are a little bit more solid
on offense. Our decision-making process has changed a little bit probably
since that day.  
You know, we were on the road in some fairly difficult circumstances the day
that we played up there. I think that, you know, because of that, we'll be
ready to go. Certainly, they have a great basketball team. They are athletic,
they can hurt you in a lot of different spots. They bring a lot to the table.
We have a lot of respect for the coaching staff and I think it will be a great
game. I don't think there's any question that there will be a lot of plays
made because there will be a lot of athletes going after each other tomorrow.  
Q. Second game in a row you had considerable minutes, do you think with more
time you're getting better and more action?  
PATRICE EDWARDS: Yeah, I think I am. It's been a long season and every chance
I get to play, I think I get better. I think I'm getting a little better and
now I know what I have to do, it helps.  
Q. Could Myrick have gone back in the game today?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: No, I think they are holding her out for precautionary
reasons. As we speak they are doing an MRI on it to evaluate where we are, so
we'll probably know something later today about her status and what she'll be
able to do to help us.  
Q. This may sound like an odd question, but is there any kind of pressure
when you're facing a team that has not won in the Big 12?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Yes. I think that the scenario where -- all of the
pressure I would think was on us today. You know, they probably could relax
and play and do the things that they wanted to and didn't feel a lot of
pressure to win. I don't think there's any question when you're in a
tournament setting like this that there is more pressure attached to the team
that's trying to get themselves in a tournament or continue to play more so
than maybe the other way around.  
Q. LaToya, can you talk about Patrice's play, coming in, they were giving
you a hard time and maybe opening things up for her.  
LaTOYA DAVIS: Well, she's my roommate on the trip, but she's a great player
and she's long and I go against her in practice and get my shot blocked most
of the time. She's a great player, goes in there and does what she has to do.
Like whatever Coach Sharp asks her to do, she'll do and she goes out there and
gets it done and she had a great game tonight.  
Q. I apologize if I was not here for the first time you talked about
Patrice, but can you talk about Patrice as well as the fact that you guys were
able to rest your big three players, something you'll need if you want to
reach your ultimate goal, the Championship?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: Well, Patrice Edwards was a great player when we recruited
her out of a junior college system in Texas at Frank Phillips College (ph).
Patrice suffered some pretty traumatic injuries and some knee problems that
we've had a very difficult time trying to overcome. We felt like when we
recruited her, she had a chance to be a really special player.  
I think she just now has had enough reps. Even in practice settings, we've
been limited even in the amount we can practice or since she's been at Tech
that she's beginning to feel that she can give us some moments and help us a
little bit. There have been a few moments in the last couple of weeks where we
felt that more than ever.  
It was not really that big of a surprise to me today what she got it done, but
I think I'm really proud for her. Because when you rehab as many times as
she's had to and gone through the things she's done, she's had four knee
surgeries since she's been at Tech, that's pretty significant. To get a kid
that's able to come back and do something like she did today, that's pretty
special, and I'm proud for her and I'm glad we got to rest some kids.  
I thought it was going to be a big part of today to try to juggle people
around a little bit and get some help from the bench so that some of those
guys that have been playing 37 or 38 minutes for us were going to have an
opportunity today not to have to do that and hopefully have a little bit more
leg spring tomorrow and be able to attack people a little bit better.  
Q. The Oklahoma State coach has a proven track record at his previous stops,
in a Conference like the Big 12, can you have a quick turnaround, or is it
going to be a long-haul process trying to turn the program around?  
COACH MARSHA SHARP: I don't think there's any question that he will get some
things to happen there. He's a great coach. He's got a great staff. They will
probably build it in a lot of different ways, I think a different direction as
far as junior college and players and the whole works. I would expect him to
be much improved a year from now.  
The other thing about that is when I watch them play and watch them on tape,
I'm always thinking to myself, there is such a razor thin difference between
teams that win six or eight games and teams that don't or teams that are in
the Top 3 in the Conference and teams that are not. It's a player here, a
player there, a play here or there, that makes that difference.  
So I think he probably is not as far away as people probably would think,
looking at their record. I think some of the players in that program are very
capable of stepping and playing at a level high enough to give them a chance
to win.  
So I would -- I would bet you -- no, that's a bad word today. Bet is not a
good thing to say. But I would guess that in a year, you would be talking
about a program that has some significant wins in their program in a year.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

### [Whitney Pegram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13844)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH BUDKE: First of all, obviously losing is never easy. It's not anything I
want to get used to. But if you have to lose and your season had to end, why
not to a Hall of Famer, why not to the classiest coach I've ever met in my
life. I hope Texas Tech can make that NCAA Tournament. I think they deserve to
be in the NCAA Tournament already. I don't think they need to win another
game. I think they have done enough with their schedule and their RPI to make
it. Coach Sharp has done more for women's basketball than most. Coach Sharp is
going to be one of those persons that 50 years from now when you look back and
you name the ten greatest names in women's basketball, her name will be among
them. It might be among the top five names in women's basketball.  
So I wish them all the luck in the world. They did to us today what they have
done to people all year. They played great defense, they great interior
defense, and they don't beat themselves.  
Our problem today has been our problem all year long. We have trouble scoring.
We just flat have trouble scoring. We're last in the league in scoring, field
goal percentage, free throw percentage, and you're just not going to win in
college basketball putting those kind of numbers up, and you're especially not
going to win in the Big 12. But congratulations to Coach Sharp and her team.  
Q. Whitney, you said earlier that you wanted this season to be longer, there
was stuff you still could accomplish, are you still excited for next season
with the way this ended?  
WHITNEY PEGRAM: I felt looking at the clock, just thinking about playing
harder because there's about six months before we're going to get to put this
uniform on again and play.  
I think we still have a lot left to give, and we're going to do that in the
off-season. We're going to work hard. We're not going to look back at this
season and say it was okay. We're going to work out harder and get stronger
and faster. I mean, we all look forward to next year. I think we're really
excited about next year, and now that our season is over, it's time to start
thinking about next year.  
Q. Can you talk about what you see as what you could do next year, you've
lost 17 in a row now, I know you probably hate that number, but what's
possible for you guys next year?  
WHITNEY PEGRAM: I think anything is possible. We have a lot of really great
players coming in, and, you know, we have a great coaching staff that has been
leading us all year. Coach Budke put in players that they would work if we
would hit some shots. If you look at our shot selection, I think we have good
shot select, we get shots within two feet of the basket all night, and, you
know, we've just got to get stronger and put those in. Kind of disappointing
sometimes when we run a play and we run all the way through and we get a shot
that we're supposed to get and it doesn't go in. That's the reason for a lot
of our disappointment this year.  
Q. Marsha has suggested that you guys could get a lot better in a hurry. Can
you talk about what you guys think you can do in the off-season? We talked a
little bit about it the other day, just in terms of what's coming in, what
comes back, that kind of thing?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, I think if we look back at this year, you know, it's tough
when you don't win a game and say that you can make a significant turnaround
and it shouldn't go together, but we feel we can. We feel like besides maybe
the Top 3 teams in the league, we played pretty well with everybody.  
We have a lot of kids that have gone through this league for the first time.
We've signed two in the fall. We signed two transfers sitting out. We have a
couple scholarships open in the spring. You honestly could look up next year
and there could be a whole new starting five out there. So we have some kids
with some experience, but we have some talent coming in.  
Obviously this is not an easy league to go from last to first in. I mean, it
just doesn't happen very often. But we're not the first team to go through
this. I think, Coach Sherry (ph), what did he go, 1-15 his first year; Coach
Blair won maybe two or three his first year. So you have to pay your dues. I
feel like I've paid a lot of dues this year.  
So I honestly don't want to sit through this again. We have as a coaching
staff a great understanding of now what we need to get talent-wise to compete
in this league. If you look at the top couple of teams, you're looking at the
top couple of teams having Kodak All-Americans on their team. You have to get
that kind of talent if you want to win the Big 12. I have a great staff, and
we'll find it.  
Q. I know you talked before about how the offense has struggled here and
there, but what does a defense like Tech has do to teams to take shots they
don't always take?  
COACH BUDKE: First thing Tech does a great job of, they don't foul you. They
don't foul you and put you in the throwing circle. They do a great job of
containing defense. They do a great job of getting you off the block, and
again they don't put you to the free throw line. I think honestly on the half-
court, they are as good defensively as anybody in this Conference.  
So, I thought we played decent defense today to start but if you go back and
look at it, the last five seconds of the shot clock or second-chance points is
where they got us. I thought our initial defense, first-shot defense was
decent, but that's a team that's a little more experienced and a little
tougher that's had success that got us in those areas.  
Q. You may it clearly early on that you would get a technical if you thought
it would fire up your players, was that intentional today?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, a little bit. It was a little bit. I thought there was a
foul discrepancy, so I wanted to get my point across on that. But also, I
thought maybe we were just letting it slip away. You know, just letting it
slip away and maybe weren't fighting as well as we could in that little time
period right there.  
So we responded this year to get us going a little bit, and it worked a little
bit, it pulled us back within 14 or 15 after they shot the technical and all
that stuff. I just wanted to make sure our girls understood that the coaching
staff is going to fight the whole game, and we want them to fight the whole
way, too.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Erika Arriarian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16374)

### [Jody Conradt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13898)

### [Tiffany Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13843)

### [Nina Norman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14241)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH CONRADT: I think this game was pretty much a snapshot of our season. We
played really well at times, and then we would have breakdowns and it just
couldn't finish the job.  
I think our lack of experience in games like this against a team that is as
good as Iowa State is, we played them early and we handled them. But things
change as we go along, and Coach Fennelly does a great job. They are very hard
to guard, there's no question. I don't think there's another team in America
that is as hard to guard as they are, because they all score well. They wait
for you to make a mistake and they knock down the 3s better than any team I've
played against.  
So it was a combination of them playing well and particularly down the stretch
and our making some critical errors as we had a chance to win the ballgame. We
were up 67-60 and then our wheels start to fall off and then we're playing
from behind trying to do things to catch up. It's not any one thing, and you
look at the stat sheets and we are out rebounded and they shoot twice as many
free throws as we do. But on the other hand, we had our chances to win the
game and just couldn't close it out and they make plays and we don't.  
Q. Their defense changed, stacking it on the inside, what really stopped
your scoring when they changed into that 2-3?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: Well, I guess inside, and also penetrating, so when Erika
went out of the game or Daria went out of the game, that sunk in and clogged
us in the middle and stopped us from what we do best.  
Q. Coach talked about how this was a snapshot, this season for you as a
senior, did you feel like you guys were close to getting cohesion ever, or
what are your general feelings of the way you guys finished up?  
NINA NORMAN: Well, you know, nobody wants to finish the season this way. There
were points in the season where I thought we were getting better as a team and
coming together, things of in a nature. Like Coach said, it was a snapshot. We
played really well sometimes and the next couple of minutes, we just fall in
the hole and forget everything we're doing.  
Q. Nina, it seemed like every free throw they hit were at the perfect time,
were those just daggers for you guys?  
NINA NORMAN: It hurt us a little bit. I think it hurt our confidence because
we went back on the offensive end and didn't produce. They came down the fast
break and hit a three and then they all had perfect timing with that. I think
we got down on ourselves a little bit and they took the lead, it was hard for
us to regain composure.  
Q. You get to come back, do you feel like this is the kind of team that is
just maybe a little health, a little seasoning away from being pretty
special?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: I've been really proud of our freshmen the way that they have
progressed this season. I think every day and practicing every game, they have
gotten better and better, so I'm really excited about the season next year but
we are really disappointed about this season.  
Q. Tiffany, would you want to play more basketball if you got an invitation
to the WNIT, would you want to play with any of the veterans on this team?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: Yeah, I would like to play. I'm very competitive and I would
hate for people to see that as being our last half losing. We want it for the
fans and all of the people that really support us and behind us, all of us
want to continue to play. Our seniors, Nina, Daria, Tamra, the seniors, we'd
just hate for them to have to leave on this note.  
Q. Nina, do you feel that -- it seems like for us it's easy to say it's a
young team and you mix in some injuries and it's going to be a tough season.
Was there anything else beyond that in your heart that you think affected this
team?  
NINA NORMAN: Actually, no. Like this past summer went by and we looked really
good and I was excited and then Carla and Eniya (ph) got hurt, but we still
have some really talented freshmen on this team.  
I was disappointed it didn't turn out the way I wanted it do, but again, it is
experience and you just have to take what you can get. I think we could have
been a lot better this season, but we just started to play together too late
in the season.  
Q. Erika, as a freshman, what would you say you learned form this season
that you can apply next year?  
ERIKA ARRIARIAN: From the beginning, Coach said every possession matters. I
think in high school as freshmen we think we can go once or twice or even
three times down the floor and make a mistake and feel like we can get it
back. But definitely we learned, every game that we've lost, that every
possession does matter and just like you all saw tonight or today, the exact
same thing.  
Q. You said earlier about the WNIT, is the thought still the same, that you
don't think you guys would go?  
COACH CONRADT: You know, we really haven't talked about it. When I was asked
about that earlier, that a quote taken out of context. The whole thing wasn't
recorded. It was a conversation, not just one or two sentences about that. I
think that kind of decision is for the players. And what they say in front of
this group they may not say the same thing in the locker room, I don't know.
It's a discussion we will have.  
I will say about the WNIT, I remember our football team had to go a couple of
times to the Holiday Bowl. There was not a great deal of excitement about
doing that, and this WNIT is not the NIT. We need to think about how we can
make it more attractive. It doesn't end in Madison Square Garden, and you
don't get a ring or anything tangible when you play in it. So it's about,
where is this team.  
These freshmen have had a long season. We are not healthy. Even Tiffany and
Nina are not 100%. So I'm not going to try to influence them one way or the
other. I think it involves a lot of people. It involves, can our event staff
get together, it's a home event, there are lots of issues to be determined.
But I don't think it's going to be made in this environment.  
Q. With the youth and the injuries all season long, how does this compare
challenging, trying-wise for you as a coach?  
COACH CONRADT: When I saw the team in the locker room, all of us learned
thing. I learned things this year. I've never been in this situation. I've
done this a few times, but I've never been in a situation with a team this
young and this inexperienced, and it's every position. You look at Tiffany and
she's a really great player, and you look at Nina and she's played a lot of
basketball. But have they been responsible for a team on the floor? Have they
been in a leadership role? No. So all of that is new, as well.  
This is a team, you have to live it to really understand it. There's so much
going on in their heads and in their minds that it's hard for them to focus
one time down the floor. I mean, there were some critical breakdowns down the
end. Are we switching screens, are we hedging screens, and then what are we
doing on the offensive end. There's just so much information that they have to
take in, as Erika said, on every possession.  
We don't always use the best judgment possible, but it's not just about the
youth; it's about the inexperience. We had a couple points where we ran down
there and lost the ball down the sideline. There was one possession we came
down and we took a quick shot, and it's as if the players all believe they can
do it by themselves because they have done that before. It's just a whole
laundry list of things that the team has to learn.  
And, you know, right now, I'm not even sure even at this point when the season
ends which players are going to be the ones that are going to step up and make
plays. So it's like, oh, okay, let's dial-a-player, because there have been
days where every one of them have done something. There have been days when
every one of them have not done something, it's really been interesting in
that regard.  
And we have some talented freshmen, no question. I think you saw a little bit
of Mergerson today, which she is capable of doing. But she can't play minutes
and she's had very little playing opportunity because of the injury.  
Erika, it's been really a stretch for her to be able to do the things that
she's done. I think if you take just what she's done, she's had a pretty
amazing season, considering how much pressure we put on her. But it is about
this team needing an off-season.  
At the beginning of the year, they had no idea what they needed to do to play
at this level, and now I think they have an idea. They know they have got to
get to work, they have got to improve on some things, and it was hard for
Tiffany to trust them because you don't know what's happening, and Tiffany
sometimes does too much herself because she's not sure about what is going to
transpire. So it's just a combination of things, all put together, and
injuries are not a little part of that.  
Q. Did you discuss what happened in Austin earlier against these guys was
not necessarily going to happen up here, and what was the big difference in
these two games besides the outcome?  
COACH CONRADT: Well, was definitely worried about that, because you can tell
them and tell them and tell them, but they have in their mind, we beat them by
30 in Austin. But what didn't factor in in Austin was Meadows (ph) barely
played and she was hurt, and I'm not sure how she played but she's pretty
important to what they do. And I thought their inside game had come along
considerably. Some of the people that are playing inside have really stepped
up, and they are a different team.  
We played well that particular game in Austin, but, yeah it was probably in
their minds, that, hey, this is a game that we can win. We started out really
well and it's almost you can't decide; they have a tendency to relax, and I
thought they did, or if you want them to really work hard early so that they
get into that mode. We played really well at the beginning of this game. We
knocked down some shots that we have not knocked down all year, and that
probably gave us a little sense of the fact it was going to be okay when it
really wasn't going to be.  
Q. Most people will probably look at a young team and say they need more
reps, so why would they not race off to the WNIT. But you're saying that your
team is not healthy enough?  
COACH CONRADT: No, I'm not saying that. They may go back and tell me they want
to go, and if this team wants to go, we'll go, or we'll be wherever we are, or
we'll play at home I assume. That's something that they need to decide.  
But the most important thing for this team right now is going to be individual
work outs and an off-season, an off-season of taking the experiences they have
had and trust me, they will separate themselves over this off-season. We won't
still have seven or eight inexperienced players who will all be at the same
spot. And really, you look at our team, they are all at the same spot right
now, and I'm talking about the freshmen and I'm talking about the returners
besides Tiffany, and she'll be the only real player who returns with a lot of
experience besides Erika.  
So they will separate themselves in some way, and that group coming in will
have some kind of impact. But we have work to do in terms of who is going to
be the leader now. I don't know, and that's going to be a really big issue.  
Q. Have you enjoyed any of it or have you lost your love over the stretch at
all?  
COACH CONRADT: You know, it's always hard when you lose. There have been a lot
of moments. They are a really fun group and I said the other day, I can go to
practice and I can kill them, I can have a run and I can really get on them.
When practice is over, they want to hug me. I'm going, what is wrong with this
group. Usually when you coach a group and you really push them and you try to
get them -- they will get mad. They will do something, they just have a good
time every day. It's really interesting to see how they do respond.  
I haven't been in this situation before, I'm telling you. Seven freshmen
probably would have been a challenge to begin with; but when you have the
injury and we started out wrong, there's no question, we started out wrong.
Tiffany and Nina were not in practice when we started because they were hurt.
So who sets the tone, who shows them how hard they have to work, and never got
it; that I think has hurt us throughout the season.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by University of Utah Mountain West
Conference Champions. We have head coach Elaine Elliott, student-athletes Kim
Smith, Shona Thorburn and Julie Larsen. And, Coach Elliot, if you'll open with
comments, we'll open for questions._  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, just, you know, our kids played a great game from
start to finish. I was so happy for all of them, certainly for our seniors.
This had alluded them. As a coach, you just like to see them have as many
great experiences as you can. And getting to win this tournament format is so
fun. And I'm just really happy that that has happened for them, and they
played incredibly well.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first please._  
Q. Were you aware of the triple-double?  
SHONA THORBURN: I had no ideal until after.  
Q. Julie, can you talk about your shooting and how did you feel like you
were quite open and then were you feeling it all day, just how it felt?  
JULIE LARSEN: I think my teammates were getting me wide-open shots, and
luckily today I was on and hitting those shots for them.  
Q. Kim, can you talk about what it's been like to wrap up your career this
way and what did you see as some keys to the game?  
KIM SMITH: As far as wrapping up my career, it's not really the way we look at
it because, you know, we're hoping we still have a couple more games left in
us. So it was just a great win. It's nice to finally seal the conference
tournament championship game.  
As far as all of my teammates, everybody has played well all year long. We've
had Heidi and Julie and Morgan, and everybody just steps up. And tonight
everybody stepped up when we needed them to, and we were burying the ball in
the hoop and playing defense.  
Q. Shona, can you talk about the feeling of finally win the Mountain West
Conference tournament?  
SHONA THORBURN: Well, I almost broke down and started crying when he took me
off, so I think that describes it pretty well. Gosh, it's so worth it. I guess
it was worth the wait and worth the losses that we, you know, experienced in
years past. And it's just a great way to end your conference career, and we
look to go on and keep playing. I'm glad that I had Julie and Kim here to do
it with.  
Q. I just want to ask Kim or Shona, I guess, how was Julie able to get open
so much?  
KIM SMITH: She doesn't need a lot of time to get her shot off so it's not very
hard.  
SHONA THORBURN: We've learned that in practice. I think we did a good job of
penetration, and penetrate and kick. And her man had to help a little, so
Julie was open. And I think we did a good job of swinging the ball and hitting
the open person.  
_THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies._  
_Questions now for Coach Elliot._  
Q. Obviously your team is no stranger to these title games. How much of the
process of the past few years builds up to how you played tonight or are the
events separate?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, I really think that every game is new and so I
certainly think every season and every game like this is new because every
team is different. At the same time, when you do have leadership that is
capable, first of all, to get done something that they've set their minds to,
it makes a big difference that they've had that experience and they're setting
themselves to accomplish something that they've fallen short of.  
It was certainly -- it has to be an indication of their preparation tonight,
their play tonight. You play well when you're really focused. You play well
when you're really interested in what's out there. And you really have a love
of competing. And I just credit those kids for the mindset to do that and play
well.  
Q. Any different style of play tonight or how was your game plan?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: It's -- we've started fast quite often and shot the ball
well early. But don't mistake, we certainly continue to talk to our kids about
don't fall in love with this. There's a long game and we can't talk at the end
of this talking about how we didn't go to the rim and didn't go to the post
and we weren't aggressive. So, we have to balance that success with knowing
that there's a long game to play and that that isn't something that you ever
want to rely on. You just want to ride it while you can. And that's really
pretty much how that worked out.  
Q. How much was it a matter of the game plan setting up Julie's shots in the
game or the game coming to her?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, the thing is, she has a guard -- the ball is in
somebody's hands who can go to the rim and can still find her. Shona has that
triple threat that she obviously showed tonight. There's not a lot of guards
that can do that, both get the finish done themselves when necessary or draw
and kick.  
You can't defend that in terms of if it's working well or if you get that
penetration, it can hurt you. So, you know, Julie just understands spacing and
she stays available, and your choice is to stay on her, in which case you'll
have problems with guards that can penetrate or try to give help. So it's a
tough call, if you can get both things done.  
Q. Coach Judkins after the game revealed a conversation you two had
afterwards about, I guess, some angry words of your not pulling your starters.
Do you have any response I guess to what he was talking about?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: What did he tell you?  
Q. He basically was complaining how you left your starters in the game, and
felt you should have pulled them earlier. He said that has been a trend,
apparently.  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Apparently. He accused me of running up the score, in a
championship game, Division I level, against the reigning regular-season
champions. You take that for what it's worth. I was just waiting for them to
come back.  
Q. You've got the NCAA tournament selection on Monday this year as opposed
to this Sunday. What are your thoughts on the women having their own day and
waiting a day for that?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Other than you're sort of one day later in terms of
preparing or knowing what to expect or -- I don't -- it doesn't re -- -- I
don't have much of a comment. I don't think one way or the other. I'm fine
it's okay. Do what's best for the game. If that's better for the game, we'll
all survive.  
Q. Coach, last year we sat out here, you scored 37 I think it was in the
championship game and you surpassed that in the first half tonight. You talked
about having your team better or at least they were better prepared. Did you
do anything differently from last year to maybe get them prepared to have this
kind of game?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: You know, again every year is so different. And, you
know, this is the first year that we -- that we weren't the favorite. It was a
completely different role. Don't feel like we didn't talk about that. We felt
the pressure was on them. They were the regular-season champs. They're
supposed to win. And we've been on that side of it. It's a whole different
mental framework to compete -- you're always competing in a different mental
state.  
So, I think we probably took the best advantage we could of being in the
position that we were, and kind of felt like we just thought, you know, we
were a combined 2.1 seconds and two air balls from a regular-season
championship. So we kind of thought, I guess there was a reason for that, and
it's to put us where we are today. And this chance we have today is kind of a
no pressure-under underdog, so maybe that helped.  
Q. Can you talk about as far as the tournament next week, you could come
back here. I know you don't have a say. Would you like to come back to Denver
if you could?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Are you talking about NCAAs.  
Q. Right?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: You bet. I've been doing this a long time, and the
longer the airplane ride, the worse for me. I would love to stay close.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach._  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Ambrosia Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16391)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Dani Kubik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16390)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by BYU head coach Jeff Judkins and student-
athletes Ambrosia Anderson and Dani Kubik. Coach, I'll let you open up with
comments and then we'll have questions for the student-athletes._  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Thank you. Well, it wasn't won of our games tonight. We
have to give Utah credit for that. I thought they played very well and
executed and did a great job of getting the shots that they needed.  
I don't know what it is. I think sometimes when you try really hard that
sometimes things don't work as well or as easy as you hope. And it just wasn't
our night tonight. Like I said, you have to give them a lot of credit. I
though they played very well. Probably their best game definitely in the
tournament. And they seemed to do that.  
They seemed to play their best game against us. If we took our average games,
we would probably beat them, but they always seem to step it up a notch and
really play well. I want to congratulate them for a great tournament.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes._  
Q. Either Dani or Brosh, how long does it take to get over something like
this?  
DANI KUBIK: We're going to get over it tonight. We have the NCAAs to look
forward to. We'll hold our head up high and keep moving forward.  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: I agree. That's all you have to do, is just move on, look
at game film, learn from your mistakes. We obviously have the tournament to
look forward to and some teams we've never played against. But, you know, it's
another game. Life goes on.  
Q. Brosh, what did you guys think you needed to do in the second half to try
to get back in the game?  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: Obviously defensive stops. Being down, I don't know, 16, 17
points, defense was huge. But then again, to get on the board, you need to
execute and move the ball around and run our motion like we usually do. And it
was a little different tonight. It wasn't the usual motion that we do. So
we're going to have a whole week to work on that. But defense was key in the
beginning of the second half.  
Q. Either of the girls. With Larsen having the game she had, obviously Utah
has other names. Was last a girl that a player that you guys were willing to
let go in order to maybe make some other stops there on the floor?  
DANI KUBIK: No, they are a really good team, and we, just like Brosh said, we
didn't play our defense. She was one girl and had to guard and we just didn't
complete it.  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: No, I mean you have to treat all the five players out there
as they're all threats. And when we don't, results like this happen. So we
focus on, you know, Smith and Shona, and the other three have to step it up.
They know they have to because they know the whole league is after those two.
So, we just -- we slipped up defensively against those three, especially Wood
or whatever her name is.  
Q. Coach, this is for all three of you, but if coach if you could start out.
This has been one of your best seasons ever. And to end it this way against a
team that you've had a history with, why Utah? What is it? Is it something
mental? Why does it have to be against Utah that you lose against?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: You want me to answer first? Every team in this league
matches up differently. As you saw yesterday, TCU had a very difficult time
playing us. They would have much rather played Utah in the semifinals than us.
Part of it is we pound the ball inside and they couldn't stop us. The other
side of the coin, they had quickness to be able to switch on Utah and not
worry about -- Utah does not have a post game whatsoever. And so they didn't
have to worry about that, and so they had the quickness to guard them out
there and not get beat one-on-one.  
If I had to do this again, I would have listened to some people that told me
to do some things, but it's hard when you're successful in the way that you
coach your team to go change something for one team. And I think what's
happened, is just certain match-ups are better. What they do is they don't
guard the non-shooter and hope they don't hit it. If tonight Melinda Johnsen
was hitting three's, they'd be sitting in the stand saying, Why did they let
Johnsen shoot three's? That's how she plays it, she plays it very
conservative. She's done that her whole career, and she's won a lot of games
doing it, and maybe I need to look at it that way sometimes.  
Utah is a very good team. They are very well coached. They have two players
that are seasoned, know how to play, and play together. They remind me of Jeff
Jonas and myself when we played. They know exactly what each other is going to
do. And thank goodness I don't have to play against those two. It will be fun
to play them again without those two. They are great players, and Brosia and
Dani are great players too, and tonight wasn't our night.  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: I would say personally, it's not so much of a mental thing.
I go out there treating them like it's another team. But I think since there's
a lot of girls from Utah, they do have that deep-down rivalry against Utah.  
Myself, not being from Utah, it's kind of hard to have Utah be my rival. I
look at it as just another school. But I can see, you know, how a lot of
people do. I think it is a mental game because we play amazing against any
other team besides Utah. So I don't know what else to say. But it's a big
mental game with our team and their team. And I guess, I don't know, I guess
we got to work on that too.  
DANI KUBIK: Same exact thing. There's nothing to say left.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions now for Coach Judkins._  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: See you girls. Good job.  
Q. Jeff, why were they open so much, especially Larsen on the outside? What
was the breakdown on the defense that allowed that to happen?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Well, I told my team the key to the game was to stop
Larsen, Carlsen and Warburton. The last two games we played them, they hurt
us. And I told my team that you need to stay on them and not give them any
shots and we'll let Smith and Thorburn score their points.  
I don't know why they left. Sometimes it's called just instincts where they
leave because they've done that so many times and they hit them tonight. They
hit them. Last night they didn't hit them. Against Vegas they missed them.
Tonight they hit them.  
It's funny, I told my coaches tonight I said, if we can go out and play our
average game both teams, we would win. But Utah seems to play their best game
against us. And maybe they just have the confidence they can do it. They
spread us out because they can all shoot it. They make our inside player have
to chase Perry, and she's not used to it, and maybe that's part of it.  
But they really shot the ball well tonight. They were open too, but a lot of
times people are open; they just don't hit them. That first half, going five
for five and three for three by those two, I mean they won't do that another
game probably. They really played well.  
Q. You seem to have a heated discussion with your team right before both
teams shook hands at the end of the game. What message were you trying to
convey before you play another game here in the next few days?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: First thing I wanted to tell my team that I was proud of
them, the way they handled themselves, and the way they didn't quit. And then
I told them for the young kids to remember this, this will motivate you in
summer basketball and lifting weights and working hard of what happened, and
what you could have had.  
And then I told them, remember the classy way that we handled it and the
unclassy way Utah handled it. They did it the whole year. I know Brosia made a
quote in the paper which they made a big deal of saying they ran it up on
people. When you're up 25 points, you pull your starters out with 1:54 in the
game, it's a classy way. You don't need to rub it in. That's what I told Coach
Elliott.  
Again I said, Congratulations, you played very well, but I don't know why you
need to leave your starters in with a 1:54 in the game. I don't understand
that. When you got somebody beat, you noticed I pulled mine out. That's not
the classy way of doing it. I played for a classy coach. I coached with Coach
Majerus, who was classy that way. That's the way I coach. And she got all mad
at that and said something about Brosia saying something in the paper and
whatever.  
Q. Just to follow up on that, at what point do you think she should have
taken the starters out?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: When they are up 25 points with 2 minutes and some minutes
to go in the game.  
Q. When would you have done it? That's when they did.  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: I looked at the clock.  
Q. Okay.  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: I looked at the clock. I've watched them play the whole
season. They're beating Colorado State by 35, and they're in until one minute
left in the game. It's a combination of a lot of things.  
I probably shouldn't have lost my cool, but, you know, I have a right to get
mad once in a while.  
Q. You've got to wait an extra day for the tournament breakdown. What are
your thoughts on the new selection Monday format for the woman?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: What was the first part of the question?  
Q. You won't find out where you're going until Monday.  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: That's right. We're excited about it. We hope that we can
get a real good draw and hope that we can get a situation where we can match
up good with teams, and hopefully we'll come back to Denver. We really seem to
play well in this building. And I know my team is very confident and
comfortable. And then of course hopefully we can do very well in the
tournament.  
I think it helps this conference to have us, no matter Utah, New Mexico and us
for sure. I think we'll be going. Hopefully TCU can represent the conference
well so we can get the respect which we really need. I think this year, you
know, we -- all of us played very hard pre-season games and did quite well,
and I think it helped the conference out a lot.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach._  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Mallary Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16396)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Dani Kubik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16390)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with BYU. Joining me on stage head coach Jeff
Judkins, Dani Kubik and Mallary Gillespie._  
_Coach, if you want to begin with some general comments please._  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Well, we're very happy about the win today. Both teams
were very tired. I think both times are very physical and I think it just took
its toll on us tonight a little bit. I thought our team really battled through
the first part of the game with good intensity, and then second half we came
out a little bit flat.  
It's hard. It's real hard when you're up 12, you feel like you played a good
first half to come in first five, ten minutes of the half and really put it
on. We turned it over, gave them some easy baskets. Like this team done all
year, they know how to win and they just came together.  
I think you can see how important it is in a tournament in this situation to
have a real good inside game because when people are tired, that's where you
get the ball. I thought Kubik played one of her best games of her career. We
really needed her tonight. And also Mallary, I thought Mallary came in and
gave us a real big lift offensively. When she's hitting shots and getting into
the basket, our team is way more effective. These two young ladies played very
well today. I'm very happy for them. We have to move on our arch rival and it
will be a great game tomorrow.  
_THE MODERATOR: Next few minutes direct questions to the student-athletes._  
Q. Could you talk about your defensive pressure in the first half, and how
you had them out of sorts and trying to get with their offense?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: We just needed to get up on them strong. We needed to have
a tough defense. We knew we couldn't give them any open shots, and if we
stepped up our defense, it would go with our offense. We tried to take them
out of their offence and thus far it worked for us.  
Q. Did you know you were going to have a big game after seeing them the
first couple of times because you just went off?  
DANI KUBIK: Well, I knew I was really prepared for this game. I was really
excited beforehand. Big game. TCU is a great team. I kind of knew it was, you
know, my turn because, you know, post is right there. I kind of got them, and
thank goodness Mallary was there so I could have a ton of assists too. But
yeah, I was ready for this game. I was really excited.  
Q. Dani, like coach mentioned, both teams were very aggressive, played
physical inside. Why were you guys able to have such success on the inside?
Rebounds were pretty close but you scored them on the inside.  
DANI KUBIK: I think it was more like position, where I got. I don't know. I
knew they double teamed a lot, so it kind of helped out to have my teammates
open in that area also. But the main thing was getting it down low inside the
key in order to score.  
Q. Mallary, you guys have Utah tomorrow. What are some of your thoughts
about playing the Utes?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: I'm excited. It's always a great game. It is a rival, so it
will be a great game. Every game is a great game. I'm excited. They are a good
team, they have a lot of good players. We're a good team, we have lots of good
players. It's going to be a dogfight. It is going to be tough. And again,
hopefully we'll come out on top, so...  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you two go. Thanks very much._  
_Questions for Coach Judkins._  
Q. Can you just talk about Utah and the differences in the first two times
you played them and what you expect the third time?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Utah is a very well-coached team, and they have a lot of
veteran players who've been in many big games like this. Kim Smith is I think
one of the best players that I've seen in woman's basketball. She always seems
to play well in these big games.  
The thing that's going to be nice is that either her pr Ambrosia, who are the
two MVPs, are going to win a championship, which is nice. I think both of them
have worked really hard in that. It will be interesting. I think Elaine's
probably right now figuring out what she's going to do. I can't enjoy this
win. I have to go back to the hotel room and watch a ton of film and figure
out what we can do.  
It should be a great game. Both teams are very equal. Both teams are tired.
We'll see who really wants it the most.  
Q. Between Dani, Mallary and Ambrosia, they scored 54 points to TCU's 53.
What kind of performance will you need from that Trifecta tomorrow?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Well Coach Elliott will try to take that away. That's her
game plan, is take those players away. And hopefully somebody like Keele, or
Johnson missed some layups tonight that she usually makes, so she could have
probably 10 tonight if she made her layups. But it will be somebody else. It
might be Riley coming in. I didn't have to play her a lot of minutes tonight
because Kubik was playing so well. So Riley shouldn't be tired. I Shawnee
Slade can come in. I think you saw tonight Vanessa hit a big three-pointer for
us. She played well the first time against Utah. So hopefully she can step it
up.  
I told my team in a kidding way, I said, if you want we can play one-on-one
Coach Elliott and me, and whoever wins can win the game. They want to play. It
should be a great game.  
Q. You mentioned the tiredness factor, both teams having played three games
in four days. Can you talk about what that does, advantages, disadvantage for
your team as well as what you perceive for Utah?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Usually what happens when you're very tired is you seem to
shoot the ball short. So a team that shoots a lot of three-pointers, it should
affect them. That's why I really believe to win this tournament, you have to
have an inside game, you have an outside game. You can't have one because it's
so hard when you get tired.  
We do have the advantage that way. I think we have a better inside presence.
Utah has two players who can create and play so well together, and they seem
to always have somebody step it up. The last two games we played, Carlsen hit
some big shots, and Warburton played very well.  
We got to have somebody else step it up, not just Brosia and Kubik. Somebody
else in our team has to really step it up for us tomorrow. And hopefully it
will be one of those names that I mentioned. They'll have their opportunity
and do it. I know we're looking forward to this, you know. I kind of wish we
had a day to rest. But I think we have more depth, maybe this could be to our
advantage. They played a lot of minutes tonight themselves. It will be a fun
game. Both teams know each other very well. There won't be any surprises.  
Q. You've been looking forward to getting Kim Smith out of the league for a
while. Have you picked out a farewell gift for her and also do you see this
game coming down to Ambrosia versus Smith or what really separates these two
teams tomorrow?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: I don't know if it will come down to those two, but I know
those two will be big factors in the game tomorrow. I'm very excited that
she's graduating. It seems like she's been here forever. I think a lot of
people thought that when I had Thorn or when ways with Utah with Andre Miller,
some of those guys.  
It should be a great matchup between Kim and Brosia. Brosia didn't have one of
her best games tonight. So if I know Bro, she will be really focused and ready
to go tomorrow and know this is her opportunity to really shine and do it. But
Utah does a great job though of taking people out of games. And we're just
going to have to hopefully get the ball where we need to and take care of it
and hope we have a little bit more energy to really, you know, push the ball
and tried to get easy baskets.  
Q. Jeff, you've talked earlier about the depth you have on your team. Can
you talk about the development of Hutson and Slade and how much they helped
this particular game?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: What I've tried to do, you know, I learned this a long
time as a player, the only way you can build a bench is by believing in your
bench and by using it. And earlier in the year I played my bench a lot. I had
a lot of people say, Why do you play 10 players? Why do you do that?  
Well, I do that because they have to learn how to play and they have to get
the opportunity. Riley has played so well for us. I really believe she's -- if
she's not one of the best big post players, she's right there. I thing Slade
has really come on. She gives us a lot of speed and quickness and athletic
ability. Vanessa has had a hard year. She's fought an ankle injury. She got
sick right after the Utah game the first time and fought back. I think she's
starting to get back and feel confident.  
I think Nancy will come in and play well for us tomorrow. Those are players
that are really there all year for us. As a coach, that's what I try to do, I
try to build my bench and believe in them. I told them tonight, I said,
tomorrow's going to be a big situation for the bench to come in and really do
well. Elaine's done the same thing. She's had Warburton and Joh-Teena and
she's had some players come in and play really well for her. That's what it
takes to win championships.  
Q. Do you believe TCU will be in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Yes. They are a very, very good team. We were fortunate to
beat them tonight. We were fortunate to beat them the other two times. They
cause a lot of problems. They're very well-coached. They've got players that
can create -- and tonight probably being tired affected them more than us
because of their quickness and their speed. But they are a very, very good
team. They played an unbelievable schedule. I mean, Jeff's not afraid to play
anybody. He's always been that way. And I think it's made his team improve and
that. I really hope they get the opportunity because they will represent this
conference very, very well.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Elaine Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15524)

### [Kim Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14523)

### [Shona Thorburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16288)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and begin with the University of Utah. Joining
me on stage head coach Elaine Elliot, Kim Smith, Shona Thorburn, Joh-Teena
Felipe. Coach, if you want to make some opening remarks._  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, I thought it was a good hard-played game, very
physical. Both teams, you know, really I thought got after it. Vegas has a
great athletic team and they pose a lot of problems on the glass. And the
second half, that got away from us. The first half, we weren't talking about
so many of the boards and second chances and possessions. And second half we
were having to talk about the possession game and the fact this they had too
many. So, it's a good win for us.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions directed to any of the student threats._  
Q. Shona, you spent a lot of the game guarding Sheena Moore. What was the
key to holding the her down and the rest of the shooters?  
SHONA THORBURN: They're so quick and athletic. And the fact that Sheena can
pull up and shoot on a dime and elevate over you. She's a tough assignment.
And I think we did a great job of holding them to a low shooting percentage
and did a good job of staying in front and getting a hand up on them.  
Q. Shona, can you talk a little bit about what happened in the second half
and how you were able to broke the game open?  
SHONA THORBURN: I think we came out strong and we had a couple quick baskets.
We were aggressive and we pushed it on them. And I don't think we gave them,
the first part of the second half, a loft second-chance points, which that's
where they really excel. We did a good job controlling the boards, one and out
for them, and hitting our open shots.  
Q. Kim and Shona, can you maybe both address the fact that you haven't won a
Mountain West tournament yet, and you got two now, and just what would it mean
to you to win this thing?  
KIM SMITH: It would mean a lot to win it. Every year, well, for the last two
years, we've kind of had to watch the celebration, and then nervously and
anxiously await the selection show. And it would be great to turn things
around this year and know, especially now since you have to wait until Monday,
that you're going to go to the tournament.  
SHONA THORBURN: I want to know what it feels like to cut down the nets.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies we'll let you go. Thanks very much._  
_Questions directed to Coach Elliot._  
Q. Could you just talk about the rebounding. They did seem to get a lot of
offensive boards, you're able to withstand that and win the game?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: It's just a difficult task. They're pretty relentless on
the glass when they have that mindset. That's why Joh is in there. We needed a
better presence on the boards, and she did that for us. You could kind of see
that physically she matches up well in that regard. So, it's just one of the
things that you know can be a factor. Today it didn't end up being so. That's
fortunate for us.  
Q. Coach, the big delay in the first half, obviously unusual situation
especially in a game like this. I guess what are you telling the girls during
that and how do you keep the team focused?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, I asked that they talk a little basketball while
they're on the bench, just maybe not the things they sometimes talk about when
they get together, just to try to keep focused. You don't get upset. It's just
a situation. There's nothing you can do. No better or worse for anybody. You
get ready to play again.  
We wanted to sort of start that as almost like the start of the game again. We
got quite ready to play. We did well. Came out of the blocks early in the
game. That was the about the only added piece of information, was like, new
game, let's go.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about holding them to 29 percent shooting and also
your feelings about breaking through and winning a tournament tomorrow
maybe?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, I always think that when you have a low shooting
percentage, it's just -- I never believe it's only on one end of the floor or
one side of the game. You hope it's because you are getting a hand up and
there's not a lot of open things. Usually obviously you wouldn't be giving up
transition baskets, uncontested kinds of things on the full court. Those
things lead to high-percentage shooting.  
At the same time, everybody looks back on a poor shooting tonight and can
attest to saying there's plenty of those shoots we would take again. We don't
take full credit and we don't feel like it wasn't a part of our effort as
well.  
The tournament, well, I mean, you'd love to have the kids experience that.
It's the one thing in my mind unfortunate about the difference between regular
season and the regular tournament, because the regular season is something
that we really believe in, and trying to put that body of work together to be
able to be in an NCAA tournament no matter what happens at these three-day
deals.  
But this is that, you know, exciting thing where people are cutting down nets.
And so you very seldom get to do that as a regular-season champion. In that
way it's an experience that's fun to have. And I would love certainly if that
happened for our kids. That's most of it.  
Q. Second game in a row you got a nice contribution late from a freshman.
After Perry was in trouble, Felipe came up big. Can you comment?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: It was nice. She's learning. She played within herself
tonight. She did what she can do really well, which is big body to board,
didn't press things on offense, let it come to her. She is very talented, and
it will be very good. First of all, she's ready to play. When you have kids
that aren't playing every game and are playing in certain situations, if their
head is not there, if there's self-pity, concern about what's happened in the
past, they're not going to step on the floor and do what she did. She's to be
commended for having her head in the game and ready to go.  
Q. Coach, will you stick around and check out this game and?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Yes, there's a lot -- we'll watch the game, and try to
watch with some purpose. You don't know until it's over what's going to happen
or who it's going to be. It's just as good to do that as to go sit in the
hotel. The kids will go to dinner and the coaching staff will think about the
game and meet up later after dinner and try to get focused for tomorrow.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach._  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Thank you.

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Ashley Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16397)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Adrianne Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16393)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Joined now by TCU head coach Jeff Mittie, Adrianne Ross and
Ashley Davis._  
_Coach, if you want to begin with some comments on the game._  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Well, I thought that the start that we got was almost the
exact opposite of the start we had against Wyoming. We dug ourselves such a
hole, and BYU was certainly -- defensively they were excellent today. We did
not get many open looks. We tried to speed the game up, and that's where we
had success. But the bottom line is we got fatigued and we had trouble keeping
the intensity and keeping the pace up enough to get them out of control.  
And credit goes to BYU. I thought they played excellent today. They are an
excellent basketball team. They've been a tough match for us all year. Kubik
was outstanding today. We did a good job on Anderson, but in doing a good job
on Anderson, Kubik was able to get us low and she was the difference in the
game today. The credit goes to their team. They did an excellent job of
getting the basketball where they needed to in critical times when we were
making runs at them.  
_THE MODERATOR: Open questions directed to student-athletes._  
Q. Can you talk about when did on defense. How did that keep you out of
sorts in the first half and going on the second?  
ASHLEY DAVIS: We talked about how they like to run a lot of help towards the
ball, and they kind of stopped their penetration early. We just really went in
the game focusing on (indiscernible) passes and moving the ball getting and
getting on different sides of the floor.  
Q. For each of you as well, just how do you feel about your NCAA tournament
chances at this point?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Well, at this point I think that we did all we can do. We had a
good couple last couple of games, and we're fighting hard. And it's always our
goal, primary goal, to go to the NCAA. Now we did our part and we can just
keep our fingers crossed.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ashley, do you want address the same question._  
ASHLEY DAVIS: That's definitely been a goal since the beginning of the season.
We're going to take a couple of days off and enjoy the last couple of weeks we
had. We ended really strong and just feed off of that and see what happens.  
Q. Can you talk about how they were able to get the ball inside that was a
little bit of difference in the game?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Definitely. We put a lot of our effort into stopping Ambrosia
which you have to do. Then they went to plan B, which is Kubik. And they did a
good job of getting into her. We were unfortunate trying to stop. And she's a
big body and she is solid and she did a great job tonight.  
Q. Do you guys feel like with the schedule you guys played that will benefit
you as far as the selection committee is looking at all y'all's resume?  
ASHLEY DAVIS: Hopefully that will help us as team. Personally we know that's
made us a stronger team, playing the top-notch teams that are out there. I
mean, in our minds it's definitely helping us. Hopefully it will help that
committee deciding if we make it or not.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Not only like the tough games that we had before conference.
You know, our conference is pretty tough. It is really solid and we impressed
by the switch-over. That ought to benefit us as well, playing teams like
Wyoming, New Mexico, UNLV, BYU three times. So we'll see from there.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. We'll let you two go. Questions for coach._  
Q. Can you talk about what you did on Anderson today how that fed over to
them getting Kubik involved?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Well, we denied her the ball, we denied some touches, but
when you do that certain times on the floor you're not going to be able to run
as much help. And BYU does a great job of moving it. They ran some good stuff
against us to get some mismatches down there. A couple times when we were
switching, they ran, you know, pretty simple guard-to-post screen and got her
not against her post but against a guard. And it's pretty simple but they
executed it very well. And they were quick with it. Timing is a big issue in
that. And they had excellent timing today when they did those things today.  
Q. Can you talk about their defense and what they were able to do?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Well, I felt like we were sluggish early and felt like the
ball movement and player movement was going to be critical. And early in the
game we weren't getting either. We would skip it but then everybody would
watch the skip pass and stand so we weren't getting active after we moved the
ball.  
We went to the press because we needed that game, I wanted to get BYU
scrambling some. I wanted to get the floor more open. Unfortunately we made
some runs, but we also made some turnovers that allowed them to get the game
back in the half court.  
So when you fall behind like that and you need the game in a different speed,
we did what we could and then I thought we got fatigued down the stretch. And
Kubik continued to make basket after basket. She's big and strong down there.
I mean, I -- I'm not sure -- I'm not sure we could play her the same way with
what they were allowing her to do. Is that correct enough without getting me
in trouble?  
Q. Could you also assess your NCAA tournament possibilities and do you feel
like you belong?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Well, I am -- the way I look at it is when you put the RPI
numbers, that's based off the toughest schedule. I didn't create the formula.
I just put together a schedule that would match up with people in the country.
And you put together 18 wins and you have the last couple weeks that we've
had, I feel good about our chances. And I feel very deserving.  
I think the thing that has been outstanding, and I'll get to this, Adrianne
touched on it a little bit, is that the league has been so good this year.
It's not just about non-conference scheduling; it's about the quality of games
we got within the league. Because the top 6 teams in this league, we played 14
games against those, and those are all RPI inside the top 60. That's a lot of
games inside the top 60.  
I like our chances. I'd love to have two more wins because I'd be sitting
there on Monday and then I'd be worried about where we're going. I guess now
I'll be less picky. We'll see TCU come up on the board. So, I hope so. We
finished -- we finished third in the regular season. We get to the semis here.
I think our league is deserving of 4, 5 bids. I feel like we're definitely in
there.  
Q. Are you not nervous about it?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: I'm nervous. I'm nervous every year. I was nervous when we
had the automatics because then they put you in the last bracket, and you're
going, is there any chance they have forgotten? Or somebody -- so, no, I'm
always -- this one will be, because of where we came from, I think we finished
so strong though. The way our schedule is set up for us, we knew it was going
to be really tough down the stretch, but that should be a benefit come
committee time. They want to see good wins down the stretch where we beat Utah
on the road, who doesn't get beat there very often. We come home, beat a very
good UNLV team. We beat an excellent Wyoming team. And then we ran up against
the team that's proven to be the best team in the league all year long.  
Q. How is Vanessa?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: You know, I don't know. Did you ever have won of those
little operation games when you were a kid and you couldn't touch the sides?
That's how Vanessa -- we got an elbow injury, we have a head injury, and she's
got an ankle. She's banged up. I was nervous it was a knee, you know. And you
see that a lot in women's basketball. But it's the ankle, and my guess is it's
going to be a pretty good ankle sprain for 3, 4, 5 days.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Good luck Sunday._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Nejlah Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16395)

### [Regina Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13838)

### [Brittney Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14521)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with UNLV, joined by head coach Regina Miller,
Nejlah Clark and Brittney Thomas. Coach, if you want to just begin with some
general comments._  
COACH REGINA MILLER: Well, I thought we didn't play well enough obviously to
beat this team this afternoon. We probably, when I think of 40 minutes in a
ball game, we probably played, I don't know, 12, 15 minutes total. Obviously
that's not enough to beat a very good team, disciplined Utah team.  
But I thought two guards battled really hard two of the senior guards and,
that's why I brought them in with me today, and that is Nejlah Clark and
Brittney Thomas. You can't come out in a game with only six assists and a lot
more turnovers, in order to have again a success against a team like Utah. If
you don't score at the offensive end, they're going to find a way to score win
their motion. They move a lot. You don't catch them standing very often, other
than when the ball is dead. So they beat us a couple times on some back
screens and some dribble penetration to the basket. And that really hurt us,
and we didn't score when they scored.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks coach. Questions for the es._  
Q. For the two players, what was the problem making shots today? Very simple
question. Is there a simple answer?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: I'll say specifically rhythm, not being in the rhythm, in the
flow of the game. In the beginning it's hard. You try to find a rhythm, get
going. And as time goes on, you start to think more about your shot.  
And I think that's -- had a lot to do with our some of players. And also
forcing shots. Instead of shooting directly in the flow of our offense, we put
up some forced shots, some tough shots, which hurt us in the end.  
Q. Nejlah, you came in that first half and kind of gave the Rebels some
enthusiasm and tenacity on defense. Talk about your playing today?  
NEJLAH CLARK: I think it was important for me to come out and give intensity
on defense because I think that's what our team needed at the time. The team
seemed down on defense. I felt whenever I was going to get in, I was going to
give them whatever they needed at that time, whether it was defense, whether
its was rebounding, just someone talking to them. I tried to make sure that
transferred to them.  
Q. Maybe for both of you athletes. It seems like intensity wasn't there in
the second half. I know Utah, they changed the pace of the game a bit. I
didn't see that second half like you guys had in the first half. Do you agree
or what was the difference?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: I'll agree. I believe, like you said, when Nejlah came in, we
dictated the flow of the game. We made some stops but didn't necessarily
convert on all of them. As the second half came around we didn't dictate as we
did in the first half. And it showed. It really did show. And it was a come-
out. It came out like that.  
Q. For both players, both young players in this program. How important is it
to be hopefully playing next week to continue your development? How important
will playing somewhere next week, whether it's in the NCAA or the NIT, be for
both of your development?  
NEJLAH CLARK: I think it's very important. Hopefully we're playing in the NCAA
tournament next week. I think that's the key right there. I hope the selection
committee look at our games and see the losses we had, we was in all of these
games. And we didn't play Rebel basketball. It's not like we lost playing
Rebel basket. We lost because we beat ourselves.  
Q. From a development standpoint, is it important to get more court time
more advanced experienced playing?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: Definitely. We're seniors. We want to go out strong for the
youth. It's important for them to get a taste of it. And maybe next year or
the years to come with Coach Miller, they can go to the tournament, so be it,
and be successful.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you two go. Thanks very much._  
_Questions for Coach Miller._  
Q. Do you fully expect to be playing next week somewhere, someplace?  
COACH REGINA MILLER: Yes. Definitely.  
Q. Have you done enough to maybe get an at-large NCAA bid even though you
lost today or does this put you in a precarious bubble position?  
COACH REGINA MILLER: You know, our league is strong enough. The last time we
went to the NCAA tournament, they took four teams. So, to take 'chance' out
the picture, it would have been nice to somehow pull off -- I guess it would
have been considered another upset against Utah today and get ourselves into a
championship game, to try to win that. And that's only the way to take chance
out, obviously win it and play your way in. Without two wins against New
Mexico, being a top 25 team, within a week I would think the selection
committee will look at our league overall and see, geez that's a strong
league.  
There's a lot of competitive teams. I felt all along, any one of six of us
could win this tournament. And today we simply didn't play well enough to beat
Utah. So, you certainly hope so that we'll be playing next week, and perhaps
we'll maybe get four or five teams into the NCAA tournament. Other leagues
have done it. If I'm not mistaken, I think we're ranked either fifth or sixth
out of 32 conferences, and that's pretty good. I would be concerned if we were
10, 11 or 12.  
Q. Why was it such a problem making shots today from your perspective?  
COACH REGINA MILLER: Yeah, well, I thought we missed a lot of chippers around
the basket, some layups. Some were with contact but you have to finish through
contact. We practiced all year with contact drills, and you got to be able to
finish and make the play. And hopefully the official will blow the whistle.
And if they do, it's a bonus. I thought we missed some chippers.  
I thought we gave up some easy looks within our offense, slow jump shots, and
created a tougher shot for ourselves by overpenetrating. As BT said, we didn't
really have any rhythm in what we were doing offensively. As a coach that's a
bit frustrating because you're on the side and you can't really control that.  
I thought a key point in the game for us is that we battle to take the lead
late in the first half, and then we lost that last segment going into the
half. It was about three minutes and 45 seconds to go, and we just didn't
perform. I inserted Nikki Hitchens. We missed some key check-outs. I thought
Utah was able to keep the momentum or hurt us. We worked hard, you know, 27
seconds per session, and then you give up the offensive board. You miss a
check-out, and that hurt.  
Coming out the half, we were only down 3 regardless. We had the ball and
didn't -- we had two possessions where we didn't score and had an opportunity,
and then they came down and scored I think two possessions. To me that's like
an eight-point swing.  
Q. Why has this team had trouble putting together 35 minutes of intense
basketball?  
COACH REGINA MILLER: Well, we have going down the stretch here. I really felt
like we're peaking at the right time. And we put together, I thought, 39
minutes at TCU. You lose on point-nine-tenths of a second because of offensive
rebounding get you into overtime with 3 starters out. But we bounced back. I
thought we played very tough again against New Mexico, and that was probably
our best team effort in the last five or six games, was against New Mexico. We
needed that type of effort today and it didn't happen.  
It's tough. Sometimes you just can't put your finger on it. If so, I probably
would have written a book by now and be a millionaire.  
Q. Can you talk about the job Sequoia did?  
COACH REGINA MILLER: I thought Kameca did an outstanding job on her. Sequoia
Holmes did okay. She probably struggled because she pressed because she wanted
to do so well against Kim. But overall I thought Kameca Simmons did a nice
job, but then Thorburn stepped up and hurt us. Those players played 40 minutes
a game consistently all year. They're the heart and soul of Utah. And they
really stepped up today. And Thorburn I thought late in the second half,
actually midway to late in the second half, she really took over the game. And
she took over the game either by setting her teammates up or dribble
penetrating herself and making some plays around the basket. She ended up with
8 assists. We can't give that up to her.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH REGINA MILLER: The last time we had something like that, McCracklin went
down in Wyoming. And that was an injury. We didn't take a warm-up, we ended up
losing by three. We probably lead the majority of that game at Wyoming. We
wanted to get some warm-up time.  
Things like that happen. You just got to adjust and you know go with the flow.
We actually were able to come back and take a lead at that point. Again, like
I said, we just didn't perform well going into the half. That last segment of
the half really hurt us. But still we had an opportunity coming out the half;
we just didn't take advantage of that. Against a good team, you can't go too
many possessions and not execute. It will hurt you every time.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach._

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Sherry McCracklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16389)

### [Regina Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13838)

### [Sheena Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14529)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with UNLV. Joined by head coach Regina Miller,
student athletes Sherry McCracklin and Sheena Moore._  
_Coach, if you just want to begin with some general comments, then we'll open
it up for some questions._  
COACH REGINA MILLER: I'm really proud of the lady Rebels this afternoon and
the efforts we put on the floor. Our goal was to really guard the three-point
line. New Mexico is an outstanding three-point shooting team. We knew they
would stretch our defense. We wanted to try to take some chances with
difficult on Marsh inside. She certainly made some plays. I'd rather give up a
two contested over a three. That's a little less.  
I thought we did an excellent job overall of guarding the three-point line. We
made some plays down the stretch. New Mexico made a run at us in the second
half, took the lead by one. I was hoping that was their run for the game
'cause we really stepped it up at that point. Our defensive intensity really
paid off. We got some deflections and steals, were able to get out on the open
court, finish the game.  
_THE MODERATOR: At this point we'll open it up for questions directed to the
student-athletes._  
Q. Sheena, could you take a moment and talk about Faye Muller? She had a
couple huge rebounds, which both resulted in baskets.  
SHEENA MOORE: Faye is able to use her size with her height. She's long and
she's skinny. She's able to use her height and weight to get around. Most
people who try to box her out, it's hard to make contact with her because
she's light on her feet. Got a couple rebounds, tipped it out, a couple
important tips. She was just solid for us today.  
Q. Sherry, they hit a three-pointer about five and a half minutes left,
which gave them a two-point lead. You didn't allow a field goal the rest of
the way. What was the difference, the key to your defense down the stretch?  
SHERRY McCRACKLIN: Well, when they hit that three, that personally was my man.
We went to a timeout. My coach was like, "That's it for them, they're getting
no more threes. If anything, they need to earn it." We took that to heart and
just said, "If we lose this game, we're going to lose it on our own. No
threes, nothing easy." We just took everything to heart and said, "We're not
going to let them hit any more shots on us."  
Q. People on press row referred to this as an upset. Do you think of it as
an upset?  
SHERRY McCRACKLIN: Personally, I don't, even though they are a ranked team. We
just beat them last week. We knew coming into this game, there was going to be
a lot of intense (sic). They're ballers, just like we're ballers. They're
players, just like we're players. We don't look at them as rank teams or
nothing like that. We just look at them as another team we need to go out and
beat. That's why I don't consider this an upset.  
SHEENA MOORE: Technically, if you want to look at it from that standpoint,
they're ranked above us. It would be an upset from that standpoint.  
But, of course, now we didn't look at it that way. They're a team. We just
beat 'em, what, last week. We knew we could beat 'em. We just had to come out
and play this game. We knew that this tournament, everybody starts out with a
clean slate. It doesn't matter what you did before. One loss and you're gone.
It doesn't really matter what record or what you were ranked before.  
Q. Sheena, because you guys did beat them so recently, did that give you
either more confidence or some better ideas of what you could do against them
coming into this game?  
SHEENA MOORE: Yeah. Since we played them so recently, we knew exactly what to
expect. We had confidence going in since we had won the last game against
them.  
Yeah, we just came in with a lot of confidence and ready to play, ready to
beat 'em.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll let you two go. Coach, stick around for a minute. At
this point, questions directed to Coach Miller._  
Q. About Faye, a lot of times players can make a presence on a stat sheet,
sometimes they don't. She finished with seven rebounds today. What a
performance she gave you at key times.  
COACH REGINA MILLER: I thought Faye came up huge at that point. I went with
her in the second half. I didn't start her at the beginning of the game. But I
thought she was playing well enough that I needed to stick with her, and it
paid off.  
Faye is an outstanding rebounder. She has a nose for the ball. She does a nice
job anticipating where the shot might come off. She's probably our best
overall rebounder, Sherry is probably our most aggressive rebounder.  
It really helped us today.  
_THE MODERATOR: Other questions?_  
COACH REGINA MILLER: You're too easy on me.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach._  
COACH REGINA MILLER: I'd like to make one last comment. I know we talk about
rankings and so on. New Mexico is an outstanding program. They have an
outstanding team, an outstanding program.  
For our program, it was a great win for us today because, as I said, they
worked all year to get to the point that they're at. Obviously they'll
continue to play into post-season. It's just a matter of their seeding.  
Outstanding players. I think Dionne Marsh is one of the top players in the
west. They have some of the best three-point shooters we've ever played
against. Again, this was a great win for our program. Certainly it will give
us confidence going into our game against Utah.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Natasha Lacy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16392)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Adrianne Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16393)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and begin with TCU, joined by head coach Jeff
Mittie, Natasha Lacy and Adrianne Ross._  
_Coach, would you begin with some general comments._  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: First off, I want to congratulate Wyoming. They've got a
great basketball team. Joe's team, he's done a fantastic job with them.  
We knew that the lead that we had was not safe because of how they play. We
held -- we did such a great job defensively early in that game. I felt like if
offensively we could continue to score, that would be key because I knew their
offense wasn't going to remain at, I think they were at 12% first half.  
All in all, pleased with the victory. We've had three great games with
Wyoming. This was just another one of those.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions directed to the student-athletes._  
Q. Do each of you guys feel like this maybe solidifies you for an NCAA
tournament bid? Most people say the Mountain West is going to get four bids.  
NATASHA LACY: I really don't think anything solidifies us for the NCAA bid
unless we win the tournament. We're not counting on this win or any other win
in the past. If we win the tournament, that's an automatic bid. We'll get in
the tournament.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: And I agree (smiling).  
Q. Did you think your steal pretty much solidified the win?  
NATASHA LACY: Again, I wouldn't say it solidified it, but, I mean, it was kind
of a back-breaker. They're excellent shooters. Any given day or any given
time, they can hit a couple threes and get right back in it.  
Q. Was that one of your better defensive games?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: I definitely say the first half was. I know we came out second
half not as we wanted to. We wanted to come out just like we did the first
half.  
Doing such a great job in the first half, it helped us out in the second, gave
us a little cushion. So, yeah, definitely the first half.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Coach, stick around for a few
minutes._  
_Questions directed to Coach Mittie._  
Q. What does it do for you as far as the NCAA tournament is concerned?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Well, I don't know what it does for us. We beat another
quality team, another quality win down the stretch. We've had a pretty good
stretch run here.  
As you know, my thought process on this is that we want to win a Mountain West
conference tournament championship. So, our focus is on that.  
I believe that our league, and I'll talk about the league, I believe that this
league has six teams that could be deserving of a bid. Now, nobody thinks
we're going to get six, and I understand that. But four to five, I think, is
reasonable.  
I think we've got to be careful across the country. In my opinion, when we've
been in the past, and you look at teams that have made it, RPI-wise, our
league is very strong. Wyoming is very deserving of a very good look here.  
So, I think that our league's going to sit very well at the end of this. But I
don't know necessarily what it does for us. I think it's another good quality
win. As you know, we've played a very, very difficult schedule. Hopefully
we're reaping the benefits of playing that difficult schedule now with some
victories.  
Q. Talk about Natasha's play down the stretch.  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: She was frustrated early in the early part of the second
half. We set her down a little bit. We felt like we could get her inside on
the post. That's what we wanted to do.  
She came back in and really was assertive. I thought our team did a great job
of getting her in the low block. You mentioned the steal at the end, I thought
the steal was huge. Three-point play, finish it off, allows us to do some
things differently defensively. Really puts the pressure on them.  
So, yeah, her play down the stretch was critical. We really went to her on
every possession. She was an option the last four minutes.  
Q. How does that compare to how you have been doing this season?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Compared to how we've been doing this year (smiling)?  
Q. Yes.  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: We have not defended the three very well. That's the nicest
way I can put it. That was the best defense we've played on the perimeter year
long. I think we're eighth in the league at defending the three. I think we
have good perimeter quickness. We haven't coached it very well, obviously.  
This team really played well tonight. I thought they came in. I mean, we were
all over Zavecz all night long. That's a very good player to hold 1-14. She
got a lot of rebounds. We made Bolerjack work for her nine points. They really
Taylor attacked us in the post, but we were willing to allow some one-on-one
play down there as long as they didn't hit the big play on the perimeter. I
thought our team really executed a good game plan. They made a game plan look
very good.  
Q. Did you see anything defensively, because you had Wyoming frustrated in
the perimeter, did you see something on film going into the game?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Well, I wouldn't say -- we made some changes defensively.
What we're doing is we're switching a lot of those motion screens. Wyoming and
Utah use a lot of those flair screens, they use a lot of slip screens. We were
having trouble defending that, staying with our player.  
Now, the disadvantage of that is that when they get a mismatch on the
perimeter with Zavecz on like Lohse, we've got to do a better job of helping.
I think our team has grown in that defense. We made that switch about maybe
halfway through conference. We're really just now only in about our fourth or
fifth week doing it, so we're really starting to play it pretty well.  
I'll say this, another thing, too. Our first year in the league, we've got to
get a feel for some of these. Hopefully we're getting a little better feel for
some of the talent in this league, because this is a very talented league.
Zavecz and Bolerjack, both times they've really hurt us. We did a good job on
them tonight.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Ellen Jaeschke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16387)

### [Ardie McInelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13836)

### [Alecia Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16386)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Air Force Academy head coach Ardie McInelly,
Alecia Steele, Ellen Jaeschke._  
_We'll open it up with general comments from the coach on the game._  
COACH ARDIE McINELLY: Well, we just got beat by a really good team. I'm
extremely proud of our players. I'm proud of what we've done this year, how
far we've come. We're certainly not satisfied. We think that with the youth we
have on our team, we can hopefully do better next year.  
But it's a great start for us. University of Utah has an awesome group of
young women that play for them. Kim Smith was just outstanding today. I mean,
we tried to switch on every screen. We would just fall asleep just for a
second and she'd be behind us and already scored a basket. She's just an
incredible player.  
Shona Thorburn, the same. She does a very good job of distributing the ball. I
thought one of the key plays today, I thought Jessica Perry stepped up and had
a nice game for them. Elaine Elliott, she's a woman who I admire greatly, and
I want to wish her and her team the best of luck. Hopefully we can, you know,
keep our players together and continue to grow and become a team like
University of Utah or a team like New Mexico. I mean, those people at the top
of the conference, that's what our players are striving to do. I think that we
can do that.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions directed to either of the student-athletes._  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how far you think you've come this season
and just the fact that you got everybody coming back next year.  
ALECIA STEELE: I think we've come a very long way this season. We've improved.
We have more confidence. We've worked together to build our program. We're
looking forward to next season so that we can do more, we can achieve more.  
ELLEN JAESCHKE: I'm happy. I'm not happy that we lost, but I'm happy because
we know we have everyone coming back. We just have so much potential. We're
going to really come out and show everyone what's up next year. I'm really
excited.  
Q. Elaine was in here and really gave you a lot of praise, said that this is
not an Air Force team that you can just put that W on the schedule. It has to
really feel good to accomplish what you've accomplished this year, but also
you have to be thinking that you can be better. Could you talk about that.  
ELLEN JAESCHKE: Yeah, like I said before, I'm real excited for next year. We
have everyone coming back. We're just all coming together right now, we're
starting to click. It's just going to be a great year next year. Teams can
think we're the underdogs and come out and kick their butts (smiling).  
Q. Ellen, you had your high game of your career today. Seemed like you were
able to get inside against Utah, who is one of the better teams. Talk about
that.  
ELLEN JAESCHKE: Well, the last two games against Utah, I did absolutely
nothing probably. But this game, I think the guards did a great job of getting
us the ball inside. It was just overall good. I was seeing the basket. Coach
has been yelling at me all season, and finally was just making my layups and
putting them in, so...  
_THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Ladies, we'll let you
go. At this point, questions directed for Ardie._  
Q. A couple years ago I remember Joe Legerski sitting in that same seat.
They were going through about the same thing as you. Could you make any
analogies between their program and your program? Seems like you're on the
same sort of path as they were three or four years ago.  
COACH ARDIE McINELLY: I just wish we had as good shooters as Joe has at
Wyoming. His players can shoot the lights out. We kind of struggle from there.  
I just think, you know, whenever you recruit, you're in a program, especially
at the academy, you have to start from the bottom up. I've said this many
times before, we can't get a quick fix. We can't get a foreigner. We have to
start with freshmen. That means no junior colleges and no one from out of the
United States. So, we have to start with freshmen. We have to try to go out
and convince young women to come to the Air Force academy, the ones that maybe
someone overlooked or maybe there was something about that player that just
didn't make it, you know, was recruited by someone else.  
You have to have a vision when you recruit. Hopefully you can then develop
those players. That's what we're doing. We're finally developing the players
that we've recruited. That's why we're so young. We have lots of freshmen,
sophomores and juniors. We have no seniors. That's been all because of the
recruiting.  
It is going to take us longer. I think that we have a great start. Like you
said, Joe was that way a couple years ago. He's watched his players develop
and become a very good shooting team. We've got some pieces of the puzzle
still to put together, but I think that we're on our way.  
As I said before, the important thing for us is for our players to stay
together. Again, I don't mean to say woe is me, but at the academy they can
leave their freshman and sophomore year and there is no penalty. You have to
continue to recruit them. You not only recruit them to get there, once they're
there, you continue to recruit them. It's not until they become a junior that
you can finally relax on that person.  
It's a very difficult place to go to school academically. It's very
challenging. Militarily, there are so many things they have to do. Our job is
extremely difficult. So, with all that in mind, I'm hoping and praying that we
can continue to keep this group of people. I know that both Ellen and Alecia
are key members of that. I feel very confident in them. If we can keep the key
people, I don't know, I guess I shouldn't say this, but you know what, I
wouldn't know if it's next year or the year after that, we could win this
thing. That's our goal. We tell our players, "You better have a goal." I think
as a coach, I have to have a goal as well.  
So, sorry about the soapbox.  
Q. Could you talk about five or six years ago, there was a feeling, there's
no way the Air Force men's basketball program could ever compete in this
conference, win a conference title, go to the NCAAs. Has that helped, the fact
they've come up and established themselves as a contender in this
conference?  
COACH ARDIE McINELLY: Well, I think it does. I think it helps all programs
because the cadets at the academy see firsthand someone being successful,
someone doing something that can't be done. You know, you have a young man
named Antoine Hood that leads the way, the charge. He not only leads the men's
basketball program, but he leads the cheers at the football. He started a
section, what is it, Section 8.  
The guy is unbelievable. He's contagious. His enthusiasm is contagious. I
think our players, Letricia Castillo, she's the same way for us. It's a very
close-knit family group at the academy. I think because of the success our men
have had, thanks to Joe Scott and Chris, all those people, it makes it easier
for our players to see that, yes, it can happen.  
Now we have Jeff Bzdelik leading the charge in the men's program. Who knows
what will happen.  
_THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Erin Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16394)

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Hanna Zavecz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16287)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Joined by University of Wyoming, head coach Joe Legerski,
Hanna Zavecz, and Erin Hicks._  
_Coach, begin with some opening comments._  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: I think this is a game where, you know, I talked to my
team early about trying to grow as a group. Sometimes you start winning games
throughout a season, and we had a tremendous season to be able to win 20
games, second time in school history. So you kind of get ahead of yourself.  
Then it steps up into tournament play. Once again, you realize how many
sophomores and freshmen you're playing with that are trying to learn at this
level. I thought TCU really came out strong, took the game to us. In the
second half, we were able to try to get it down, but they always seemed to
have an answer once we get it to three or five points.  
_THE MODERATOR: Let's open it up for questions for the next few minutes
directed to the student-athletes._  
Q. Erin, early on you guys were struggling shooting. How much of that do you
feel maybe you had some nerves or tightness going, how much do you think it
was shots not falling?  
ERIN HICKS: We were definitely nervous coming out tonight. Our focus wasn't
quite there at the beginning. We needed some shots to fall for us. They
weren't doing that in the first half.  
You know, we came out second half, had a little run there for us. We just
needed a couple more plays, a couple more shots to go for us.  
Q. Was some of that nerves the pressure, knowing that you had a chance for
an NCAA berth, that you really had to get this game in order to keep that
probably viable?  
ERIN HICKS: Yeah, nerves. You know, going to NCAA nerves. Mountain West
Conference tournament. Nerves, it's a good team. We knew that coming in here,
you have to win the first game to go on and play.  
So it was all, everything, coming into this game.  
Q. Hanna, talk about your night. You had 15 rebounds. You did everything
great. Unfortunately, the shots weren't falling. Did you concentrate on trying
to do other things at the same time?  
HANNA ZAVECZ: You know, I was just trying to make my shots. They just weren't
dropping.  
I think, I don't know, I thought my focus was there, but obviously that shows
in stuff like shooting around the basket. I just got out there and tried to
play my hardest, and I guess after a while there, my shots weren't dropping.
So I did try to focus on other things to help out the team, just try to get a
win, however I could.  
Q. When you fell behind, obviously you have shown the belly to come back all
year long like this. Was there something that said that you guys tried to
realize that you just take a little timing to get back in the game?  
HANNA ZAVECZ: Yeah, we go by a system of trying to win in four-minute lots. I
think that's a big part of our success in coming back when we're down by so
much just because we don't look at the bigger picture, we try to take little
steps towards it.  
So, yeah, that's what we've been doing all season. I guess we just didn't make
enough plays today.  
Q. Do you both feel like you are still deserving of an NCAA tournament bid?
If you are, would you sort of make your case right now for that bid.  
ERIN HICKS: You know, we'd like the NCAA bid. But anything we can get right
now is what we're going for. NIT would be great for our program. Anything we
could get is what we're going for.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. We'll open it up for questions for
coach._  
Q. How do you feel your NCAA status is now?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: You know, that's something that's not in our control. What
we talked about as a group, you have to make it as difficult as possible on
the committee. By doing that means you need to win basketball games.  
Once again, I think the talk for the last four or five weeks around Wyoming
has been that we've been playing almost at tournament level for that stretch
to get here. Over the last, I think it's 12 games now, only two teams have
defeated us. That's TCU and Utah. For this group, they have to play hard every
night to be able to compete.  
Once again, you know, whatever's going to happen post-season-wise will happen.
We just didn't make it as difficult as what we could have tonight.  
Q. Looking at tonight's game, one thing you always stress is just keep
shooting. Was it hard at all to convince Hanna and Jodi to keep shooting even
though it just seemed like there was a lid over the basket?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: When they got up 25 out of 59 shots, I think they're doing
what I ask of them. You know, that's our style. We're going to shoot that ball
and we're going to shoot a bunch of threes. We don't have, you know, the 6'2",
6'3" person inside to be able to play in the post. I thought Michelle Taylor
did an excellent job tonight. I thought she created the run in the second half
for us.  
We rely on being able to shoot from the perimeter. When you look at it, you
know, Erin Hicks kept us in the ballgame and gave us those opportunities. She
goes six of nine from the field, four of five from three. She's the only one
that made three-point shots for us tonight. You're not going to win very many
ballgames when we don't have more people step up on the offensive end.  
Q. When you got off the really rough start shooting, obviously TCU was
shooting lights out. The combination is always deadly. You came back and
played much better defense. Talk about your defense in the second half.  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: We've been able to challenge people all year and try to
get in a transition game where we get up and down the floor. I thought we were
able to do that in the second half. We had a chance to cut it to three, and we
missed the front end of a one-on-one. We then once again had it at six, got
the ball on at out-of-bounds play at point-blank range. We missed the lay-in
where we could have cut it to four.  
I think those things are more deflating to a team. I thought we played
aggressively, defensively. Hanna was big on the glass. She was not making
shots. We all know that. But to come up with 15 rebounds is completely
dominating one phase of the game. I was very pleased with that effort from
her.  
But we need her to score to win. There's only so many, I should say, runs you
in you to come back. I thought we did it when we cut it to five. We let it get
back up. We cut it again to six. We just needed to make a couple more plays.  
With a young group, hopefully we learn from this and in the future we're back
with, once again, 20 wins and being able to maybe get a win in the Mountain
West Conference tournament.  
Q. You have a very young team. What do you hope this experience tomorrow
will affect them in setting the tone for next season?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: What I really hope is that the young players understand
they still have to keep working. They want to get back in the gym. You cannot
just relax at this level. The Mountain West Conference, it's the best that
I've been associated with. I've been involved with these schools for roughly
20 years now. This level of competition has really stepped up. I feel we can
play with the best teams in this league. But you have to play at your best to
get wins in this league.  
I thought TCU played very well tonight. They made the big plays. Whenever we
did make a run, somebody for TCU had an answer. I just wish them the best of
luck as they continue playing.  
Q. Because you only have six or seven players really getting all the minutes
in these games, have you felt like maybe down the stretch the last couple of
games they've been gassed, they don't have the legs under them?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: We talk about that all the time. As you build a program,
it takes your recruiting classes to get everybody in place. I told the young
group in there today that I'm looking forward to the day when we're not
counting on freshmen or sophomores to do the bulk of the work.  
The kids work so hard to give themselves a chance to win. I've always been
taught that, you know what, you're going to ride your horse until your horse
can't go any more. I know we do that with Erin Hicks and Hanna. When you look
at it and there's 40, 39 and 38 minutes out of Jodi tonight as well, I just
think that's the best chance for us to win. And for those players, they
deserve that, even if all of a sudden we're out of energy at the end.  
Q. NCAA tournament aside, how would you encapsulate this season?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: I tell you what, if somebody would have caught me back in
September and said, You're going to get 20 wins and have the possibility of
post-season play, we would have advanced to March 8th. I wouldn't have worried
about anything else.  
That's the hard part. If it doesn't hurt to lose, then you have not invested
enough in what you're trying to do. I have a group of players over there that
they're investing in it. I have to try to remind them where we've moved this
program. We're going to keep this program going. We're going to keep building.
We really felt we were on a five-year plan. All of a sudden, we jumped way
ahead of schedule. We just got to try to keep them focused and keep getting
players in here to be able to contribute and compete. I don't see the Mountain
West Conference backing off in talent. We're going to have to just continue to
step up at Wyoming and do the best we can.  
Q. You mentioned you knew TCU would make runs in the second half, especially
Natasha Lacy, you contained her pretty well in the first half. What was she
doing in the second half, what were you doing in the second half?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: I think what ends up happening is great players make great
plays. You cannot sit there and count on the fact that at some point in time
they won't make plays.  
She creates huge problems for us because she has the ability to go inside and
post up your point guard as well as she can shoot the ball on the perimeter.
That's what you have, when you have somebody who has that kind of leadership,
to be able to step up. You know, we're looking at a TCU program, and I don't
know the numbers correctly, but I believe they've been in the NCAA tournament
the last five straight years. Now, if I've slighted them on that, I apologize
to TCU. But they're a veteran team that is used to winning and used to playing
at a very high level. That's what we're trying to get done at Wyoming.  
Q. Talk about your fans tonight.  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: Wyoming fans are the best around. When we started getting
on a roll, they kind of fell in love with this team. They would show up. When
you see how hard Erin plays and Hanna and the efforts they give every night,
you could hear the crowd. When we started making our run, they really got
behind their group.  
I think that energizes a team. I just feel for them as well because, you know,
they were hoping for a run here. If we're fortunate enough to be in post-
season play, I know the Wyoming fans will be there again for us. I think
that's something that is going to continue to grow because they definitely
have an effect on a basketball game. Once again, I can't say enough about the
Wyoming fans.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Don Flanagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13837)

### [Abbie Letz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16388)

### [Dionne Marsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14530)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Joined by University of New Mexico head coach Don Flanagan,
Abbie Letz and Dionne Marsh._  
_Coach, if you want to begin with some general comments._  
COACH DON FLANAGAN: First off, I thought UNLV played an excellent game,
exploited our weaknesses, put full-court pressure on us. And I thought they
kind of wore us down a little bit. Even though it did wear us down, we got to
even, then we got a little bit of a lead with just a little bit of time left
to go. Then all of a sudden, we just didn't complete the game.  
I thought one of the things that really hurt us was offensive rebounding. When
they got an offensive rebound, they scored off of it. Many times we defended
well right down to the end of the clock. They missed the shot. They got the
offensive rebound, then they finished a shot. I thought that really hurt us
because we worked real hard on defense. I thought we could have blocked out a
little bit better. We certainly didn't shoot very well from the three. I think
that really hurt us.  
_THE MODERATOR: At this point, questions directed to the student-athletes._  
Q. Abbie or Dionne, when did you feel like the game started to get away from
you?  
DIONNE MARSH: Uhm, like coach said, they really just exploited our weaknesses.
Blocking out was a little difficult for us today. That's one thing with this
kind of team you need to do. They may not always make their first shot, but
they crash the boards hard which shows they give tremendous effort. I think
that's what kept us from coming back, was just the blocking out. That happened
like late in the game.  
Everybody's just got to focus. It happens to everyone. We just have to take it
and learn from it.  
Q. Is it better to have gotten a different seed and not come in? You talk
about focus. Maybe you're used to not coming in and being so sharp at the
beginning. UNLV is a team you would think you would see later in the
tournament. Did that have any play in that?  
DIONNE MARSH: No, not really, because we've played everyone in this conference
before. We've gone over that. We've had scouting reports. We've heard it over
and over and over again what every single team does. You have to be ready to
play everyone. You can't say we want to play this one person first to get
momentum going. That's what you have to do as a team, take responsibility and
capitalize on the things you need to capitalize on.  
Q. Abbie, could you talk about the disappointment. You're used to coming in
here and rolling out of here with three victories.  
ABBIE LETZ: It's very disappointing. But it's something that happens. It
happened to us today. Yeah, it hurts. It's going to hurt for the rest of the
day. We know tomorrow's a new day. We've got to keep our heads up and hope the
NCAA realizes what we did in the preconference schedule and in the conference
and picks us.  
Q. Do you think it's going to hurt your chances with the tournament?  
ABBIE LETZ: Well, I mean, I don't think it's a positive on our resume for the
selection committee. But you never know. You don't know what they're looking
for this year. You don't know who has the automatic bids already and who has
at-large bids taken up; just have to see.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Coach, stick around for a minute.
Questions directed to Coach Flanagan._  
Q. They had four players in double figures. How hard is it to defend a team
like that?  
COACH DON FLANAGAN: The last time we played them, they shot over 50%. In the
first half they shoot 52 or 53%. I don't know what they finished with. It
seems like they shoot a very high percentage against us. Throughout the
season, they didn't do that.  
I think most of that is a result of their second shot, not necessarily their
first shot. One of the things I worried most about was their offense breaking
down and then them driving and hurting us with a drive, or them shooting and
hurting us with an offensive rebound.  
We only had two players that were in double figures. I thought the only player
that was really attacking their defense, well, Abbie was trying to, was Dionne
and Abbie. Those two players were attacking the defense. The rest of our
players were settling for 22, 23-foot three-point shots. I thought we had to
be more aggressive. It showed at their free-throw line. We only went to the
free-throw line, I think we shot two free-throws. You only shoot two free-
throws, that means either they're not seeing the fouls or you're not creating
fouling situations by attacking the defense.  
Q. On the defense side of the ball, it seemed like they were flying around,
getting to all your passes, creating havoc. Do you think they came out with
higher energy today?  
COACH DON FLANAGAN: Well, you know, I thought they tired actually. But you're
right, they did give -- I mean, their effort was very aggressive. I did think
they were tired. In retrospect, I think I should have called a timeout when we
drew it even. Then Dionne fouled out and she was our main player that was
scoring. I kind of lost an offensive weapon. I lost somebody that was actually
attacking their defense. That put us in a difficult position.  
We had to derive our scoring from moving the ball. We couldn't just get it
into one player. So when we did that, we had opportunities, but we just missed
those opportunities.  
But they were the better team today. I thought they were the better team. They
were more aggressive. When you look at the statistics, it was pretty darn
close in every statistic. I thought they out-rebounded the heck out of us, but
they really didn't. It was 13-12. But the ones they got, the rebounds they
got, the O boards they got, they really converted. They would get that rebound
and then make a second shot from a high-percentage shot. That's something that
we didn't do. When we got the rebound, we threw it back out and we couldn't
get a clean shot.  
Q. What kind of seed do you think you might get? Are you even going to worry
about that between now and Monday?  
COACH DON FLANAGAN: First of all, we have to be invited. That's not a given. I
think, personally, we've done enough, played a good enough preconference
schedule, then done well enough throughout the year, and we played many times
in the top 25. I think when you look at how the NCAA derives those
participants, they measure how many teams you played in the top 25, how you
did against them, how many teams you played in the top 50, how many teams you
played in the top hundred. With that being their formula, I don't think we're
going to miss the NCAA. I think we're going to be in.  
But at the same time it depends on who wins this tournament. It depends on how
they feel about us, you know, what they know about us. I'm hoping they know a
bit about us and they know a bit about our history because traditionally we've
been pretty strong. We've gone four years in a row. I'm hoping to make it
five.  
Q. You had some players get knocked around. Do you think the physical nature
of the game rattled some of your players?  
COACH DON FLANAGAN: We lift weights, too. All year long we've kind of been
banged up. I think that alone was hurt us a bit in our aggressiveness. I know
I've pulled back in practice. We have some aggressive drills that I just threw
out the window. I don't do them any more. For the last month, I've thrown all
the aggressive drills that I have out just because I have too many people that
are walking around or limping around or with injuries. So consequently, I
don't do it any more.  
Usually this time of the year, we're playing really physical with one another
to get ourselves ready. I think that hurt us a little bit because this was a
very physical team. They appeared to be a much stronger team than us I
thought, too. Yes, I agree with that.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach._  
COACH DON FLANAGAN: You're welcome.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Vanessa Espinoza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16384)

### [Sara Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14526)

### [Jen Warden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13833)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Now joined by Colorado State University head coach Jen Warden,
Sara Hunter and Vanessa Espinoza._  
_Coach, do you want to begin with some opening remarks._  
COACH JEN WARDEN: I thought we played -- it was funny because we didn't feel
like we played the greatest first 20 minutes of the game and yet we still went
into the locker room down 3. Obviously we were very optimistic about our
ability to cut down on our turnovers. We knew we had to being more physical
with the ball offensively if we were to be efficient offensively. And I think
we got overpowered and we got a little manhandled. Our turnovers ended up
being our demise.  
I felt like those first 20 minutes, even though we don't feel we played as
well as we have played or can play, we definitely battled. I'm proud of this
team. I'm proud of what we've done this year.  
_THE MODERATOR: For the next few minutes, questions directed to the student
athletes._  
Q. Sara, can you talk about the difference between this game and Fort
Collins, what BYU did to you defensively and tonight?  
SARA HUNTER: Really there was no difference. They stayed tight. It was just a
matter of, you know, first half, I was kind of feeling it and second half got
a little cold. But, I mean, I think we all came out and played hard both games
really. We didn't get a lot of, you know, balls to fall our way or calls, so
it happens.  
Q. Vanessa, if you could try to step back and look at this year, there were
obviously some games where you guys were right there and then certain games
that did not shake out right. Could you put your fingers on a couple of the
reasons why there was just some inconsistency in how things played out this
year?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: Oh that's a tough question.  
Q. Sorry.  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: You know at times we played really hard, at times we would
have lapses. I don't know really know what it was. I thought we came together
as a team very well each game. We improved every game. We just couldn't put
the finishing touch on things, whether it was defensive stops, you know,
rebounding or whatever. But I felt like this team improved every game, and I'm
very proud of this team.  
Q. For either of the players. As Jen said, you didn't feel like you maybe
played the greatest first 20 minutes, but nonetheless you were down by 3
coming out of the locker room. Did things kind of snowball there in the first
6 minutes of the second half?  
SARA HUNTER: The worst thing was just our turnovers. They came off really hot
right at the beginning, and we didn't respond well. So, I think when you get
down like that, it's hard to pick yourself back up. That was our biggest fault
I think.  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: We couldn't get stops. They were on a run. I think that was
the biggest thing. Defensively we couldn't get a stop.  
Q. Vanessa, Coach Judkins talked to you quite a bit after the game. Was that
kind of a thing where that's your last game and he's respecting you for your
years?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: You know, we don't really know each other, just from playing
against each other. He was asking me about my dad. His dad passed away last
year. And he just said, thoughts and prayers are with you, and just
congratulating the team and myself on our year. Just very nice.  
_THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Sara or Vanessa._  
Q. One more for Sara. Just going into next year, obviously losing three
seniors. There's some leaderships voids to fill in obviously. How do you view
this year personally from your standpoint? And then looking ahead to next
year, what are you expecting?  
SARA HUNTER: I know looking on paper, everyone thinks this year was a failure.
The three seniors brought so much heart to this team. It was such a pleasure
to play with them, and just to learn from Vanessa. She plays every game like
it's her last. And you know, every -- Melissa and Lindsay are the same way.  
Like you said, it's going to definitely be, you know, a spot that's hard to
fill. But I think we have a good class coming in. And, you know, we're just
hoping to keep building. I think every year is just going to get better here.
And coach said in the locker room, it starts with what these three seniors did
this year. I'm so sad. We'll miss you. But we're excited.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. I'll let you two go. Questions for Coach
Warden._  
Q. Jen, the fact that you guys had some foul trouble issues starting that
second half, I'm just wondering was it difficult to come out and maybe defend
as hard and be as aggressive as you had to be against a team like because
everybody knows the bench is short and it causes so much foul trouble causes
so much trouble. I was wondering if you thought that kind of set things into a
negative direction?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: Yes (laughter). That is difficult. I think in two phases
that's difficult for our team. One, obviously your best players have to be
thinking about their personal foul trouble because they have to be playing.
Second, you don't want to think about what might happen if those players can't
play anymore.  
It's no secret that depth has been an issue for us, and you never want a
player to feel like they can't make a play because they've got to stay in a
game. You're going to start to unravel at that point. And when you've got two
starters, Lindsay and Molly, that obviously have to be thinking that way
already in the first half, that doesn't mean good things.  
Q. Could you talk about the impact of Ambrosia Anderson for them and what
they did to Sara to not let happen what happened in Fort Collins?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: Ambrosia is a terrific player, and I really respect Coach
Judkins' way with her. It's almost an N BA style of coaching that he has with
her because not every shot is the most -- she's a terrific player, but she has
a lot of freedom. And because she has that freedom, she's become the player
that she is.  
Ambrosia wouldn't be nearly as effective if she clearly had to understand
what's right and what's wrong for 40 minutes. She just plays the game. It
comes to her. She feels it. And there's so much momentum that comes out of her
play I think because of that.  
And honestly, from her coming from where she was as a junior to where she is
as a senior, I think in large part the credit belongs to Coach Judkins and his
ability to give her so much freedom and confidence. That's really what's made
her the player that she is.  
Sara Hunter, we saw a lot more zone tonight. The zone we saw was an extremely
physical zone we were knocked off our tracks on our penetration. And when
you're knocked off your tracks on penetration, rarely do you have to draw two
defenders, and you have your teammate open. And I think the physicality of
their zone and the size of their zone left it a little more difficult than it
was in Fort Collins to free Sara up on screening situations. I thought that
was a good coaching move by Jeff again, and their ability to stay with that
while we had a -- you know, it's really ironic because that zone essentially
opened our middle, and it wasn't necessarily the most high-octane offense that
we had in the middle of the court at the time. But it silenced Vanessa, it
silenced Sara, and silenced Molly. And those players off of quick hits were
the ones that really gave us momentum in the first half.  
Q. When you look back three or four years from now, when you look back at
the season, what are you going to think about? How are you going to assess the
season, your first one?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: That's a great question. And the first thing that pops into
my head is what I told the players in the locker room. We will be a top 25
program. And it started with this year and it started with these seniors. And
everything that this program does is going to find its roots with LT and with
Diesel and with Vanessa. I know those seniors came into a program that was
highly ranked and, you know, dissipated through their years, but I want them
to feel that they're going to be part of something again that's going to rise
up in the conference and rise up in this part of the country as something
they're going to be extremely proud of because as a team we're extremely proud
of them.  
Q. With that in mind, going into next year, I know this team in its first
year obviously instituting a new system and a lot of new things to learn was
looking to kind of try and improve after each game. Going into next year, what
do you feel like this team needs to accomplish to get to that goal of
eventually being again a top 25 program?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: You know, I think the whole thing is recruiting and
development. And when you look at what Utah as done and what BYU has done and
what New Mexico has done, it's recruiting and development. It's ironic that we
played BYU because they're a very good example of a lot of things. He coaches
an extremely physical game and he recruits extremely physical players. And it
takes about three or four years for your personal style to be reflected in the
players that are recruited into the program and to build from that.  
Every time I see one of the top 25 teams in the conference, and the way they
move offensively and the way they screen and the way they defend, I look at
them and say that's a player that's been doing the same thing for three years.
I think in our case it's a Catch-22 in the ESPN world, you want everything
right away, and you want to go from a franchise program to the Super Bowl in
the first year. But in the college world, it takes recruitment, it takes
development, it takes patience, it takes a lot of love. And we're going to
cultivate this program and I think this year was the first part of it.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Jen._  
COACH JEN WARDEN: Thanks, you guys. I appreciate you being here.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Elaine Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15524)

### [Kim Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14523)

### [Shona Thorburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16288)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll begin with University of
Utah head coach, Elaine Elliott, Kim Smith and Shona Thorburn._  
_Let's begin with some general comments from Coach Elliott and then we'll open
it up to questions for the players, then finish up with questions for coach._  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, I just love what's happened to Air Force. I think
Ardie has done a great job. Their team is young, yet competing. The future's
bright. Gone are the days when that's anybody's automatic win.  
I just think they play hard, smart. She's got some nice kids. That was a good
game.  
_THE MODERATOR: At this point we'll open it up for questions directed to the
student-athletes._  
Q. Alluding to what your coach just said, could you talk about the progress
of the Air Force program over the past few years? I can remember a time when
this would have been a 55-point game.  
KIM SMITH: Yeah, I think in our freshman year, you know, it wasn't as much of
a game. It wasn't because they would ever stop competing. They've always been
a very tough team, always fought very hard until the end.  
They just have some really good players. They're really starting to work
together. It is a tough team and you have to come ready to play every time you
play them.  
SHONA THORBURN: Yeah, you know, like every team in the conference, we have a
lot of respect for them. You have to have respect going in or you're going to
be on the losing end against a team like them because they never give up.  
Their talent, just their overall play, we've been here four years now, has
just improved greatly.  
Q. You survived a scoreless stretch there towards the end of the first half.
Was that more Air Force doing something to stop you or was that a Utah thing?
What was going on there?  
KIM SMITH: You know, I think it kind of happens in every game. You'll go
through a stretch where people just aren't hitting shots. Unfortunately, it
was all five of us not hitting shots.  
I mean, if you watched it, we had a couple layups, even rollouts. It's just
kind of in the flow of the game. Whether it was them or us, I'm not really
sure.  
Q. Your thoughts on a potential match-up with New Mexico in the next
round.  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: We're not talking about who we're playing till we know
who we're playing.  
Q. How significant was your finish at the half with an 8-R-0 run?  
SHONA THORBURN: Definitely momentum going into the locker room. This game is a
momentum game. I think we did a good job of carrying that over into the second
half and competing.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Questions directed to Coach
Elliott._  
Q. Obviously Air Force has better players than they did, but what
specifically are they doing better than in past years?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, they have better players. That's always a great
job. She put together a great freshman class a year ago. Those are the kids.
There's at least four of them, if I'm not mistaken, Castillo, Jaeschke,
Findlay. It's just a great class. That's how you get it done.  
You get a class of kids or a couple, two kids that you really can then build
around. She's done that with those kids. That sophomore class is just more
talented. They've won more games because of it. There's no secret. It's about
the players.  
Q. Can you talk about your defense. It's always been the strength of your
team. Seemed like early in the game you had a lot of turnovers. Talk about the
significance of that.  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, you know, you just have to remember what that does
to a game, to put your efforts into the defensive end of the floor. I wish I
could say that we never lacked in that, but we did.  
Trying to keep that focus is really important. It just dictates so much about
what happens on the floor, if your kids will play intensely and aggressively
at the defensive end.  
Q. Can you talk a little about what Kim Smith has meant to you, particularly
this year down the stretch, her scoring has picked up in conference play? What
does she do for your team and how important is it for her to perform at this
level?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, yeah, she's extremely important. She's been so
consistent, it's really been phenomenal. Kids feed off that. They get
comfortable when she's comfortable.  
There's so many "kudos" to her, I just can't talk. I've been coaching a long,
long time, and have never had a player play with the intensity and commitment
and relentlessness that she plays with. She deserves everything she's gotten.  
Q. If she happens to have an off game or off stretch, is it tough for the
other players to rally around? How do you keep that continuity going? They
almost watch her play at times.  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: That's true. You have to deal with that. You have to
make sure that people -- that your kids aren't standing, watching. We have to
deal with that. We sometimes get stagnant. Kids just aren't playing aggressive
around her.  
It's just something that we are aware of. We try to address it as best we can.
Our kids have had a good season and there's been a good support group around
here. She hasn't done it all alone. She'd be the first to tell you that. Yet
what a kid like that means as your center and your core is obviously
undeniable.  
Q. Do you like the way your team is playing right now? What could you be
doing better at this stage?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: Well, I just think as a coach, every game I think you
look at, you know, you never feel like you had 40 minutes of all the things
you wanted. Even if there's one defensive breakdown, one rotation somebody
misses, a block-out. It's like any game, we had our ups and downs. In terms of
the season itself, I do think we've grown, I do think that we are, you know,
in the best place we could be for now.  
I mean, I think that we kind of have attended to that. I give credit to the
kids for moving forward, playing our better basketball at the end of league
play, without a doubt.  
Q. You had a young player step up in the second half there, Sasha, and was
3-3 from the three-point line. Is that nice to see from a young player in a
big game?  
COACH ELAINE ELLIOTT: It is. It's especially important if your starting kids
are struggling from there, which they are. Heidi and Julie didn't get much to
fall tonight. Sasha got a few -- the second half of the season, we've gotten
her more game time. Tonight was a nice comfortable feel for her, I think.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Ambrosia Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16391)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Dani Kubik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16390)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We will we'll get started. BYU head coach Jeff Judkins,
Ambrosia Anderson and Dani Kubik. Coach, if you want to begin with general
remarks and we'll open up questions directed to the student athletes._  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Thank you. It was nice. This was a scary game today
partially CSU is very talented and they play so well in Fort Collins, it was
kind of a scary game for us. We knew that we had to come out and play hard
early and defend them early.  
First half was not one of our best halves. I thought we played well for
spurts, but I thought the second half we came out as a team and really
defended them and moved the ball around. It's nice to have two players like
these two young ladies who can come in and both of them are playing so well
right now with the inside-outside game.  
I thought Brosia did a lot better job the second half moving and not taking
the easy shot she had in the first half, trying to get a better shot. And I
thought Kubik did a great job of really controlling the boards.  
You know, Johnson doesn't get a lot of credit with points and all that, but
she did a great job Hunter tonight. She had 27 on us in Fort Collins, and that
was her challenge tonight, was not to let her get any easy baskets.  
I wasn't planning on playing zone as much as we did the second half, but it
was working. I learned from my father when things are working, don't change
it. But it was a nice win for this team. We really needed a game like this
where we could get some confidence and, you know, get some easy baskets and
also play against a very athletic team.  
_THE MODERATOR: For the next few minutes let's direct questions to the student
athletes._  
Q. Ambrosia, you came out and scored I think 12 points in about eight
minutes and change in that second half. Was that just a case of you deciding
I'm done kidding around, this has got to stop?  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: There's came when I kick it in gear, and say you know what,
I can't stop getting bumped around, shooting up hope shots. Just take
confidently, just playing my game. Because it's that in-between game that gets
me all the time where, do I want to shoot the three, do I want to take it all
the way? I just got to make up my mind and go wholeheartedly. And that's the
difference right there.  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: She just listened to me, that's what it really was
(laughter).  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: Sure, sure. He said keep moving let it come. I did.  
Q. Dani, after seeing what happened to New Mexico earlier today, did that
have your team maybe focused a little more coming in or was this a factor for
you?  
DANI KUBIK: No, it was a big factor. We just got beat I think by 28 points or
something like that. And you don't want to come out in this game and, you
know, get drilled, you know. It was a big impact on our team. We knew we
needed a re-group, get it together and play strong in this game. So this was a
big game for us.  
Q. Talk about the difference in what you did tonight or versus what happened
in Fort Collins when they really put a scare in you guys?  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: Personally or as a team?  
Q. You pick.  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: As a team, I think we trust each other more, we worked the
ball around more, got into the post. Motion is nothing without our five, so we
get them in there and we do our perimeter stuff and it's so hard to guard. And
we just realize that, and things start falling.  
Individually, just the same thing. Just play how you practice. And sometimes
when the lights go on in my head, you know, I think differently and try to do
it all. But you really just got to play like how you practice every day, day
in and day out. It's so much easier.  
DANI KUBIK: Another thing I think was our defense because the last time we
played them, they had a lot more open shots, and I think that we did really
good on our defense tonight. Melinda did a great job. But we just made sure
they didn't have open shots. That was our big focus this time, was to make
sure they didn't have those open shots.  
Q. Ambrosia, you mentioned the lights going on. Did you have a lot of family
and friends here and did that add to or take away from any pressure?  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: Not a whole lot. Just a couple people, like four or five
people came. That's just something I struggle with the whole year. Games are
always slightly different for me. But, I mean, it takes me a couple minutes to
get out of it. And it's something I have to work on. But, yeah, it was a good
atmosphere. It's always nice playing in Denver, growing up here, playing high
school here.  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Your high school team is in the semis.  
AMBROSIA ANDERSON: Uh-huh.  
_THE MODERATOR: Ladies we'll let you go._  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: Good jobs you guys. Congratulations.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions now directed to Coach Judkins._  
Q. Jeff, you guys forced 25 turnovers, and CSU has been kind of a turnover-
prone team as the season has gone on. Was this a big focus, to try to turn the
ball over on them today?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: I think every coach likes turnovers because a lot of times
turnovers, after turning the ball over, you can make baskets or get easy
baskets.  
I don't think we tried to force turnovers. I think what we try to do is
defensively take them out of what they were trying to do. They run a triangle
offense. In Fort Collins, we had a real difficult time giving them too many
open shots on handoffs, on pin-downs. So tonight we really tried just to get
through those. We didn't worry so much about the post like we've done in the
past. And I thought Johnson, Mallary, and Jennie Keele did a great job not
giving them a lot of easy, easy baskets.  
Now when you do that, you got to worry about Dennett. And Kubik is the best
defending center in our league, and she is physical and tough. I thought she
did a real good job of guarding Dennett one on one on the post. When you can
do that, you can put more pressure and that's what causes turnovers.  
Q. Jeff, you talked about how much you were worried about this ball game
considering what happened to New Mexico and seeing them go out in the first
round. How much did this game worry you?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: It worried me because a lot of time when you come in a
number one seeded team, you don't really focus yourself. You think you've had
a great season, and you come in here not ready to play. All of a sudden, a
team like CSU comes in, plays with a lot of energy and excitement. They can
beat you.  
I've been in this 18 years, and I have gone home a couple times the first
round with having a very good team. That was something I really emphasized the
last two days with my team, is, you know, we got to come out ready to play, we
got to come out with being aggressive defensively. We got to come out and take
care of the ball and really improve and get better so that we can get better
as a team.  
And I've told everybody we have four stages. This is number four. Number four
is post-season and tournament. And, you know, we've done well in the first
three; we've got to do well in the last stage for us to have a really
successful season.  
Q. Jeff, can you talk about the opening five minutes or so, the second half,
kind of an ugly first half. You guys really took control right there.  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: I think what happened is we came out a little bit flat and
then we ran a little streak, and then Brosia got tired, and I had to start
subbing a little bit, and my subs didn't come in and give us the energy they
usually give the first half. And we kind of play back and forth.  
I knew this. This team is a good second-half team. Partly that they focus
themselves and they know what they're doing and then we make adjustments.
Brosia, like she said earlier, she had open shots where she usually doesn't
get those early. She had to adjust tonight. What I told her to do was just go
out and play and let it come. You know, you're kind of hunting for your shot.
Just let it come and move. And I thought she did a lot better job the second
half.  
I also think our advantage is Colorado State had to play a hard game
yesterday. They got a little bit tired and they couldn't bring the intensity
they brought earlier. That's the advantage of not having to play that game
where you don't have being tired or whatever.  
But I think also playing them so closely in Fort Collins was a good motivating
factor for us. We knew that if we don't come ready to play, they can stay with
us. I thought tonight we did a lot better job. Our zone defense was very
effective. I thought we were very active in it. And when we're active like
that, we're tough to score on sometimes.  
Q. Coach, Ambrosia was talking about with kind of getting her head, is it
that you'd rather have her shoot off a pass in the flow, or can she hit these
open threes off the dribble when she decides?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: She can do it all. But what Brosia has improved so much,
people don't realize, is that she's not -- how do you say this -- not get into
bad habits that she had. She is letting the offense and her teammates help her
through those situations. Last year she had moments where she was brilliant
and then moments where she started trying to do too much. This year she's
really let it come, and I think that's maturity, but I think it's been four
years of me pounding her for a long time trying to help her.  
Ambrosia respects me for a lot of reasons, but one reason is I was in her
position as a player myself. I know what you have to do to score points, and
what you have to do as a team. She's done a great job. The Mexico came when
she jumped up for rebound and came down and she's grabbing her knee, I thought
Poor Bro, not for the team but she's worked so hard to get to this level. She
is a great player. She's made me a great coach because of her play out there.
She's fun to watch. She's a team player.  
And, you know, she did some good things defensively tonight that you don't
see, deflecting passes, active hands, and whatever. But she is a great player
and I've been very fortunate to be able to coach her.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Vanessa Espinoza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16384)

### [Molly Nohr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16385)

### [Jen Warden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13833)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: On the podium now is Jen Warden and student athletes Molly
Nohr and Venessa Espinoza. Coach, if you will open up with some comments and
then we'll it up for questions._  
COACH JEN WARDEN: I thought San Diego State was very well prepared. Obviously
they knew our quick hits. They made good adjustments. Michelle Strawberry is
an extremely talented player. Erin Jackson had a great game. I have a lot of
respect for Beth Burns, and the way she's going to bring that program around.  
So I thought they were very competitive and they were tough down the down the
stretch. I'm proud of our players and the opportunity to live for another day
so to speak. Obviously when you have someone like Vanessa playing with so much
confidence and so much spirit right now, it doesn't hurt that's she's going 5
for 5 from the three point line. I thought they made really nice adjustments
on screening situations and on angles. We found that Vanessa was hot, we kept
going to her. Even though when she was foul she stayed hot.  
And then Molly I thought really gave us a contagious look of attacking the
basket, staying aggressive offensively. I know our team gets confidence when
they see Molly Nohr going to the rack.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. You guys were out-rebounded. You start 1 for 7. There's a lot of things
going badly. You end up with a nine point lead. I didn't know if you get off
the hook a little bit you ended up getting such a nice lead?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: I think that is really perceptive. I think we acknowledge
that in the time out. I think we had a 16-minute time out. We said look it's
not going our way right now. We can do one of two things. We can panic and
stay on our own rearends for the rest of the game or we can relax and know
things are going to turn.  
I thing Vanessa again would hit a clutch 3 to give us a little a little bit of
life. Molly would get a layup out of a press break to give us a little bit of
life. But we really were, as you would say, searching for baskets and going to
half time down 8 on the boards I think is something you immediately got to
change. They have 10-O boards at halftime. That's not acceptable.  
Q. Can you comments on that what it felt like, not panicking and staying
cool under that situation?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: That's staying calm. You know, half time we talked about
getting out rebounded and that's what we would focused on. And went out and I
thought second half we kept our composure and played well.  
Q. Want to add anything?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: No. No.  
_THE MODERATOR: Next question._  
Q. Vanessa, after those two steals and maybe there was a little frustration
if you thought you might have been fouled when they were stealing it, you came
back and hit the huge 3. Was that a lot of determination because of what just
happened with the steals?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: Yeah, I mean, we were only up by I think 9 at the time, and
you know my teammates set me up, great job giving me the ball, set me up and
great pass and lucky shot.  
Q. Vanessa, for you and your classmates, obviously you guys have been
through this a few times, but it being your senior year, is there a little bit
more desperation to it? Is there a different kind of mindset you're bringing
to it?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: Definitely is. Every year we're one and done. This year we
want to go as far as we can. You know, the determination, we're ready to go
for BYU for tomorrow.  
Q. Coach, do you feel like you're kind of looking at a similar program
across the floor? I mean, you're both new coaches. What are your thoughts on
that?  
COACH JEN WARDEN: I think your initial thoughts are you know no matter what
you're doing or who you're doing it against, you're jockeying for a position.
And as Beth and I kind of start at the grass roots level, I think we see each
other initially and we're competing.  
And you know, then you move up on Air Force, and you move up on Wyoming, and
then UNLV. But first and foremost it as competitive 8/9 as it is competitive
in 1/8 or 3/6. And I think that you really got to take heart that you've got a
position and you got to recruit and you've got to teach. You have to be out
working the other guy whether it's Wyoming State or BYU.  
Q. Maybe other teams in your situation knowing that they're going to have to
play a number one seed and the team that's only lost three games I think all
year would be kind of a not as confident, but after the way you played BYU
last Thursday, what do you feel like you have to do maybe to turn that around
and get an upset tomorrow?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: I think if we play like the other night, a few adjustments,
I thought the team played hard and each game we're improving. We are feeling
extremely confident right now. And you know, rebounding is going to be a big
key for us. They're great inside and out. We have to do the little things to
beat BYU tomorrow.  
MOLLY NOHR: They're a real tough team. We need to out hustle them, get all the
loose balls to really get ahead of BYU.  
Q. Vanessa, I just wonder what your mindset was in this game after all the
frustrations of this season? And you were saying to your teammates, I'm not
going to let this one get away?  
VANESSA ESPINOZA: Definitely, we had a bad showing in Air Force. And that kind
of was in the back of my mind today. You know, we didn't show up to play. And
tonight we weren't going to let that happen. The atmosphere before the game,
everybody was just -- the intensity, the fire, you could see. You know, for
these seniors, we're not going to be one and done. Every year you know we come
in here and we lose. And you know, again, that's just in the back of our mind.  
_THE MODERATOR: Last question follow up._  
Q. Molly, can you just talk about what Vanessa meant to and the energy she
brought?  
MOLLY NOHR: It's really nice knowing you can go to a player, especially like
Vanessa, and knowing she's going to get the job done. I have all the
confidence in the world in Vanessa. I mean, towards the end of the game, and
we ran all the plays towards her, and she hit everything. I mean, the rest of
the team did a really good job setting her up and she did -- I mean, she was 5
for 5 from the three-point line. Especially down towards the end of the game,
we were only up by 6 points and she hit that 4-point play. I mean, she just --
I don't know. She's kind of the heart of the team I think. Really whenever we
get in the huddle, everyone looks towards Vanessa. I don't know. She keeps her
composure really well on the floor.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._  
COACH JEN WARDEN: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2006

  

### [Beth Burns](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13834)

### [Michelle Strawberry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16285)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by San Diego head coach Beth Burns and
Student athletes Michelle Strawberry and Erin Jackson. Coach Burns, begin with
some comments we'll open up for questions._  
COACH BETH BURNS: Certainly I think first congratulations needs to go to
Colorado State. This is a game that neither team aspires to be in, and I think
that it was a tremendous effort by them obviously. There was a couple little
stretches in the second half, but you can't say enough about the performance
that Espinoza had today. She hit some back breakers. I think for us, she was 5
for 5 from three, including an N one.  
We had Veronica Shaw on her lot, who is a very good pressure defender but we
really had no answer. They did some any things. I was proud of our team. I
think we competed hard. I think that 44 percent in the second half is the best
shooting percentage that we've had all season long. We've struggled with it
all season long. So, I give us credit that we walked in here with our heads up
and we're going to walk out of here with our heads up.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. Coach Burns, is this a situation where you're kind of looking more at the
process than the outcome, the improvement of your team throughout the
season?  
COACH BETH BURNS: That's a great question. I'm going to have to put a plug in,
they had a great stringer who came in today. You're exactly right. The real
positive is how great the Mountain West Conference is. We're proud that we're
the 6 RPI league in the country. That's something that you know for us we
spoke a lot about having success, what we can do day in day out, game in game
out to have success, because in a lot of the contests winning wasn't a
conceivable realistic option. It didn't mean we didn't strive to do that. But
the process was -- and we have improved tremendously. But I think it's the
level of our competition which is kind of the reason why you see the result.  
Q. Follow up question for you, Michelle. What do you feel like you're legacy
will be for those who are coming after you? Are you happy with the foundation
that you've laid?  
MICHELLE STRAWBERRY: Yes, I think I did a good job laying a foundation. They
have a good recruiting class coming in for next year and the returners have
improved so much. The foundation that me and myself some of the seniors,
Veronica and Lindsay, the foundation we laid was pretty much hard work. And
Coach Burns is going to continue to make everybody work hard. Foundation is
pretty much laid, and next year's time, get some wins.  
Q. Looking at the box score, the stat line and rebounds, the same,
everything was pretty close. Can you talk about the difference, what it really
came down to today?  
COACH BETH BURNS: You know, coaches know their teams obviously better than
anybody else. And I think that, you know, everybody has to make adjustments.
And I think one of the adjustments that we have as coaches is that there's
some things we can't do. Maybe a logical adjustment, if you will.  
They put some new wrinkles into the triangle. We hadn't guarded it yet. We
guarded them pretty well both times we've played them. And I think that was
the difference. You know, the wrinkles that they had, we didn't adjust -- and
give credit, you can wrinkle all you want; you still got to make shots. And
that's why I say Espinoza made some huge shots. But they were doing something
new. And in a game that was this close, where we really tried to make the game
ugly and tried to take some air out of the ball on the offensive end, because
we don't go very deep, that was huge.  
We just couldn't seem to adjust to what we had to get done, perhaps to put
ourselves in a position to eliminate some of those three-point shots.  
Q. Michelle or Erin, can you talk about the four-point play? Espinoza, you
kind of clawed your way back into the game. Talk about what that play meant.  
MICHELLE STRAWBERRY: Well, obviously that was pretty much a back-breaker
because we were trying to contain her. She just hit a couple of threes on us.
We were trying to put the ball in the basket after that. We knew we were down
and we knew she was hot. We tried to contain her as best as we could. As Coach
Burns said, they did put some wrinkles in. For us, it was pretty much mental.
We had to adjust. We had to talk and switch. That's where we kind of lost
focus, it was because of that. She hit a couple shots.  
Q. Michelle, you've been here for a while. Can you just reflect on the
season?  
MICHELLE STRAWBERRY: I think this is a good learning season for me. I had a
great time. I love my teammates. The new coaches coming in did a great job. I
think we advanced and we played better every game, and we've learned a lot of
things. Like he was saying, we built a foundation and we'll be able to win the
next coming up years.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies._  
COACH BETH BURNS: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2006

  

### [Monique Currie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15647)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Mistie Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15649)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll start with an opening statement by Coach. And then I would
like you to address your questions to the student-athletes first, please.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just congratulations to Maryland. I thought they played an
outstanding game. I thought early on we were the aggressor and I thought we
did a great job. But I thought as the game wore on they became a little more
comfortable and when Toliver hit that shot at the end of regulation, that was
tough for us.  
But I just give them all the credit in the world. They didn't panic when we
went up 10 and stayed with their game and came out on top.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the players, please.  
Q. Mo, what was the feeling at half-time and when did you feel the momentum
shift?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I don't know. We felt great at half-time. I think we thought
we were playing pretty well. We wanted to do a better job of rebounding, but
we felt like we were in a good position to win the game if we continued to
play like we played that entire half.  
I think Maryland had the momentum for almost the entire second half. We didn't
really get a chance to go on a run and they went on a couple runs. And they
hit the big shot to take it into overtime.  
Q. Monique, I know it's difficult so quickly after the game, but can you sum
up your feelings and in having your career end and then what happened
tonight.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I don't know. Well, clearly right now I don't feel very good
about how things ended. It's a tough loss. I think we tried as hard as we
could and we left it out on the floor and that's all that you can really ask
for. But it really hurts right now.  
Q. Mistie, what did you see change in the second half?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: They went on a run and it shifted the momentum. That's about
it.  
Q. Monique, you said that you felt they had the momentum the entire second
half. Was there a point that you noticed where it really did start to shift or
was it something about the start of the second half?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: We scored the first basket of the second half. I think. And
from there we were for the most part exchanging baskets.  
We didn't really get the stops that we needed to get to maintain the lead that
we had. And they just slowly crept up on us and took the lead.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much, we'll let you head back to your
locker room. Congratulations both of you on an outstanding season. We'll go to
questions now for Gail.  
Q. If you could just talk about that momentum shift that they made, because
you were sort of trading baskets and they just kind of all of a sudden, they
were tied with you guys. Was there a point where you kind of started to see
that shifting and then catching --  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think it was gradual. I think they just continued to gain
more confidence the longer they played with us and they just cut into the
lead. Like Monique said, our defense in the second half was not nearly as good
as it was in the first half. They were better in the second half. I think they
became more comfortable. And they were just better and they hit some tough
shots, but they have been hitting those shots all year.  
Q. Were you surprised at all how cool their freshmen played under pressure,
they have been good all year but at that stage of the game with that whole
season on the line?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I seen it too many times. Every time their games go to
overtime, they won every game in overtime. So I've seen many instances where
the pressure is really on that they come through.  
Q. When you do have a lead and then you are going back and forth and just
swapping baskets and not getting that stop, you guys didn't look like it was
sort of frustrating you or bothering you, did you get any sense that your
players were sort of getting a little frustrated that they couldn't get that
stop?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, I think we all felt like we were fine and we were going
to get the stops we needed. They were hitting some great shots. And sometimes
you play great defense and a kid hits a fadeaway three, there's no defense for
that. They hit some really tough shots. So I told the team not to be
frustrated by that. They're great players, they're going to hit some great
shots. And as long as we continued to score on our end, eventually we would
get the stops we needed. I think we all felt that way. Unfortunately, it
didn't work out that way.  
Q. Did you think you missed a chance to bury them in the first half? You
must have missed eight or ten lay-ups and had a number of occasions to make it
a 15- or 20- or 25-point game?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, that certainly would have helped. We were so excited
coming out of the gate. We got great looks and didn't make them pay for it. So
I think that probably would have helped us a great deal had we put those easy
baskets down early and gotten an even bigger lead.  
Q. You've come close before, but never this close; you guys were six seconds
away. How much does this one hurt?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I don't know. I just feel utter disappointment right
now for my players and specifically for my seniors.  
So it's killing me right now. Not for myself, but for my players.  
Q. Before their final possession in regulation who did you want to stop or
was there someone you were expecting to take that shot for them?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: They have some great shooters. We know Toliver has hit a
bunch of big shots for them, but they got so many, Shay Doron, they have been
going to her, she had been hurting us on numerous occasions down the stretch.
So we really had to play everybody. And we switched on all screens, because we
knew they were going to set some screens on the ball to try and get somebody
open, and Ali ended up on Toliver, and she had to shoot over a 6'7" person and
she did.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Gail, I'll let you go back to the locker room and again
congratulations on a great season.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Maryland is now joining us in the interview room. Let's go ahead
and let Brenda make an opening statement and then we'll go to your questions
until the players get here.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, I think we were, I apologize, celebrating and
enjoying this party too long. But first and foremost, it's just unfortunate
that any team had to lose this game.  
What a great game. I thought Duke had a tremendous defensive game plan against
us, really took us out of rhythm for most of the game. And I tell you, Mistie
Williams, Monique Currie, did a tremendous job leading this team all season
long.  
But obviously very proud of these players, with the amount of hard work, the
poise, the confidence they played with, my coaching staff, the assistant
coaches, the support staff, everyone that is involved with Maryland athletics.
I tell you, the fans that were here, they came out in waves and the fans back
home and this is very exciting and we're honored to be the first women's team
to be bringing back a national championship.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Go to questions for the girls first, please.  
Q. Marissa, was there any doubt at all that once you got the game in the
overtime you would win?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Not at all. When Kristi hit that shot, we all went crazy in
the huddle. Overtime is our time. And Shay looked at everybody, what better
way to win a national championship than in overtime, which was our time all
season long.  
Q. Shay, can you talk about the injury, what happened, how did it happen?
And could you have taken the free throws, or did the coach have to call the
time-out for you?  
SHAY DORON: Well, I honestly I lost feeling in my hand for a good few seconds.
I was just trying to move it. I just fell really hard on my elbow and I guess
the vibration, I guess, I don't even know honestly what happened. Our hands
got tangled up and I ended up flipping over her shoulder, so I just fell right
on the elbow. And I wanted to take the free throws, but it was a good decision
not to let me, because I was very emotional and I felt like I could take the
free throws, but our coaching staff is the best in the country and every
decision they make I understand it.  
Q. Question for Marissa: A year ago you were here as a spectator, you and
Kristi, you provided the decisive points, can you just talk about that?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Well, last year when Kristi and I were here sitting in the
arena and we both looked at each other, at one point and I don't remember
which game it was, and just said we're going to be here next year and we're
going to win a national championship.  
Towards the end of the game at half-time my teammates we all just talked and
said, we have been in this position a million times before this season. We
just got to do what we have been doing all season and play as a team and we'll
come out victorious.  
Q. For the players, if you could each answer, Laura Harper was named Most
Outstanding Player, if you each had a vote, who would you vote for?  
SHAY DORON: Every player stepped up so big and in different games and that's
what makes our team so dangerous is you really can't pick out one player that
is outstanding, but obviously we all are. And Harp deserves it just as much as
everyone. But everyone is so important to this team. This team is so deadly at
every single position, which is why we won the national championship, because
nobody can stop us in any position.  
Q. Marissa, first half Coach got in your face big time. What was that
about?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: She knows that that's the best way to get to me, and get
through me. My attitude was horrible the first half, I was hanging my head
because I wasn't knocking down shots and had a lot of turnovers. It wasn't
anything negative she was just saying that I've been playing this game for so
long, just go out there, have fun, put a smile on my face and that this team
needed me in order to win, so I just had to pick up my attitude.  
Q. Kristi, tell us about that great shot and also tell us what your thoughts
were when you looked at the person in front of you as you were taking that
shot.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Oh, we had set -- Jeffrey had set the play to have me go off
one screen and then pass and then flare off another. But in my opinion big-
time players want the ball in big time situations. So I wanted to take the
shot.  
So I went off both and I just kind of saw an opening, and I saw Alison Bales
step up and I said, that's a big girl. She's very long, and I knew if I got it
over her, it felt pretty good. So as soon as it left my hands, I knew it was
going in.  
Q. Laura, what picked up in your game the last few games through the
tournament? What's different than like during the regular season?  
LAURA HARPER: Everyone's game should come out in the tournament. And the
Maryland girls are just hot right now, so. We're just hot right now. And
that's the best way to describe it.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Laura, congratulations on being named Most Outstanding Player.  
LAURA HARPER: Thank you.  
Q. As Shay mentioned, there are a number of members on this team who are
probably deserving of that as well, if had you a vote, what would it be? And
what was your reaction when you heard that were you named Most Outstanding
Player?  
LAURA HARPER: When they were about to say it I was chanting "C Lang" with the
rest of the team and I was like me, I was like, oh, I just wasn't really even
expecting it. I think my dad put it best when I gave him a hug. He said, "You
tell this team that it was a team MVP." We're like the true definition of a
team and tonight the better team won.  
Duke has very, very talented players but we played I think together, we stuck
together, we showed emotion like a team. I mean KT hit an MJ type shot.
Everybody came up big tonight. So you can't even really put an MVP on this
team.  
Q. Crystal, first half it looked like every time you touched the ball there
was Alison and Mistie staring you in the face. Talk about what you did to sort
of respond to that.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Well, I knew they were going to come out doubling, so our
coaches told me that that's what they were going to do and just look for the
open man and that's what I was trying to do.  
Q. Crystal, being double-teamed and not getting as many shots as you
normally would, can you talk about how Laura stepped up tonight the entire
tournament when you're being double-teamed like that?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Laura is a big player and she stepped up again for us. It
shows how great our teams is. We had five players in double figures and I just
love this team. I love this team.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Maryland is just hot right now. We're hot right now.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll let you head back to the locker room. And now let's take
questions for Brenda, please.  
Q. Coach, it seemed to start the second half you were desperately looking
for some kind of spark, the three-point play where Langhorne drives and also
gets the third foul on Lindsey, was that maybe the play that finally jump
started everybody?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, we talked a lot at half-time that we wanted to get the
ball inside a little bit more with Lang only having one touch, but, yeah, I
think that really got us jump started to get some emotion and get some energy,
and I thought at that time after that play our defensive intensity really
picked up.  
Q. Coach, I think you'll fight back a smile to know that have I several text
messages telling me that they're in the streets in College Park. If you could
just talk about where you've brought this program, that's usually a
celebratory dance for the men and to see that happen for your program after
four years, what does that mean to you to know the students are behind you?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I tell you I hope they're celebrating and being smart with
what they're doing back there. Because this should be a time for us to rejoice
and just enjoy the moment. And obviously with the University of Maryland and
our athletic department, each and every team is given that opportunity with
the support that we have from the day I was hired with athletic director
Debbie Yow, this has been so special.  
Our president, president Mote and the support that he gives and the support
and the backing we have here at the University of Maryland is tremendous.  
Q. You talked about the poise that your younger players have had and how
your freshmen haven't really been freshmen because they played so much. But if
you could talk about the way they stepped up especially in overtime, both
Kristi and Marissa to want the ball in those situations.  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think the biggest thing is we never really treated them
as freshmen. From the minute they stepped on campus they didn't act it or
behave like it. They wanted the pressure, they wanted the expectations and I
think you were able to see as the game unfolded our leadership and our
veterans really kind of kept us in the game, and then once our two young
players were able to settle down, they just played with so much confidence.
They have been there, they have practiced, they have put in the time, and they
knew they were going to be able to step up and perform.  
Q. You talked either yesterday or Saturday about the history of this
program, Chris Weller brought a team here 25 years ago, can you talk about
what this all means for people who have been with this program over that
time?  
BRENDA FRESE: It just continues the tradition. When you look back at 25 years
ago we were one of the first teams in the Final Four. And obviously what Chris
Weller was able to do with this, with Maryland, I'm living out a dream. She's
invested so much time and energy and for us to be able to continue on with
this tradition and bring back the first national championship, this is
something pretty special.  
But it speaks volumes of so many people that are involved that deserve this
credit for this championship.  
Q. Can you describe at all how you feel and how long you think it will take
to sink in?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that the thing I enjoy the most is just taking in
everybody else; Shay Doron and her emotions, these players, my parents, my
husband, who would have ever thought in my wildest dreams that I would get two
rings this year, one getting married and two a national championship. So it's
pretty surreal.  
But I think that the thing that's so special is just looking into the eyes of
each and every person, player, staff member, fan, just how much joy is out
there because they understand how much hard work went into this game.  
Q. Can you talk about the half-time message and what you believe really
sparked this team in the second half?  
BRENDA FRESE: We just really talked about -- I told them I was excited because
as bad as we played we were only down by 10. And that we were going to be able
to go out in the second half and we were going to regain our confidence and
our composure and we were going to obviously throw away the first half and
come out 0-0 and be ready to chip that thing away.  
So I think obviously us being able to get them in some early foul trouble and
then I just thought that our defensive intensity really picked up. Shay Doron,
Kristi Toliver, Ashleigh Newman, were really getting aggressive and starting
to chip away at their lead.  
Q. Could you give your version of your discussion with Marissa in the first
half and what you saw in her that you needed to straighten out?  
BRENDA FRESE: Just knowing her and kind of what she thrives on, I knew I
needed to be firm with her. I knew it wasn't going to be a coddling, it just
was a firm action in the sense of hey, we believe in her, she's got to snap
out of this, she's too great of a player to sit and get caught up in the
emotions of the game, and that she just needed to kind of snap out of it, and
that she's needed to start playing with poise and confidence on the floor.  
Q. Much is made about how young your team is, other teams that have come
here haven't been able to sustain a run like this for years to come. Can this
team continue to be good throughout the future?  
BRENDA FRESE: Hey, you know, on the outside, you say absolutely, yes. And you
hope that we're building a dynasty here. But each and every season defines its
own, the players define it with their character and really how they come
together, and so you really have to take each team as its own. I don't think
you can put any different, you know, added pressures and expectations, you
know. I don't even want to look ahead yet to next year, because I want to
enjoy this year. But every team is really -- it depends on your chemistry, how
much you click. And I'll tell you, of all the years I've been coaching, never
have I seen a team go through a season and play for each other the way they
played tonight. And how fitting. I mean this game, five players in double
figures, overtime win, just everything that was a culmination of this season
all wrapped up in this last game.  
Q. Will you talk about Laura Harper and her performance in the last couple
games.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'm so proud, obviously, to be able to see Laura Harper and her
being named the Most Outstanding Player. Obviously when you look at someone
like Laura and all the hard work that had to go into this season, she ruptures
her Achilles' tendon last season, sits out all year, loses the year, and then
for her to be able to come out and perform like she did in this tournament is
just a tremendous thing.  
Q. For that shot that Toliver hit to tie the game, was that what was
designed, was there ever any question that that was going to be the shot or
were you looking for something else and that's just kind of what you got?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, not exactly. My assistant Coach Jeff Walz did a great job
designing the play. We were on the bench and we knew the ball -- we knew we
were going to Kristi Toliver and we knew she wanted to take the shot. We were
setting screens, we were going to look for a little flare action. She decided
to dribble penetrate and keep coming off of screens. Hey whichever way was
going to make her feel comfortable I'm all for it, and she just stepped up
obviously and played with a lot of confidence.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Brenda, congratulations.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2006

  

### [Joni Comstock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13892)

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will let Joni start with an opening statement here and then
we'll go to your questions for either of the two of them.  
JONI COMSTOCK: Thank you Deb. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for
coming this afternoon so we can talk a little bit more about the tournament. I
also want to say, congratulations to the coaches, student-athletes, and
certainly to members of the media. I think that we have all worked effectively
together to continue to support and promote and develop women's basketball.
And I think all of us on the committee feel like it's been another great year.
We're looking forward to the final game tomorrow night and that it's going to
be just, again, just a great ending to a 2006 year.  
As we have the committee members talked in the last few days, we really again
feel like there have been a number of very positive things that have occurred
and I just want to take a moment just to mention a few of those that we really
consider to be highlights. First of all, of course, taking the opportunity to
celebrate the NCAA centennial was a great thing for us this year. The 25th
anniversary of NCAA women's championships and certainly as that centered
around women's basketball and honoring the anniversary team and all of the
festivities related to that.  
In addition, we were pleased with the results of our first move to Selection
Monday. We felt that there were a number of good things with that and
certainly the coverage by ESPN and the hour-long show that we had, we felt
that it was again a very great vehicle for continuing to promote and develop
women's basketball. We have had our 14th consecutive sellout here in Boston,
so we're happy about that and looking forward to a great crowd tomorrow night.
Our Regional attendance was up at all of our sites and that collectively
accounted for an additional 22,000 people seeing those Regional games.  
In addition, the Regional finals posted the second highest ESPN rating ever.
That was also a great thing and the Connecticut-Duke game was the most viewed
Regional in the ESPN history with a 1.95 rating. Overall ESPN has shared with
us that at least at this point their ratings are up over 22 percent. So that's
again certainly something to be very proud of and excited about as it relates
to the development of women's basketball.  
Again, I think it is certainly a tribute to not only the 64 teams in the
tournament, but all of them involved in Division I basketball. I think
certainly it's a tribute to the hard work of our committee and again the
support and the attention that we receive from the media.  
As with each of the years, there's a little controversy, each year, with teams
that maybe are disappointed and have questions about why they were either not
included in the 64 or where they were in the seeding process, and so that is
something that the committee continues to look at, to review very carefully,
because our commitment is to make sure that we continue to support and promote
and do everything that we can do to make women's basketball as great as it
possibly can and to reach its full potential. So again, I thank you for your
coverage and for all you that you do. I know that the hours that you put in
are tremendous and we appreciate it very much.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: And we'll go to questions for either Sue or Joni. Please.  
Q. Joni, you just mentioned 22 percent, is that 22 percent for the whole
tournament?  
JONI COMSTOCK: Yes. Yes. To this point, yes.  
SUE DONOHOE: We held our own in and had a little bit of a decrease first and
second rounds but our Regional semi-finals and Regional finals were so strong.
So overall for all preliminary rounds, we haven't gotten the overnights from
last night, so.  
Q. For both of you, as you look back over the years of growth in the
tournament, are there any particular milestones that strike you? And I'm also
interested to know, are there any particular sponsors from a corporate
standpoint that you can say have really stepped up and supported you more
recently than in the past?  
SUE DONOHOE: Well, I think that when you look at our, the last 25 years, it's
interesting, I had a chance to be in Norfolk as a graduate assistant coach.
And we had attendance of about 8,000. The lowest ticket price was 1.75. And
then five dollars and then boy, we popped it up on the top with a seven dollar
top ticket price. And I look at our attendance record now at 29,619. We set
that in San Antonio. We got a sold out TD Banknorth Garden, especially here at
a ticket price of $140. That to me speaks volumes. Certainly we have still got
a lot of growing up to do. But I think another thing that's really important
to note is as we have grown over 25 years, we have grown in a good way. Our
game has maintained what's good and wholesome about college athletics. And I
think that the more we grow and the milestones that we reach, insuring that we
retain that wholesomeness, that we retain what's unique about women's
basketball. So that would be my answer to that.  
To answer the second part of your question, certainly over the years, and I
hesitate to call out different corporate champions and partners because you
always leave someone out, but the NCAA's been fortunate over the years to have
folks that had a vision that had a connectivity to college athletics and
certainly to women's basketball. I think likewise our Women's Basketball
Coaches Association has had those sort of corporate sponsors and individuals
that really believed in our game. When you look at the exposure that these
corporate champions and partners are getting, and how the brand of some of
these corporate champions and partners connect with the brand of women's
basketball, I think that's pretty exciting. I think more and more you've got
folks out in corporate America that are seeing those connections between
college athletics and particularly women's basketball and what they want to do
to build their brand.  
Q. I'll just take the gloves off right away, there wasn't a little
controversy about the bracket, there was a lot. And a lot of that was that the
RPI seemed to be used when it worked like you wanted it to and it wasn't used
when you didn't. There was also statements made that were in direct
contradiction to things the committee has said before in terms of how they do
the bracket. What's the message teams are supposed to take out of this year,
especially a team like Western Kentucky that played a tough non-conference
schedule, had a 20 RPI, didn't get in, what's the message they're supposed to
take or is that message going to change based on the makeup of the
committee?  
JONI COMSTOCK: We just came from the coaches, we had an opportunity to really
talk with them about that very thing. And I think that, you know, these are,
they're controversial things, they again, as you said, there have been
disappointments. I also think at the same time that that represents one of the
really positive things in terms of the growth of the game, the parity, and the
depth of the really good coaches now that we have in the tournament.  
We shared with the coaches all of the things, I mean, no question about it,
the RPI is one of the tools, and I think the committee the way we like to
describe it is, it's one of the tools that to help us organize the
information. In addition to that, I mean, you're certainly one of the experts,
I don't need to tell you that we look at road wins, conference records, non-
conference record, the overall record, what they did in their last ten games,
what happened in the conference tournament. And we try to weigh all of those
things. And as much as we have tried to continue to maintain certainly
fairness and commitment to it, it is not a science.  
We also shared with the coaches that we're looking forward to our summer
meetings and we'll certainly listen to them and if we need to hone those a
little bit or even maybe identify some priority of those, the criteria that we
look at, then we will certainly consider doing that. But in the case of
Western, we shared with the coaches as I said earlier, that the best of my
memory, we were in a very tough situation this year because we had I think two
remaining slots and about 14 teams that we had to compare. We tried to lay out
the criteria as carefully as we could, and look at all of those 14 teams
across the board. And that's the difficult task of the committee that
ultimately those ten people had to vote and we had to select to the best of
our ability the two that were going to get those remaining slots. But Western
had a great year, we recognized that from the very beginning and we looked
long and hard and again. They were a great team.  
Q. On the selection conference call, your committee refused to name the
order of the how the No. 2 seeds evolved, and that's been done before. So my
question is, why the lack of transparency on that? That's something that
certainly has been put out there and been in the public before.  
SUE DONOHOE: We have, we have always, we have always given the one lines. We
have not given the twos, threes, fours. And so we followed the way we have
done it.  
Q. Is there a reason why you don't give that out?  
SUE DONOHOE: Well, part of it is is because of the decisions that the
committee has to make, once they start with the -- once they seed them, then
once they start putting them in the bracket, it's just something that we have
never shared. We have never, we never have. I don't know much to tell you
beyond that. We have always shared the ones, but we have never gone deeper
than that. Nor have the men's committee.  
Q. Just one last follow-up, is that something you would consider for the
future sharing that since you're not really sure why you haven't shared it
before?  
SUE DONOHOE: Well I think this: I think right now -- and I think any year,
somebody asked me right after the selection show, "Are you going to meet? Are
you going to discuss this this summer?" Because of some of the difficult
decisions that the committee made, we do that every year. The committee sits
down in the summer, in the fall, they sit back down in February. When they do
they're orientation meetings to discuss principles and procedures. I think
anytime we have got an opportunity to make the process better, we will. And if
that's, if that makes the process better, if that builds more consensus and
make it's more transparent, certainly we can talk about it.  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think the committee really views sharing the RPI, as Sue
said, beginning on what, I guess in January, of this year, that we're hoping
that that again is a positive step, that it takes away some of that veil, so
that people can understand what we're seeing, what we're looking at. And the
one other thing that I wanted to mention really and just in just looking at
all of this, we do have the criteria, but I have, I'm sitting here looking at
a number of the committee members in the back row and these women spend a
tremendous amount of time, all 10 members, watching many, many basketball
games. And while we take the criteria, we take the numbers, we take the facts,
we also watch those games, watch those teams. And we start doing that in
November.  
So that it's, that it is really as much as we possibly can. It is a fair
snapshot of the entire year of the teams' performances and trying to make sure
that we look at as many things as we can to again get the best 64 in there and
get them in the right place so that we're representing women's basketball
effectively and that we're providing a great experience for the student-
athletes.  
Q. In previous years the committee has taken pretty good steps to make sure
that teams playing within regions when they got to the regional level had
played on the same day so there was no competitive imbalance. Also that teams
reaching the Final Four had played on the same day. What I mean for example,
as an example, Maryland played, a team I cover, they played on a Saturday,
excuse me, a Sunday, Tuesday, first and second round. Had to play Baylor which
had played on a Saturday, Monday. Here at the Final Four, Maryland has played
a day earlier than the team they played last night. Usually the bracket is
balanced so those things don't happen. Was there something this year that
happened to change that?  
JONI COMSTOCK: Well, I think more than anything, what we try to do first and
foremost is get the teams in the bracket, in the right spot, keep them, as you
said, as close as we can to good geography, to not send them all over the
country. But some, you know, somebody has to play on those certain days. And
so that, we were aware of it, but we, you know, it just wasn't possible for us
to get all of the teams in the bracket so that they were nearby, they were
matched up with the right teams and that they were playing on those same days
for first and second round and regionals.  
Q. How do you see your audience as different from the audience for the men's
game and how does that affect the way you market your game?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think that there is a little bit of a difference. I think that
over the last two and a half years the NCAA, the Division I women's basketball
committee, the issues committee, has undertaken a branding initiative and we
have done a great deal of research to identify who is the women's basketball
fan. And we have done a lot of research to determine how do we change that
casual fan and make them a big fan. How do we take that fan that when they're
flipping television stations they might stop off and watch a women's game for
a little bit, how do we convert that fan to a face-painting, you know, wig-
wearing, fanatic in the arena? And we have taken on this initiative, we know
it's a growth process, with the initiative. But I think that one thing that
you see in the women's game, and we're starting to see little bit of a shift
in the needle, but we have still got our work to do here is, you've got fans
that are very, very loyal to their team. And they will support that team
through thick and thin. They may, they're bigger fans of their team and their
institution than they are of the game of women's basketball.  
So it's a challenge for us to maintain that fan base and that fan connectivity
with their institution and yet expand them to being a fan overall of the game.
So that as we're conducting first and second round sites, they have got an
opportunity on that first round game day to see four of the top 64 teams in
the country. Not only will they come see their institution, but they will come
watch those other three games because it's just good women's basketball. It's
a challenge for us and it's part of what we have got to do and what we have
got to continue to push in order not only to grow our championship, but to
grow regular season women's basketball.  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think just to add to that very quickly, I think two of the
things that have become very, very clear to me in just talking to people this
year is that everyone again recognizes the growth, the competitiveness, but
two of the things that continue to remain very much respected with the women's
game is the quality of play, the great coaching, and then also the
sportsmanship. And that people like to bring whether it's their children or
they like to come and they know that they're going to see again, just very
high quality basketball that's played the way we all want it to be played, and
with again with good sportsmanship. And I think those are definitely, those
are characteristics that our fans are looking for. And I'm proud that we have
in our game.  
Q. Since we have a little, this is for Sue, a little different dynamic going
on this week, any concerns that the game goes one-sided tomorrow night that
ESPN may start changing its focus during the broadcast to Wednesday's event
and the fact that all that's gone on, have you had any problems or anything
extra from your side of the fence?  
SUE DONOHOE: No, not really. We were made aware that WNBA wanted to bring
their draft here and we talked about it. First we talked about it with our
television partner, certainly with the understanding that the focus of this
weekend is on the two semifinal games and a national championship game,
tomorrow night about midnight or 12:30 they can shift their focus. Even as
recent as yesterday we had a direct dialog about that. If there's a natural
fit there to say, you know, a player A who may be a first or second round
draft pick, certainly, but the focus certainly to this point has been on the
women's Final Four, the two semifinal games and it is my expectation and my
understanding that that focus will continue throughout the game tomorrow
night.  
Q. I would like to know what are the factors you'll use in determining
whether moving the selection show to Monday was a success?  
JONI COMSTOCK: Well, I think that just one of the comments I would make again
is the committee has talked about it a little bit, we were very, very pleased
with the presentation of our tournament, of women's basketball, and we thought
that again partnering with ESPN and the way that show was presented was a
very, very good thing for women's basketball. We were down, Sue is sort of the
numbers expert, but we were down a little bit in terms of ratings for that
show. But my personal opinion is it's a blip, that we'll see it jump back up
and I think, again, I would defer a little bit to my colleagues in the back,
but I think that we all feel like we have to continue to separate and advance
the women's game and have it stand on its own two feet and that we did that.  
SUE DONOHOE: I think one thing, I think looking at Sunday evening, because of
the men's games that were on that afternoon, if we had, if we would have had
our selection show on Sunday evening, our selection show would have been about
43, 44 minutes, instead of that 60 minute show. I think the committee's very
aware of some of the challenges that it creates for media across the board,
for electronic and print media. They do. And the committee knew that when they
made this decision that it was, it was a bit of a calculated risk, but it was
a risk that they felt like that in the long run was going to help grow the
championship, grow the game, and again, what we're going to receive out of
Selection Monday is something that will grow over time.  
One of the things that certainly as we talked with ESPN about making this
move, some things that we felt like were really important, not only for
Selection Monday, but for the growth of the game, was an enhanced presence for
women's basketball during the regular season. I think we certainly saw that
from ESPN. We had our big Monday night. I think ESPNU gave us some women's
basketball exposures that we had not had in the past. I think we saw an
expansion of the bottom line. So all of those were parts of the discussion.
Not only was Selection Monday the decision to try and give women's basketball
a place to stand on its own, but also there were other parts attached to that
to say, let's grow during the regular season and then through the championship
as well.  
Q. Just one follow-up on that: Is there any fear that you, by the decision,
you might have alienated or hurt your coverage among the print or local
electronic media because of the time of that selection show?  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think that's something that we have to continue to evaluate.
Obviously that print media is extremely important to us. And so again, my only
comment would be that we're continuing to look at that and we want to make
sure that it's a good decision for everyone involved who is helping us with
the game.  
Q. If you guys both could talk about this: It seems like, I don't think
there's any question whether you admit it or not you have been hamstrung by
the fact that TV is now dictating a lot of what you do. You guys say you
agreed to it, I don't know how much in reality it's them dictating it and how
much it's you agreeing to it, but how much has that affected, for instance,
setting up the brackets, you have challenges that the men's committee doesn't
have, in terms of predetermined sites. You talk about the Selection Monday
show, that it's going to grow, what if it doesn't? Can you sort of talk about
that. Do you guys basically, are you taking a blind leap of faith that what
television says is going to work is going to work?  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think that one of the things, Michelle, you know, you make an
excellent point there, clearly I think the committee recognized the risk
involved in it. This was a discussion with ESPN over a number of years. We
didn't jump into it quickly, they have been suggesting it, we have been
talking about it, and what we try to do is, as Sue mentioned, make sure that
they were good partners with us, so that we could also count on some
additional things from them in terms of promoting that show, promoting the
tournament overall, and so.  
But you're right, it was a risk, and but that's what we have, we have felt
with any number of things with the women's tournament through the years that
we have had to look carefully, but take that leap and hope that we're doing
the right things to support and advance the game. And I don't see this as
anything that's any different. We're hoping that this is going to work out for
the best for the game. If not, I assure you, we will continue to look and
decide what we're going to do instead.  
SUE DONOHOE: A couple other things, I think that you have the media piece of
it and moving to Selection Monday, we spent a great deal of time visiting with
our coaches about Selection Monday, and there was a little bit of a split on
that. Some said, hey, jump out there, gives us an opportunity to stand on our
own, be on our own, get our own exposure and then you had some coaches that
said, you know, why? Why change now? So there was a little bit of a split on
that.  
But a lot of the things that the coaches were concerned about was how is it
going to impact us as a team to travel. If the men announce on Sunday, are we
going to be put at a disadvantage for travel? So those were certainly concerns
that we addressed with before the committee ever made a decision. And quite
candidly, we were better able to service our women's teams this year than we
have ever been able to do and it's because that our travel staff was able to
focus on the women totally without having to share focus with the men's teams
that they were trying to do. And I think another piece of that, not only are
you moving Division I men's basketball, Division I women's basketball, you're
moving Divisions II, III, you're moving ice hockey and you're moving a whole
lot of officials and committee members all at once. So certainly the committee
will continue to look at it, if we're going to grow, we're going to have to
take some risk, and the committee didn't take that decision lightly. I can
promise you that. They did spend probably two and a half, three, four years
just discussing the decision before they were ready to make it.  
Q. You mentioned a while ago that about two and a half years ago you started
some branding initiatives to try to turn casual fans into fanatics. Can you be
a little more specific about what you tried to do and maybe which ones worked
and which ones haven't?  
SUE DONOHOE: Sure. What we did, we identified five attributes that folks
identify with with women's basketball. And Joni mentioned those: High quality
of play, sportsmanship, role models, strong academics. Those type of
attributes that when folks think about Division I, Division II, Division III
women's basketball, they say, that's why I have an interest in basketball. And
so what we have done with the branding initiative, we have reached out to
Divisions I, II and III, because we feel like it's a grass roots effort at all
decisions, we have reached out to each one of our institutions, to the head
coaches, to the marketing director, to the directors of athletics to engage
them and get them activated in the branding initiative. Likewise we reached
out to our Divisions I, II and III conferences and we have asked for a
commitment and an activation from those groups. Last year at our women's Final
Four we had a meeting with our coaches, all of them, all decisions and it was
a call to action and basically here's our tag line for the branding
initiative, "It's all day, every day, our game." And we ask our coaches at the
Division I, II and III level to make that commitment that it is all day, it is
every day, and it is our game. And the measurable outcome for the branding
initiative is to increase our fan base. To increase it at every Division I, II
and III institution. To increase it during the regular season and during the
championship as well.  
If we're going to continue to grow the championship we have got to continue to
grow during the regular season. And so this is a collaborative effort in order
to try and achieve that. That's the measurable outcome, it will take several
years to do it. But it's been amazing to look at some of our institutions and
our conferences and how they have embraced the branding initiative and how
they're trying to roll it into their branding activation either as an
institution or as a conference. So we'll keep working on that.  
Q. In terms of Selection Monday, what sort of timetable have you given
yourselves to determine whether it's going to be successful, what outlets have
you given yourselves whether you can go back to Sundays or make other
alternatives? And also in terms of, have you discussed the travel and trying
to grow your fans, well, what considerations did you take with the fans when
you're giving them one less day to make their travel plans, which is already a
pretty expensive bill.  
JONI COMSTOCK: I think in terms of evaluation of Selection Monday, I think
again what we will be doing this summer is sitting down and looking at it when
we have all facts in about whether -- it's the gamut. You know, the ratings,
attendance, everything related to starting our tournament with that Selection
Monday. See what it looks like and then I think that it will be at that point
where the committee will decide even then if we feel like it has been a good
decision, and we're going to keep it, or if we do feel like it needs our
careful eye, then I think probably at that point we'll put a timeline on it
and decide what we want to do from there.  
Q. Is there any consideration to when you have the eight predetermined sites
for the first two rounds, having either a one or a two seed in each one of the
eight sites? So that in a market like Chicago they have two No. 4 seeds and no
1, 2 or 3 for the first two rounds?  
SUE DONOHOE: Steve, when the committee puts teams into the brackets certainly
they have the principles and procedures by which they put them in. Putting a
No. 1 or a No. 2 seed at a site is not one of the principles that they have to
follow. Do they look at it and do they try and do that? They do as much as
possible. But they can't do that at the expense of the other principles and
procedures by which they have to follow. When you look at your Chicago site
and they didn't have a 1 or they didn't have a 2, but you look at the 4's that
they did have, when you look at a Michigan State and a DePaul and a UW-
Milwaukee, a Kentucky, a Tulsa, you know, certainly you had a great site. But
if they can do that, they will do that. But it's not a principle that they
have to follow.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: I'm going to ask Coach to make an opening comment and we'll only
have the players in here for 15 minutes. Brenda will then stay with me for the
duration, which will be about another 30 minutes after that. So let's let
Brenda make an opening statement.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, obviously I'm extremely excited to be playing in
the first national championship game for our program here at the University of
Maryland. And I'll tell you, these kids, these players, have taken us for a
heck of a ride. We're just looking forward to continuing on with it.  
I think these players have shown time in and time out that they belong here.
And from the moment that they stepped on campus they have shown that they had
a big picture, one goal that they wanted to accomplish and they're one step
away from achieving that goal.  
I want to thank all of our Maryland fans. The amount of support that we had
here in the arena, that have come here, our fans back home, the incredible
support, the phone calls, the e-mail, the buzz that's going on around Maryland
athletics is something pretty special.  
Obviously tomorrow night we're going to have to come out, we're going to have
to have a tremendous game plan against a very talented Duke team with a
tremendous amount of depth and experience. And we're going to have to come out
and obviously be able to defend and rebound against them.  
Obviously a couple things that we're excited about, it's guaranteed tomorrow
night that there's going to be an ACC champion that's going to be a national
champion. From our end it's the fourth time playing Duke, so, again, I think
these players could give you the scouting report by heart at this point.  
We obviously understand how good and how talented Duke is. But I love where
we're at and where we're peaking and the kind of confidence we're playing
with, but Duke has set the bar in our league. They were the ones winning the
titles, winning the championship, and because of it they have all made us a
lot better and have made this Maryland team have to step up and play at an
amazingly high level as well.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the players.  
Q. For any player that would like to answer, do you find it either amusing
or insulting that the conventional notion is that this team is too young to be
having this kind of success right now?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: It is kind of amusing. We don't think that we're that young.
We don't think we're that inexperienced. We have all been playing basketball
forever. We have had overseas experience, with three of these guy, four of
these guys up here. So we're just out having fun, playing basketball, doing
what we do. And as long as we come out with a lot of confidence and keep
playing the way we have been playing offensively and defensively, we'll be
fine.  
Q. For Crystal, Laura and Shay, obviously all of those 14 losses to Duke
weren't yours, but how much of that at one point just became psychological and
do you think beating them in the ACC tournament kind of got that monkey off
your back so to speak?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: That's exactly what I said when we finally beat Duke, the
monkey is off our back. It was really tough playing Duke. They constantly beat
us. We finally got that win off and I think that mentally it's, that fear
against Duke is just gone.  
LAURA HARPER: I think that it's no longer a thing that we really dread playing
or we kind of get nervous or anything, I think it's just another ACC game that
we prepare ourselves to play. I think that beating them in the ACC tournament
definitely gave us the confidence to know that we can compete with them, we
can compete with anyone. So I definitely think that helped.  
SHAY DORON: Well, in the past obviously I just think Duke was better. And
right now I think that it's pretty even with the teams and that's why like
Harp said, we're not nervous and we have proven we can beat them and we know
we can beat them and play with them every game since this season. The last two
games we had, I mean, we had a huge lead on them at half-time that one game,
and so we were in the game with them for a while.  
So we know we can play with this team and that's the biggest difference is
we're just as good this year as they are.  
Q. Question for Marissa, do you see some similarities with the teams with
good post players and good perimeter players?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Definitely. I think we match up so well with them, we can
score from all five positions and they can to. The rebounding, the fast pace
tempo, it's going to be a very fun game, very similar to UNC.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: All right. I'm going to let them go. We'll take questions for
the coach now.  
Q. You were talking about your team peaking at the right time. Is this
essentially a hot team right now or just a team that has really found its
rhythm and groove?  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously a little bit of both. They're really gelling and
understanding whatever is working, they have understood in the NCAA tournament
if we need to go inside we're going to do that, if we need to go outside we'll
execute from that end. But I just really like to see just the amount of
confidence that they're playing with right now and just really playing
unselfish team basketball.  
Q. What is the difference, please, between the Duke team that you beat in
the ACC tournament and the team you're playing now? Have you noticed any
difference since that time?  
BRENDA FRESE: Wow, you know, I've just thought all season long in terms of
when you play Duke and try to match up with them, just they continue to have a
tremendous amount of depth, and I think they're playing with a lot of
confidence right now. I think Pokey Chatman said it pretty well in her press
conference that at one point when they were talking about Duke being down or
struggling in the ACC tournament, that we were all going head to head with
each other, us, Duke and Carolina. So I just see their seniors, their
veterans, really playing, they're poised and they're on a mission and both
teams are going to be hungry and want to win this game.  
Q. Marissa and Crystal played for Coach G over the summer. How do you feel
about that and has it made them better?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, they loved reading all the books that they got to read
this summer with Coach G and the homework assignments that she gave them. But
they really respected playing for her. Gail is a tremendous coach. I know they
learned a lot. I think it really got Marissa prepared for college. Marissa
coming in from high school, the level of intensity that needed to take place
in a practice, in Coach G's practice, got her prepared and made my job a heck
of a lot easier, with Coach G coaching her over the summer. And Crystal, she
just gained so much valuable experience being a leader, named the tricaptain
on that team.  
So nothing but positive things from them spending the time with Gail in the
summer.  
Q. I know that there were a lot of wins this season that your team could
point to as giving them confidence, but beating Duke in that ACC tournament,
did that sort of propel you to the run you've had through the NCAA?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think you can point back to so many of the key games
throughout the season. The Carolina win was pretty special at their place. But
the Duke win, as the players have mentioned, kind of was the monkey off their
back, so to speak, given the history and the tradition that Duke has had
against Maryland. And let's not forget the tradition that Maryland has had in
the past. I think people forget since it was in the '80s, that Maryland still
owns the most ACC titles and has done some pretty special things. So just
being able to get the talent back so we could be able to match up with Duke
and make it a competitive series.  
Q. I've seen a lot of basketball games, I don't think I've ever seen anybody
commit 12 turnovers in one game, let alone for a winning team. So what is it
about Kristi's makeover or whatever that makeup, that allows her to continue
to play and allows you to continue to have faith in her?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think the thing that makes her so special, as you
witnessed her having a tough night with the turnovers, but she kept her head
in the game. And how many freshmen do you know who would, or any player let's
not even tab her as a freshman, make that many mistakes and still be able to
keep their head in the game and stay poised and knock down some really key
shots. And I think we're losing sight of her effort defensively, what she did
against Ivory last night, keeping her in check and making her take difficult
shots. And then just keeping her poise for a 40-minute game. She's the
backbone of this team and she's come so far. In the past that 12 turnovers
would have affected her game and just the fact that she stayed in the game and
stayed positive with this team.  
Q. Duke has won its last two tournament games scoring more than 20 points
below its average. Do you see this as a positive sign that maybe they're a
little out of sync or a warning signal that they can win despite not scoring
80 points?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that shows you the sign of a great team when you can
pull out wins even when you're not scoring a lot of points or maybe, from our
end, at times when we weren't playing some of our best basketball and able to
pull out games, so I don't think at any point -- we have the utmost respect
for Duke, you can never underestimate them, because they're so talented, so
deep, they're so experienced, and they have one goal at hand as well.  
Q. You said something a few seconds ago, people forget in the past and you
said in the '80s about Maryland, a problem or the dilemma this sport has is
its past is always changing. In the '80s I'm not sure how many of us were
watching this. This sport had a full crowd last night and I've been where
there's no one there. What's the next step? How do these guys become a weekly,
daily, monthly event?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first it is my job to keep reminding people of history,
because we feel like it's pretty special at Maryland. But we just continue to
grow the game. And as we have this room filled with media and being able to be
our voice out there and being able to validate what a great game we have here,
to be able to have great games, in the semis and this championship game that
our audience is going to be able to view and then it comes down to the fans
and our supporters to be able to come out and be able to get in the gyms and
be able to fill this audience up.  
Q. You talked the other day about Shay committing, how crucial that was. How
about Crystal's commitment to you, coming that she was two-time state Player
of the Year, McDonald's All-American, how crucial was her commitment to the
program?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, obviously it was huge. We really felt like in the first
class with Shay Doron and Kalika France we were able to secure some of our
guard play. And then in that second class to be able to have Crystal Langhorne
when she could have chosen any school in the country, had narrowed her list.
We were in that mix with UCONN and Tennessee and Florida and Virginia and for
her to be able to say yes to Maryland, was a huge validation to our program.
And really I think opened up the doors to a lot of perspective student-
athletes and recruits out there that, hey, as they see these talented players
committing to Maryland, that Maryland is definitely a top choice.  
Q. We talked a lot about the experience factor last few days, can you
comment a little bit about Shay in that regard, her being sort of the one
that's been here there through the rise to a elite status?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought Shay played a really special game for us last
night. And really throughout the tournament a lot of negative things have been
said about her play and she doesn't need to show up on a stat sheet for us to
show how valuable she is to this team. I just thought her, her leadership last
night, she was really doing all the directing on the defensive end. Her
energy, what she is saying, what she's doing in time-outs, the amount of
confidence that she's really infusing in our players. Those are the unwritten
things that people don't see that she does behind the scenes and she's done it
all season long. It's why she's playing in the national championship game in
three years in such a short time of her career.  
Q. This sort of takes off on the last part of your answer: What was your
timetable when you got the Maryland job? How long did you think it would take
to turn things around?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I never placed a timetable. I never have been smart
enough probably to put a five-year or ten-year plan timetable to put that
together.  
When I spent my one year at Minnesota I remember walking in there and that
team had won eight games and I initially started out hoping we would win 10.
And once that team reached 10 wins in the non-conference play, we upped it to
15 and then to 20. You keep raising the bar as you see a team can handle those
expectations.  
So obviously we felt like as competitive as the ACC was, and where we wanted
to be nationally, that it was going to take obviously some recruiting classes
to be able to get in to reach that level. But I don't think you can set a
timetable or you can't measure, you can't measure a player and a team's heart.
And I think that's the thing that you're seeing with this team being able to
separate themselves.  
Q. Can you talk about the impact Alison Bales has on a game and how maybe
you can use maybe speed or quickness or something to counteract that?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think Alison Bales right now is playing at a high level. Just
watching her through the tournament she's really just been a consistent,
steady force for Duke. Obviously with her size she gives a lot of match-up
problems. And, yeah, you hope that you can use your speed and quickness to
combat the fact that she's 6'7".  
Q. Dissecting Kristi's game a little bit it seemed like you guys were bent
on getting the ball inside early in possessions, especially in the first half
and it led to a few turnovers, also seemed to work for some points. Was that
by design and can you afford to duplicate that strategy against Duke's bigs
tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: That definitely was the game plan. We felt like if we could go
at North Carolina inside, hopefully maybe try to get them in some early foul
trouble, we felt that maybe they didn't have as much depth inside compared to
what they have on the perimeter. But again, I think that you have to probably
read the flow of the game tomorrow night and from our end we usually have been
able to utilize what's been more successful, whether it's our guard play or
our post play, reading the flow of the game.  
Q. You and Gail a lot of people would say that have you a lot of similar
characteristics, meaning when you were in college both of you probably started
to feel like you wanted to become coaches. I wonder if you could sort of talk
about how much you two are alike and just the fact that you are fairly close
in age, in the same conference, and probably are going to be battling each
other for a couple decades at least.  
BRENDA FRESE: I've always had the utmost respect for Gail and I've told her
this time and time again, I just think she's such a class act whether she's
winning or in the moment of defeat she's always a class act with her opponent
and with this conference.  
And I think probably our similarities is we're both so darn passionate about
the sport, about the game, about our student-athletes, and about their best
interests. And I remember actually when I got the Maryland job Gail was one of
the coaches that reached out on my voicemail, left a message. Told me that her
job was going to get a lot harder because she obviously had been in the DC
area, she grabbed up Monique Currie, Wanisha Smith, a lot of talented players
in our area and she knew that that was going to be the first area and
territory that I was going to clamp down on, was just taking care of our home
state and our surrounding area.  
So first class all the way and it's just exciting for both of our programs to
be playing in the national championship game.  
Q. A lot was made about the kids making their first trip to the Final Four,
how about you? Were you a little anxious, nervous, coming into this weekend?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that you go through a whole range of emotions as you're
here and just thinking about the Final Four and a national championship game.
Yeah, definitely, nervous, apprehensive, then you go into emotions that I
remember yesterday kind of getting kind of choked up just thinking about what
this game meant and the meaning of it, and then actually as the days wore on
and got closer to yesterday's game, I just got a real inner sense of peace,
calmness, poise, confidence, and this is from our players' end and a coach's
end, why you've worked so hard. And you shouldn't have nerves at this point,
it should be a level of confidence, because you know you put in all the
preparation and the hard work to get yourself to this point.  
Q. When did you realize that you wanted to be a coach and you would be good
at it?  
BRENDA FRESE: Initially when I was in high school I knew I wanted to be a high
school coach. I kind of had set my goals there. And always remember my dad
telling me, "You can do more. Never underestimate yourself. You can do more
than you think." And it was really in college when I battled through four foot
surgeries when I was at Arizona, and thought I was going to play for the rest
of my life, like most players, and ended up losing most of my junior year and
then my senior year was completely finished with basketball.  
So I got the opportunity to coach at Pima Community College that year. I got
to do it all as an assistant coach. I got to coach and really felt like at
that time this was something that I really loved and didn't want to -- it was
kind of an extension to be a part of a team and to always be coaching you were
always going to be with some wonderful people.  
Q. Two things: One, what did you learn from the last three games with Duke
and maybe what will be your keys? And then second, your decision to open
practice, just wondering what that thought was.  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously with Duke you got to be able to defend, you got to be
able to rebound and they have so many key match-ups, obviously because they
have so much depth, every player that steps on the floor for Duke can score.
Their depth is tremendous. They go nine or ten players deep. So they can
really wear you down. We just have to -- obviously we have to make it
difficult for them in terms of our defensive plan and our rebounding plan.  
In terms of open practice, I'm probably different from most coaches and teams
in that I want the sport to become as visible as possible. And I feel like
that -- I don't have anything to hide. There aren't any secrets that go about
in this business and with this game. It's going to come down to who can stop
who tomorrow night. And I want to be able to give that kind of access to our
media, to still continue to get to know these players, our team, so that they
can be well received and so we can grow this sport, and grow it as far as we
can.  
Q. Can you talk about Marissa Coleman and her intangibles yesterday, passing
the basketball and also rebounding for you guys.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, Marissa was huge, close to a triple-double,
stepped up, made huge free throws for us, tremendous job being unselfish. She
was passing the ball inside and then stepping up and making some key shots and
getting on the glass. I thought her -- obviously her size on the perimeter and
the job that she was able to do on the glass, that's so similar to every
player on this team, whatever it takes to win is what Marissa is going to do.  
Q. You guys have really seemed to embrace the underdog role and keep using
the word respect or disrespect, why does it matter, I mean, as long as you
guys keep winning, why does it matter if you are getting respect?  
BRENDA FRESE: It really doesn't, I know these players in their heart they
understand and, hey, they're playing in the national championship game, but I
think that from anyone's end when you put the kind of hard work and the time
and the energy that you do in your sport, it is nice to be validated and
respected in your sport. And that's, you know, I guess the one last kind of
final stamp of approval that they're looking for.  
Q. Could you size up Newman's contributions last night and going forward,
because it seemed look she was, when you guys forged ahead, making some nice
passes inside, and not that she came from know where, we know of her, but
where is she going? Is she going to play tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Oh, yeah. I thought that Ashley and Jade obviously had a tough
game in terms of the foul trouble that they were in. Both of them. My gosh. I
mean they were so key in terms of the minutes that they did get when they were
in foul trouble, how they defended, and how they played. And I thought
Ashley's play, she's a tough, confident guard for us. And just like we have
seen all season long, different games, different players, step up and the
thing I'll credit Ashley with is she stayed in the game. It's tough when
you're in foul trouble, sometimes you lose your players and I thought she just
stayed poised, stayed confident and she's again going to be someone that needs
to come ready to play tomorrow night.  
Q. You've been able to bring Maryland to elite status in a very short period
of time. With the benefit of a top flight resources and a top flight
university, how far away do you think the women's game is from having a George
Mason and what will it take for that to happen in the women's game?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think we're continuing to keep growing this game, just like
the men have done. So we're obviously getting closer in terms of our depth,
this year you're seeing where we could have had a handful of teams here in the
Final Four. I mean I think a depth of 10 to 12 teams had that possibility. I
think that you're starting to see the resources and the support being put out
there by the administrators and we're just going to continue to grow the game.
I can't tell you how far away that's going to be, I mean, obviously, that's
where you're at, but I'm excited. Parity has arrived, look at this national
championship game and all of us just need to continue to keep working hard to
keep building it even further.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Okay. We're going to let Brenda head back to her locker room
area. Thank you.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Welcome to our press conference to discuss the NCAA's
partnership with Habitat for Humanity and a special Habitat build that's
scheduled for later this spring on in the day. With me to my immediate right
is Sue Donohoe, the NCAA vice president for Division I women's basketball.
Doug Bruno, the WBCA president and head coach at DePaul University. Lisa
Stockton the head coach at Tulane, and Lark Palermo who is executive director
of the Boston Habitat for Humanity office. We're going to allow each to make
an opening statement and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Sue.  
SUE DONOHOE: Thank for joining us this afternoon for certainly something that
we think is an exciting announcement. But more than that, it's a meaningful
tribute to one of our friends in the coaches association, and a very
meaningful way. The home team, NCAA Habitat for Humanity home team is a three-
year partnership between the NCAA and Habitat for Humanity International.
Through the Home Team the NCAA is providing volunteer relief and funds to the
area stricken during the recent hurricanes down in the Gulf Coast area.  
To date the NCAA's committed 2.5 million dollars on an annual basis to the
Home Team partnership and we will continue to provide volunteer assistance
over the next three years. It's our attempt to engage and involve our
membership and our student-athletes in the process of rebuilding an area that
was certainly devastated through the storms. To date we have had several
builds, we had a build at one AA football championship. We had a build at
Division II swimming and diving championship, and in Indianapolis this week as
the men's Final Four has been going on, they had a build and then our build
will take place in the city of Knoxville later this month.  
From day one the WBCA, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association has been in
partnership with our Home Team and when I first made the call to Beth the CEO
of the WBCA, and I said, "Beth, this is something that the NCAA would like to
do, and we would like to partner with your coaches and your membership."
Beth's response was "Count us in. We are on the team." So we're proud that the
WBCA's part of the Home Team and is going to take part in this initiative.  
The other part of the initiative that we're proud to announce today is that we
are conducting an online auction. The auction is live and it's ready to go
right now, and the items that we are auctioning will benefit the Boston
Habitat for Humanity chapter here in your home city. In working with Don
Sterling, Pat Henry, Harvard University and Northeastern University in
figuring out a way that we could leave a footprint here in the city of Boston
through the local organizing committee. It was our hope that through this
online auction we'll be able to provide benefit to the local organization as
well.  
As I mentioned earlier, the auction is live. It is on, it is live now. We have
four silver anniversary commemorative basketballs that have been signed by the
four head coaches of the women's Final Four teams that have been participating
at the Garden. Like we have one silver anniversary team that has been signed
by every member of the 25th anniversary team.  
So those items are available, you can go on. The bidding starts at a hundred
dollars for each basketball, and we're raising the increments at 10 dollars a
bid. So get on bid early, bid often and if you don't, I'll get on and bid
early and often over you. So with those comments, I will, Deb, turn it back to
you.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Okay. Doug. I think have you some comments for us.  
DOUG BRUNO: Yes, this is the ultimate time of the year for March Madness and
basketball competition. And Pokey, if you would mind just standing up and
Carla Berry, would you mind coming out and being recognized before we
introduce Lisa. In the midst of all this competition, coaches overcoming
adversity is what we do, but overcoming the adversity that these coaches have
had to overcome at the beginning and outset of their school year is something
that they don't find in any coaching book. It's something that they don't have
in their playbook. And Pokey, yesterday was, is playing for the national
championship, and she came over to the Jostens lunch to acknowledge Sue Gunter
and it was just a very just unbelievable experience for someone that just five
or six hours later is going to play to continue to fight for the national
championship.  
But she's got a perspective that's bigger than just the game and that's why
she was there yesterday. So Pokey and Carla, we just all like to acknowledge
and thank you both for seeing the big picture and also for what you did last
September as a LSU school when the tragedy of the hurricane hit. So thank you
very much for being here (Applause).  
Lisa Stockton and I have gone around and around. We were in Conference USA
together for a lot of years and some years, one year Tulane would win two, and
then two years DePaul would win two and we would fight back and forth. At the
same time, the relationship between Lisa and I was always a positive one, and
then you always knew that there was so much more there than just a coach. And
now this season again, school's going to start and Lisa and the others, other
universities located in New Orleans have to just up and take their teams and
fight for their lives just to stay alive. And go on live over at Texas Tech
and the University of New Orleans and Champaign. We have to go live at Tyler,
Texas and that's something that you just don't practice, and I, just on behalf
of the WBCA, acknowledge, thank, and just really acknowledge the stars that
you guys were this year and this season of competition and again, Lisa, we're
going to turn it over to you now and you can proceed and great job, Lisa and
you're really something special to our association. Beth Bass is going to come
up and answer questions because do I have to get back to conference captains
meeting.  
So we're going to conference captains, so Beth, if you don't mind coming up
and helping with the questions and I'm going to move on out. So Lisa.  
LISA STOCKTON: When Beth asked me to come and say a few words, you know, this
whole year has certainly been a challenge. We talked about what Pokey and her
staff have been through and all the teams in New Orleans. And I think you
really can take things for granted and just something so devastating can hit
your city. And I've been apart of a city that's one of the most established
and old cities in the country. And the university is 175 years old. And one
day it can change all of that. And we went into August just ready for our
freshmen to come in and life to start and to concentrate on basketball. Once
Hurricane Katrina came through, everything changed. And it is certainly not
calmed down since. It's been a rocky road. But I think that you look at that
and how people have handled these situations and organizations like this are
so inspiring for us.  
In New Orleans, when you drive into the city, you see a sign that says
"Recovery is a marathon, not a sprint." And I think that's what's very
exciting about this commitment from the NCAA and the WBCA and everyone
involved in this, because this isn't going to be -- people's homes and
people's lives will not get back together overnight. It's going to take a long
time. It's going to take a long-time commitment to building the Gulf Coast and
New Orleans back. And I think that we're very, very excited about this
opportunity and I'm proud of our Coaches Association for being a part of it
this.  
When our team was moved, we had four schools that took our athletic teams at
Tulane. We had a lot of damage to our campus. And we didn't know if it would
be a semester or two that we would relocate to Texas. When we were sent to
Texas Tech and those first few days after the storm, I couldn't believe how
many people contacted me or my assistants or administrators just about, "What
can we do to help?" And just at that time it was hard to tell then what we
needed. But one of my first calls was Beth Bass and she just says, you know,
"The association we want to do something, we want to do something to help. We
want to do something to make a difference," and I certainly think this
commitment is going to make a difference.  
When you're around this every day, we got going to work and I see the homes
and I work with people that don't have a home and they're not sure what their
future will be and that's when I really feel I've know about Habitat for
Humanity for a long time. And I certainly have respected what they have done
but now I feel it more than ever, just what a difference you can make in the
lives of people and I'm very excited about that.  
I think the other thing that is very special I think for people in Louisiana,
and I'm sure Pokey looking over there is in this first project the WBCA will
be working with will be dedicated to Sue Gunter. And I think that if she were
here, I'm sure this would be something that she would be very involved with
and very proud to be associated with. But she's a tremendous, has been a
tremendous ambassador of our game and just a legend in the state of Louisiana.
And I'm very proud that this will be dedicated to her.  
In conjunction with the induction to the Hall of Fame in Knoxville, there's
going to be a volunteers will build a habitat, a home to be re-assembled in
Baton Rouge, and it will be a home for a family in Baton Rouge, and I think
that's very exciting and it's a start to rebuilding, and our biggest obstacle
in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast is housing. So we really appreciate everything
that everyone has done and just speaking from people in it every day, we just
thank you so much.  
SUE DONOHOE: Thanks Lisa. Again the build's going to take place April 29th. It
will take place in conjunction with the women's basketball Hall of Fame
induction weekend and we're certainly pleased that the Women's Basketball Hall
of Fame will be a part of it. Interestingly enough, Sue Gunter is a member of
that Hall of Fame. And so there will be a lot of coaches that will descend on
Knoxville that early Saturday morning, there will be a lot of hammering, so
they say, they tell me, a lot of hammering going on but there will be a lot of
friendships shared and a lot of good memories made. Then the house will be
moved down to the Baton Rouge area, and it will be re-assembled there in May,
and then there will be another dedication service in Baton Rouge in early
June. So we're look forward to all pieces of that.  
As I mentioned earlier, in addition to that, we have begun an online auction
today and those proceeds from that auction will stay in this local community.
And we always try to come to a city and leave the city better than when we
came. And certainly that's our hope with the online auction and that the funds
that we raise in that auction will remain in this city and benefit this city.
And we have joining us today Lark Palermo, the executive director from the
Habitat for Humanity Boston chapter. Lark.  
LARK PALERMO: Thank you. On behalf of Habitat for Humanity International, and
Habitat for Humanity Greater Boston, I very much appreciate the generosity of
the NCAA and the WBCA, and also for giving us the opportunity to join you here
today.  
The teams who are participating in the Final Four have worked very, very hard
to be here. And I think it's helpful for everyone to understand that our
Habitat for Humanity families also work very hard for their homes. We're a
nonprofit organization and each family is required to participate in building
their home or someone else's home for a minimum of 300 hours. So we look for
300 hours of sweat equity from each family, as well as a requirement that they
attend 100 hours of home owner education classes.  
And after that, the families are paying off a 25-year mortgage to Habitat at
zero percent interest. So we have a lot of hard-working people, just like we
have a lot of hard-working basketball players at Habitat. This Home Team
partnership is a three-year partnership between the NCAA and Habitat for
Humanity International, which will be raising funds and providing volunteer
labor to assist in the long-term rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast.  
Currently here in Boston our Habitat has the largest density urban project
under construction in the northeast. We're building 22 units of housing in
five different buildings on Blue Hill avenue in Dorchester and this auction is
going to be a huge help to that project.  
I'm hoping it raises a lot of money. If we get a thousand or two thousand
dollars, we're in desperate need of power tools and that's probably what we
would buy. If they can raise $5,000, that's enough for us to buy cabinets for
a kitchen. And that will install a kitchen in one of our units. If we get
something like $20,000, we could easily invest it in a playground that we have
planned for our site there. And in fact, we probably could add a basketball
court. So that the children who are going to be living there, can practice
basketball and maybe be here one day in the Final Four.  
So again, I want to thank the NCAA and the WBCA for inviting us here and I
really want to thank you for your generosity. This is wonderful. Thank you.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you. Are there questions from anybody in the
audience at all about this partnership? If not, we congratulate the NCAA and
Habitat for Humanity on this wonderful project and we wish you the best of
luck. Thank you.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll allow Gail to make an opening statement and then I'll ask
you to point your questions to the players first and then we'll release them
to their breakout sessions and Gail will remain in here with me then for a
while.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just excited to be playing for the national championship. It
feels good to be able to say that. It's been a goal of ours all season long.
We're looking forward to just a tremendous game. Obviously Maryland is playing
excellent basketball and we know it's going to be a great battle.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We'll go to your questions, please.  
Q. Question for Mistie, can you talk about how badly you want to win this
championship, not only for yourselves but for Coach as well.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Definitely. For the past four years I feel like we have had
the teams that have had the ability to win, we just haven't been able to pull
it off. I think this team is more special than any team I've been on because
of our relationships we have with one another, as well as with the coaches. I
feel like together we are all like one team and we all have one vision and it
just seems that everything's being set up in the right direction and we just
have to finish it off this year.  
Q. For Alison: You played a pretty active center in Sylvia Fowles last
night. You played her to a standstill, a fairly active front court too. How do
you look at neutralizing what they do as far as quickness?  
ALISON BALES: Well, all three of their post players, Langhorne, Harper and
Perry are all really talented, really great players. And I think that we know
we have seen them a lot this season already and I think that we know their
strengths and weaknesses, and I think that we all want to do -- we'll have to
do a good job together on them.  
Q. Monique, what makes this team different than the Final Four teams you've
been a part of before?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Mainly our depth, and our balance. We have players coming in
off the bench who could very well be starting and who contribute a lot. And
our bench definitely makes a difference. When we came to the Final Four when I
was a freshman, we only had eight players. So that gets tiring playing a game
every other day for three weeks almost. So that's the main difference.  
Q. For Monique and Mistie, usually when one team beats another team as many
times as you guys have beaten Maryland, there's something more than just
physical there. Was there a point during those games when you like looked at
them and saw that maybe they were perhaps psychologically beaten, and have
they gotten some edge back by beating you guys in the ACC tournament?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: I don't think it was mental. Maryland's a great team. And the
whole entire ACC is just amazing. I think that Brenda Frese has done a great
job getting the players that she does need and she's a tremendous -- she
inspires her players to play their best every game. It's tough to be beat a
team three times in a row, North Carolina or Maryland. And we know each other
so well, it's going to be difficult to stop one another.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Yeah, we're both extremely familiar with one another and we'll
have to go out there and play hard, just like they will. And whoever wants it
more will pretty much win the game.  
Q. Monique and Mistie too, coaches are always telling players this is your
time, this is your special time to go out there and do what really you've
worked so hard for. In your mind, is this Coach's time?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I think it's her time. Most definitely. And we always talk
about or everyone always talks about that I wanted to come back so I could win
a championship. But for me, seriously, I wanted to do it for Coach G because I
know how hard she works and how dedicated she is to this program. And even
though we have been a successful program without a national championship, I
think that would definitely separate us from some of the other good and great
programs and put us in that elite class of programs.  
So this is for her. This is her team and she's brought us a long way and
developed this program into a national powerhouse, and to finally get a
national championship will definitely lead us in the right direction in taking
another step for the program.  
Q. This is for Mistie and for Alison: Looking at the two match-ups we saw in
the semi-finals, front court play really was a huge difference I believe in
both games. Can you talk about the pending matchup with this front court
against Maryland and how have they rated in terms of the front courts you've
faced in the conference and how have they prepared you for this game that
you're getting ready to play against?  
ALISON BALES: I think that Maryland is one of the most talented and also one
of the deepest. They don't have one post player that's of amazing quality,
they have three, especially in Harper and Langhorne. You have to be able to
guard both of them. You can't really help off one, you have to be able to stay
with both of them all the time.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, just playing them three times has prepared us for any
other front court that we have run into this entire tournament. All of them
are so talented and All-Americans and it just doesn't stop there. They're a
tremendous team and I think that we're as prepared as we can be at this point
in time.  
Q. This is also for Mistie and Alison: Kristi Toliver was saying that the
way to beat you guys is with speed, their front court is faster than you guys,
then they will beat you down court. I was just wondering how do you compete
against that kind of speed?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Okay. Um, well that's nice.  
(Laughter.) I think that our post players are very athletic and I think that
we have a height advantage and it's great that she says she can beat us down
the court. That just makes us want to work hard and make sure that we get the
job on defense done and that's all you really could say about that.  
ALISON BALES: I have no doubt that Kristi Toliver is faster than I am down the
court.  
(Laughter.) But I won't be playing against her, I won't be guarding her, so.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Lindsey, how has your perception of Maryland changed since the last
victory in the ACC tournament?  
LINDSEY HARDING: Again, it just shows how good Maryland is. The first time we
did play them we did win significantly, but I knew that they were going to
come back and come back stronger. We just can't sleep on them, we have to play
hard. I have a lot of respect for them and their program. And it's going to be
a hard fought battle.  
Q. Following up on Kristi, what she said, not so much what she said but they
seem to have a swagger about them, a lot of confidence, perhaps more than you
might expect from a young team. Is that because they're too young to know
better or could you sense that swagger developing over the three games of the
season when you beat them once easily and then it got tough and tougher and
eventually they beat you.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, they've gotten it done, they won big games, they bet us,
beat North Carolina, and here they are playing in the national championship.
So they earned that right to walk around like they -- walk around proud and
feeling accomplished, because they have accomplished big things, despite their
youth. They really don't play like they are a group of freshmen and sophomores
and a junior. So they need that to come out here and play. You have to have
confidence.  
Q. For Lindsey, given Kristin Toliver's comments do you feel like it will be
incumbent upon you to make sure that she doesn't run up and down that court as
freely as some people might think?  
LINDSEY HARDING: Yeah, definitely. I know that I'm going to pressure her to
make every shot of hers difficult. She's been throughout this tournament
hitting big shots for them and been playing with more confidence. So she's
been doing a great job with that. But it's definitely my job to slow her down.  
Q. For Mistie, is your dad going to keep his word and show up tomorrow?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: No. No, he's not coming. Nope.  
Q. Monique, there's a lot of story lines about you coming back and you just
answered one of those questions by saying "this is for Coach." Do you think
that maybe you're creating pressure to accomplish this for something outside
of this team, these individuals, the whole idea that you said in Bridgeport,
there's a knock on our program that we haven't won the national championship.
Is that creating kind of an external pressure that you have to deal with that
Maryland doesn't, as the upstart?   
MONIQUE CURRIE: That's a possibility. But this whole entire tournament is
pressure. And you're playing under extreme circumstances. You're playing some
teams that you're not familiar with, and with a short amount of time to
prepare for each team. So we have to prepare ourselves as best as we can, and
I think we work well under pressure and we feel like we have been the
underdogs throughout this tournament and we have come out and proved to
everybody else that we are here to play and we are here to win it all. And
that's what we plan on doing on Tuesday.  
But the pressure doesn't get to us. I don't think it has thus far and we just
play Duke basketball, and we have been successful doing that.  
Q. Question for Wanisha, you know what it's like to be a freshman point
guard when you have a lot on your shoulders, can you talk about how much you
learned last year and then what it's like having Lindsey back this year and
how good of a back court you guys have been together?  
WANISHA SMITH: It's great. I feel like my freshman year was a whole learning
experience. Knowing what Coach G wants for me and knowing how to run the team
at such an early age, and I feel like coming into the tournament with Lindsey,
it takes a lot of pressure off me and hopefully it will take a lot of pressure
off her with the way we perform. But I don't know, I just learned how to be
mentally prepared and that's kind of helped me.  
Q. For Lindsey, last night Coach G kind of complimented you on your
defensive play helping double down in the post against Seimone Augustus. Do
you feel that that's going to be another thing that you're going to have to do
tomorrow night too, given the front court you're facing or strictly are you
going to concentrate on putting pressure on the point?  
LINDSEY HARDING: It's going to be huge. Like Ali said before, it's going to be
all about team defense. Yes, we have to contain our own man, but we also have
to be in help, and ready to help our teammates out. So defensive rebounding I
feel is going to be huge in this championship game.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, we're going release you back now to your breakout
sessions. We'll take questions for Coach.  
Q. I heard you describe Mistie Williams as one of the most mature players
that you've ever coached. Can you just talk a little bit about her development
and what she has meant to this team this year.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Mistie, even when we recruited her, she was wise beyond her
years. She was the most mature recruit I ever had. She was always extremely
organized and thinking ahead and planning ahead and didn't ever act like a
freshman.  
I think she's grown into a great leader for us. And she's our most vocal
leader. She's one of our hardest workers. I think she's really developed her
game; when she came in she really didn't have any post moves and now she's got
multiple moves inside. She's become a good passer at that high post, can hit
the high post shot. And takes great pride in her defense as well.  
Q. Could you just comment on the correlation between Alison's ability as a
shot-blocker and rebounder to make you a faster team pushing the ball up the
floor?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I think Ali -- you know, Lindsey sets the tone for us
on both ends of the floor, but Ali really gets us going on both ends of the
floor. When she's blocking shots, I think it's extremely intimidating to the
opponent, and it also changes shots, it also gets our transition game going.
She gets the ball out quickly. It used to be where she would block the shots
and she almost blocked them out of bounds and now she's gotten much better,
she either blocks it and gets the rebound or she blocks it and her teammates
know to go after the ball. So she helps us.  
And when she's aggressive on the offensive end down low, that's just such a
big bonus for us as well.  
Q. You were asked the other day about the pressure involved with being a No.
1 seed again, not having any titles, you said you didn't think there was any
pressure. Why not?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Because I guess I've let that pressure go. I've let that
worry go about winning the national title. I feel like we're going to win it
at some point. I know we're going to win it at some point and so that's given
me great freedom, great confidence. I think I've learned not to try to force
it to happen.  
I think in the past perhaps I was so, I wanted it so badly for the team that I
tried to force it to happen and I found out that that's not really possible.
And just to try to control what I can, which is the preparation of my team,
and let everything else fall into place.  
Q. Could you talk about Monique's play this year and sort of that fine line
she walks between trying to be aggressive but not doing too much.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, it's a fine line. It is a fine line. And we have asked
her to really move the ball and shoot the ball less and like I said before, we
don't run many plays for her at all, which is different than we had in the
past. But the grand scheme was to make everybody feel important. So that if
and when she had an off-night, in a big game, her teammates would feel
comfortable and confident that we were still going to win. Because that they
knew they could score as well.  
So her minutes have gone down, her shots have gone down, her productivity per
minute has gone up. And she understands and accepts that that's made us a
better team. And the fact that we have really put an emphasis on our post play
this year has helped us. So she's been really the consummate leader for us in
that she's been willing to sacrifice for the greater good.  
Q. What, if anything, are you doing differently this week as opposed to
previous trips to the Final Four to prepare the team?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Not much, really. Just much more aware and have talked to
the team a little bit more about taking care of themselves, and resting.
Because it is very fatiguing and can be somewhat overwhelming, especially for
the young players with all of the media attention, and all the things that are
required of them. So I talked to them about telling their family and friends
and people that all of a sudden want to jump on the bandwagon that there's no
more room. And that we just need to focus on ourselves and get rest, stay in
the room and stay fresh and stay focused.  
Q. With what Monique said earlier about wanting to win it for you, can you
kind of talk about the relationship that you have being that she has came back
for her fifth year and overcame the injuries, decided to stay around with the
program?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I just have so much respect for Monique. I wasn't sure last
year if she was going to stay or go, if she would have gone she was going to
be one of the top draft picks and there were a lot of reasons for her to go.
She already had her degree. She could easily move on. But the fact that she
decided to stay really for her team and for her coaches as well, you know, to
try and do something really special while getting her Master's Degree I think
speaks volumes to the type of person that she is.  
Q. On Maryland's side what concerns you most, the brashness of their youth
or the fact that they can basically play free and easy because they weren't
expected to do this well this soon?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Hmm, that's a little bit of everything. They're an
exceptional team. They can score at all five positions and they got kids
coming in off the bench that are very good as well. They push the ball, they
play great defense. Prolific three-point shooting team and now Harper has
really stepped up, and really the last time that we played them in the
tournament that was I think a break-out game for her. So with the added
scoring, it makes it much more difficult to defend Langhorne. And she's very
special.  
So the fact that they are playing with great freedom, they seem to have a chip
on their shoulder while they have been here talking about respect and I don't
think anybody now could possibly not respect them. So it would be interesting
if they can still say that because in my mind they beat the No. 1 team in the
country twice. So I see them right now as the No. 1 team in the country. We're
just going to go out and try and beat them.  
Q. Could you break down maybe the three Final Four teams that Monique has
been a part of and is there something that separates this group from those?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: All I can say is probably the biggest difference in this
team and those teams we were extremely guard oriented the first two trips. And
with Alana Beard and Iciss, even though she was a post, she never scored
really in the post. She was a face-up post player, finesse post player so, we
are a finesse team, guard-oriented team and we didn't have great balance. We
had two really prolific scorers. This team, we're much more balanced. We have
got a good inside-outside attack. We made a concerted effort to develop that
post game and there's just much greater balance on our team. So that if the
outside game isn't working for us, we can pound it inside and vice versa.  
Q. You had Crystal and Marissa over the summer, what did you learn about
them and has it helped you prepare and how hard was it to let them go at the
end of the summer?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Crystal and Marissa, I mean, they're, we tried to recruit
both of them, we didn't even get in on Crystal, but Marissa we thought early
on we thought we had a pretty good shot at her because she and Monique were
pretty good friends. But they're both, not just great players, but they're
great people as well.  
So I think I spent half the time with Crystal, she would make a great play and
I would be on the sidelines cheering, "Yea Crystal," and then I would be
going, "oh my God." Because I knew I had to play against her for three more
years. So she's just an incredible player. They both are.  
Marissa, I said when we were recruiting her that I thought she was a
combination of Monique Currie and Alana Beard because she was strong like
Monique and smooth like Alana, and that's a pretty special combination.  
Q. I can't imagine there's anything new that you'll learn for the third time
around against Maryland, but can you give us your take on that impending
matchup between Harding and Toliver and how has that panned out for you in the
two previous matchups?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, the first time we played, Kristi was coming off of an
injury so she didn't start for them. But when she was in, she was extremely
productive. She came in, she hadn't hit a three in any of the games. I don't
think she had made a basket actually. She had played like five games before
our game and hadn't scored. And then she came to our game and she lit it up.
She's played very well, I think, in really all three of the matchups against
us. So they have done a great job when they get the ball into the post. I
think their post players have done a really good job of finding her and again
you have seen it, she makes big baskets for them. She has no fear, it's tough
to defend that little fadeaway that she's got because she creates space. So
you can be in her face but she take as little step back and it's hard to
defend.  
Q. Brenda said that one of her decisions to open practice today was sort of
like sort of expose women's basketball to a broader audience, can you imagine
on your answer sort of taking that hit for the good of women's basketball, the
day before a national championship?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I didn't know she had opened practice, so. No, I think that
it probably goes to everything they have done up to this point. They have
really opened up the doors, they have had the media on their bus and at their
training tables, and so it makes sense now that she would continue to do that
and her team has played extremely well. So I think I would worry about my
team's focus, but we're just in a different place, so what works for one team
doesn't necessarily work for another. But it's worked for them.  
Q. You talked about trying to force it to get a championship, what kind of
things do you think you did that might have been forcing it?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I knew Alana Beard was our best player, so we ran most
of our sets for Alana throughout the year, really because she was so good. And
when we got in the tournament I kept trying to go to Alana and unfortunately
she wasn't having one of her best nights. And instead of understanding
probably that I needed to have a team that was a little bit more balanced
throughout the season, I just, we were relying on one person. And I think too
there was a lot of stress involved because specifically her senior year we
were expected to win it. We were going, we were the No. 1 going into the
tournament. And we felt the pressure but we never talked about it, like it
would go away if we didn't talk about it.  
And I learned from that. I think to just really get a better feel for my team
and see how they're feeling, what they're thinking and sometimes they do feel
stress, and they need to get it out and sometimes you just need to talk it out
if that's the case.  
Q. In looking at the three games, the two wins and the one loss, is there
any one or two things that you look back at that game you lost and see, this
is why, this is what we didn't do that we may have done in the two wins? And
secondly, without giving away too many secrets, what do you feel is going to
be the key tomorrow night?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, in the third game we got outrebounded, so that's
always a concern for us. We take great pride in our rebounding and obviously
Maryland's an excellent rebounding team; they lead the nation. But that was
the game that we got outrebounded and they shot I think 13 more, made 13 more
free throws than we did. And in that last game, and I think it was, they were
much more aggressive than we were, attacking the basket. So therefore, they
got to the free throw line. So I think that we, they got us back on our heels
a little bit, specifically in that third game and we need to just be more
aggressive now.  
So I think the keys as always, it's not a cliche, but we all say it, it's
going to be about defense. It's going to be about rebounding.  
Q. How is your team feeling and what are they thinking? Are they nervous
going into this game? Are they feeling the weight of a great senior class
that's leaving?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No. Right now I think we're in a really good place. Even
before the game last night in the locker room while we were talking, you could
just sense a very quiet confidence. And it was good to see. And I thought we
started off real well. I think playing Maryland. And I said this when Maryland
played North Carolina, I think when you're dealing with a team that you're
extremely familiar with, I think that's a good thing. I think that for both
teams. I think that can help you forget about the fact that you're on the
grandest stage, and there's a national audience and you can just focus on the
fact that you know this team very well and there's a level of comfort when
you're playing a team that you've played several times before.  
So hopefully both teams, and I expect both teams to play an excellent
basketball game because there is that level of comfort between us.  
Q. You talked about relieving the pressure or at least not ignoring it. Was
there anything you did special to do that or to motivate the team. I know that
Maryland actually came by the Garden when they were in Boston to play Boston
College. Did you do that or anything like that?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, I've done that in the past several years and I felt like
that put more pressure on my kids, honestly. So I have done that probably on
maybe three different occasions where we were in the same city so I took them
around and talked to them. And sometimes it worked for us, we went to Atlanta,
and sometimes it did not.  
So I haven't done anything in particular.  
Q. Maryland played in the original Final Four, 25 years ago, but how do
these teams, your team and Maryland, represent the evolution of the women's
game in terms of size and speed, do you think that evolution is going to
continue at this rate or is it beginning to come into where it's going to be
sort of?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, I think it's going to continue to grow. It's amazing how
far our game has come and I think you're exactly right, you can see it with
now the size, the speed, the skill level of really many of the teams that were
in the NCAA tournament, Candace Parker dunking. You know, we are recruiting
players right now that are dunking in high school. Several of them. So it's
not just one player. I think that next year you're going to see several
players dunk. And the year after that probably even more. They're getting
bigger, stronger, faster, and I think that we're going to continue to really
grow at a very rapid rate.  
Q. I was wondering if you could comment on what a national title would mean
for this program as it relates to all the success that the men's program has
had at Duke and all the attention they have received nationally.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I think that we have established ourselves as one of
the premier programs in the country. Winning that national title I think would
just put a little exclamation point on it, and I think our men, they have been
great role models for us. And when I first came to Duke that was one of the
great lures for me was that our men's program was so successful and I thought,
well, if they can do this, and why can't we. We had the same academic, the
same things to sell, the campus, the student life, all, it's all the same.
Cameron Indoor Stadium.  
So if they can do it, you know, we should be able to do it as well. So it's
just a matter of time.  
Q. With the year Monique had as a freshman and just with everybody and then
she got hurt, was there ever a "what if" for that year because you guys were
so close and I mean, what if we had her on that team?   
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think probably at the time during that season and at the
end we felt like she could have been the missing piece, but there are probably
for every team there's wouldas, couldas and what ifs. So everybody has to deal
with some injuries. That was a significant injury for us, but we let that go
and moved forward, just like everybody else needs to.  
Q. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think Coach K went to several Final
Fours and walked away without winning a national championship. Do you see any
similarities in the past that in the paths that both of you have taken and
would you derive any special satisfaction if you win tomorrow?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Any time I can be compared to Coach K in any possible way is
a good thing. Yeah, I think, I know it took him several years, I don't know
how many, but we're just -- it would be very satisfying to win. I think that
everybody's, every coach's goal and dream is to win the national title, so
we're 40 minutes away.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Gail, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2006

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Erlana Larkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15661)

### [Ivory Latta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15658)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will allow the coach to make an opening statement and then
please address your questions to the student-athletes first.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Really proud of our team. I thought we had a great year.
Today just we didn't play well. Rebounding was a big key. We knew that was
going to be a big factor. And we just, we couldn't make a three point shot. We
actually took too many. I didn't want us taking that many. I wanted the ball
inside more, because Erlana was playing really well.  
But I think the good things are that they had 26 turnovers, and that we had 16
steals, and we did some good things. But they're tough and they, their inside
players were tough and I thought they were tough down the stretch. I felt like
we got the ball inside to Erlana there at the end and I felt like that she was
going to score and get fouled there, and I thought it was a big turning point
because that would have tied the game up. But it didn't happen, so that, but
anyway, we didn't have a good shooting night, especially from the three, and
the rebounding was a big factor.  
So I thought it was a very physical game. I expected it to be that way. But
again, we are really disappointed that we lost and we're not playing for a
national championship, but we'll have to learn from it and move on. We have
got a lot of these kids back next year. Both these will be back here and I'm
sure this will be motivation for them for next year.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the student-athletes.  
Q. Ivory, let me ask, how much effect did the fall have on you in the first
half as far as your ability to jump or take a shot or even concentrate?  
IVORY LATTA: It affected me a lot. But I tried not to think about it. I just
tried to go out there and play hard for my team and try not to think about it.  
Q. Ivory, why do you think you guys just had so much trouble getting
offense, things going offensively?  
IVORY LATTA: I think that, I don't think we had trouble, I think that Erlana
did a great job down there for us, there was a lot of calls that we didn't get
down the stretch. And I thought we should have gotten them. And like Coach
said, rebounding was going to be the key to this game and we got outrebounded.
That was that.  
Q. Ivory, could you just describe what happened on that play where you
injured your knee and were you concerned that you were going to be able to
come back and when did you feel like that was going to be so?  
IVORY LATTA: I just know I made a cut and I felt like I got pushed in the back
and I came down and I pretty much hyperextended my left knee and I just heard,
I don't think I can remember, Erlana was saying, "We need you," and that right
there, I just tried to forget about the pain and just try to go out there and
help my team win.  
Q. When you say it affected you, what did it take away from you for the rest
of the game?  
IVORY LATTA: As far as my cutting and pushing the ball up and down the court
as far as the things that I usually do and things like that.  
Q. Erlana, just could you talk about the balance side. Why were you able to
do what you did offensively?  
ERLANA LARKINS: I think they did a great job of double-teaming me. But I also
think I did a good job of finding my teammates and I tried to mix it up with
the reverse pivot and the shot and the right shoulder turn. I tried to mix it
up more, so I think that's why I was kind of successful.  
Q. For Erlana, what about the defensive pressure you faced from Maryland. Do
you think they had some more balanced scoring, more people crashing the glass
it seemed like? Did it seem like one against four at some times?  
ERLANA LARKINS: Sometimes it seemed like that, but I knew I had a five
teammates out on the court. I just think Maryland from the tip of the ball,
they wanted it really bad and they showed it out there today and they came out
with the W.  
Q. Ivory, you came down hard on the floor another play in the game, was that
from us just frustration? Was that just your body coming down? What happened
there?  
IVORY LATTA: When?  
Q. The last few seconds of the game.  
IVORY LATTA: Talking about the tie-up?  
Q. Yeah.  
IVORY LATTA: I just tried to tie the ball up. It wasn't nothing. I didn't try
to slam her or anything. I just tried to tie the ball up and she just twisted
and we both fell. It wasn't nothing at all.  
Q. Ivory, how much pain were you in and it just seemed to take a lot of the
joy out of the way you were playing and maybe your teammates, too?  
IVORY LATTA: Well, when I went down I was in a lot of pain and still is in a
lot of pain right now. But I tried not to let it affect me and I think that I
let my teammates down, you know. But like Coach said, we just got to look
forward to next year, and me and Larkins will be back and we're going to go at
it again.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll let you head back to your
locker room area. Now we'll continue with questions for Sylvia, please.  
Q. Coach, if you could just talk about Maryland. They seemed feel like even
now they still haven't really got a lot of respect and I'm sure that's because
they spent so much of this season in your shadow, Duke's shadow. Talk about
what this team can do. Obviously they beat you guys twice but what they can do
in two days here?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, they're a great offensive team, there's no doubt about
that. Their five starters are all very good scorers. But they can just all
shoot the ball. They got big bodies inside. They're just a great offensive
team. I knew we would have to score a lot of points to beat them. The two
games we played this year was 98-95 and 91-80, I believe, in the ACC
Championship game. So I knew we were going to have to score a lot of points to
beat them because they're just a very good offensive team.  
So, but you know, we'll learn from it.  
Q. Is there something they figured out about you guys or maybe they just
have a good match-up with you, have you figured that out?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I didn't feel like we were in rhythm today, especially
after Ivory got hurt. Because she's our spark that gets us going and all. I
just felt like that the energy that we normally have wasn't quite there and
when she got hurt there. And it was pretty physical out there. So, but we just
weren't hitting on all cylinders today like we normally do. I do think a lot
of it was because of when she hit the floor and everything, and Tangie was,
she was not her normal self. She was having problems breathing over on the
side and so we had to keep taking her out. And she couldn't, couldn't breathe.
And normally she gives us a lot of rebounds, and the last in the ACC
tournament she had, she usually gets a lot of rebounds and helps us a lot.  
So, but Maryland played a great game and it was just like I said, we're just
going to learn from it.  
Q. Jessica Sell hit those two threes and put you ahead for your last lead of
the game and you took her out almost immediately, can you explain that?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: No, I didn't take her out immediately; she was still in there
awhile. But she was tired. She was tired and she then, she asked to come out.
I didn't take her out immediately. But she -- and actually where we put her,
we put, let's see, we were trying to get some more rebounds, I think, but I
just took her out because she was tired and we were trying to mix it up
inside, outside. But those, there was really no -- and normally we have
several people that make threes, but we just, none of them were hitting those
tonight. Except Jess had two.  
Q. What contributed to your guys's inability to make defensive stops down
the stretch, especially a lot of them lay-ups by Maryland?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Yeah, our rotations on the back side and I felt like Camille
being in foul trouble, she wouldn't gamble, but I felt like some of our
rotations on the back side, they get the ball out of the trap and make the
extra pass, and they were getting some things off of that. So we actually came
out of those traps for a little while. But then as the clock ran down we had
to start putting more pressure on them again. But I thought they did a nice
job. We'll watch the tape, we'll come up with another scheme, so hopefully
we'll have something a little better when we play them next year.  
Q. Your trademark has been your team's ability to run but it seems like you
got caught in a half-court game. You almost chose to do that with Larkins
underneath.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: You're right, we didn't run. A lot of that had to do with
Ivory, you know, but we didn't, didn't push the ball like we normally do, get
it out and go. So you got to get the rebound before you can do that. Some of
that was our not getting the rebounds.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Sylvia, thank you very much.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL

## April 2, 2006

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're joined by Shay Doron, Laura Harper, Crystal Langhorne and
Coach Brenda Frese. We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Frese.  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, all season long this team has played with a chip
on their shoulder and I really felt like they have had to fight for respect
every step of the way.  
I'll tell you, they got a lot of believers after tonight and the performance
they put on. And just a tremendous game, obviously from both teams. But for
this team, to be able to hold North Carolina to 70 points, that was our game
plan to be able to hold them in the 70's. Just to be able to keep our poise
and our composure throughout a 40-minute game. I'll tell you, it's just a
tremendous team win to be able to continue to keep taking steps with this team
and they just keep taking us for a heck of a ride. And I think you can see by
now what makes this team and this group just so special.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Go to your questions for the players first.  
Q. Talk about the job that Larkins did inside and what you guys did to
neutralize their inside.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: She's a great player and I think she just was getting
inside position and the until the second half we tried to contain her and have
somebody help out on Atkinson and help double on her.  
LAURA HARPER: She's just, like, really hard to guard. She was getting good
position, making really good post moves. She had a really good game. We tried
to contain her and try to force her to take jump shots as best as possible.  
Q. Shay, what was the game plan defensively on Latta and can you talk about
the job you did with her?  
SHAY DORON: The game plan was to keep her in front of us at all times. She's
very quick obviously and we wanted to make sure we contested every one of her
shots and get the ball out of her hands as much as possible. We doubled on the
top screen there and we made sure that she wasn't going to beat us on that
play she beat Purdue on.  
So we just were trying to get the ball out of her hands as much as possible
and get her to take contested shots.  
Q. Crystal, the pace seemed so frantic for both teams in the first half, was
there any thought of saying, let's slow down and kind of collect ourselves?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: We had a lot of turnovers and our coaches were telling to
us relax and we were telling each other to relax. Because North Carolina
speeds you up and we just wanted to take our time and take care of the ball.  
Q. Have you guys taken any inspiration from being the lone 2 seed from
Baylor's run last year, do you think about that at all?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Our coach has said that. She says a lot that Baylor was a 2
seed last year and they won it all and we can do the same.  
Q. You guys had like two rebounds in the first eight minutes and the coaches
kind of called you out on that. Crystal, Laura, was there something you did to
get the advantage back in the paint there?  
LAURA HARPER: Well, this whole time preparing, it's been stressing rebounding
and it was a little disappointing to hear such statistics from the coaches. I
think we just kind of buckled down and said, we have to rebound in order to
win this game and we want to win, so that's what we did.  
Q. Laura, what got into you and when did you think that this might be your
night?  
LAURA HARPER: Just from the beginning. I could feel that I was like Carolina
has so many weapons and so do we, I just wanted to play confidently and have
fun out there and that's what I did. I just had fun.  
Q. Shay, can you talk about the shot you hit with like a minute left, the
pull-up jumper from the free throw line?  
SHAY DORON: I had that same opportunity the first half and I kind of read it
wrong and tried to give it to Crystal, and it was a turnover. And at half-time
the coaches were like, "That's your shot. It goes in every time, so shoot that
with confidence." And it was the same play. They didn't step up on me and I
shot it and it just went in.  
So I was just playing what they gave me. So that was about it.  
Q. Shay, I wanted to get your thoughts when Latta went down with the knee
injury, how concerned were you that she would be able to come back and how
effective do you think she was coming back off that? Was she able to cut as
well? Was she as effective as she was in previous meetings that you faced?  
SHAY DORON: Yeah, honestly I didn't really see it affect her at all when she
got back on the court. I was kind of hoping she would get back on there.
Because I didn't want any excuses later. So we're glad she got back up and
she's a great player and I'm glad she did play. And she had a good game, but
we played such a great team defense and we came out on top.  
Q. Shay, can you talk about your confidence level coming into this. You
hadn't had a particularly great shooting performance so far in the tournament
and then made some big shots down the stretch. Can you talk about your
confidence there.  
SHAY DORON: Coach B tells me that I shot about ten million shots in my career.
So I can score, I know I can score, and when I shoot it, I can't think at all,
I just have to shoot because it just comes naturally. And when I do just shoot
it and not think about anything, that's when it goes in. So I just got to keep
my mind blank and just take what's given to me.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, we're going to release you back to your locker room now.
Thank you very much. We'll go back for questions to the coach.  
Q. How you doing? Did you want to substitute more freely tonight? Seems like
it was a more frantic pace and you didn't substitute at all. They all played
an average of 33 minutes.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought that it would have been nice to -- we got into
some early foul trouble. It really, we had to adjust coaching-wise when we had
Shay and Ashley and Jade in a lot of early foul trouble. So again, we would
like to be able to get everybody involved to be able to use everyone on this
team who has gotten us here.  
Q. If someone had told you before the game that your point guard would have
two assists and 12 turnovers, would you be surprised that you won? And I
wonder why at some point you had Shay bring the ball up and it seemed more
effective, and then you went back to Toliver, I wonder what your thinking was
on that?  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. When you look at the turnover stats to see that we
won the game with 26 turnovers and our leader at the point having 12 of those
turnovers, but that's just because -- obviously how aggressive they played;
they're in your shorts the entire game for 40 minutes. That's why we adjusted
with Shay and putting her at the point to be able to relieve some of those
minutes from Toliver. But again, we didn't feel like we could go too many
minutes with Shay at the point. Just because Shay, you know, Toliver's been
the one handling it for us all season long.  
Q. It seemed like a game for big players today and less so for the guards,
how come?  
BRENDA FRESE: That's what was working. It was who could stop who and obviously
they were getting a lot of easy looks in the paint. Larkins really was
extremely aggressive, but to be able to have the X factor from our end with
Harper and Crystal Langhorne really did a tremendous job. And I think that's
what make this is team so special is they understand whatever is working in
terms of a game plan, we're going to ride and we're going to go with it.  
Q. Towards that end, I think the conventional wisdom was that you and North
Carolina wanted to run. In hindsight it seemed like that you really wanted to
turn them into a jump-shooting team or did you?  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. We wanted to try to turn them this into a jump-
shooting team as much as possible. And we also wanted them to have to take
difficult shots. We wanted Ivory, we knew she was going to score her points,
but we wanted her to have to take some difficult shots under pressure. Just
have to work for every little thing that they were going to get.  
Q. What was one thing that you wanted to do differently defensively from the
first two times, maybe something they hadn't seen out of you?  
BRENDA FRESE: We definitely did mix it up this game from before. We actually
doubled Larkins any time she caught the ball in the paint. We doubled off of
Atkinson. That was something that we were looking at just to be able to
frustrate her. I thought we did a tremendous job at times getting that double
team, getting some calls with the jump ball. And then we wanted to double some
on ball screens that they were -- we saw that screen up top was a screen that
had really given Ivory a lot of easy looks going to the basket. Sometimes we
got it, sometimes we didn't. But we knew what we wanted to do in terms of
executing it out.  
Q. You had a pretty private conversation with Kristi Toliver. I guess it was
about 12 minutes or so into the first half, what did you guys talk about? You
seemed pretty aggressive with her.  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, just to keep her head up. Sometimes she wears her
emotions on her sleeve in terms of showing her frustration. I wasn't going to
let her show her frustration in this game.  
She did a tremendous job. The pressure that she faced for 40 minutes bringing
the ball up the floor, and I just wanted to stay firm with her in the sense so
she didn't allow herself to get frustrated and stay firm and in terms of her
believing in herself and her abilities, because she's such a great player.  
Q. Could you kind of go into this No. 2 trying harder thing and how many
times have you brought it up to your players that a 2 seed can come in and win
this thing?  
BRENDA FRESE: Actually I only brought it up today at shoot-around. I heard
that actually from the announcers over to the side that -- actually from our
SID Natalie had gotten it from the announcers that the last 2 seed, the last
two years the No. 2 seed has won the national championship.  
Q. Coach, not to take anything away from the rest of the players, but it
seemed like it was to some degree a one-woman show for them and could you talk
about your balanced scoring and how much that helped you tonight versus North
Carolina's sort of one option?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought that obviously Erlana played a tremendous game.
She really, I think they went with the game plan in terms of you ride that
out. She was getting some great looks, was being aggressive on the glass, but
it was nice to be able to see from our end to have that balanced scoring when
things would break down. We had so many options. That's what this team has
done all season long, is just continue to stay and be unselfish.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Coach, thank you very much. We'll let you head back to the
locker room area.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2006

  

### [Monique Currie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15647)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Mistie Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15649)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will start with an opening statement from the coach and then
please direct your questions to the student-athletes first.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just excited to still be playing. I thought that LSU is an
exceptional team and I thought that this was one of our best defensive
efforts, really of the year.  
So I'm just extremely proud of our team and specifically of their defense. So
I just, I give a lot of credit to Pokey, they have had a tremendous year.
Excellent team, great players, and but I can't say enough about my team and
the effort that they put forth, specifically on the defensive end.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the student-athletes.  
Q. For Mistie and Monique, can you talk a little bit about the job that the
front court did, specifically against Seimone Augustus. What was it that you
did that made it so successful, held her scoreless at the half?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: I mean, we worked so hard throughout the season on our
defense because we were so offense-minded in the beginning of the year. And as
the season went on we knew that defense was going to help us win games towards
the end of the season.  
So I just give them tremendous credit. They got a job and they nailed it. And
it showed.  
Q. Mistie, I would also like to ask about the job on the Sylvia Fowles that
was done. She was not allowed to dominate the game either on the boards or on
the scoring front. What did y'all do there?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: She's a tremendous athlete. And she's got great size and
she's just dominates every game. And we knew in order to be successful that we
had to shut Seimone and Sylvia down. And it was just I think the post players
did a great job in boxing her out; only three offensive boards and I'm just
proud of our team, our whole defensive effort.  
We got a job, Coach G really trusted to us get the defensive job done and
everybody, there wasn't one letdown on this team.  
Q. Monique, you were never shy of saying you wanted to come back for this
chance, how happy are you and excited to be here?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: I'm extremely happy. I'm very proud of my teammates. I think
our win was really a team effort. And it just feels good for me because there
isn't any pressure at all for me to go out there and have to score 20 points
or anything like that. We just have a well-rounded team and they really helped
to get me where I want to be, and that's in the championship game on Tuesday.  
Q. Monique and Mistie, could you talk about the Maryland match-up in the
final and specifically Maryland's balanced scoring, how that makes it maybe a
little difficult to match up with them?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, Maryland is a very good team. They're young, but they
don't play like they're young; they play like they have been playing for years
together. They have a great point guard who leads them very well in Langhorne.
She's been unstoppable throughout the tournament, so we really have to focus
on rebounding like we have been doing, and taking care of the ball.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: That's pretty good.  
Q. Maryland obviously is your last loss before you went on this run, was
defense kind of what you talked about during that, like that little period you
took off where you came back or what? Monique or Mistie or whoever.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Definitely. Right when we lost in the ACC Tournament we knew
that there was breakdowns in our defense. And it was rebounding and our
defense. And we had two weeks, I'm grateful for having those two weeks where
we were able to just break down segment by segment and just really work on our
weaknesses. And I feel like that's really helped us with our confidence on the
defensive end. It showed tonight and hopefully it will show in the Maryland
game on Tuesday.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies thank you very much. Now we'll continue with questions
for the coach.  
Q. Just elaborate a little bit on the defensive scheme in regard to Seimone.
Did you want to have Lindsey drop off the point guard and double her if
Seimone was able to receive the ball?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Right, we did a couple of different things. We changed it
up. Initially we started in a little soft press, back into a zone. But within
our zone we had Lindsey drop all the way down to cover any curl cuts because
Seimone is so good at curling. So she, even though she was at the top of the
zone we had her drop in. And then on misses we were man to man, but we were,
she had all double responsibilities, Lindsey did, double responsibilities on
Seimone. Wanisha had Seimone with the understanding that if she did get the
ball, she needed to get her to put it on the floor so we could get a double
from Lindsey. And I just, I thought she did a great job.  
Lindsey was really incredible. The defense on Seimone was very good, but the
defense off of Seimone was probably better. Because they were the ones that
really helped any time she put the ball on the deck.  
Q. Was there something you saw on the tape that said that they were just
going to, that you wanted to give them pretty much any open outside look?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Several teams have played them in a similar fashion. You
know who the go-to players are on LSU's team. And we're not the first team to
sag off of white. She has seen that before. So we just tried to mix things up
a little bit so they didn't. I think once they become comfortable with
whatever you're doing, then they're very efficient, and so that's why we did
that. But we also changed things up and ran some zones at them as well.  
Q. It's hard to shut down one player, you shut down two. How remarkable, you
shut both down Fowles and Seimone, who have been dominating games. That has to
be even more impressive.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think that's really a testament to, one, our depth, but
our strength of the inside-outside attack. When you talk about that, you talk
about offense, but I think that truly it's our defense as well.  
Because when you double, Bales was in charge of double responsibility on
Sylvia Fowles. Lindsey had Seimone and Ali was responsible for doubles on
Fowles. So a double with a 6'5" and a 6'7" person probably they haven't seen
that all year long because we do have that size, and we have got depth to
continue to rotate fresh people on them.  
Q. Offensively did you try to take advantage of the height that you had in
the paint?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: We tried to. Didn't do a particularly good job in the first
half. I thought that we could have done a better job with that. But then I
thought in the second half we decided we were really going to Mistie early and
try and take advantage of the size. And she responded for us. I thought she
did that really well.  
Q. When Maryland pulled ahead for good then in the North Carolina game, all
the Duke fans stood up and started cheering. Almost a sense of relief that if
you were to go on to win tonight that you wouldn't have to go through North
Carolina. Was that something, did the team realize what was going on at that
point?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: No, we were in the locker room and we turned the TV off. We
were doing our own game preparation. So it didn't really matter to us who won,
they're both excellent teams. We have lost to both of them the last time out.  
So we were looking forward to playing LSU and hopefully having the opportunity
to play one of those teams again.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Gail, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2006

  

### [Seimone Augustus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14353)

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: LSU is entering the interview room. We'll start with an opening
statement from the coach.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Regardless of how disappointed I am in our inability to perform
better, it's not lost upon me how much Duke had to do with that and I want to
make sure that's clear because so often when you don't get things done, it's
easy to make it about yourself.  
So I definitely want to credit Gail and her girls for their ability to stick
to a game plan win, which maybe in their case may have been ugly for them, but
it was a win.  
But the bottom line is, the further you advance, the tougher the competition
becomes, the more locked in and focused you have to be every single
possession. It's not a game of halves, fortunate, we got into this point but
like I said, we could have helped ourselves a lot, had opportunities, I think
that it was the opportunity to cut it to six through a couple possessions it's
then double digits. I'm done.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions for the players, please.  
Q. Seimone, it might be difficult to feel perspective right now of your
career, but can you kind of put into words what your four years have been like
at LSU and your ability to go to three Final Fours?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: It's been amazing. It's a great ride. It's unfortunate, we
have been here three times and never got past the semis, but it's been a
tremendous time here. We have had great opportunities in front of us, for the
most part we came in, I did what I felt like I wanted to do for this program,
made history, and hopefully made my mark.  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Duke's defensive scheme, how they were
able to frustrate you. I saw you several times frustrated on the court and
things like that. What did they do to shut you down?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: Never frustrated. Just through the game I'm always mad if
we're not running the offense as effectively as we can. If you know anything
about basketball you could see the difference actually when we set screens,
made the right cut moves, doing the things we need to do and tonight that
didn't happen. We just were just standing around and it was easy to guard us.
We didn't make them guard us. But they did a great defensive job of sticking
to the script and doing the things they needed to do to force us into
difficult shots and turnovers.  
Q. Seimone, did you ever feel that you were forcing or that you needed to
make the offense come to you or do you feel that you stayed in your game as
much as possible?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: For the most part I felt I stayed in my game. I let the game
come to me. It's unfortunate that I didn't score like I normally score, but we
try to stay in a routine of getting paint touches, forcing them to play low
post defense and try to pitch it out. But like I said before, tonight it was
just a different story because of the way we ran our offense, it looked -- it
made it look a little bit more difficult because of the things that we didn't
do on offense.  
Q. Seimone, at half-time did you feel any frustration or was it growing at
all when you hadn't scored a point or how the game was at that point?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I wasn't frustrated that I didn't score a point. I was
frustrated at the way we played. I felt that we could have came out and played
a little bit better, had a little bit more energy. Could have fought back a
little bit more than what we did to kind of cut the lead going into half-time.  
I said this before, if I never score a point in the game and we win or we're
in a position to win, I'm fine with that. But I was just more than anything
angry at the fact that we didn't do the things that we needed to do to kind of
cut the lead heading into half-time.  
Q. Sylvia, how frustrating was it for you that they kept throwing big girl
after big girl at you and banging you around at 6'7 ", 6'5", coming at you.
How did that affect your game?   
SYLVIA FOWLES: It affected me a lot. As you can see, very frustrating that I
couldn't get a groove. But it happened. I was very frustrated and I couldn't
get no shots or do anything to help my team.  
Q. Seimone, I know that they don't have anything to do with each other but
after last night's men's game and the way that started off and you guys got in
into a big hole, did it ever enter your mind, oh no, here we go?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: No. I don't think the men's game had an effect on how we
played. We just came out and didn't do what we needed to do, and I think it's
been an ongoing thing for us, always starting out sluggish and having to come
back and make up the slack for what we didn't do in the five to 10 minutes of
the game. The men's game had nothing to do with the fact that we came out
sluggish. We were still proud of them, we still cheered them on regardless,
but we knew what we had to do and we just didn't come out and do it.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Ladies, thank you very much. We're going to let you go back to
the locker room and now we'll continue with questions for the coach, please.  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the defensive scheme you saw and the
one they threw at Seimone. Obviously it had to be one of the most effective
jobs any team has done against you. Anyone come close to that this year?  
POKEY CHATMAN: You know, I guess I would answer it saying, no, because of the
end result and the number of points she had. But it's also easy for me to go
back and see why she didn't do that, and please understand I'm crediting
Duke's defense. I could do a better job answering that more clearly for you in
the fact that we didn't do the normal things when we saw the same defense we
had been seeing for three and a half years, four years of Seimone's career.
That's the part that's difficult for me to answer.  
Credit to Seimone because she garners that type of attention. It wasn't new,
it wasn't a different scheme, maybe it was at a different time of year and
they did it a little bit better, and we didn't equal that with the same
effectiveness.  
Q. She actually only touched the ball six times in the first half, that sort
of happened for the first five minutes against DePaul too, then all of a
sudden you started settings picks and screens and getting her open. Is that
what happened tonight but no picks and screens weren't being set properly?  
POKEY CHATMAN: A couple of things. We have three rules for a cutter when a
screen is set, and that's to wait, wait, wait. And that's being patient. A lot
of times when we were setting the screen for Seimone, it's not necessarily for
her to get a touch, she just draws a lot of attention. But if you don't set
the screen at the proper angle, if you don't wait for it and then when you
come off of it, two or three players don't guard you unless other people get
going. So it was a combination of things. Seimone leads in scoring, but it's
also team offense, where there's about three or four things that go into that.
The screen doesn't necessarily have to lead to a cut but it needs to lead to a
good angle and timing. The timing was off, it was all off.  
Q. Can you put into perspective what she has meant to the university and how
much you'll miss her .  
POKEY CHATMAN: Yeah, that's easy to do. I'm a realist. I'm good at
perspective, but I'm also emotional. It will take about two seconds to give
the proper answer to sum her up: Her legacy will not be this last game. And
that's as good as I can do. But I think that sums it all up. Because I've
always talked about Seimone and her ability to elevate a program and put us in
position to be on this stage. It's just unfortunate that this last attempt for
an advancement, we fell short and the manner in which we fell short. But I
don't think it changes what she's done for the game, especially at LSU.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Coach, thank you very much.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2006

  

### [Marissa Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15655)

### [Shay Doron](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15653)

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Crystal Langhorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15654)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're joined by the Maryland team along with Coach Frese. We'll
ask the coach to make an opening statement and then we'll go to your
questions. Coach Frese.  
BRENDA FRESE: All right. Well, obviously we're extremely excited to be here.
We obviously also want to welcome Pokey Chatman and LSU to the ACC tournament
part two. And obviously want to extend an invitation out, we would love to
have them come join our league, if they would like to be a part of it.  
But we obviously feel very fortunate. We kind of feel like the new kid on the
block kind of coming in here crashing the party. Knowing that this team and
this program is obviously ahead of schedule. But I'll tell you, we're just
enjoying and loving every single minute that we get to be a part of this.  
It couldn't happen to better people. I tell you. These kids are the ones that
have taken us for this ride. They're a ton of fun to be able to be around and
I'll tell you, I think we lead the nation in smiles with how much fun that
we're having. But we are definitely honored to be a part of, it's a special
place, making history in our conference, and to really be a part of coming
here to the Final Four, and when I think back to four short years ago, when
this team and this season went through a 10-18 season, to the point of Debbie
Yow, when she hired me here at Maryland and having the same vision that we
shared together. And to be living out that dream is something that I tell you
is really a dream come true.  
Obviously from our first opponent, North Carolina, I think you could ask the
players, at this point I think both teams could give the scouting report that
they know each other inside and out. Both teams are excited about the match-
up, having split with North Carolina during the season. North Carolina
obviously has a wealth of talent and we're just going to try to go out and
execute our game plan, and we're probably the only team in the country though
that is hoping for overtime, because in overtime that's our time. So just
looking forward to getting out on the floor tomorrow night.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Thank you, Coach. We'll go to your questions now, please.  
Q. Brenda and any of the players, to what extent does the fact that you're
playing a very familiar opponent help you get over whatever concerns you have
about being here for the first time?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think it gives us a tremendous amount of confidence. You're
not having to use that first 10, 20 minutes, the first half of the game to get
used to each other's style. We already know from the tip that this game's
going to be a track meet, both teams love to score, they love offense. And I
think you're going to see a game from the tip that's just going to be up tempo
right away.  
Q. For those of us that didn't have chance to see the game with North
Carolina that you won, what went right that game in bringing that victory to
you?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that one we gained a lot of confidence. We were down by
about 10 or 11 at half-time. We thought that we had really not played a very
good first half. We didn't handle the press well.  
But the second half I tell you we came out, we boarded with them, we were able
to get a lot of second-chance opportunities. We just found a way. Obviously
everyone can remember the last second shot by Ashleigh Newman that sent us
into overtime, and the fact that going into overtime this team has gained a
lot of confidence.  
Q. Shay, in the last couple years you guys were one of the few teams that
haven't had as many problems with North Carolina's 1-3-1 press, why is that?  
SHAY DORON: I think the main thing is we have five ball handlers on the court.
Crystal and Aurelie, our post players, can handle the ball as well as
obviously the guards. And it's the type of tempo we like to play. We like to
play up and down and we kind of welcome the press. So not many teams press us
all year because we kind of feed off of that and we do well against it.  
So you just have to play smart and kind of read what happens and we do that
pretty well. And with all our experience, it just helps us a lot.  
Q. Coach Frese, how is your school's financial commitment helped you in
building your program there at Maryland over the last few years?  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll tell you, it starts with your administration. The support
that we have from our athletic director, Debbie Yow, from president Mote, you
know, they traveled to the ACC and the NCAA tournament, when you have that
kind of support and backing with your administration and your university, you
can see it across the board. If you look at Maryland athletics, every team has
the opportunity to be successful because of the amount of support and backing
that we have.  
Q. As the new kid on the block could you offer an opinion about your three
colleges who have been around the block here a few times?  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously I feel like I'm very fortunate because I get to coach
in this conference, in the ACC, so I get to go against Sylvia and Gail, so
I've been able to personally become better as a coach just from that level of
competition. And Pokey Chatman and I, we enjoy the time that we get to spend
together in the gym. The conversations that we get to have. So all three of
them, just your personal relationships and professionally, I think that you
can gain so much from watching, listening, and just the interactions that we
have been able to have.  
Q. Are you superstitious about anything and if so, what is it?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: No, I'm not superstitious at all. I just, I really don't
have any things that I do regularly. I just go out and I'm pretty, not
superstitious at all.  
Q. Shay, a few years ago when you signed with Maryland could you have
imagined being here, and what made you take the leap of faith that Maryland
would be a good place to go?  
SHAY DORON: Well, obviously me and the coach, I knew that we had the same kind
of mentality and winning drive, and the most important thing for me was the
coaches and I found that here at Maryland. So that's what really brought me
here. But from day one where the year after we had a 10-18 season, the locker
room talk was Final Four, national championship, ACC championship. So since
I've been there that's what we have been talking about since day one. And that
hasn't changed throughout the years and it's not going to change when I leave.  
So just kind of instill that mentality, that winning mentality, that we can do
it and we can play with anyone, and it's been there since I've gotten there.
So nothing's changed, it's just that this team, it's a reality and we
definitely expected it and for us it's not, you know, a quick thing and it's
not ahead of schedule for us, it's a right-on-time thing.  
Q. For the players: I realize the seeding is not comparable but at the same
time are any of you drawing any parallels to George Mason because probably of
the four teams you were the one that was the least thought to get to the Final
Four.  
SHAY DORON: Who thought that? Who always thought that? Not in our locker room,
we think that not only we're not the underdogs, but we should have gotten, we
could have probably gotten No. 1 seed at the Selection Monday show. But like
we said, the seeding really doesn't matter at this point. Everybody has to
play the same amount of games to get to the same point. We just want to play
hard and we know we can compete with any team in the country. We have proven
that time and time again. And to ourselves, unfortunately nobody really takes
notice. I don't know.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think actually nobody even thought that George Mason
would have made it to the Sweet 16 and we were expected to go further, so I
think we're a little bit different.  
Q. Coach, in light of the dramatic rise of your program over the past four
years, do you feel like your program is still maybe fighting for recognition a
little bit, within your campus and also in the community, and I wonder what
you guys, what kind of changes we have seen over the year, what you think
could still change?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that we don't spend a lot of time comparing and
contrasting. The questions that have been out there in terms of, do you feel
slighted, you know, the George Mason team and the attention they're getting
compared to your team. I'll tell you, we don't at all. We landed from
Albuquerque and we were on the front page of the Washington Post, Washington
Times, Baltimore Sun, USA Today, I mean that's some pretty big stuff for this
women's basketball team and this program.  
And the women's basketball world, I think this team has really shown all
season long that they have been fighting for the respect, just the fact that
they have known how good they are and what they're capable of doing. So we
really focus on the positives and the recognition that this program is now
receiving for all the hard work that this team has put in and it's definitely
well deserved.  
Q. Can you kind of tell me just challenges Ivory Latta presents to your team
and what you see from her as a player, what she brings to the court and the
energy to her team?  
BRENDA FRESE: I don't know if we have enough time to talk about everything
that Ivory does for her team. I mean first and foremost, what energy and
emotion as a leader that she brings for her team is tremendous. Then you go
into her basketball skills, the fact that she's one of the quickest, fastest
players from end to end. Always pushing tempo, can create for herself, for
others. She's extremely strong. Getting to the basket, being able to finish.
And obviously it's just, she's just a tremendous player.  
Q. Shay, and then Coach, what has Crystal meant to your team and what does
she do for you that makes your team successful?  
SHAY DORON: Crystal obviously is our No. 1 option and everything goes through
her and she spreads out game, especially for the guards and for the other post
players, because she draws so much attention. And the great thing is that as a
guard it's so easy to pass her the ball because you know Crystal is going to
pass it right back out when she's double-teamed, which she usually is. And we
just really trust Crystal and she's just powerful and quick, and she's just a
mismatch hell for any post player in the country right now.  
BRENDA FRESE: I think that the thing that makes Crystal so special is not only
what she possesses as a basketball player, because everybody in this room
knows what kind of talent she has, but it's what kind of person she is day in
and day out, just the way she takes care and handles her business, just how
she is about her teammates. I'll give you a small example, we were in
Albuquerque and you all watch and witness in the Baylor game, I mean, she
single handedly, her teammates were unselfish passing her the ball, she did a
tremendous job against Sophia Young and we get to half-time and the buzz in
the locker room is all about "Great job, Crystal. What a job. You know, keep
it going, "and her response is, "Thanks, guys, for passing me the ball." And
that's the kind of teammate she is; she's so unselfish. She's always about
this team, she doesn't have to score a point, and as long as we win and she
can do the little things, she's ultimately, she's an ultimate team player.  
Q. Brenda, was Shay kind of the one who kickstarted this whole thing for you
guys or a big part of that, especially getting the players you got and then
everything?  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. You think back to year one, Shay Doron and Kalika
France, who is injured, Shay was the first player in our program to verbally
commit and say yes to Maryland. And again, you have to remember, I mean she
committed to Maryland given the fact that our season we were 10-18 that year.
Her first year as a freshman, she comes in and leads this team to 18 wins. So
the fact that she believed in our vision, the fact that we had very limited
time to recruit her, I got the job in April, and we had less than what, five
or six months to be able to recruit Shay and get her to understand and believe
our vision. So I've always, I'll always remember just how special of a
commitment that was.  
Q. Coaches like to talk about the first five minutes of the first half or
the first half as being critical. In your mind what needs to happen the first
five minutes of the first half and second half to be successful tomorrow
night?  
BRENDA FRESE: We need to set a tone obviously from the tip and we need to show
that we came to rebound, that we're going to box out, because North Carolina
is so athletic, so strong, so aggressive, and we need to show that we can, you
know, that we have come ready and we're going to do battle and we're ready to
go.  
Q. I just want to ask you what kind of statement it makes for the league to
have three teams here to be able to start talking more about the ACC when you
talk about perhaps the best conferences in college basketball?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, obviously to be making history is something
pretty special. The fact that it's never been done before in a conference, to
have three teams and I think all season long everyone had talked about
Maryland and Duke and North Carolina as three of the top teams in the country,
but you didn't know how it was going to play out and what kind of success that
the teams were going to have.  
Now I think it really validates the three teams, the conference, just having
to go head to head all season long against each other.  
Q. Crystal, is there an ACC style?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think the three teams that are here, everybody plays a
fast-pace game. Everybody likes to run. And I think that's a trend a lot in
the ACC, everybody is very fast paced in the league.  
Q. For Marissa and Crystal, you guys started the season, at least in terms
of the polls, like number 14. When did y'all know or have a sense that this
could be something special?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think when we went down to the tournament in the Virgin
Islands, and I think we played really well and we played a Final Four team, a
team that was in the Final Four last year, Tennessee and we played a great
game and from that point we realized that we are a Final Four team and we can
make it to Boston.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I say the same thing. After that Tennessee game we fought
hard the whole game, and in the locker room everybody was very disappointed
because we now that game was ours, and we knew that when we played that game,
and it was in November, that we had so much room for improvement and that we
could get to the Final Four.  
Q. Crystal, can you talk about your relationship on and off the court with
Erlana Larkins and how you plan on defending her?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Well, I've known Erlana since my senior year of high
school. We were roommates at McDonald's. She's a great person. I loved being
around her when I was around her and we spent a lot of time together. We're
just excited about the match-up, I don't think I'll be guarding her, so Laura
Harper probably will, but we're just going to really need to contain her,
because she's such a great player.  
Q. Coach, I know this is not the first time this has happened, but it's four
women coaches of the four Final Four teams, and two of you sort of second
generation, you and Pokey, what does that say now about the development of
women and women in sports and women in coaching and all of those sorts of
issues?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think that you're starting to see, obviously, a change
in the game, first and foremost in terms of parity, you're starting to see a
lot of different names in teams that have the ability and the chance to be
able to get to a Final Four. We talked all season long, I mean, there were
probably 10 to 12 teams out there this year that had a chance to be sitting in
the position where we're at today.  
So never before in the history of our game have we had that kind of parity,
and you're finally starting to see a little bit of a change in the game in
terms of coaches that are retiring that have really paved the path. And from
my understanding, you know, I can reflect and feel how fortunate I am to be
given the opportunity that I now have from all these great coaches like Marsha
Sharp from Texas Tech, and Ceal Barry from Colorado, who have invested so much
time and energy to make this game be what it is now at this national stage.  
Q. Brenda, I wonder if you could talk about the team's health or injury
report. I guess Marissa succumbed to the dreaded virus the other day and how
is everyone else doing?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, let's see, of the 10 members that we have on our team,
seven of the ten had been hit with the virus. So our two healthy ones, knock
on wood, up here are Shay and Crystal, and they have not been hit. And we're
not planning on them to get hit until any time after Wednesday. I told them
they could go ahead and have that virus hit. And Angel Ross are the only
three. Aurelie is on her way out, she was inflicted with it, had to come out a
day later, couldn't fly out with the team, had to come out with the band and
cheerleaders and Marissa unfortunately was hit two nights ago, didn't practice
yesterday. But you can, as you can see by the smile on her face, she had a
little to eat for breakfast and I think she will be ready to go.  
Q. How are you doing?  
BRENDA FRESE: I'm doing great. Like I talked about, anyone who wants to go on
the Albuquerque diet and lose a quick five pounds...  
I am getting ready after the Final Four to write my book, "The Albuquerque
Diet." I think it will be a best seller. Great way to trim up before you get
out on the Final Four stage.  
Q. Coach, I would like to piggyback on something that Crystal said, she said
all the three teams in the ACC run. LSU will also run, maybe a little more
controlled, but they will run as well, is that maybe just, is that where
women's college basketball is going, a lot more running now and that type of
athleticism?  
BRENDA FRESE: In terms of the running style?  
Q. Yeah, as far as the women's game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Oh, absolutely. It's interesting as we gotten on the bus and
with the 25-year history, they have given us, we watched a lot of the games
with the old teams, watching that style of play. When you watch that film I
wish I had time to go back in the history and watch a lot of those games to
get even more knowledgeable. But absolutely you can see players are bigger,
stronger, quicker, faster, from the weight room you look at the LSU-Duke
match-up with 6'7" Alison Bales and 6'6" Sylvia Fowles, so you're not only
getting the size now, you're getting the speed and the quickness that the game
has evolved into.  
Q. Shay, what are your recollections of meeting Coach for the first time and
how is she different than the other coaches who recruited you?  
SHAY DORON: Well, I think her youth definitely clicks with us more because
it's just like you said, there's a wave of a new generation and you just kind
of see eye to eye more with that.  
But like I said, we just clicked in terms of winning personalities. Just by
having regular conversations with her and hearing about her future plans for
Maryland and all that just to me, I mean, it's just, it was very believable
and very realistic, and with the area and the whole east coast, it's just a
very recruitable school with the academics. So just like I said, just getting
to know her as a person and then in the recruiting business, you have so many
fake people and when you finally meet a real person, it's pretty easy to pick
them out and you got to just stick with that and get to know them a little
better, and I definitely felt that with Coach B and her whole coaching staff.  
Q. Brenda, as many years as you've been around the Final Four scene anything
being inside that's surprised you so far?  
BRENDA FRESE: I tell you, from a personal end, I swear every Final Four that
I've ever been to and I sit in the stands I always get teary eyed when I have
sat there and thought about the day that I would have the opportunity to coach
a team and be able to bring them here. And I'll tell you, it's something
pretty special. This is what you grow up as a little kid dreaming about. And I
know these players know this as well, I mean, to have the opportunity, the
fact that this team brought us here is something that's truly special and I
really feel like I'm living out a dream. I still continue to pinch myself and
appreciate the moment that so many people have always dreamed about and
coached their whole lives and may not ever get here. Players who work just as
hard as us that may not get the opportunity to be here. So I just want to
appreciate the moment to be able to be a part of something pretty special.  
Q. For any of the players that want to comment, just being a slightly less
experienced team than North Carolina, I just want to know how, what basically
having a win here in your pocket against them how that helps mentally going
into a game like this?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: With our youth, I just think we play fearless, we have
nothing to lose when we go out there; we just go out there to have fun and our
win against them at North Carolina, that game was a lot of confidence going
into the rest of our season and we lost to them in the ACC tournament and we
learned a lot from that game, and watching film and seeing that we lost the
game with rebounding and with our defensive effort. So I'm looking forward to
the game tomorrow night.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: All right. With that we're going to let them go. Thanks.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're joined by Coach Goestenkors and Alison Bales, Monique
Currie and Mistie Williams from Duke. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach and then go right to questions.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just excited to be here as I'm sure all the teams are. It
was certainly a battle to get here. And I think when you look across, we all
had at least one game that we really had to fight through that came right down
to the bitter end to determine who would get to the Final Four.  
So we are extremely pleased to be here and looking forward to playing LSU.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: And we'll go to questions.  
Q. Coach, three teams from the ACC and all three top three in the nation in
scoring in points, do you think this is the kind of venue for the style of
play of ACC and has it always been such a fast-paced style in the time you've
been there?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: It's grown. The style of play has certainly improved. I
think it's always been a running conference. I came from the Big-10, I was at
Purdue for several years and at that time it was more physical conference. And
when I came to the ACC, that's the first thing that I noticed is that there
was much more running and pressing in the ACC.  
I think the teams have just continued to improve from top to bottom.  
Q. Coach, I would like to piggyback on that question slightly, is the
running game instead of a trend, becoming the norm now in the women's game?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think more and more, you're seeing it more and more. I
think that the players, I think again it all comes back to the high schoolers
that are coming into college. They have been playing since they were in third,
fourth -- organized basketball now since third, fourth, fifth grade.  
So they understand the game and it's a much more exciting game. The fans like
it, the players like it, so I think we're seeing much more of it. So I do
think it's a trend.  
Q. Monique, you've stated before how you came back for this year for a shot
at the national championship. Can you elaborate on how much it means to you.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, it means a lot to be back here. I think we worked really
hard this season so that we could prepare ourselves to make this next step.  
It's been a goal of ours since the beginning of the year to win a national
championship and to get over that hump of getting past the Elite Eight and
finally making it here. It means a lot to me and it means a lot to my
teammates.  
Q. Gail, is there a moment you can point to, kind of an a-ha moment where
you said, it's not just us in the ACC anymore, there's other really good
teams?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't think a particular moment, I think we started to
see, probably not this year but last year, we have been pretty good for
several years and North Carolina has been nipping at our heels. We had beaten
them 12 straight times going into last year. So I think last year Maryland
gave us a good run and North Carolina beating us three times, I think that's
when we could see, we knew Maryland was young and they had good recruits
coming in and the rest of the teams were very competitive as well. So we felt
like -- I knew going into this year this would be the best year for our
conference. Clearly.  
Q. Coach, financially, your budget at your school, has it, have you seen
increases over the last three or four years in that budget or have you had the
money from day one to be competitive in the ACC?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think the budget continues to increase. I really don't pay
attention to it. I know I go over it every year, that's about all I know. So I
do what I think is necessary for us to be successful.  
My athletic director, I see red lines all over the budget. He hasn't done
anything other than that to me thus far. So it's worked out all right.  
Q. Question for Monique: Who inspired you to play basketball and why?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Who inspired me? I don't think I can like, necessarily pick
one person that inspired me. But in my neighborhood everybody played
basketball and at school everyone played basketball, so I just did that. And I
enjoyed it. I played in rec leagues from when I was in the third grade, and so
it was something that I was pretty good at and I enjoyed playing, so I just
started playing because everyone else played.  
Q. For the players, as students and athletes at Duke I wonder if you could
talk a little bit about how distressing the events are that are going on at
your campus right now and how they may impact you.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're not going to address any other questions regarding that
topic at this press conference today, so we're going to have to move on to the
next question. Next question.  
Q. For Gail, Connecticut slowed the pace down, obviously, and you called it
the prettiest ugly win or whatever it was. Do you expect more of the same in
the first game here being that there's only one team here that's not in the
ACC?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't think so. I think that when you get to this point
everybody, you know what got you here. You stick with what you're good at, and
LSU is a tremendous transition team. So I can't really see them letting the
air out of the ball at this stage in the game. They're too good for that.  
Q. The coaches talk about the first five minutes of each half being very
crucial. In your mind what do you need to see in the first five minutes of
each half to point towards success tomorrow night?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think aggressiveness on both ends of the floor. But also
poise. You want to say aggressive but sometimes you're so excited to get out
there that you turn the ball over. So you want to stay aggressive, have that
attack mindset, at the same time you want to show the poise necessary to take
care of the basketball.  
Q. Would you just offer a brief comment, please, on the other three coaches
in this tournament.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think Pokey Chatman has just done an incredible job
considering the adversity that their program has gone through over the last
several years with the loss of Coach Gunter and then with Hurricane Katrina. I
can't even imagine all that they have been through and she's really handled it
with great style and grace. I think she's an exceptional coach.  
Brenda Frese, she's one of the up and coming coaches in America. She is
extremely passionate and highly motivated. Does a great job getting her teams
prepared and making adjustments throughout the game. And I just have the
utmost respect for her.  
Then I think Sylvia Hatchell, she's Coach of the Year this year and I think
deservedly so. I don't think anybody came close to her this year in what she's
been able to accomplish with her team. They play, I think, one of the most
exciting brands of basketball in the women's game. I think that people love to
watch them play. I think they're good for TV as well.  
I think that they will get people that aren't typically women's basketball
fans, if they just tune in for a little bit, and see them play, I think that
they will come back for more. And I think she's just done a tremendous job,
really, with her team and this season in particular.  
Q. Question for Coach: How do you rate LSU's defense and do you see
improvement from the team that you played last year?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Most definitely. I think we're both improved defensively.
And I watched the game that we had with them last year and it was like a
slugfest. We were both, we walked the ball down the floor most of the time and
our defense, we both had numerous breakdowns defensively. I feel like we're
both in a different place now. We're both much better and specifically I think
Seimone has really improved her defense and Erica White, there's been a lot on
her young shoulders, but I think she's handled it tremendously. And she pushes
tempo, but she also does a great job pressuring the ball on the defensive end
of the floor. Then Sylvia, I think, last year she was still learning the game.
She was a great athlete, but not necessarily a great player. This year she's a
great player.  
Q. For Alison, can you talk about the particular challenges Sylvia will
present for you. You're one of the few players that she will have played who
is a little bit taller, she may be a little bit quicker than you, what are the
challenges and what are you going to try to do against her?  
ALISON BALES: Well, like Coach said, she's a great player and I think that our
whole post group will share the responsibility for guarding her. You will see
me and Chante, we'll all give her different looks throughout the game.  
Q. Can you just comment on that a little, please, Coach?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: She's, like I said, she's just playing a tremendous
basketball and she's improved her skills. She might be one of the most
improved offensive players of the year this year, from this year to last. So
as Alison said, I think it's going to take a team effort. And we don't
anticipate stopping her, that's not an issue for us, we know that's not really
possible, we just need, hope to contain her. And it's not as much her scoring
that really breaks you down as it is her rebounding. Because when one
individual gets 15 to 20 rebounds, it's very demoralizing for a team.  
Q. Coach, how important is this game for you personally just maybe get over
the hump and get this program winning a few more of the big games?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I really don't feel like it's important at all. I think
being able to get to the Final Four four times is pretty nice. I feel very
good about it. I know that our team is going to continue to be successful
throughout my career and so I'm not, I don't feel the pressure of trying to
win another game or win two more games. I know that we can. And my job is to
prepare my team the best way possible for them to do that.  
So, but other than that, I really don't feel any pressure.  
Q. Gail, do you feel that the rise of the ACC and North Carolina in
particular is finally allowing the women to sort of get their due on Tobacco
Road, or do you feel that you're still sort of fighting for recognition down
there with all of the tradition of the men's basketball?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think that we have had such great teams and in the
triangle area in particular, NC State, they were in the tournament again this
year, but they have been to the Final Four as well. So I think it's been tough
for us because we have great men's basketball teams, as well as women's
basketball teams, so and we love it because it's, we're a great basketball
school, and we really support one another. At times I think it's hurt our
attendance probably at all of our schools and media attention as well, because
there's only so much space in the paper and sometimes I think that with fans
they pick and choose what teams to cheer for and which games to go to.  
So we're hoping now that since there aren't any men's teams still playing in
the ACC, that perhaps some of them will, that haven't been women's basketball
fans but are Duke fans or North Carolina fans, will now watch the women's
teams play and hopefully come back for more.  
Q. Coach, I just want to ask you about rebounding. I know when you had that
stretch at the end of the regular season where you really weren't playing your
best ball. You were pointing to turnovers. But you're on pace for a tournament
record for rebounding and I want to know what's behind that or what you've
been doing differently to rebound as well as you have?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well since the end of the ACC tournament that our main focus
has been rebounding. So we have done -- many days we do warm-up drills, that
it's, 10 minutes of just rebounding. Totally breaking down the rebounding,
making sure we do the little things well. I thought we got to the point where
we were just trying to outjump people. In certain games you can do that but in
the big games you can't get away with that anymore, and we learned that the
hard way. And when we don't box out, we have been making players run. Since
the beginning of the season we hadn't done that. So we went back to some of
the things to make sure that the emphasis was to do the little things well in
the rebounding category and it's been paying off for us.  
Q. Mistie, for you, talk a little bit about the balance that you have to
have when you come to the Final Four, you want to have fun, there are
distractions, you got to focus and work hard, just balancing that, all that,
and if you could follow-up with how maybe Coach helps you guys stay a little
loose and enjoy it all.  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's really important for us to really remain focused.
I remember my freshman year there's a lot of hoopla and a lot of stuff going
on and it's really easy to get caught up in all of it. I think that just with
the seniors, we're just going to be focused on keeping everybody under wraps
and letting everybody appreciate all of the things that are given to us and
all of the attention that we are getting, but at the same time we are here for
one thing and one thing only.  
And I think that Coach, we really haven't talked about it, but we can have fun
with each other and not necessarily worry about what's going on around the
Final Four and just stick together. Because that's what has made us so
successful is that we are here together and we have accomplished something
great, but we're not finished.  
Q. Monique, could you talk about what Alison has done to become a more all-
around player?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, I think she's just a lot more aggressive when she's on
the court, offensively and defensively. Last year we used to stress that we
wanted her to be more aggressive on the offensive end because she would be
aggressive on the defensive end, but then she wouldn't really demand the ball
and this year she's really done a good job of doing that and I think she's a
lot more confident, which helps her in games and be more willing to take
chances or make a move or shoot the ball when she gets it.  
Q. Is there a time you remember when she really demanded the ball?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, um, I don't know a time in particular, but when she
pulls me over and it was like, "I was open, you could have given me the ball,"
then I know that she really wants it and she wants to do something with it.  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about the impact that Abby Waner has
had in the tournament and whether she's been everything you expected or more
than you expected.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think Abby's, she's played her best basketball right now,
which is exactly what you hope for as a coach. I think she came in playing
great basketball and then she lost her confidence a little bit, which happens
with freshmen quite often. But she always remained positive and she fought
through and she never lost faith in herself. And I think that was huge and I
think her teammates really helped her through as well.  
But every time she shoots I think that as a coach and I think her teammates
believe it's going in. Sometimes it was to the point where we believed more
than she did. But I think that they helped her and we all tried to help her
understand that one, she can't be so hard on herself, which she is, she's a
perfectionist, and two, that she needs to shoot for us to be successful. And
we believe in her and I think that now she is believing in herself again,
which is important.  
Q. How big an impact has she been in the tournament?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, she's been huge. When she came in and she, last two
games in particular she's hit big shots right away when she came in. Even
though one was a bank shot, which she did not call, it was a three and it gave
us momentum and she had a big old smile on her face and that's what we needed
to see, that she was relaxed and ready to play and believed in herself.  
And even just the way she's carrying herself, even if she doesn't hit a shot,
she's carrying herself with such confidence and poise that I think that it
makes us all better.  
Q. Gail, and the players, what's one thing you have to do differently
against LSU compared to last year in the Regional?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Well, I think last year we had eight players and when I
watched the tape again I could clearly see we ran out of gas. So I think that
this year we need to use our depth to our advantage. Last year it was a
disadvantage, and this year I think it could be an advantage for us.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Any of the players? Any different answer? If not, we'll move on.
No.  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Just win. That's different.  
(Laughter.)  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Good answer.  
Q. Gail, can you think back to '99 when you as a new coach of a Final Four
brought a team that hadn't been to the Final Four before, what's that
experience like, say, from when you win a Regional final to maybe that first
moment when you're here. Can you talk about that.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think that the first year, in '99 when we came for the
first time it was coming off of a huge upset win over Tennessee. And so the
elation of that game was such that it almost overshadowed the fact that we
were going to the Final Four. Because it was a David versus Goliath, so that
was a huge story.  
So it was a totally a whirlwind from that point until we got here. And I don't
think I actually ever came down off of cloud nine until I was back home after
we had lost to Purdue in the championship. So I almost didn't have time to
really catch my breath and understand what was happening to us. And once you
get here for the first time, it is really, truly overwhelming with all of the
media exposure and all of the events that you're required to go to, the game
itself is just two hours and probably it's the one thing that you actually
want to do is play the game, but everything that surrounds it is extremely
overwhelming.  
Q. Gail and any of the players, what does Augustus do better than any other
player you faced this year, and do you think she's the best player in the
country?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Seimone moves without the basketball and reads screens
better than any player in the country.  
If she's the best player in the country? I think we have got a pretty good
player here as well. I think she's certainly one of the best players in the
country. It's hard to compare all the players because they all do something a
little different, we're comparing point guards, wings and posts.  
Q. Question for Monique: Could you talk about the way that LSU defended you
last year and what did you learn from that experience?  
MONIQUE CURRIE: Well, Hoston guarded me last year and I'm pretty sure she will
probably guard me again this year. She's an excellent defender, she's long and
she's aggressive. She was all over me for the entire game and I just think I
need to do a better job of moving when I don't have the ball and definitely
setting up and using my screens to get open, because that's the only way I
could probably shake her off, because she is a really, really good defender.
But we set good screens, so I'll have to use those.  
Q. For the players, after the losses to North Carolina there's been a
perception that Duke may be the more talented team but maybe is not quite
their match in terms of physical and mental toughness. How do you respond to
that, that maybe you're more finesse than toughness? Have you worked on that
or is that something that you accept?  
MISTIE WILLIAMS: I definitely don't think it has anything to do with, like, a
mental toughness. I definitely think with our size and the way the style that
we play that it's not as finesse as you're stating that maybe you've heard.
Our team is very physical and we play with a lot of heart and a lot of
passion. I just think that on those typical occasions, those occasions that
you're speaking of we just had defensive breakdowns and let them get on runs
and really didn't capitalize on their weaknesses and let them play to their
strengths. So we just really had to come back and kind of bring everything
back and just collect, and just kind of reflect on what we could have done
better and how we were going to change it. And I think that that two-week span
where we didn't play, we really just capitalized on how we're going beat any
team that we would face in this tournament.  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the 12 straight wins against North Carolina and you
guys are had such a good run there for several years in the ACC, do you feel
like that that has helped the whole ACC get better? Do you feel like the rest
of the programs realize they had to compete with that and that's brought
everybody up to this level?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I do. I feel like, and the other coaches told me that in the
ACC that they had to, they felt that they had to do a better job recruiting to
compete with us. Because we did go on that run where we won 50-some straight
games and I think that it really, it was tough at the time I'm sure for them
but at the same time it made them better because they knew the type of player
we were recruiting against Tennessee, and UCONN and they needed to recruit
against us as well. So I think the entire league has really stepped up its
recruiting efforts and you can see that when you look down the line the last
couple of years at the top recruiting classes, several ACC teams have been in
the top five.  
Q. Gail, you talked about just no men left for the ACC, but has it created a
buzz even within your area within Durham and Chapel Hill and then also within
the conference itself having the three teams?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: It has. Our entire conference I think is so proud and we
talked in the preseason about the fact that we had several teams we thought
could make it to the Final Four and that we thought we had the best conference
overall from top to bottom, but until you actually back it up in the NCAA
tournament, it's just all talk.  
So now I think that our commissioner, he's here, and the assistant
commissioner are here and I think they're so proud and to be the first
conference to have three women's teams in the Final Four I think is pretty
special.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: On that note we'll say thank you very much to these ladies.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2006

  

### [Seimone Augustus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14353)

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Scholanda Hoston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15651)

  
_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We will let Coach make an opening statement and go to your
questions. Please raise your hand so we can get a microphone to you.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Obviously we're extremely excited to be here and we have been
asked a lot of questions about being the third trip and, no, it does not
diminish it. It's just exciting and it's a credit to this team and what keeps
you focused on everything is the fact that you have a formidable opponent in
Duke waiting. The fact that they lead the nation in scoring, second in plus
rebound margin. Presents several problems to you, inside attack, outside
attack. I could go on and on.  
I was speaking to someone about game goals and that is to play a 40 full
minutes of Lady Tiger basketball, because that's what's needed this time of
year.  
Q. This is a two-part for Scholanda and Coach Chatman: Scholanda, how much
of an advantage is it to having been here three consecutive years? And Coach,
how much of an advantage is it to having a player like Seimone in this
environment who can take over and kind of win a game for you if she has to?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I think it's a bit of an advantage, just in having some
experience. That plays into being able to help our younger players along.
Everybody except for Kristen Morris was here on the team last year but a lot
of them didn't get the minutes as Seimone and myself did, and Sylvia too. And
just being able to talk to them and kind of coach them through and settle them
down a little bit, like Erica White playing a tough point guard position and
really this being the first time that she's having to carry such a heavy load
in such a big environment on such a big stage. Just being able to be her
support and help her through that.  
POKEY CHATMAN: I'll start with the Seimone question, because that's the
easiest one. Seimone, Seimone is Seimone and she's a joy to watch grow.
Obviously on the court because that's the part that gets rewarded the most,
but just as a person and how she's infected, affected, effected this team and
not at the expense of the team, and part of the reason why we're back here, we
all become better coaches, when we get players like Seimone Augustus. But just
in terms of being here again, just to expand a little bit on what Scholanda
said, I think it's huge in terms of the process of events that take place up
until the game. We understand it's going to boil down to 40 minutes of action,
it's going to take place in between 94 by 50 feet lines, but just in terms of
getting everyone ready and enjoying all the moments, because it's so unlike
anything else, but we enjoy it every time.  
Q. If there's one similar theme for all four of these teams it's they all
seem to run well or at least play very good transition basketball. Is that the
direction that the women's game seems to be going in general and is that a
good thing?  
POKEY CHATMAN: It's a good thing because generally what starts that transition
is a sound defensive effort in the half court. And that's a compliment to kids
at this level buying into that end of the floor, because it's not often
glorified. You credit them and you credit the coaches for making that a point
of emphasis. But we're okay with it moving in that direction because it helps
you utilize every facet of the game. It's no longer a half court game, it
involves every inch of the court.  
Q. Coach, this is your third straight year in the Final Four, I'm sure
there's a comfort zone, but in a way do you feel like an outsider to an ACC
party?  
POKEY CHATMAN: The comfort zone, that's for you guys to write about. It sounds
a lot better, it doesn't feel comfortable because of the field and that's just
a compliment to Duke, Maryland and North Carolina.  
I think it's tremendous that a conference could put three schools in this
event. And we can make jokes about it, I think I did last night, but that's
just a compliment to what they have done. You don't feel like an outsider
because at the end of the day it's the basketball game and everything you work
for for so many years coming up to this point.  
Q. My question is for Coach Chatman, how do you and your players prepare for
a big game?  
POKEY CHATMAN: Several things go into that preparation. The obvious is the
basketball, we watch a lot of film -- I'll back up.  
We rest. We make sure we feed them well. We practice a lot. We watch a lot of
film. We talk about those things. We emphasize everything that's gotten us to
this point and most importantly we enjoy it.  
Q. Sylvia Hatchell spoke for a few minutes about her relationship with you
over the last couple of years. Could you talk about that and also your
thoughts on the other coaches in the Final Four here.  
POKEY CHATMAN: Yes, through Sue I always felt like I knew everyone because she
knew everyone so I would hear all the stories from the Nike trips and how fun
they were, but I always felt like I knew them and I had to remind myself that
I really didn't; it was from a distance.  
But I remember when I was first named head coach in the Nike trip was in Tahoe
and of course they all had the gist of it, so they were enjoying it, having a
good time, golfing, on the yacht, and I was working trying to get my staff
together and I had a little bit more on my mind. But I just remember every
morning, every other morning just meeting up with her and having conversations
with her. It was a definite comfort level. I remember having conversations
with her husband and how welcoming she was just to talk basketball and share
some Sue stories with me and it's just a lot of respect, you respect them from
a distance and now to be up close and personal, I'm still kind of getting used
to being mentioned in the same breath as some of these coaches and what they
have done. I feel like I've been doing it for a couple of weeks and they have
been doing it for a couple of decades.  
So it's a compliment to me and you talked about the other coach, I mean, you
know, look at what Gail has done at Duke over the long haul and it keeps going
in an upward swing direction. And the record speaks for itself. And everything
Brenda's touched, she's turned to gold. And it's not a surprise to us that it
worked with her. All summer we watched the effort and I guess that's part of
the reason why they're all here.  
Q. For Coach, could you talk about Duke's rebounding prowess in the
tournament. They have had numbers in the 50s and 60 performance. What have
they changed from last year?  
POKEY CHATMAN: I don't think you change, I just think as a coach of Gail's
caliber, you find an area that you want to improve upon and you have players
that want to improve and want to get better and it's a mindset. And it's
obviously something that they emphasize. They made a living off of it in terms
of adding something else to their arsenal. And to me it's a mindset, because
we all can emphasize it, but until they buy into it, it's not really good,
it's just on paper. And it's a compliment to those players that want to
participate in the not so glamorous portion of the game because they
understand the significance of it.  
Q. For Seimone, I assume you came back to school this year for the chance to
win the NCAA title, and would you feel complete if you did not win it?  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Yeah, I still would be feel complete. I'll be disappointed,
but it wouldn't overshadow everything that's happened here at LSU through my
years here. I would still feel good about the situation and the fact that I
made the decision to come here and do the things that we have done as far as
making history here.  
Q. Sylvia Fowles, I would like to ask you, it's not that often, I don't know
how often I should say, that you play somebody in similar in height like
tomorrow night with Alison Bales. What is that like with somebody who has at
least an equal ability in size?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Believe it or not I like competition like that. I like somebody
who is taller than me, who I'm going and banging on. Alison Bales is just a
perfect match for me and we have to go out there and do what we have to do.  
Q. Wanted to ask the players, the SEC for a long time has been the premier
women's basketball conference and a lot of people are making a lot of the ACC
getting three teams this year, do y'all feel any extra incentive being the
lone representative from the SEC, a non-ACC school to try to win, and also
being Seimone's last year here and Scholanda's, to try to get that victory in
the first round?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: We want to do this for us. It's about going out there and
playing our best basketball. Laying out there what we're capable of. I think
we have all the tools necessary. We have the players, we have the coaches, we
have the game plan, we have Coach Starkey who stays up all night and breaks
down film, and he's the best at it. We have everything we need. And I think
that's the important thing. And that's the reason why we feel like we're
extremely capable of going out there and doing it. All those other things,
they're good story lines, and they will look nice on paper, but when it comes
down to it, it's everybody that's within this circle we want to do it for
everybody in there.  
Q. This is for Coach: Somebody said the other day that you would try to slow
Duke down kind of sort of the way that Connecticut did. Gail said she didn't
see you coming out of what got you here, that the transition game is what
you're kind of about. Without giving away too many secrets, is it your plan to
just play your game and just and let things fall as they may?  
POKEY CHATMAN: I don't think there are any secrets. I think we have 16 tapes
on Duke. It's never by design to slow a game down, you just go back and
evaluate how you've been effective. You can run in transition and not
necessarily get a shot out of it, and then make seven or eight passes in the
half court. It's not something that we're going to emphasize and say, don't
take a shot until under 10. It's not one of those things. It's just we have
been most effective when we have run half court offense and made the
opposition defend us to get to the free throw line. And if that means the game
ends up in the 50s or 60s, that's an area where we have been good, but it's
not something that we're going to try to emphasize.  
Q. This is for Seimone and Pokey: A lot of the national media has kind of
grasped on to the Katrina story with the men's team, and they have been
showing that, I'm wondering how many of that do you actually get, have you
gotten a lot of questions, comments considering that and is it something that
you feel you're playing for? Scholanda just said you're playing for the
school, do you also feel some state pride as well?  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Always. We want to represent our state as best as we can.
And, yes, we do hear a lot about the Katrina thing. And I think that helps
motivate us. We witnessed everything that happened firsthand and the way we
had to, I guess, adjust and adapt to that situation, only helped us with our
season as far as focusing in on what we have to do. Just those adverse
situations, it was much easier for to us come out here and play for this
extended period of time. The Katrina victims, they really helped inspire us.
We were able to go out and speak with them, try to help as much as we can. So
we feel like to some extent that we can give them two and a half, three hours
out of the day just to enjoy a good basketball game, that's what we're going
to do.  
Q. Coaches often talk about the first five minutes of each half being
relatively crucial, in your mind what do you need to see in the first five
minutes of each half in order for it to be a successful night tomorrow
night?  
POKEY CHATMAN: Not to take away from your question, I think coaches are
probably thinking of it more in terms of the first possession, because that
sort of sets the stage. You play in five-minute increments, you're playing to
be short. Compliment to the field and where we are, you know, we talk about
trying to make every possession our masterpiece. That could be on offense or
defense. And that's the approach we have to take. And that's the compliment.
How we want to play against Duke.  
Q. Coach, Scholanda and Sylvia I'm wondering if you can all answer the
question, is there something called the Seimone factor and can you describe
what that is?  
POKEY CHATMAN: How long is this press conference?  
(Laughter.) You guys get to witness a very small portion of the Seimone
factor. So much of what she's doing is signature Seimone and it's not that we
don't appreciate it, it's just normal. In the locker room, at team functions,
the star player being the biggest cheerleader or the silliest one on the team.
There's several things. And I'll compliment Seimone how she's grown as a
person, athlete, through this team, with this team, the community, and she's
the child that Baton Rouge raised. And to see her on this stage, to continue
to elevate her game is a compliment to her and we're all better people,
including Seimone. And she's always throwing it back at us because certain
times you get a player of her caliber and because of prior star players have
maybe certain expectations, and she extinguished them immediately. And that's
what separates her.  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Don't make me say good things about her in front of her.  
(Laughter.) Oh, I think that the biggest thing is outside of the basketball
things, I said this before, that all the trophies and the awards and the
accolades, I don't think that's what defines her. I think that the way she
carries herself with all of that weight is what defines her, just being so
humble and just not making you feel like she wears that all the time.  
I have told so many people we practice and play with her every day and you
forget sometimes that she's the national Player of the Year and this trophy
winner and that, because she just doesn't exude that every day and makes it
this big, big deal. She doesn't have the huge ego that she could walk around
with because of who she is. I think that's the biggest thing.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I kind of agree with Scholanda and Coach Chatman. Just the
person she is and all the weight she carries on her shoulders, you really
wouldn't know that she's the national Player of the Year, once you're around
her every day. But just her goofiness off the court and it just sets her aside
from everything.  
Q. Seimone, how good is basketball in Baton Rouge? Youth basketball, high
school. I know the men's team has some players, too. Does that city get enough
respect, because I don't think people think of that as being a basketball
hotbed.  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: Oh, you have to put us on that. Let me see how I can put it.
In past years we were on top, but now we have declined a little. But we can
take on any Miami girl. We can beat anybody in Miami. But at the time when I
was coming up it was a very big part, basketball was the key thing in Baton
Rouge and we, I mean, that's mainly all we did. You see a lot of kids at the
parks and rec centers, wherever we could get a game, that's where we would be.
And I think like Coach said, that this helped me, the city of Baton Rouge
raised me.  
Q. Question for Coach: How important will your bench players play in this
game? Last year your bench players when you played Duke played a big part. How
important will that be this year?  
POKEY CHATMAN: Huge. I think that one of those bench players is now on the
starting five. I think Sylvia had 13 and 11 last time out. And we struggled
and she was a difference maker in that game. I think it's huge. But I think
every coach would say that, even more so for us because so often we have to
hear about Sylvia and Seimone and I think we're a two-man roster sometimes,
and that's early in the year. You get to this point, everyone understands that
there's a reason why those kids are at the forefront of what you do
offensively. But I think from Florence Williams, I mean everyone, you know,
just in terms of how we need to play in order to be successful is why they're
important.  
Q. For Scholanda, I guess, so often this year you played as the favorite,
you're going into this game as the underdog, you said before you didn't need
any extra motivation, but do you like that challenge at least?  
SCHOLANDA HOSTON: It's welcomed. We still have to go out there regardless and
play good basketball. This time of year, I don't think there are any
underdogs. These are four great teams that all want to walk away from here
Tuesday night with a national championship. And that's what you have to go out
there and fight for. You have to go out there believing that you're going to
go out there and play your best basketball and that you're capable of doing
that. When you put that on the floor, that's what has to be done. You're going
to have two great teams going against each other, where no numbers are going
to matter.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Any final questions? If not, I'm going to let them go. Thank you
very much, ladies.

_BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS_  
  
DEBBIE BYRNE: We're going to let Coach Hatchell make an opening statement and
then we'll go to your questions.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I believe you were a former coach. Giving all the
information. That's good.  
We're, of course, like all the other teams, excited to be here. We're just
enjoying the experience and having a lot of fun. This is a special team, as
you can tell. These young ladies up here, and we're just excited about playing
a great Maryland team. We have already played them and we know what a great
team they are. So it should be an exciting game tomorrow.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Questions.  
Q. If there's one thing that seems to tie all four teams together it's they
all run well, at least they are very good transition teams. Some of it is ACC
style, but is this also now the trend in women's basketball?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well I hope it's the trend in women's basketball, because I
like it. But you're right, that's a very similar characteristic of all the
teams; they go up and down the floor, run the ball well, they all have a
strong inside-outside game. And just good balance, good flow. And I think all
four teams here are a lot of fun to watch play.  
So I agree with you 100 percent.  
Q. Coach, to flip the coin on that, how important will it be for your team
to execute in the half court set if Maryland is able to take you out of the,
or at least not take you out, but at least limit your abilities to run?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I think Maryland likes to run too. They score a lot of
points. Our games this year it was 98-95 and then 91-80. That's a lot of
points for both teams.  
Plus I think it's great for women's basketball that people see the talents and
the skills and abilities of all the players. But we're known for our fast
break, but of course if you know our team, and our coaches, we keep a lot of
detailed stats and records in our grading charts and all that. And actually
our percentages in the half court offense are above 50 percent this year. So I
really think that we have executed well in our half court offense, especially
when we had to. Now, yeah, we like to fast break, but when we need to run a
half court offense, we have executed well, especially in pressure situations
down the stretch. And especially in some recent games.  
Q. Sylvia, as the dean of the coaches here, would you just offer a comment
on your colleagues, especially the young Coaches Brenda and Pokey, please.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, dean, man, you make me feel old.  
(Laughter.) The only time when somebody says dean that I think would make me
feel real good is they compare me to Dean Smith, to tell you the truth.  
But it's an honor to be here and I think we got a lot of good young coaches
now out there. Pokey was a great player and took over for Sue Gunter and just
again, she has brought her expertise as a player to the game. Her intensity or
her passion. I've gotten to know her real well in the last few years. We have
a special relationship. We have talked a lot about on Nike trips and other
times about transition game. I think we have a lot of the same philosophy with
motion offenses and defensive concepts and stuff, so I really have enjoyed the
relationship I've built with her.  
And then in our league, you know, the team or the coaches, it just gets better
and better every year. I know a few years ago we played Minnesota, whenever
Brenda was there, we played them in the NCAA tournament and we beat them in
Chapel Hill by just a point or two. And I said right then, you know, I told
Minnesota they better take care of her or somebody is going to grab her and
they did. But Brenda has done a good job at Maryland and she and I have talked
about a lot of things. She's asked my opinion about some different things, so,
but it's great for the game, especially in our league.  
And of course Gail has been at Duke awhile. And we're just big rivals, but we
have a healthy rivalry. We have tremendous respect for each other and our
programs and I think we make each other better. So it's just a lot of fun
right now to coach and to see a lot of the younger players coming, a lot of
the younger coaches coming through and actually last night at the banquet and
I was thinking about a lot of the young former young players that are now into
coaching and some of them that are assistant coaches other places and I was
just thinking that a few years from now a lot of these kids are going to be
head coaches, so it's a lot of fun to see them carrying on their passion and
love for the game.  
Q. Coach, you obviously have a lot of success then you had a stretch against
Duke where it was kind of tough. What turned it around for you and you just
talked about how you made each other better, what did they do that made you
better?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, it's called Alana Beard graduating is what it's called.
It was hard for to us beat them when Alana Beard was there. But again, like I
mentioned, I think in our league, not just Duke, but all of our teams, we make
each other better. The level of our conference competitively has increased
tremendously in the last few years and it's not just Carolina, Duke and
Maryland, I mean Boston College was almost here; we got a lot of great teams
in our league.  
So, I think that again, you know, we have gotten some great players and in our
recruiting the last few years, I think our style of play fits our players. And
as a coach, when I was younger, I wanted to prove myself as a coach, but with
different things that we accomplished. Now I don't have to prove myself as a
coach, the main thing now is I just want my players to experience success and
I want to see the smiles on their faces. I want them to have fun and I want it
to be one of the best times of their lives and I just want to help them grow
as basketball players and as people, and that's where I get my enjoyment from.
So I'm having a blast.  
Q. What are the things that your team has to do to match up against
Maryland?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: What do we need to do to match up with Maryland? Well, maybe
we need to recruit you.  
(Laughter.) Well, we have already played them a couple times and I just think
there's a lot of good one-on-one match-ups on the floor, at every position.
They're outstanding and we are too, I think a lot of the little things will
make a difference, I think it will come down a lot of it to rebounding, and
just whichever team the ball is going in the hole for tomorrow.  
Q. To the players, Maryland was the only team that defeated you this year,
do you think whatever questions you had you solved in the ACC tournament title
game or are there still some things you have to be concerned about tomorrow
night?  
IVORY LATTA: Could you repeat the question, please?  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Maryland was the only team that beat you this year. When you defeated
them in the tournament game do you think you solved all the holes they might
have found or are there still some things you as a team have to be concerned
about tomorrow night?  
LA'TANGELA ATKINSON: Well, since we lost to Maryland, we improved in practice
and we got better throughout the game. So just improving throughout practice
and the rest of our games we kind of solved everything during practice.  
Q. Coach, with Ivory, do you almost have to suppress some coaching instincts
with her, I mean there are things you would maybe normally tell a player not
to do that you have to let her do? And I think maybe the answer is yes, maybe
Ivory might want to comment on this too.  
IVORY LATTA: That's for the coach.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I think with accountability and responsibility, when
you show those characteristics, you get more privileges. And Ivory has proven
herself to me when she came in as a freshman. I let her make a lot of
mistakes, because I knew that it was going to pay off in the long run. Of
course she was skilled when she came in, her ball handling was excellent, her
three-point shooting was excellent. But I think that her knowledge as a point
guard, her decision making, just her experience, the experience in our league
has just paid off tremendously for Ivory, but I've coached her long enough
that we can look at each other and pretty much know what we're thinking and
she knows what I want done out on the floor, and I can make a little gesture
to her and she knows exactly what I'm talking about without saying anything.
But again, because she's been accountable and showed responsibility on the
floor and decision making in pressure situations, then I give her more freedom
because she's proven herself.  
IVORY LATTA: Yeah, right. I think Coach pretty much said it all. But it comes
down to, I think it all goes down to confidence and she has a lot of
confidence in me and that right there just builds up my confidence to go out
there and perform to the best of my ability, but I'm just happy that she's
given me the opportunity to go out there and do the things that I do. That's
my girl.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. Sylvia asked Gail this question just a little while ago, but do you feel
like the rise and the success of the ACC has finally kind of allowed the women
to get their due on Tobacco Road or do you feel like you still need to fight
for recognition, considering the tradition there?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, basketball is basketball and our men have had a
tradition for a long, long time. And it's just, there's just no rivalries and
there's just nothing like ACC basketball. I grew up a men's basketball fan.
That's one reason why I wanted the job at North Carolina.  
It's a wonderful environment to be in. You just can't express what the feeling
is like when you're in the area we're in, of course on our campus it's
tremendous. It's just such an honor to be on that campus with former coaches
like Dean Smith, Bill Guthridge, now with Roy Williams there, it's just so,
it's a basketball coaches heaven, paradise really, and then with all the other
coaches coming in, I've made friends with a lot of the coaches, of course all
the women's coaches, but men's coaches too. A lot of them when they come to
town they will call me up. Bobby Cremins and I are good buddies, and Dave
Odom, he's out in South Carolina, so it's just a wonderful feeling, I guess
you could say with the relationships that we have and I don't look at it as
men and women's basketball, I look at it as ACC and basketball. I think the
women have really put the ACC on the map this year with three teams being in
the league. And I'm telling you, the ACC women may be better next year. I know
you think, well how can it be better, but it could be better because I think a
lot of the teams are going to be even better next year.  
So, but all the coaches get along well, it's a tremendous relationship that we
have, yesterday some people were asking a lot of questions about us and Duke,
you know, yeah, we're eight miles apart, but we have a lot of respect for each
other and we make each other better. I think one reason why we're both here is
because we make each other better.  
So it gets some attention at times but I think both teams do really well to
keep things in perspective. And we really, like I said, we both have
tremendous respect for each other.  
Q. For Ivory, you've been on TV enough now that you're a recognizable face
around America. And you really are emotional on the court. Some people have
said that sometimes it looks as though you're showing up the other team or
like Diana Taurasi before you, people kind of have a negative impression, some
people, and a lot have a positive impression, can you comment on that?  
IVORY LATTA: No, I just came to the conclusion. No matter what I do, people
are going to say the things they want to say, but as long as I'm out there
having fun and enjoying myself and my teammates enjoying it, as long as I'm
not doing anything to hurt my teammates or disrespect my coach or my school,
I'm just going to keep doing it. And until coach says, hey, you know, don't do
that anymore, then I'm not going to do it. But she knows from the bottom of my
heart that I'm not going to go out there and do anything to disrespect the
other team or disrespect the university. I'm out there having fun and I'm
going to keep doing it. My little dances, my smiles, my anything, I'm just
going to have fun out there. That's what she always tells us before we leave
the locker room is main thing is to have fun. And that's what I'm going to
keep doing. Yeah.  
Q. Coach, along those similar lines can you kind of put into words what
Ivory does, both with her play and her mentality to kind of help the team and
also you've kind of compared her ease in front of the camera with I think a
Marian Jones, the last point guard, can you kind of expound upon that too a
little bit?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, first of all, Ivory is a great kid. And let's start
with the foundation, because I'm very southern, as you can tell, and there's
an old saying "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." And she has a
wonderful family. Her mother and daddy, just the environment she grew up in,
we had time I could tell you about her home visit, that must have been what,
close to a hundred people at her house there. And the whole house was full, we
had the windows up, people were sitting in the windows, they were sitting on
top of the furniture, it was just unbelievable. We had a big feast, a big
feast. And it was on Sunday, went to church together and then went to the
house, all teachers were there, and family members and all the boys that used
to play on the court with her. It was a wonderful day. What a great time we
had.  
But Ivory is first of all, she's for real. She's for real. And she has a heart
and a passion for the game of basketball. Ivory is very concerned about her
image. She wants to project a strong positive image to everyone that is
involved with the game. She has tremendous respect for everyone on the court,
the opponents, the referees, the media, everyone. She's just, I think she's
great for the women's game right now because she's such a positive role model.
And she's very concerned and very aware of little kids. If she's in a big room
full of people, I mean, even if the president of the United States was
probably in the room and there were little kids in there, Ivory would go to
the little kids. I don't know if she's drawn to them or they're drawn to her
because of her size.  
(Laughter.) Stop kicking me, Ivory. But she's just has a heart and a passion
for the game. And again, even though Ivory gets some individual awards, she's
really all about her team. She wants to uplift, to lift up her team and bring
recognition to them. And just the example is that the ACC Tournament there, in
the final game, when the clock was running down and she called her, one of her
teammates that had played a great game. Erlana and gave her the game ball,
wanted her to have the game, the ball the last few minutes. And then when they
gave her the MVP award, she looked at me and says, "I don't deserve this,
Erlana does." And I said, "Well, tell her that."  
So she's always lifting up her teammates and trying to make them better and
just a great kid. And her excitement and enthusiasm and passion for the game
it makes people smile. It makes people feel good, it makes people smile. I
can't tell you the number of letters and phone calls and e-mails we have
gotten from people that have just said how she brightens their day.  
And again, and I'll finish, and I know I talked too long here, but I've been
coaching a long time and one of my main goals, well right now the first goal
is to win games for the University of North Carolina, but second of all is
promote the game. And I feel like the way we play and having a player like
Ivory sells the game of basketball. Because I want people to fall in love with
women's basketball. And that's one reason why we go up and down the floor.
Because I want them to score a lot of points and make it exciting and fun. I
don't like low-scoring games. I made the comment, it's sort of like watching
paint dry. I like to go up and down the floor and that's what we're all about.
I don't like slow games.  
Q. I'm going to hold you to five minutes on this one. Seriously, Coaches do
talk about the first five minutes of each half. The importance of the first
five minutes of each half. What do you need to see in your mind in the first
five minutes of each half for it to be a successful night tomorrow night?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Intensity. Aggressiveness on offense and defense. The
intensity level. And we have started this year mostly well. We did not start
well in the Purdue game. But then in also a few games in the second half we
come out of the locker room not with the intensity level. I call a quick time-
out and then we get to the intensity level that we need.  
So I think just the intensity level that we come out with on both ends of the
floor.  
Q. Coach, for three teams to be from one conference, do the stars kind of
have to align to get these teams all here?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, it's interesting how all three teams got here, but I'm
not surprised at all. Because they all deserve it and they're all very, very
good. So I'm just glad we're all in different brackets. So we could be here.  
I'm not surprised at all. That is just how good our conference is. And it may
be even better in the future.  
Q. Ivory, I could tell by the look on your face that when she was describing
the home visit that's pretty much how it went. Can you explain why everyone
was there, I would think you would want to have that to yourself?  
IVORY LATTA: Yeah, that many people I think that was pretty much my whole
town. So I don't know. I just know that they have been following me throughout
my whole career at North Carolina and they're very supportive and I just know
that when I told them that North Carolina was coming, everybody just wanted to
come. So my mom, she cooked up a big feast for everybody and we didn't know
that many people was going to come. People started showing up that I ain't
know who they were. I'm like, all right, they coming with North Carolina
shirts on. Well, I'm like you know what, just go ahead and enjoy yourself.  
But they have been very supportive with me throughout my career. And I just
can't thank them enough for the things they done for me.  
Q. Coach, do you think in the past women's players more reluctant to show
emotion on the court and was there more so than men's players?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I don't know. I never really thought about that, to tell you
the truth. I don't know. Maybe you ought to ask the players that. I don't
know. I'm usually not speech less, but I don't know.  
LA'TANGELA ATKINSON: I don't know.  
IVORY LATTA: Oh, I think it's great for the game to be honest. Because they
say a lot of women shouldn't do a lot of things and men are able to do it, but
whenever we go out there and show emotion and just show our passion for the
game also, and we like to go out there and fight hard and dive for balls and
hustle and play with a lot of intensity. So without emotion in the game, I
think that it would be pretty much boring, yeah. I think I think that sums it
all up.  
Q. Just a follow-up in that vein: Isn't it fundamentally sexist to criticize
women for doing what in the men's game would be celebrated as attractive
flamboyance?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I don't know. I would have to think about that a little bit.
We just try to do what helps us be successful. In being emotional on the floor
and showing our, like Ivory said, our passion and enthusiasm for the game, it
helps us. And I'm going to tell you, we enjoy it. We show our love and our
heart and our passion for the game and for each other and I let our players
have a lot of fun out there. They enjoy the experience and they enjoy each
other, and the chemistry on our team is absolutely incredible. Just because we
got a lot of great players on our team, but they know that they are ten times
better with each other than they are by themselves.  
So they work really, really hard just to keep that chemistry going and to let
each other know how much they appreciate each other. And I think that's real
important. They are constantly giving words of affirmation and affirming each
other and how important they are. So, but the emotion out there, I don't know,
I just know I used to think that men's coaches in women's basketball they
could carry on on the sideline and if they got a technical, that was fine. No
big deal. But if a female coach got a technical, then, oh, you know, that
was... and I know, I've felt that way. So maybe that's in the same ballpark, I
don't know. But all I know is that we're going to play with a lot of heart and
passion and have fun.  
Q. Coach, just wondering if any of North Carolina's opponents came up with
any creative schemes to stop Ivory and slow the transition game down, any kind
of novel defenses?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, let's see, trying to think. We have played some great
teams. They played a lot of good defense. Tennessee put a big player on her.
We have had some of them do that. I think that from my perspective as a coach,
as teams try to double her or put a big player on her, or different things
like that, then I'll tell her we'll run something to get a mismatch or make
them switch off, or if it's a trap, then we'll do something to let her break
the trap or I have two point guards in there lots of times, if you watch us
play, then the other one will bring it up the floor and then that -- if there
are two of them trying to guard her, then somebody is open.  
So again, we have had -- I tell you, when we played the first game in the NCAA
tournament, Riverside. Yeah. And it was at Vanderbilt and we sit underneath
the baskets, there the benches are on the end and so we were sitting
underneath the basket and I noticed that when they would shoot the ball, all
five of them just took off running to the other end of the floor, but none of
them went for an offensive rebound. I looked at my assistant coach, I said,
you think they were afraid of our fast break there? All five of them, not a
one of them went to the offensive boards. They would shoot the ball and take
off. All five of them. So I felt that was interesting.  
(Laughter.)  
But I don't know. There's a lot of different strategies you can use. But
again, Ivory is not our whole team. We have got a lot of good players on the
floor. Camille can play point guard if she needs to. Sometimes she brings it
up the floor because she throw it in for us. Tangie can bring it up the floor.
We put Tangie in the middle, we give her the ball and then she attacks the
basket. So we have a lot of things that we can do. So it's just not Ivory.  
DEBBIE BYRNE: Thank you very much, ladies. Appreciate your time up here.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Shanna Zolman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14374)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Tennessee, the 2006 SEC tournament
champions, Coach Pat Summitt, Sydney Spencer, Candace Parker and Shanna
Zolman._  
_Coach Summitt, if you would._  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, obviously, this was a very tough battle for both
teams. A great basketball game I'm sure to watch. A challenging one to play in
and coach. But when you look at the two teams, I just thought that, you know,
possession by possession, both teams played really tough, both offensively and
defensively.  
For our basketball team, this had to be our best defensive effort of the year.
I can only tell you that I'm extremely proud for this team because I've been
-- obviously, I'm always talking about we got to play defense. I think defense
and boards really helped us win this game. Without question, the two keys to
why these young ladies cut down nets.  
I'm excited for them.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions._  
Q. Candace, Hoston was talking about defending you on that last basket you
made. How difficult a shot was that for you? Was it a shot you felt you had
nothing left to take other than that one or do you feel real comfortable with
that particular move?  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, in the closing seconds, coach told me to dribble out a
little bit of time, and then run our -- play our isolation play and go one-on-
one. They can't help hustle these two people besides me because there's such
great shooters. Shanna hit the two before. It was just one or one with me and
her. I knew I had the height advantage over here. I just took it and shot over
her. Fortunately it went in.  
Q. Shanna, at the 55-50 mark, you were on the floor. You looked up at the
scoreboard and called your team together and talked to them. If you remember
that, can you share what you said at that time?  
SHANNA ZOLMAN: What was the time?  
Q. 55-50. You looked up at the scoreboard and went into the circle to
talk.  
SHANNA ZOLMAN: I think I was just talking about -- I was just trying to go on
a run. Coach was really trying to emphasize throughout the course of the game,
going into the game, how much LSU was a running team, how much they make runs
and go in spurts in different parts of the game.  
They had just gone on one, so we were trying to come back and counter with
that one ourselves. I was just trying to gather the team and try and just
emphasize defense at that point, just being able to make defensive stops so we
can be able to turn that into offensive points at the other end.  
Q. Coach, obviously coming down towards the end, you didn't call timeout,
didn't hold for the last shot. Is that a situation where you have the ball in
the right person's hands anyway? What's the thought process?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: You know, in most of my coaching years, I've called
timeout. But I've found it very difficult at times to get the ball back
inbounds, particularly against a great defensive team. I happened to be
watching our men play at Florida, and Florida called timeout, never got the
ball back.  
You know, things like that stand out in my mind. Coach K, which I have
tremendous respect for, he never calls a timeout in that situation. You just
have to trust your team. I think I've changed my philosophy in probably the
last three years about feeling like I've got to call timeout and manage. If
you prepared your team and you got good leadership on the floor, let 'em play
because a lot of things can happen trying to inbound the ball on the
sidelines, which we saw at the end of the game.  
So, you know, I trust this team to make those decisions.  
Q. Fouls can take away so much of a team's offensive. Could you address the
fact that Parker's versatility, her ability to go out, shoot from the corner,
what that does for you in that kind of situation?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I've said many times that I think
Candace Parker, I don't think there's any question who the player of the year,
freshman player of the year should be. People are talking about all the names
out there. In my opinion, there's only one that can do what she can do.
There's some great people that can shoot the basketball on the outside, post
up on the low block.  
But her versatility, and we ask her to play the point position, we post her
up, we let her face up. You know, there's so many dimensions to her game that
it's very difficult for teams to say, "We're going to stop her because she's
going to be on the low block." Where it is much easier with our inside people,
for them to double. But when Candace is in the game, she always gets other
people open.  
I mean, just like with Shanna and Sid, you know, it's very important for them
to all be content on playing well together, not be concerned about who's
scoring, because there's nights that Candace has led us in assists, and
obviously Shanna and Sid have both benefited from that.  
Q. Shanna, company you talk about the three-point shooting for you tonight,
how important it was, particularly what Sidney was able to do in the first
half?  
SHANNA ZOLMAN: Yeah, I told Sid, she's going to give me a triple double today
because of helping me in my assists. Sid was able to knock down a lot of open
shots from the outside, and they were being very, very aware of myself on the
outside, Candace inside, doubling down the post because of the post presence
that they have brought the entire tournament as well as the regular season. I
mean, we've emphasized and gone inside against Auburn and Georgia, and they've
dominated inside.  
I knew that that was definitely going to be another focal point for us. When
that wasn't going as well as it has in the past, Sid stepped up tremendously
from the outside. She had a lot of open looks, was able to knock them down.
They carried on into the second half, as well. But she definitely stepped up
big from not only three-point area but two-point as well. Myself, just trying
to knock down open shots whenever I had 'em, when we needed 'em, as well.  
Q. Pat, a week ago you're trying to explain a loss. Here a week later, you
get another championship. Can you describe the process that's taken you
through this week, how challenging that's been?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, obviously the loss to Florida was probably the one
from my standpoint as a coach was the most disappointing. That and obviously
losing at Kentucky. I just felt like, you know, for whatever reason, we didn't
get motivated to play two unranked teams. That's where you have to be very
careful that your team -- that they respect every opponent.  
The defense just let us down. It was painful to watch on tape, those two
games, the lack of commitment and competitiveness on the defensive end. We
talked about it, talked about it. Obviously, Monday and Tuesday we had what I
think were productive defensive workouts. We didn't work a lot on our offense
before we came here. We worked a little on our press offense.  
It was great to see them carry over. They have to take ownership. A basketball
team, you can manage practice any way you want to as a coach, you can control
everything on the floor. Come game time, they control it. I think that's the
thing I was very proud of, is watching them play defense with passion, making
things work, sorting out when we were maybe switching when we shouldn't
switch, just identifying the big three players we had to guard for LSU.  
I'm really pleased. I hope this would be a carry-over into post-season.  
Q. Sidney, can you talk about what was going on for you offensively, in the
first half, but all night getting the looks you were able to get?  
SIDNEY ZOLMAN: I think particularly in the first half, we just broke their
presence. I know a couple of my stops came from they were trapping a double
team. She kicked out, hit me. Candace was trapped with the ball, came out and
hit me.  
Other than that, I just think my teammates were finding me in transition. LSU
wasn't matching up on me. They weren't as concerned about me as our post
players. Our post players have been anchoring us inside and putting up the
numbers they needed to do. They weren't matching up with me.  
Q. Going into the tournament, you're about seven three-pointers away from
the all-time school mark. What are your thoughts on that? How much ask that
kind of weigh on your mind? Is it something you think about going into this
stretch for you at all?  
CANDACE PARKER: Not at all. I don't even think about it. Actually, I just read
it right now. It's not something that crossed my mind. The only thing I ever
think about going out is how I can lead my team to a victory. Individual
accolades has nothing to do with any thought process in my mind.  
Q. Pat, what do you think this does for you seeding-wise? Do you think you
maybe have a No. 1 here? What do you think?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I think this team deserves a No. 1. Now, whether we're
going to get it or not, that's up to the committee. It's not like we're
dodging bullets when we schedule. We play everyone. I think when you look at
this conference, you look at what Florida did, Florida beat LSU and Tennessee,
so obviously they're a quality basketball team. I really felt like if we could
win the tournament, that we should get a No. 1 seed, and in particular just
looking at our RPI, I mean, I think we've done all we could do, certainly this
weekend in particular to position us for a No. 1 seed.  
Q. Pat, I know no game is just one moment, but a game like this seems to
come down to a make, a miss, a turnover, and the other team is going to make
the other team pay. Is it just maybe you made LSU pay for not making a shot or
not coming up with the rebound at the last minute?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I think in a game like this it's a team that
obviously has an opportunity to have the ball last and win the game because of
it. You know, we chose to foul. We knew we'd get the ball back more time to
score. I guess I trusted our team offensively. I thought we struggled during
the second half. Our offense had really not been real efficient.  
But it's just a matter of, you know, how the game plays out and which team
executes and gets the breaks. You know, LSU is a great, great basketball team.
I just think you're looking in this conference at obviously two teams that
have played in this game the last two years. It's been games that could have
gone either way.  
Q. Coach, a secondary concern, but do you think you may have knocked LSU out
of a No. 1 seed tonight or do you think you both should be able to get that?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I think we both should get a No. 1 seed.

## March 5, 2006

  

### [Seimone Augustus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14353)

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Scholanda Hoston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15651)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From LSU, we have Coach Pokey Chatman, Scholnda Hoston,
Seimone Augustus and Sylvia Fowles._  
_Coach Chatman, would you like to open up with a statement._  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: No. I didn't know I ever had a choice. No, I wouldn't
mind opening with an opening statement.  
You know, so often we get lost in things, this basketball game that has such
elite athletes on the court, it gets lost in the shuffle. So often the mental
to physical as four is to one. And the mental part of that is for as close to
40 minutes as possible, whenever you face a tough opponent like Tennessee, you
have to carry the game plan from the practice floor, from the locker room,
from the huddle onto the floor. Often we didn't do that. Some of that was
related to Tennessee, some of that to us.  
I credit our team for still putting ourselves in a position to have a shot at
winning the basketball game. But when you give up 10 three-pointers in this
environment this late in the year, it's going to be a struggle, uphill battle.
But I credit the kids for battling back and making a basketball game of it.  
We don't want to be good. I want to make that next step to being great.
Mentally we'll get back to Baton Rouge, we'll work on that and we'll be a
better basketball team.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. You talk about giving up 10 three-pointers. Half of those were to
Spencer. How much of a focal point was she coming into the game defensively?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: You know, it's scouting report defense. That's her
comfort zone. She's obviously a threat from a three, try to make a play off
the dribble, don't lose never her in transition. Four for four in the first
half, if I'm remembering correctly. They were wide-open looks.  
Some of that continued. We also gave up more looks in the second half. We were
lucky they didn't fall. Can't be lucky from here on out. If not, you pack it
up and you go home.  
Q. When you had the ball about 35 seconds left, did you expect them to
immediately foul? If so, did you ever consider having Seimone bring up the
ball?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: Well, a different day, Seimone would have brought the
basketball, it wouldn't have been a foul. It a chess match from there on out.
Erica White has done a good job of hitting free-throws. It's one of those
plays where you take that chance. Seimone's shooting free-throws pretty good.
Maybe a double team comes, she gives the basketball up, and somebody else gets
fouled somewhere else. So that's the chess match for the basketball game that
you have to play.  
Q. Seimone, when you took that last shot, it looked from the sideline there
might have been an opening to the basket. Did you not see one? What did you
see at that point?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: It wasn't open into the basket. Spence, I believe, I don't
know which player it was but she held off. I didn't want to take a chance at
drawing a foul, losing the ball, whatever the case may have been, so I stopped
and shot the jumper.  
Q. Scholnda, same thing, can you take us through your defensive sequence,
the shot that Parker hit about 20 seconds left.  
SCHOLNDA HOSTON: It was a one-on-one match up. They cleared out
(indiscernible). I forced her to her left where I felt it was a little less of
a comfort zone for her. She shot a fade-away one-handed jumper and it went in.  
Q. Pokey, did you consider fouling at all there with three to give when you
still had the lead on that possession?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: You know, it's one of those things where you look at
where she got the shot. Early, if you remember, when she was in her comfort
zone going into the post, (indiscernible) the double team. But she's such a
good basketball player, you know, if you come with the double too soon, she'll
hit a shooter wide open.  
We thought our defense had really gotten them out of a rhythm, and that was
one of the first times she got a one-on-one look. We really felt good about
that because we were sagging in, Sylvia was doing a good job of playing some
position defense. Like Scholnda said, at the end of the day we're a very good
defensive team and we went to our bread and butter. On that particular
possession, she was better.  
Q. Pokey, you were able to beat Tennessee in Knoxville when it had Alexis
Hornbuckle. How do you explain the difference in these two games?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: There's a million differences in the game. You think
about how long ago that was, the adjustments Tennessee has made in terms of
the other players stepping up, playing a little bit different. Candace is
definitely getting a heck of a lot more touches. Those touches change
possession by possession. That's a team making adjustments to what's
necessary, responding to injuries.  
I thought you saw Tennessee attack the glass a lot more. I thought their
ability to get so many offensive rebounds was something they did a better job
of when we were in Knoxville. I think it boils down to the time of the year,
this tournament. You can't really compare a 40-minute game during a regular
season to a game that comes on the heels of back-to-back-to-back. There's so
many other factors.  
Q. Is there any team mentally tougher than Tennessee in a situation like
this?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: It's kind of hard to speak to that because there's not a
lot of teams you play. I mean, I give credit where credit is due.  
You know, tonight they were mentally tough. Therefore, they came away with the
victory and the SEC tournament championship.  
Q. In the second half I think you guys went about six, six and a half
minutes without a field goal. What was going on offensively or what wasn't
going on offensively right about then?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: Yeah, that kind of goes back to the opening statement.
Understand when I say this, it's always with the idea that the opposition has
something to do with it. Then it boils down to a matter of wills with the
scouting report defense overshadow your scouting report offense.  
I think if you go back to possessions, our script was to reverse the
basketball at least two times so we could make the defense move, therefore
creating some gaps for us to penetrate and also move the help defense so
Sylvia wasn't as crowded when we tried to lob the basketball in there.  
I think that was one of the those times where we didn't really stay true to
the script. That's the mental against the physical.  
Q. What do you think this loss or this outcome does in terms of NCAA
tournament ramifications for both y'all and Tennessee?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: You know, I may be the only coach in the history of the
world left that doesn't think about it. You know, I'm thinking about how many
days I'm going to give them off, when we're going to practice, because that's
the only thing I can control.  
I hope I never change, but I have to be honest with you and tell you I don't.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Tye'sha Fluker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16372)

### [Candace Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16368)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Tennessee, we have Coach Pat Summitt,
Candace Parker and Tye'sha Fluker._  
_Coach Summitt, if you would start off._  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I really felt our basketball team played with great
intensity both ends of the floor. It was obviously a hard-fought game. The one
thing that stood out in my mind was our ability to really to a great job on
the boards. If you can control the boards, you usually have a great deal of
influence on how many times -- how many possessions you get, how many
opportunities you get from that. I felt we had a lot of opportunities.  
Obviously, Ty and Candace did a great job for us. It was a great team effort,
particularly the second half. I felt we played very well together as a team
overall. But just -- we worked on a lot of different looks. I felt Candace
handled the ball well for us. The one thing Georgia did at Georgia was really
take us out of our offense. We turned the ball over, I think, 28 times. Better
effort tonight. Just really pleased for our team.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions._  
Q. Pat, the game really kind of deteriorated into a lot of fouls there in
the second half. Did that play to your advantage at all, do you think, or
not?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I think that obviously both teams fouled, but the
fact that they were full-court pressing us, I thought we did a nice job of
taking the ball off the dribble and really forcing the issue offensively. I
think that's when they probably got caught up and had more fouls in that
situation.  
We could spread the floor, and we did. I thought it probably did play to our
advantage as opposed to just bringing the ball up and going right into our
offense.  
Q. Just your thoughts the last five, six, seven minutes of the game on how
well you feel you guys execute.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I thought we did a great job late in the game. That's
something that I've seen from this team in a number of games. You know, we did
that at Georgia. Certainly we did it tonight. It was just a matter of us
stepping up and everyone taking responsibility and ownership on the offensive
and defensive end.  
We executed very well. I just give our players a lot of credit for that.
Obviously, Candace wanted the ball in her hands, but she's a player that can
see over people as well as go around people. Not many people in the country
that have the good fortune of having a player - I don't know what she is -
6'2", 6'3", 6'4", 6'5". Anyway, she can see over the defense. I thought that
was huge for us.  
Ty, she's obviously playing the best basketball of her career. There's no
doubt about that. Having a go-to like that. Nicky came up with some huge plays
for us as well. Our frontline game last year struggled. That was costly for
us. This year they've really stepped up and played big.  
Q. Georgia really hadn't been able to exploit its advantage of quickness and
athleticism in either one of these two games. Why do you think that is?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I really thought the first half down there, they were able
to do that. I think because Shanna could not see over people or she had
trouble getting by them, and Candace went to the point, then we worked on this
by design for tonight. I think that just because of our size and our passing
skills, I thought we did a nice job of just passing the basketball.  
It's hard to beat Georgia off the dribble, because of their quickness. I
thought it was to our advantage to be aggressive off the pass and the dribble.
We obviously got some fouls when we went to our dribble attack. But just
having the size, I think our size.  
I told our team, "Don't feel in a rush. We don't want to rush our offense." I
didn't mind if we got late in the clock, we just didn't want to turn it over.
I'd rather have a five-second count than turn the ball over. I thought we had
a lot of composure, even more tonight than we did in Athens.  
Q. Tye'sha, you were very vocal out there tonight. I saw you talking to
teammates, talking to the ref. Can you talk about your performance on the
court and your level of involvement out there, not just when you have the ball
in your hands?  
TYE'SHA FLUKER: I think it all started, you know, more so when Lex went out. I
just told my team I would step up in leadership. Not only, you know, step up
with stats in my play, but just try to bring, you know, leadership through
being vocal and being emotional to help us stay in the moment while we play.  
I thought it was, you know, my job to, you know, stay in everyone's ear, make
sure we knew we were in, just making sure I was positive out there. When we
had mistakes, we got it back, didn't hold our heads down.  
I think for the most part we did a good job of having hustle plays after we
made mistakes.  
Q. Candace, can you talk about this game? You had the great start, then they
came back in the second half and got the lead briefly. You were able to really
finish well. What did you think was going on in the last 10 minutes that
allowed you to finish the way you did?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think it was just great communication, free-throws. Actually
struggled with my free-throws lately. Ty did a great job of stepping up to the
line and hitting free-throws.  
I think it helped us later in the game because early on we valued every
possession. We didn't waste possessions by turning the ball over, quick
shooting, things like that. I think once we settled down and just communicated
and everybody knew what we were in, we were able to close out the game.  
Q. Candace, it seems like Georgia brings out the best in you. Is there any
particular reason for that? Is it match-ups? You seem to play your best ball
against Georgia.  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I just try to bring energy to the team. I know that
Georgia is, you know, one of the best in the SEC. I think everybody tries to
bring their best game against a great team together.  
I just think that it's just focus and just communication and just execution.  
Q. Pat, I know you want to savor this one. Can you look ahead to tomorrow
night, how this lineup you have now may affect Sylvia, the inside game that
LSU has?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I think that they're probably as strong defensively
as they are offensively. Most people talk about their great offense.  
Having played them earlier in the year, obviously we're disappointed with how
the game ended. Their overall team speed and quickness is exceptional. But I
think we're a better basketball team right now than we were when we played
them.  
We're going to have to really take care of the ball because I think that they
generate a lot of points of their turnovers. Obviously fouls inside is going
to really challenge our frontline game.  
But I feel good that we can go inside against them and we'll look to do so. We
just have to really take care of the basketball, we have to be able to rebound
with them. For me, those are the two big stat lines you are going to take a
look at and know how we're going to fare with a team like LSU.  
Q. Coach, you had to go to Dom and Sybil when Nicky and Sid got in foul
trouble. Can you talk about the job you got out of them tonight?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I think when you go to the bench, you don't want
anyone to come off the bench and hurt your play. You hope they help it.  
I thought Sybil was consistent. We didn't really lose anything there. We
maintained our position. I thought Dom stepped up and did some good things for
us. We need that off the bench. I mean, we obviously shortened our bench
tonight by design, and we just felt we really needed to keep the players that
were the most efficient on the floor.  
We had really good rhythm offensively in the second half in particular.  
Q. Pat, you said you're a better basketball team than you were the first
time you played LSU. Even though you have Hornbuckle, you believe that? Why do
you think you're a better team?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I have to think outside of having Hornbuckle because
we don't have her. The reason I think we are better, I think our shot
selection is better. Obviously on the defensive end, we miss her tremendously.  
Nicky Anosike has really taken on a lot of responsibility for defending on the
perimeter. We miss her ball handling. Candace has stepped up and handled the
ball for us. We've asked everyone to handle. I think we're a little better
passing team. That's not to say that if we had Lex we wouldn't be a whole lot
better, but I do think that in some aspects of our game we are better. We're
not as good defensively, but I think we may be a little stronger offensively
because of what we're seeing now out of Candace, Ty, Nicky, and Spencer has
stepped up and had some big games for us. Shanna played well in the second
half.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2006

  

### [Mickie DeMoss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13867)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: University of Kentucky, Coach Mickie DeMoss, Carly Ormerod,
Sarah Elliott and Nastassia Alcius. And Coach DeMoss, if you would open with a
statement._  
COACH DeMOSS: It wasn't the way we wanted to finish out the SEC tournament,
but, I tell you, LSU played a heck of a game tonight. They're a heck of a
team.  
I thought that, you know, we competed, we struggled to get good looks at the
basket. You know, I thought with the fouls on the inside, Sylvia's fouls
really just made it tough for our post people in there. Just couldn't get a
lot of good looks early. I thought that just kind of set the tone. We never
could get anything going. Seimone Augustus just proved why she was player of
the year, I guess. She hit some unbelievable shots.  
But still proud of the year that we've had, proud to be in the semifinals of
the SEC tournament.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. Coach, could you talk about LSU's ability to deflect your passes? Seems
as though everything you tried, they were right there on the spot.  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: You're right. They're just so athletic. They're athletic,
they're long, they're quick. If our passes weren't precision, I mean, just
right on time, they seemed to get their hands on it. You know, even our shots,
we would get an initial look at the basket, and they're just quick. They can
get from one spot to the next very quickly.  
I tell you, and everybody talks about their offense, how potent their offense
is, but I tell you, their defense is really, really good, really good.  
Q. Did you see that on film? Were you thinking maybe you could exploit
something? Seemed like they probably played their better defensive game than
you've seen.  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: Yeah, I thought they played really well tonight. They got
out-pressured in the passing lanes a little bit more than what we've seen on
tape. They played very inspired tonight.  
For whatever reason, we just did not attack the way that we should have. You
know, I have to give a lot of credit to LSU. They're one of the best teams in
the country.  
Q. When they went on that run, could you see maybe your kids starting to
back off a little bit, play differently?  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: There were a couple shots I thought that we let them
alter. But, you know, we cut it to 10. I thought Stassia came in and really
gave us a lift offensively. We were able to cut it to 10. But they're just a
team of runs. Same thing happened to us in Lexington. We were able to cut the
lead. They call a timeout, they just go on a tear. That's kind of what
happened.  
We got it to 10. I thought we didn't let it deflate us totally. But it just
wears on you, particularly when you've played the night before. Didn't have a
lot of time to prepare, didn't have a lot of time to rest. But I don't think
it totally deflated us. We just had to keep fighting.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Sylvia is a very excellent ball player. She's very
athletic. She gets the rim, she gets a lot of rebounds. I got to give Sylvia a
lot of respect for that. Our game plan was to push her off the block and put a
body on her all night, which I thought we did a pretty good job of that most
of the night. She's very physical. It was pretty much a battle between me and
her all night.  
She's very physical. You know, I got to give her her props for being such a
great athlete.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: You know, we talked in the locker room. I mean, you know,
it's obvious what it takes to be the No. 1, 2, whatever they've been ranked
throughout the year, 1 through 4, I guess, most of the year. You know, we
learned from this.  
We just focus on the positive. We learn from it. We move on. You know, we're
excited, unless something bizarre happens, get into the NCAA tournament, which
is a first for several years for Kentucky.  
But we learned from it. We've got to practice at a great tempo every day, make
strong cuts, speed cuts, move the ball quicker. We'll go back and break the
tape down and learn from it, get better from it.

## March 4, 2006

  

### [Seimone Augustus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14353)

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From LSU, we have Coach Pokey Chatman, Erica White, and
Seimone Augustus._  
_Coach Chatman, would like to open with a statement._  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: I thought from the first defensive possession, we
established ourselves on that end of the floor. It was something that I
challenged this team with leaving the locker room. I thought early on in the
season we were stifling defensive teams at times and needed to get back to
that. I thought it would set the tone.  
It sort of washed away the fact that three of our first four or five
possessions were turnovers. I really felt good on it, because we were locked
in on it that end the floor. We were keyed into establishing ourselves
offensively. I was pleased we carried that out throughout the game to the tune
of holding Kentucky to 52 points and also shooting 57% from the field. All
around great effort on both ends of the floor.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. Could you talk about Sylvia's injury. Did you see what happened exactly?
How is very for tomorrow's game?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: She's fine for tomorrow's game. I actually saw it on the
monitor upstairs. It looked like she just came down on it wrong. I thought
maybe she came down on someone's foot. But she's fine. She's going to rehab
it, ice it, get in the cold whirlpool and get rejuvenated for tomorrow.  
Q. Coach, could you talk about your team's ability to deflect passes and
really alter shots during that seven-and-a-half-minute drought that you caused
Kentucky to have.  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: Great question. One of our game goals was to make sure we
got our hand on the basketball, try to get deflections. It's something that we
chart in practice year-round. I thought every single player that came on the
floor contributed to that. That made the pace a little faster than Kentucky
wanted. I thought Sylvia was really active. Every single player. I don't want
to call anyone out. It was a total team effort.  
I haven't even seen a deflections chart. But I could tell from the way that
Kentucky ran offense in that little span we were doing a relatively good job
of pressuring them.  
Q. It's getting pretty shameless how you take Seimone out to protect your
record. It's a funny question. You need to smile.  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: No, no, no. You can give me a hard time (laughter).  
Q. It was funny, same kind of scenario today as yesterday. How important is
it at this point of the tournament your starters playing 30 minutes
(indiscernible)?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: I think it's huge. The numbers that I was looking at on
the clock is the 10-minute mark in terms of players in their freshness. I know
Sylvia would have been in the game if she wouldn't have gotten her ankle
sprained a little bit.  
I would rather you guys write about a bigger story, if we can salvage some of
those minutes for our key players to have some freshness tomorrow. Tomorrow
Seimone may be something for a sub, maybe 'get out of jail free'.  
It's one of those things where, you know, Seimone could go off tomorrow, who
knows. But I'll never, ever try to stick a player back in and get a record.
There's just a bigger picture out there.  
Q. Seimone, you guys obviously won the regular season championship. How much
would it mean to add the tournament championship? Is that something you guys
have talked about?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: Yeah, that's our goal. Any time we have an opportunity to
win a championship, we want to go out and compete and win it. We focused on,
you know, winning the tournament, but for the most part we just want to go out
and compete. This is a tough time of the season when you want to make sure
your team is running on all cylinders and everything that needs to be intact
is intact. Right now it seems we're headed in a positive direction.  
If everything keeps going the same, championship is bound to happen.  
Q. Seimone, are you hoping to break that tournament record tomorrow, get
over 30? For Pokey, how do you like this as a tournament site? Would you like
to see it stay in the rotation?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: About breaking 30, I mean, if the opportunity shows itself,
if I'm still shooting the ball well, our offense is working, I get the
opportunity to score. If it gets there, then fine. That's not a focal point of
mine. I would rather win the championship than score 30 points and not win at
all.  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: In terms of the tournament being here, obviously we've
experienced some success here I think Seimone's freshman year. I don't think,
I know, her freshman year. This place has done a great job with it. Part of
the reason why it's back here is at the end of the day, it boils down to those
40 minutes you get to play and advance and play again.  
If we're fortunate enough to play well tomorrow and have a good showing, I'm
sure I may campaign for it again.  
Q. Erica and Seimone, do you think making it to the Conference Finals, is it
now a tradition for LSU lady basketball to make it to the conference final?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I think so. We want to start a tradition of success and have
something to go with our legacy. We've made it to the conference regular
season, won, and now we're in the finals again for this tournament. I think
it's a good start, you know, to start a tradition for us.  
ERICA WHITE: We're always talking about our legacy in the locker room. We work
hard. So getting to the championship, that's definitely something that we key
in on. It's a good tradition to start here.  
Q. Erica, Seimone was 13 out of 18. A lot of those were jump shots. Can you
tell pretty early on when she's in the zone or in the flow of it?  
ERICA WHITE: I always think Seimone's in the zone (laughter). You know, I
never think she's off. Early on, I could tell when Seimone is in the zone. She
makes a basket and she looks at me and we just give each other this look like,
"Yeah, just give me the ball." I know to get it to her, she's going to put it
in the hole.  
Yeah, she was on it. I just want to say, since we're talking about Seimone,
that three-pointer was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen from a
teammate. Props to Seimone.  
Q. LSU is the first SEC school to win the men's and women's outright title
in the same year. Does that make Baton Rouge the capital of all things
basketball?  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: Of course. We are the capital of everything basketball. The
only thing, (indiscernible) has a national championship. That's the only thing
they have over us. Everything about us is successful. A lot of people didn't
expect our men to even challenge for an SEC title. It feels great that both of
the programs are doing good, and we're striving towards getting championships,
further our play into NCAA play.  
Q. Mickie said she thought they were a lot better team than last time you
met, and your team also. Can you talk about the difference between the last
two games, how much better you guys have gotten since then?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: Mickie is right. We're both better teams. You know,
that's why you toss it up and play 40 minutes, because it's a matter of who's
going to be on their game, who's going to out-execute, who is going to
neutralize the other team's strengths, who is going to stay true to your
script and your own strength and try to neutralize your own weaknesses.  
I think the fact we just established ourselves so early on the defensive end
of the floor, and there's never really an answer for it, what's so good about
it, so many of the players on the floor contributed to it. Usually when you
talk LSU defense, it's Sylvia's blocked shot or Scholnda's steal. Erica did a
great job of shadowing 00, not letting her get good looks at the basket.
Seimone did a good job of tagging on the double-stagger screens, not letting
Pfeiffer get her feet set. It went on and on and on. I think the fact we
established that early by five players is what helped us gain some of that
momentum.  
Yes, they're a very good basketball team. It just so happens that we
established some things early on and were able to carry it out.  
Q. Seimone, you said the went weren't expected to contend. Y'all were picked
behind Tennessee and Georgia. Talk about the play of Erica and Rashonta
helping you be a championship team, have a chance to win a championship
tomorrow. The point guard was a question. Obviously, you have good play there
this year.  
SEIMONE AGUSTUS: I think they've done a great job at not focusing on what
people were saying about Tamika leaving, how you want to fill that gap. They
came in with the confidence and the swagger that they were going to do
whatever possible, regardless of who started, to make this team run on all
cylinders.  
I think they have done a good job of teaming up. If Chante gets in, we get
out, we have a halfcourt game. Erica gets in, she controls the court. We just
need a point guard. We have two point guards that can go out and give us what
we need at any time during the game.  
I applaud them for being able to take the criticism early on about not being
Tamika Johnson. Our team allowed them to be themselves and gain confidence
within our system.  
Q. Erica, coach talked about that big defensive stops you made early in the
game. Could you see it kind of start to deflate some of Kentucky's players?
Maybe they just couldn't find their offense after that.  
ERICA WHITE: Yeah, I can see it early on. We weren't doing well defensively.
On offense, we were getting baskets. That's deflating to a team when you're
getting easy baskets and stopping them on their end.  
I could definitely see it in Kentucky. I think we were up by like eight or
nine or something crazy like that. I could definitely see it.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Carol Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13859)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Mississippi, Coach Carol Ross, Ashley
Johnson and Armintie Price. Coach Ross, if you would open with a statement._  
COACH CAROL ROSS: Well, a lot can change in 24 hours. You know, unfortunately,
LSU is obviously a talented, very explosive team with two outstanding players,
about four or five others that aren't real bad.  
When you play teams that are better than you on paper, maybe better than you
in a lot of areas, you have to find ways to take their strength away. If you
pick up the stat sheet, you will see that their strengths all along were their
strengths again today.  
They got big games out of Augustus and Fowles and they just killed us on the
boards. If you get out rebounded by 23, it really doesn't matter who you play,
you're going to get beat. If you play a team like LSU, they're going to beat
you pretty bad.  
You know, so that's, I guess, the game in a nutshell. They played to their
strengths, and we didn't get to play to ours.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions._  
Q. What do you think about Augustus as a player?  
COACH CAROL ROSS: Well, the best thing about her is she's a senior. After
that, she's not a bad offensive player either. She's one of the most -- she's
graceful and she's poised and she plays hard, but she does it so gracefully,
that sometimes that gets overlooked.  
She runs the floor hard; she takes great shots. She's just very composed and
selective, which great players are. She makes everybody else around her
better, too. You know, she is the best player in the country. She has been for
a couple of years. You know, if you're not coaching against her, it's a real
treat just to watch somebody with her ability play, and she does it with so
much grace. It's just really a beautiful thing to see unless you're sitting on
the other bench.  
Q. Carol, you know she's going to get her points, and Sylvia is very likely
to get a double-double, too. When a player like Hoston heats up, do they
become -- I won't say unbeatable, but do they become very difficult to beat at
that point?  
COACH CAROL ROSS: You know, most teams have a great player, and then you have
other players that play their roles and they do what they do. But for a team
to really have two go-to players, the beauty of it is that they're go-to
players with different abilities. It makes it very difficult to try and
contain or disrupt or even diminish their abilities at all.  
Then if you get too much energy to that, then the rest of them know their
roles very well. You know, I really thought Erica White was the one that blew
the game open, because we could not contain her. She ended up making the game
fast.  
Their transition game really, I thought, was the one factor that we had not --
I thought we could guard them and force it into a halfcourt game, then we
would worry about Augustus and Fowles. I thought she made it where we had to
guard everybody, we had to guard 94 feet. To me, that was the really wrecking
punch out of the whole bunch, we couldn't get it into a halfcourt game to pay
that much attention to the two that we were most concerned about.  
Q. Y'all would have wanted to go up and down, and they would have wanted it
fast.  
COACH CAROL ROSS: We did. We didn't want them to. We wanted to play fast, from
our offensive perspective. We needed easy buckets, we needed to play fast on
the offensive end, but we needed it to be a grind and ugly on the defensive
end. We just weren't able to make that happen.  
Q. She did in Baton Rouge.  
COACH CAROL ROSS: We did in Baton Rouge, but we could have kept that same game
plan and maybe played a closer game, but I didn't think we could win that way.
We just made a decision that we were going to gamble and play the way we
needed to play, and if we got beat, we got beat, but it was the only chance we
felt like we had to win.  
We came into this tournament to win, not to play close. So we wanted to get
our traps and play a little bit faster than we did in Baton Rouge because, you
know, I don't feel any better losing by 15 than I do by 20, both scenarios.  
Q. I'm sure you hope the people who vote on the alternate team remember No.
24 on Sunday. She's played pretty darn good the first two days of the
tournament.  
COACH CAROL ROSS: I can't even imagine that anybody can't appreciate the
things that a 130-pound, 5'9" player does. She plays the game with such effort
and does things that people her size shouldn't be able to do just because her
will to compete, her excitement to play in games like this. You know, she
leaves it on the court. When the game's over, she can always feel pretty good
about things because there's nothing left.  
I don't think there's any question that people can appreciate what she does
and how she does it.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Carolyn Peck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13864)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: University of Florida coach Carolyn Peck, Sha Brooks and Sarah
Lowe._  
_Coach Peck, could you open with a statement, please._  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: Obviously, we didn't want to be the first in this press
conference because that would mean we are the team that goes home tomorrow.  
I tell you, you have to compliment Kentucky because they came in and they came
at us and attacked, understanding we played a game yesterday. We had a game
under us, and they were fresh out of the blocks. I think they did a good job
of coming at us.  
I think Sarah Elliott did a terrific job for Kentucky in the paint getting 20
points. Sam Mahoney really stepped up big for Kentucky today.  
I am proud of what our team has accomplished this year. Am I satisfied? No.
But I think that in the SEC, I think we've had tremendous leadership from our
four seniors, Sarah Lowe going the distance at the point position that she
does, for Brittany and Dalila inside, and I think Danielle has had a
phenomenal two games in the tournament. Then I can't say enough about Sha
Brooks. I'm thrilled that hopefully we'll be sitting here again for three more
years to come.  
It's a disappointing loss because this team has done a terrific job this
season of accomplishing some firsts or making some history so that Cathy so
has something else, something good, something positive to put in our media
guide. We were really hoping we could get Florida back to the semifinals today
because that hadn't been done since '98. But just didn't happen for us today.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions._  
Q. In your last game at Kentucky, your press really seemed to bother them,
the changing defenses-faults. Do you feel they handled that differently or
better this time?  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: Well, I think fatigue played some bit of a factor of where
we wanted to get to. I have to compliment Kentucky, they did do a good job of
attacking it, coming down instead of just breaking it and then setting into an
offense. They continued to stay in the attack mode. We didn't do a good job of
getting matched up.  
Q. What do you think of this as a site for the tournament? Would you like to
see it stay in the rotation?  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: I think Little Rock has done a tremendous job with the
tournament. I like the facility. I'd like to be able to watch the games in the
hotel. The people are very supportive. They're excited about women's
basketball here. I think they've done a terrific job of running the tournament
both years that I've had the opportunity to be here.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: As long as we're getting to play, I'll be anywhere.  
Q. Coach, what is it that Sam Mahoney was doing differently? You said she
stepped up. Can you talk about what that was? Were you prepared for that?  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: Well, she was very offensive-minded. Sam is I think a very
unselfish player. A lot of times she's looking to get the ball to other
people. Today she was able -- getting late in the shot clock a few times, she
was able to make things happen, being able to score and finish.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Candace Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16368)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

### [Shanna Zolman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14374)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Tennessee, Coach Pat Summitt, Candace
Parker and Shanna Zolman._  
_Coach Summitt, would you open up with a statement, please._  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I thought this was one of our better efforts as a
basketball team, just in terms of how we shared the ball and our willingness
to get the ball inside, just find open players; we had inside, outside action.
I thought Shanna ran the team well. Candace obviously did a great job on the
boards for us, helped us. She was like a second guard on the floor when she
was on the offensive glass.  
Our bench gave us some energy. Didn't have the numbers off the bench, but if
we can get those quality minutes, I think that's really going to be key for us
in this tournament.  
We did a lot of good things. Our post game has really stepped up and been one
of the most consistent parts of our game. Obviously, our rebounding today was
very, very strong for us.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll take some questions, please._  
Q. Pat, can you talk about how you got started each half, you know, the hot
start both halfs.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, we did. I think just the fact that we shared the
ball, really ran our offenses, obviously played from the inside out. That has
been something that we've been inconsistent in in starting sometimes, the
first half in particular. So it was good to see that we went inside right
away.  
I think that has to be where we go, is get the ball inside, get paint points.
You get inside, outside action. You really make the defense work. We were
patient. Likewise, I thought we did a good job pushing tempo. That got us some
paint points, as well.  
Q. Pat, could you talk about defensively how you started the game. You came
out, I think full-court pressing in that first possession and you were playing
man. Looked like you -- were you trying to set an aggressive tone there?
What's the strategy there?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, the interesting thing is that we have, at times,
opened up in our zone. Sometimes we're aggressive, sometimes we're not. I told
our staff, I just want to open up in man. I want to open up so we are
aggressive, we're on our toes, we're generating some energy, and hopefully
some good things off of our man defense. We can always switch up.  
Obviously, we went to the second half with our zone. But I felt like we were
already in a good place as far as our intensity and just our commitment on the
defensive end.  
Q. Pat, can you talk about the way the game unfolded. It seemed like it was
perfect for what you wanted in being able to get the starters rest and going
to the bench early.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I told our bench this. I mean, I think it's so important.
When you have your SEC tournament that you get quality play off the bench. I'm
not asking them to, you know, give us a 10-point lift. I'm asking them to go
in and let's just be as efficient as we can be and let's keep things the way
they are. If you can add to it, that's great. But don't go in and cost us
points. Make sure that you bring that intensity, that type of play.  
I thought today was one of the best jobs that we've done.  
Q. The second half, with all the three's, was that in the cards? Was that a
pleasant happening?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: That just happened (laughter). No, definitely not in our
game plan. But I do think that our ball movement was obviously very good. I
thought spacing allowed us to get good action. You know, we had some good
looks on the skip.  
I just think we really were alert. When you have that alertness in a game like
this, I think it's going to allow you to get some good looks and not just
settle for a one- or two-pass offense.  
Our players really space well.  
Q. Pat, can you talk about the change, maybe in intensity from a second-
round game like today to a semifinal round game tomorrow night?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I think this team knows what they have to bring each and
every game. I like the intensity today. We had some lapses. But I think
overall they understand it.  
You know, our goal obviously is to come here and win three games. It's not
going to be easy. We're going to have to work at it. We're going to have to be
competitive and not take possessions off. But that's the goal.  
We've got one down and now we just have to focus on the next game and be ready
because either opponent obviously that we will face, we have faced already
twice. You know, I think coming in and knowing that we have to beat a team
that third time is going to be something that we can do, but obviously we have
to match the intensity of our opponent because they'll bring it. I mean, they
obviously feel like, I'm sure both, that they let a couple of them slip away.  
Q. Shanna, you guys came out and got on them pretty quick. How anxious were
you guys to come here and get the post-season started, especially having lost
on Sunday?  
SHANNA ZOLMAN: We were extremely anxious to get here, and not only being able
to play our first game on this floor in Arkansas, but most importantly to get
that first game under our belt.  
We were really trying to stress, along with the coaching staff, and emphasize
the importance of being able to come out and just make a statement the first
half, the first game, because this is a new part of the season. Despite how,
you know, our regular season went, our SEC regular season went, this is a
whole new season now, and we're trying to make a statement the first game.  
I think with the intensity that we brought in both halves, I believe that we
made that statement, and hopefully we can carry that out throughout the rest
of the tournament.  
Q. Candace, you have waited a year for this, your first post-season play.
Can you talk a little about how that was for you out there today?  
CANDACE PARKER: It was a great experience to start off like we did. Last year,
you know, obviously I was sidelined with my knee injury. I was really excited
to get here. To finally be able to play is amazing. I talked to my dad
yesterday. He was, you know, telling me that, you know, last year you couldn't
play, just all the -- I was anxious and everything like that, and I should let
that carry over to today now that I can. Just hustle and play hard because,
you know, I mean, every game is a promise, and I've learned that from my
career.  
Q. Candace, what was the situation when you came out of the game I guess
seven, eight minutes into the first half?  
CANDACE PARKER: I'm okay. I strained my good knee, my right knee. But it's
okay. Jenny checked it out. She gave me the green light to go back in. Yeah,
they're both good.  
Q. Candace, can you talk about your role on this team, how it may or may not
have changed from the beginning of the year when it was a little bit smaller
lineup, maybe more guard-oriented, to more of a big lineup?  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I think that, you know, all of our roles have changed as
a team. We asked Shanna to move over to point guard. I've had to move up to
small forward and everything.  
But I think we're adjusting as a team. We're doing a great job of just, you
know, helping each other out, playing positions that we may not, you know, be
comfortable with, but I think we're just bringing energy and making mistakes
through hustle.  
I think, you know, this team is adjusting well through all the adversity and
all the things that we faced.  
Q. How much does it help this team to have this kind of a defensive effort
in the first game of the tournament?  
CANDACE PARKER: It's huge for us. It's huge to have the defensive effort in
the first game. Hopefully it will carry over to the second. Like I said, our
team does it when we have to. That's not necessarily the attitude that you
want to have in the regular season. But in the post-season, I think it's great
because, you know, we know we have to, otherwise we're going to go home. I
mean, we did it today. I was really proud of our defensive effort.  
Q. Coach, in light of the injuries that y'all have had in the course of this
season, were you a little concerned when Candace did come out of the game in
the first half?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, I wasn't sure what she felt or what happened. But
once I asked Jenny after she checked it out, she said she was fine; Candace
said she was fine. I think the one good thing that we have is a great trainer
right there with us that, you know, obviously has been in this profession and
is regarded as one of the best at what she does.  
You know, that eliminates any confusion about, can she go back in or not?
Obviously, I knew she was good to play. But any time a player is experiencing
anything that's unusual pain-wise, whether it's the knee, the ankle, the hand,
whatever, I've been through pretty much everything, and you always, as a coach
-- it always concerns you until you have the answer.  
Q. Shanna, before you left Knoxville, you told the media that you wouldn't
know for sure if it would be the team's idea to win this. Pat was talking
about how last year Tennessee won because it was the players' idea. Have you
been able to read the team now?  
SHANNA ZOLMAN: Definitely. I think we came here with the same attitude as last
year. Went out the floor today, starting the way we did, that tells a lot.
It's not necessarily something that we came out and we were just kind of
lackadaisical with the ball, not very intense defensively. I think that we
came out in the same way that we came out last year.  
I'm not saying the outcome is going to be the same. I'm not going to make any
guarantees about that (laughter). I know that our minds, our intensity and our
hearts are in the right place, and that's where they need to be.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From Auburn University, we have coach Nell Fortner, Nitasha
Brown, Marita Payne and Sherell Hobbs._  
_Coach Fortner, would you like to open up with a statement._  
COACH NELL FORTNER: I thought Tennessee was outstanding today. They shot the
ball extremely well and just absolutely just man-handled us. We didn't have an
answer for it. It was a long day for us.  
_THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions._  
Q. For any of the players, can you talk about what they were doing
defensively to make it so hard to get shots off and then to make shots?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, it was a very aggressive denial defense. They kind
of disrupted our offense. It forced us to try to create shots, not get in a
real flow in our offensive game tonight.  
Q. Considering they had lost on Sunday, I think Zolman talked about how
anxious they were to get out here and get started. Did you expect that, the
way they started?  
COACH NELL FORTNER: Yeah. Yeah, they're notorious for coming back after a loss
and getting after you.  
So, you know, they're really big. They're very big right now. Even though Pat
is forced to play a different lineup than they started the season with,
they're extremely big. It's hard to see around things. When you're trying to
create some opportunities for yourself, it's hard to see open players 'cause
they're very big to pass the ball around.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Mickie DeMoss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13867)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Kentucky, coach Mickie DeMoss, Sarah
Elliott and Samantha Mahoney._  
_Coach DeMoss, if you would open with a statement._  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: Feels good to be in this position. It's been a while
since Kentucky has been in the semifinals of the SEC tournament. This team is
very deserving to be in this position.  
I thought tonight we came out and we stuck to our game plan, had an attack
mentality. It was a very physical game. I thought that we rose to the
occasion. Just very proud of the way we maintained our poise down the stretch.
Florida made a few runs at us and we were able to maintain our poise and keep
our lead and extend the lead.  
Very excited to be where we are right now.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions._  
Q. Mickie, you've been waiting all season for Sarah and Sam to both have big
games at the same time. What was that like to see them both score 20 points?  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: Yeah, they made me wait till the very end of the season,
looks like (laughter).  
It was really good to see both of them step up and be the players that they
certainly are capable of being. I felt Sam just stepped up and just made some
big shots, big-time moves from the perimeter. Sarah was big-time inside for
us. Just maintained that play for 40 minutes. That's what you as a coach love
to see, that they maintained it and kept the pressure on Florida for 40
minutes.  
Q. The mojo award, can you think of the inspiration and background of that,
and who got it tonight?  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: Well, you are looking at the two mojo winners sitting at
the table. We had dual winners today.  
But it's just something fun we started at the beginning of the year. Being
from Louisiana, you know, we got this -- I don't know what it's called, a
statue or something that my (indiscernible) operations bought at a beauty shop
and didn't really know what to do with it.  
I wish I had some inspiring story to tell you. We said we're going to give a
mojo award for the player of the game that we feel like made the biggest
difference in the outcome. We've been doing it since the beginning of the
season. Actually, it's when the conference started. We started doing it when
conference play started. I don't remember exactly when. It was at the
beginning.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: After wins, exactly. Obviously, on a loss, mojo wasn't
working that night.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: It's just something that coach thought of. It was a fun
little activity or whatever you want to call it. It's fun for us. I mean, we
get to sign it. You have your name on it, saying you played hard that game.
It's something you are proud of.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Oh, yeah.  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: You get to travel with it. They're real thrilled when
they have to travel with it. Get some funny looks in the airport.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I think it's a good thing for our team as far as knowing
that the coaching staff and your teammates felt like you played hard that
game. It's just something for our team to do.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I think before Coach DeMoss comes and talks, we kind of
talk amongst ourselves as to who we think is going to get it, things like
that, make our predictions. So, yeah, we do talk about it.  
Q. Were you hoping to wear them down because they played last night?  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: That was part of it. And watching our film from both
games, I felt like our zone press bothered them. In Gainseville we started out
pressing them a little bit, but we didn't press them much in Lexington. I just
felt like on top of the fact they played yesterday, we wanted to take
advantage of that. Also I felt like they weren't real thrilled about being
pressed. For two reasons we stayed with that press. Felt like we kind of
jumped on them early with that.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: I thought we did a good job, I do, with the exception of
a couple times we broke down. I think for 40 minutes, we did a nice job of
attacking. That was our mentality. That was our game plan, was to attack and
get the ball down the floor and attack the blocks. We maintained that
mentality for the most part for 40 minutes.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, I think this is just a big time of the season in
general right now, tournament time, as far as winning or go home pretty much.
I think it's important to our team to step up and win big games.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, it is. I think that's something we can pretty much
count on every game, Pfeiffer coming in, knocking some shots down, spreading
the lead, really lifting our team up.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, because they had to flair out, gives us a one-on-
one opportunity on the inside. It's definitely an advantage for us. Coach is
always saying take advantage of a one-on-one opportunity, high-level look.
When Pfeiffer gets hot, Sam gets hor, or Carly gets hot, it's a great feeling.
It's just something we really look forward to. If they come in on the post, we
can look for the forward. It's just a win-win situation.  
Q. Mickie, what do you think of this as a site, as a host area? What kind of
job are they doing? Would you like to see Little Rock stay in the rotation?  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: You know, I know we were here, what was it, three years
ago, four years ago. Actually, it was my last year at Tennessee. I thought
Little Rock did a nice job of hosting it. The crowds were good.  
As a coach, you don't even realize where you are sometimes because you're in
the hotel room watching film, scouting and practicing, all that. But Little
Rock has been great. It's easy to get around. We're five minutes from the
arena. Those are things as a coach... As long as the crowds are good, that
always means a lot.  
I think Little Rock has done a great job of hosting it.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: Sure, sure. I don't think we really get a vote. If they
had it back here, I think that would be great.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: You had to bring that up, didn't you (laughter)?  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: No, actually we're looking forward to the challenge. We
played them in December. I know this team has grown up so much since December.
We've learned a lot. We've grown a lot. We've matured. We're looking forward
to the opportunity. We have the utmost respect for LSU, but we're certainly
not fearful of LSU.  
I think for us to advance, and when you advance in a tournament, you know the
games get a little tougher. You don't dodge any bullets. We've put ourselves
right here. We're going to face it head on.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Like coach said, we grew up a lot. We've worked on a lot
of fundamental things. Our freshman have grown up a lot. As sophomores, we've
done a lot of improving as well. Like coach said, we're accepting the
challenge. It's going to be good tomorrow to see the outcome of the game. It's
going to be a good game.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: They're a very, very good team. I think one of the best
teams in the country. They're in our league. We watched them on TV a lot since
December. Sylvia Fowles is certainly one of the best post people in the
country. Seimone Augustus is Seimone Augustus.  
Again, I think we've got to beat them as a team. I think we've improved as a
team. It's five of them and five of us. Again, we have the utmost respect for
LSU, but we're excited about having another chance to play them.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MICKIE DeMOSS: You know, people ask me that the first year I took the
job at Kentucky. I think when you're in the heat of competition, it's your
team against another team. It's not me against Pat. I think coaches that get
focused on that can't coach their team.  
It's a challenge. Pat and I play golf against each other all the time in the
summer. I beat her most of the time. It's a challenge. It's really kind of fun
because I know what Tennessee likes to do. It seems like the Kentucky teams
always rise to the challenge to play Tennessee. A little special rivalry
there.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_Coach, would you like to open with a statement, please._  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: I think the big thing tonight was our mentality. You
know, we turned the ball over probably the first five times out of eight
possessions we got it. And then it really affected us, affected our shots. We
let it affect everything that we did, very similar to when we played at home
against Georgia. We missed shots, turned the ball over, gave them easy
baskets, then put our heads down.  
What's disappointing is the mentality that we weren't able to get out of.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. Can you talk about Georgia's quickness, athleticism? Is that a tough
match-up? Talk about that match-up.  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: It's tough because, you know, this is a very athletic
team. I think their guards -- obviously their back court has great experience
and great athleticism, probably the quickest in the country. They've played
man for three years, and now they're playing a zone. I know from playing it
last time and watching it on film, they probably play a zone better than they
do man because they really can get in the passing lanes and create havoc.  
If you have young guards that are telegraphing passes, then they also get up
and pressure you. If you don't protect the basketball, you pick it up, then
you pass the ball away... I think we had a lot of guards not handle the
pressure on the perimeter because of what they create defensively. They create
a lot of havoc on the basketball and in passing lanes.  
Q. How closely would you call this a carbon copy of what happened in
Nashville? Did you see anything any different from where you were?  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: No. I think it was very similar. That's what's
disappointing, is I don't think we made the changes we needed to make. I
thought after winning the last three games that we won that we would have more
confidence, and that if we did make mistakes or we did turn the ball over or
miss shots, that we wouldn't let it take ourselves out of it.  
But, you know, at the same time I'm not one of those coaches that just, you
know, is going berate my own team and blame them. We didn't step up and do
what we needed to do mentally. But at the same time I think this is a very,
very good Georgia team. I think they create a lot of the mistakes that they
make with their quickness, like I said, and their athleticism. They have a
great inside-out game. They have probably one of the best post players in the
country as well as athletic guards. When they're on, they're on. They're very,
very explosive and they're very confident right now. They make you look bad,
too. It's not us just being bad; they're a very good team.  
Q. (No microphone).  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: I think it's tough. You know, I'm not going to make any
excuses. We've been through this. We know what it's like to play back-to-back.
We played more people, so we shouldn't have been as tired as we were. We got
very tired very quickly. They weren't (indiscernible) much at all.  
I'm not going to make any excuses. I'd love to be able to say that's what it
was, but I don't think that affected us.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Sherill Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16370)

### [Cori Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16369)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Georgia, coach Andy Landers, Sherill
Baker and Cori Chambers._  
_Coach Landers, would you like to make a statement._  
COACH ANDY LANDERS: First statement, I think they need to probably fire the
statistician if Baker only had three steals.  
_THE MODERATOR: That's wrong._  
COACH ANDY LANDERS: I thought she had her hands on a bunch of balls. Maybe I
was wrong. I thought that she was terrific there. We played really well, which
we have done on a number of occasions this year, particularly since the 1st of
January.  
But defensively I thought we did a good job with the press, not necessarily
enforcing turnovers, but in controlling tempo. I thought we did a good job in
the halfcourt of keeping the ball out of the high post.  
Vanderbilt is really, really good - really good. I just love watching them
play. You know, the tapes that we've had, and of course we just played them a
week ago, they're so disciplined, they're so skilled, and they run their
stuff, they do a great job with it.  
I thought we did a great job of keeping it out of the high post, then getting
to the three-point shooters. So defensively we were good. Offensively, we were
able to turn 'em a couple of times. We were able to rebound the ball. Cori had
seven rebounds at the half. We were able to rebound the ball well and get it
out and run some. You know, I think that's what our kids enjoyed doing the
most.  
Then in the halfcourt, we were able -- again Cori knocked down some three's,
Jay knocked down a three in the first half. We just kind of separated
ourselves from 'em.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions._  
Q. Talk about the ability to find Cori open so much and get the three-point
shot.  
SHERILL BAKER: I know when I penetrated, when other guards penetrate, we
opened up Cori and Megan on a three-point shot. Cori and Megan hit down the
three's we needed tonight.  
Q. Cori, I wanted to ask you, I think there was a three you hit in the first
half. One of the other players was on the ground. Do you remember that play?
Do you ever remember getting a basket on a pass from a player that was on the
ground?  
CORI CHAMBERS: I think that was Tasha falling out of bounds. No, I don't think
that's ever happened.  
COACH ANDY LANDERS: Kick-out for a three. A big-time play. Tasha had gotten
herself under the basket. I forget how she got the ball. You know, to be able
to make the pass right to Cori in such a manner that Cori could catch and
shoot was really, you know, impressive to me.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SHERILL BAKER: Like 13 steals (laughter).  
Q. Coach and Cori, are you glad to get another crack at Tennessee?  
COACH ANDY LANDERS: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we've played them twice. Pat, before
she retired, devised a schedule where Georgia would play Tennessee and LSU
twice in the same year. We can thank her for that.  
But, you know, at their place, I don't think that we deserved to win the game.
But I thought the game was winnable. At our place, I thought -- I'm not saying
we deserved to win it, but I thought we should have won it, and we didn't.  
You know, to me personally, yeah, it's a wonderful opportunity. When you've
played a team twice like that and didn't get it done, to be able to have
another shot at them, you know, is really neat. I mean, if they beat us again,
then I guess you say, "They're better than we are. " That kind of proves it. I
don't see where the damage is going to be done there. So we got everything to
win and nothing to lose as far as I'm concerned.  
CORI CHAMBERS: I mean, I'm excited. It's the post-season, so it's kind of like
the pre-season and all those other games we played is already in the past, and
everything is a game-by-game situation. We're excited to play and fired up
about it. Got to go home and get some rest now.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH ANDY LANDERS: It's going to be interesting. Our players need to
understand it. Sherill and Cori, this is something I didn't say to the team
after the game, that they need to go back and stress very clearly to our team,
this will be a challenge for us because generally after we play a Sunday game,
we're off on Monday. After we play a Thursday game, we do very little on
Friday.  
We've got to be mentally very, very tough the rest of the week. It was
important to us that we could rest and take care of ourselves. That's
something else that I should compliment our basketball team on. We were off
day before yesterday. We did very little yesterday. We did very little today
in shoot-around. Any time you take a team out of a routine, a coach worries
about that, for them to be able to come out, tip it up and go hard, as if we
had been in a routine and pressed a great deal tonight.  
But we're going to be challenged the next couple days.  
Q. I was wondering how you like having the tournament here in Little Rock,
second time around, if you'd like to see it stay in the rotation?  
COACH ANDY LANDERS: Well, you know, I wasn't at the afternoon session. I was
back at the hotel watching Law and Order and a little bit of tape. So I don't
know how it drew. I'm not a good one to ask.  
I think it's important that our tournament draws. I think it's important that
people attend. I remember the last time we were out here, it drew very, very
well. I was extremely impressed and excited to come back. But I wasn't at the
afternoon session. I know we played a late game. That's not a great draw, so
I'm not a good one to ask right now. I'm sorry.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2006

  

### [Seimone Augustus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14353)

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Scholanda Hoston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15651)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From LSU we have Coach Pokey Chatman, Scholnda Hoston, Seimone
Augustus and Sylvia Fowles. Coach, will you open with a statement, please._  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: When we were coming in, there were several things we
needed to accomplish to experience some success. You look over the last few
years, Ole Miss has been a team that has gotten to the free-throw line the
most in this particular conference. We thought that our ability to defend in a
disciplined manner, but also transition to the other end of the floor. We ran
some good offense, couple of ball reversals, and establish ourselves in the
paint, would go a long way.  
So that the best stat on the stat sheet is the fact that we got to the free-
throw line 20 times and only committed eight personal fouls. I think that
established ourselves early on and the team was able to carry it out to the
tune of shooting almost 55% for the game.  
_THE MODERATOR: We're open for questions._  
Q. Pokey, you talked about the need for Sylvia to be more dominant and kind
of play up to her capabilities. Did she start to do that today? Did she
approach that?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: I think so. You look at the fact that the looks that
Scholnda was able to knock down on the perimeter, it's a correlation. Sylvia's
activity would draw so much attention, if we get a paint touch, Scholnda can
get her feet set, so it all works in unison.  
Also a couple of blocked shots, the fact we had 58 points in the paint, she
secured the rebounds. I haven't seen our deflection chart yet, but I thought
she did a pretty good job of being active deflecting the ball, denying the
basketball, and she just played big in all facets of the game.  
Q. Pokey and Seimone, you probably don't realize, but she tied your LSU SEC
tournament record for scoring today, 30 points. I was wondering if you were
aware of that. I assume that's not why you took her out. I was wondering about
that.  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: Honestly, I didn't know I had any records left to break.
No, it's not. The hope is to continue playing, getting some fresh legs under
some people. It does seem like a pretty smooth move on my part.  
Seimone's game often gets written about like it comes easy. You think about
the double teams, the (indiscernible), she manages to be an unselfish player
and stay off, which ties into Sylvia getting the touches because she garners
so much attention. That attention wouldn't be the same if she wasn't an
active, unselfish player. Today you saw typical Mone in action.  
Q. Her 30 points tied you. Would you mind talking about that, tying her
record.  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I think she took me out on purpose (laughter). Coach is a
very competitive person. No, I'm just kidding.  
I mean, I'm just glad to just be in that company with coach. She set the
standards for LSU Tiger basketball. Most of my points came off today, like
coach said, just moving, reading the defense, doing the little things, setting
screens, to get people open and hoping that my defender had the help of
somebody else. I got open shots, maybe drive to the basket.  
Q. Pokey and Seimone, you must really like this building. You're 4-0. Last
time you were here, you won the SEC title. Are you going to petition to keep
it here? Is it special for you to come here and play well, knowing there's
thousands of people living in this state displaced by the hurricane? Are you
aware of that? Did you feel a strong fan contingent here?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: Yeah, extremely strong fan contingent. We're well aware
of the aftermath of Katrina because we're still living in the midst of it.
Yes, we've experienced some success here. There are other teams that are about
to shoot it up, start the next game. That helps you get back to reality
really, really quick.  
It's extremely important for us to play well because there were some things
that we didn't do particularly well at the end of the season. You know, this
conference will humble you. It's imperative that you correct those things.  
SEIMONE AUGUSTUS: I agree with coach. I think we sure play well because SEC
doesn't let you have the opportunity to kinda sit back and relax and think
about the victory you just had. You have to focus on the next opponent, the
opponent after that. Besides, this is post-season. You must be ready to play.  
Q. Scholnda, it seems you played with some energy that had been kind of
absent since the Tennessee win and the Georgia win. How much have you looked
forward to the post-season? Is that kind of what you needed to get your energy
level back up to where it was?  
SCHOLNDA HOSTON: You know, this is the time of year that you get excited
about. This is a lot of fun. Every game you go on, it's going to be big
competition. You got to go out there and step your game up. It's exciting. I
think that's why we have a little bit more energy. I just hope that we
continue to carry that out throughout the rest the tournament into the NCAA
tournament.  
Q. Coach, what did you tell your team at halftime to sort of cut down on the
amount of turnovers that you had in the first half?  
COACH POKEY CHATMAN: I said, "Cut down on the amount of turnovers we had."
(Laughter).  
No, it was one of those things where I thought Ole Miss might want go to a
press to get us out of rhythm. Then we gift wrapped it for them and they
stayed in it for several possessions. I wanted them to be aware of what role
we played in it, what role Ole Miss played in it, and be more in attack mode.
Couple ball reversals, the gaps get bigger, attack and punish people for
wanting to apply pressure to you, to understand that we control that. I
thought we did an okay job in the second half - a better job, not near where I
want to be.  
Q. Scholnda, it was a very back-and-forth game in the first few minutes,
then you hit three straight shots that broke the game open. Talk about that,
the start of the game. You got the open looks, help from Sylvia. Talk about
that stretch, what you were feeling, how good it felt to get back on track
offensively.  
SCHOLNDA HOSTON: It felt real good. A lot of credit to my teammates. They did
a good job of reversing the ball, penetrating in the gaps and kicking out to
me when I was open. I just tried to step in the gaps and knock them down.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

## March 2, 2006

  

### [Susan Walvius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15514)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: University of South Carolina. We have Coach Susan Walvius,
Shannel Harris and Melanie Johnson._  
_Coach, would you like to open up with a statement?_  
COACH SUSAN WALVIUS: I'm really proud of what our team has accomplished this
season. Our players have really worked hard. They've done a great, absolutely
fantastic job for us. Had an opportunity to challenge and finish fifth in the
league, ended up with a tough match-up against Auburn today.  
You know, I was concerned about this game because I know how strong Auburn is
defensively. We came into this game I think No. 1 in the country field goal
percentage defense. I think Auburn came in in the top five or they definitely
were in the top 10.  
Very strong defensive team, especially in the paint, which is the strength of
our offense. So I knew it would be a good match-up. We got some shots that we
wanted. We couldn't get our shots to fall. In our last six or seven games, we
have averaged over 50% from the floor. We've shot the ball extremely well. We
did a better job today taking care of the basketball. We had 19 offensive
rebounds today.  
If you look at our stat line, we have an opportunity to shoot the ball 10 more
times than a very good Auburn team, you think we walk out of here with a W. We
could not get shots to fall today. I know that became very frustrating for our
team.  
You have to give a lot of credit to Auburn. I thought Auburn played a great
game today. I was very impressed. I thought they did a great job attacking the
rim, I thought they did a nice job feeding inside, they stepped out, hit
outside shots. They shot a higher percentage on our basketball team than most
teams we've played against this year. Just really all the credit goes to them.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions._  
Q. What do you think your chances are now for an at-large bid?  
COACH SUSAN WALVIUS: I hope the NCAA committee will take a good hard look at
our basketball team because, again, you're going to have days where you don't
have a great game, and we had one today. We didn't play well.  
Certainly we've got to give Auburn some credit there. But we have, and we have
finished our season strong. We have played -- we're again No. 1 in the country
as far as field goal percentage defense, we have a very good basketball team,
we finished 7-7 in the SEC. We beat Minnesota out of conference. We beat
Florida late. Florida goes on to beat LSU and beat Tennessee. We have a great
basketball team.  
You know, I hope the NCAA will take a look at that.

## March 2, 2006

  

### [Stephany Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13862)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
COACH STEPHANY SMITH: It kind of been a season full of us one-half
performances; 25, 30-minute performances and tonight was another one of those
nights.  
I thought we played extremely well both offensively and defensively in the
first 20 minutes of this basketball game. I thought we did a good job of
keeping them off the offensive rebounds, communicating shooters and having
awareness of where their shooters were. They picked us apart a little bit with
a high-low game.  
I think the first half we had good efforts. In the second half about after the
first media timeout, around the ten-minute mark, they had built a ten-point
lead. We were still fighting but then they knocked down a few three-point
shots with miscommunication, we didn't communicate shooters and we passed by
shooters that were right in the zone.  
And then we just kind of shut down. That was really unfortunate. It went from
a 10-point game to a 30-point game in a matter of moments.  
I am thankful that we at least showed some fight in the last three minutes to
at least fight for respect if nothing else.  
Q. How much of it had to do with your short bench? Was there a fatigue
factor there?  
COACH STEPHANY SMITH: We have had a short bench for different reasons all
season long, whether it was foul trouble or injuries, and we're absolutely
loaded with injuries. And one thing that you probably don't know about Lauren
Hill, she plays a lot. She plays as hard as she does, she's very limited in
what we're allowed to put her in there for. She can only play four, five
minutes at a time. So our bench is even shorter than it appears.  
There are a lot of teams that play with a short bench. There are a lot of
teams that only play a seven-man roster.  
So yes, I think that's a factor. I think that it's weighed heavily on us all
season long. But I don't think there's anything wrong -- I think seven people
can come out here and get it done night in, night out. I mean, Florida beat
Tennessee with five on the road.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2006

  

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Auburn University, we have Dewanna Bonner and Whitney Boddie,
and Coach Fortner. Coach, if you would, open up with a statement._  
COACH NELL FORTNER: I thought it was an outstanding effort on our team today,
being ready to play and coming out real focused and knowing exactly what they
needed to do. You know, it's a win in advance. At this point, everybody is in
the same boat. I think this team was very hungry today.  
But I did think the difference in the game was having Whitney Boddie on the
floor as opposed to last time we played South Carolina, we did not. And she is
a difference maker.  
She made a big difference for Dewanna Bonner today. She made a big difference
for Keke Carrier today. That's what your point guards do, and that's what they
did today.  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions._  
Q. Can you talk about your play opening in the first half and second half?  
COACH NELL FORTNER: Well, I think, again, I think this team is probably very
hungry and played with tremendous effort. When you play that way, good things
can happen to you. But really proud of their focus, just staying very focused
to do the things they needed to do to win the ballgame.  
But I go back. Not to harp on it too much, but when you've got your point
guard playing and leading on the floor, it makes a big difference. Also not
just her, but she made a huge difference for Bonner. I think they feed off of
each other, the confidence they give each other. I think we saw what they can
do today.  
Q. Talk about your opponent tomorrow.  
COACH NELL FORTNER: Well, I mean, we just played them recently, so that's a
positive actually (laughter). We played them a pretty good 12 minutes in the
first half, then we got into a little bit of foul trouble, so it disrupted --
Bonner got in foul trouble, Keke Carrier got in foul trouble, Hobbs, who is
our sixth man off the bench got in foul trouble, and that disrupted us. We've
got to be very careful not to let that happen to us again.  
But we know Tennessee well. It's not like we're going to have to start from
scratch and know how to defend them and the plays they run. That's a good
thing actually.  
There's no question, Tennessee is a great team. They're going to be hungry
coming off their last game and a loss. They're going to be hungry to play well
tomorrow.  
Q. Your interior defense was pretty strong today. Talk about that.  
COACH NELL FORTNER: Well, you know, when I can keep Keke and Marita in the
game at the same time for extended periods of time, that's quite a formidable
force. 6'5", 6'7", if they're not blocking the shot, they're altering the
shot. I think they did a good job of that today.  
You know, this frontline is pretty big, 6'4", 6'5", 6'7". That's pretty hard
to shoot over, get around, everything else you need to do to score. But I
thought they were able to stay in the game together for extended periods of
time, and that was good today.  
Q. For either of the players, what do you remember about the meeting just a
few days ago with Tennessee? This is a Tennessee team right now that you think
is a bit vulnerable? Basically?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: They got a lot of big post players. But we also got a
lot of big post players. I remember we got to get Keke Carrier the ball more,
at least stay in the game a lot because she's posting up real hard coming into
ACC play.  
Q. Any thoughts?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I know we got to get Keke the ball and also stop their
inside player. I think Fluker had a career night against us. We can't let
their post players go off like they did. You know, stop them early in
transition, push them out, contain their other players and I think we'll be
all right.  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Most definitely. I mean, I feel like we can score on any
team really because we're big inside. We have guards who can do a lot of
things, too. So inside and out, we can score on them.  
COACH NELL FORTNER: Don't you love freshmen? They have no fear (laughter).

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2006

  

### [Brittany Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16367)

### [Carolyn Peck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13864)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: This is the first time we have gotten to do this. Coming
back to play tomorrow. I am very proud of our team. And when you get into the
SEC tournament, everybody's record is 0-0 because every team is going to come
and play their best basketball, and I thought that Mississippi State did a
great job with us today.  
They gave us problems with our players which is something we take pride in.
Second-chance opportunities, shooting the ball from the perimeter very well.
My team is doing a very good job of keeping their composure, bearing down and
doing what they needed to do in order to get this win today. And we're
thrilled about the opportunity to go back to the hotel and not have to pack
our suitcases.  
Q. Can you talk about having such a balanced offense and so many weapons how
that makes it hard for other teams to defend you guys?  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: Well, I think that that has a lot to do with the
unselfishness of our team. Because most teams will double when the ball comes
to Brittany or Dalila. That leaves opportunities on the perimeter. Or if they
have to put pressure on Sha or Danielle, then that opens up things inside.  
I think that our team does a really good job -- something that I am very proud
of them this year, is that they haven't forced too many shots. They have all
been good shots within our offense, and they play with a strategy. And if
shots hadn't fallen, we kept the emphasis on our defense, and that's what
we're trying to build our confidence from. I think everybody feels a part of
that. That defensive weight doesn't just land on one player's shoulders.  
Q. Talk about tomorrow's game against Kentucky, what you expect.  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: I expect it to be a huge battle. Kentucky is a very strong
rebounding team. They are also are a team that has a good post game that can
score inside as well as shooters on the perimeter with Ormerod, Pfeiffer and
Mahoney. They have got a good bench, a deep bench. We split in the regular
season.  
I think that both teams are going to be extremely motivated tomorrow.  
Q. Brittany, talk about your three-pointer before the end of the first half.
Did that give you guys a little bit of a lift to get a shot like that?  
BRITTANY DAVIS: Well, honestly, I guess I just saw Danny (Santos) and I came
up and we kind of almost ran into each other. I kind of just threw it towards
the basket. I couldn't really see it. It went in. I didn't even know it. She
expressed it to me because I couldn't see. People were standing over me.  
I think definitely it kind of gave us a little bit of something in the locker
room to run in with. Little excitement. It was just -- it was good. It was
fun.  
Q. Coach, talk about coming into the tournament how much the wins versus LSU
and Tennessee helped your team today.  
COACH CAROLYN PECK: To be honest with you, I don't think it helped too much,
just because, you know, the thing about it in going to those kind of games
we're not expected to win and the concentration, the hype, the excitement is a
little different than going into games that you are supposed to win.  
So I really can't even relate the two. I'm not saying that it was an automatic
victory over Mississippi State, it was just that we played the moment in the
season. So if you look on paper at just records or whatever, you might think
that Florida is supposed to win, but we all knew and that's the kind of -- the
thing that covers everybody in the locker room is that as much as you try to
say it is 0-0, you want to start from the back of some of your players' minds
and that you don't have that same hype and excitement that you do when you
play teams like Tennessee and LSU.  
We want to get ourselves to a point where we have got that same hype and
excitement regardless of who we play, because if the ball is falling a couple
of different ways today, we might have a different outcome because Mississippi
State came in and played a really tough game today.

### [Adrienne Bush](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15508)

### [Susie Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13858)

### [Sarah Pfeifer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15509)

### [Rochelle Vaughn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15510)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Arkansas, Coach Susie Gardner, Sarah
Pfeifer, Adrienne Bush and Rochelle Vaughn. If you would open up with a
statement._  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: Well, you know, we were prepared for this game. Our kids
were fired up for the game. We went over it in the locker room. The energy was
there the first half. I thought we fought, we battled, we played tough.  
And the second half was a different team. I felt like when Price got her third
foul in the first half, they did a great job taking some charges, and then
when she got her fourth foul, our best player is on the bench.  
From the stats, we shot the ball poorly. Our kids had said at practice that
they were committed to the press, we wanted to press, we pressed, and then it
just dribbled past us. There was no help, no taking a charge.  
You know, it's very tough. It's embarrassing to be in Little Rock, for the
City of Little Rock to work so hard to bring this tournament to Arkansas and
we had the fans behind us. You know, it's just really, really -- I don't know
how to explain it in all honesty.  
Q. How much did fatigue enter into what happened in the second half?  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: Well, we'll say one thing for Ole Miss; we have a larger
rotation, and last game we played them, they played six players, and that's
what they did rotation-wise. You look at their stats, their numbers and how
many people play per game, I think that -- Awkward is really only their true
point guard, and that was another part of our philosophy. If anyone would have
shown fatigue, it would have been them because we rotate more players in and
out.  
Q. They had 44 points in the paint, and -- (Inaudible).  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: Yeah, it was layups, it was dribbling right to the
middle. You would think that a post player or an outside guard, what a perfect
opportunity to take a charge. We talked to them about doing that, but at the
same time we can't get beat up and have a four one-on-one. At some point the
score got so far, we can't not press. We had to look like we were still
trying, but you're right. I mean, I don't know, they were easy baskets for
sure, easy layups.  
Q. This is for Susie and Sarah. You guys obviously struggled from the three-
point line. Can you just talk about that and how tough that was?  
SARAH PFEIFER: We took the shots, we just didn't make one. We started giving
them back and then the team collectively missed shots.  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: We live and die by the three-point shot. In my opinion
that's the best way to play women's baseball is the three-point shot. We can't
jump but we can hit threes. After a couple of threes early, that gets the team
started, that gets the fans started up and that helps to cut the score, as
well. We had some very good three-point shooters, but we weren't hitting them,
and that's a big part of our game plan. I felt like they were good shots. I
don't think they were rushed shots. I felt like they were wide open, but they
didn't hit.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: I thought Kristina Andjelkovic played a good game. She
was all around, she was down on the floor. She was running the press. She
played her heart out. She's got to end her career feeling good about it, I did
everything I could in my last game. I thought she played well and I thought
Moore played well.  
We could have gotten the ball inside a little bit more, I guess.  
Q. What's the difference between the first and second half as far as the
three-pointers because there really wasn't any either half, but the first half
you were able to compensate with the inside game.  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: I think the difference was basically the points was part
of it. They were getting easy baskets, and baseball is a game of momentum, and
they were just taking it. They had the momentum and we didn't, and I think
that when you get down by a chunk, you tend to -- we couldn't get anyone to
step up for us offensively, and I wasn't sure who was going to take the ball.
I said, give me the ball, I'll take it. You've got to have somebody to take
the ball and go down there and make good shots. That was the difference
between the first and second halves.  
Q. Adrienne, can you talk about the frustrating end to the season, and then
it seemed like today kind of capped it off in a bad way.  
ADRIENNE BUSH: That's one of those things where you start off so well in the
SEC, everyone is positive and things kind of snowballed from there, and it's
the same way when you lose. You try your hardest and you go out there and you
make the plays and you try as much as possible, and I felt like in the first
half that's what we did. And then in the second half, like coach said, it was
like a different team out there. When things are going bad, they go bad.  
Q. This is for Adrienne and Coach. Did you all feel like it was a home court
atmosphere out there, and if so, did you not take advantage of that?  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: Yeah, the first half definitely. You talk about calling
the hog, and that was happening. Certainly at the same time we had such a long
drought of not scoring in the second half, that just takes the crowd out of
it. I think you're right, we did not take advantage of that at all.  
ADRIENNE BUSH: It was a missed opportunity for us, especially the second half.
If we could have maybe just gotten a lead, built a little bit of momentum that
way, we would have kept the fans into it. Missing shots, you know, like I
said, it kind of snowballed, and it was really disappointing to be out there
playing well the first half, and then the second half not doing the same
thing. It was very disappointing.  
Q. This is for Susie and Adrienne. You mentioned the charge. It sounded like
you were hoping to catch some more people doing that. Talk about giving up
your body and taking those charges.  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: We take a lot of pride in that, and we don't do take
charge drills because you can't simulate a charge. The person going for the
hole is not going to want to make contact so they can't reach in on the person
-- it's just not game-like. Our charge leader takes them better than anybody
and she'll lay it out there for you, and she gets in hard, too, because she
lays it out.  
I kept convincing the other players they knew what was coming; defensively
that's the biggest play on this baseball team minus a blocked shot. It's a
hustle play, it's a selfless play, somebody that will sacrifice their body. I
respect Adrienne Bush so much because she will do that, and she did it
tonight.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
ADRIENNE BUSH: For me personally it's kind of one of those things, Coach --
I've been playing such shoddy defense lately, and that puts me in position to
be able to take charge because they were driving with their head down low.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: From the University of Mississippi we have coach Carol Ross,
Carla Bartee, Ashley Johnson and Armintie Price. Would you like to open up
with a statement, please?_  
COACH CAROL ROSS: Well, we put together a great game, and to really see the
same team that we were so familiar with in November and December, they kind of
disappeared. It was really seizing the moment and taking the opportunity to
open a new door to a new season, and I'm glad, all of us, for the players in
particular, that they had success.  
Rebounding wasn't spectacular but we did a much better job in the second half.
Then we had a talk about it all year long, so it was great to put a game
together where our defense and offense were both pretty stout, pretty strong.  
Q. Just talk about, the opposite of what you expected that you can't rebound
and you outshoot them, opposite of the first game, and still win.  
COACH CAROL ROSS: I'm not that surprised because we came into the tournament
with a fresh frame of mind, refreshed. We let go at the end of the season. We
had too many disappointing moments, and we really looked forward to starting
anew, and the team embraced that.  
We're happy about where we are. Any time you can advance in this tournament
it's a good day, and we feel very good that we were given the opportunity to
play one of the best teams in the country and in our league, and tomorrow at
noon we'll see what happens.  
Q. Any of the players, just talk about in the second half, you guys really
put them away. It seemed like you guys had a lot of legs and it looked like
they were running on empty. Did you sense that?  
OLE MISS PLAYER: In the second half we got a lot of fast break points and a
lot of easy layups. We reached the ball a lot in the second half.  
Q. Did it seem like -- (Inaudible).  
OLE MISS PLAYER: It kind of did to me.  
Q. This is for Coach Ross, any of the players, the threes, they live and die
by that. Talk about that impact on the game against your defense and how did
you feel about that?  
COACH CAROL ROSS: A combination of things. Obviously we came into this game
fresh off an Arkansas match-up on Sunday afternoon and they shot the three
pretty well Sunday, and we knew they had the capabilities to do that. We
focused again on that.  
I thought essentially our coverage was better today than it was on Sunday. We
were fortunate the few times they got open looks an they simply didn't put the
ball in the basket. Part of it is a combination of our coverage was good at
times and they simply missed some looks sometimes.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH CAROL ROSS: Any player can have a great moment, and that's exactly what
she had, Awkward, was a great moment. Coming off that 37-point performance, I
was more worried about somebody else having that moment because if you haven't
done something consecutively throughout the season, it's unlikely you'll do it
again. We didn't want her to get that mentality that -- (Inaudible). We were
mindful of where she was much more so today than we were Sunday.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
OLE MISS PLAYER: Well, they gave me the three, and when I hit the three, I
tried to post-up. I tried to drive in, and I just tried to let it go --
(Inaudible).  
Q. For any of the players, did you all feel like this was a home game for
them, and if so, was it important to take the crowd out of it? Did you feel
like it was a road game?  
COACH CAROL ROSS: Well, we did know they had the home court advantage, it's in
their state. Arkansas has great support, and we knew that the fans were going
to be more for Arkansas than us. We talked in the locker room about coming out
and getting off to a good start so that they could quiet the crowd, and to
keep the hogs from squealing we needed to play defense and rebound and just
take enthusiasm out of the building if we could. I felt for the most part that
we did that.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
OLE MISS PLAYER: Well, Armintie is all-around a great player. Of course we
look at each other, and we're like, uh-oh, we've got to take our game up. She
gets a lot of rebounds. We had to take good shots and hope that we could hit
them.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
OLE MISS PLAYER: Everybody came into the spot. We just wanted to keep it
going. Not coach.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
OLE MISS PLAYER: They came out with everything they had. It was just our job
to step it up. We did come into this game knowing they were one of the best
defensive teams out there. Every time we got the ball, we got the attack.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH CAROL ROSS: Well, I think we're on the right track, but we take it one
game at a time. This game is now behind us and we have to look forward to LSU
and look at things we did in this game and try to make those stronger the next
game.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  
Q. Can you just talk about flow of the game; first half was very close then
in the second half you blew it out. Talk about what was happening with your
team over the course of it.  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: Well, defense we changed at halftime. We really wanted
to force them into turnovers since that's what they were struggling with and
we pressured and trapped. In the second half we went to more of contained
defense and said, we ain't pressuring, we ain't trapping. We're not going to
get crazy because we get one steal, and for every one steal, they will get
five layups uncontested. So we wanted to force them to shoot over us, and to
rebound instead of rotating and giving them easy baskets.  
We did a great job in making that adjustment and the defense changed the whole
game.  
Q. Can you talk about your two freshman Jennifer Risper nine assists, zero
turnovers and Tina Wirth your leading scoring with 17 points.  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: What's really nice about freshman is we don't expect a
lot out of them, so there's not a lot of pressure on them. In the SEC
tournament that's when everybody feels the pressure because their season could
end, or that tournament could end.  
As you saw Nicole Jules didn't have her best game and the freshman picked it
up. They played freely. They were very excited to play in their first SEC
tournament, and it showed. They just responded really well.  
Q. Talk about the balance on your offense. You had four players with double
figures.  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: That's what we talked about after the game. That's what
we always try to achieve. We really like to share the ball and have balance
out there. What I like is, as you see, we had I think it was 32 assists and 35
baskets and that's pretty impressive. That means that we're sharing the
basketball, taking good shots, creating shots for other people not ourselves.
That's tough to guard. We don't rely on the same person every night, of the
same people every night, or if someone was hurt, sick or in foul trouble we
don't fall apart.  
Not everybody is going to bring their best game every night. We are starting
to develop as a team as different people stepping up each night, that's what I
like.  
Q. Nine three-pointers tonight, how much did that help you all as far as
just opening things up?  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: Well, I think one of the people sitting next to me,
Cherish, she really stepped up to hit when we needed the threes that she took.
They were big and she hit them when it was real close. Cherish got some looks
and she made most of them. I think that really helped us.  
It's funny, the two people sitting next to me are the two people I have said
every day after the LSU game, when we worked the team harder, that these two
people were the two who made a huge difference, changed, worked harder and
made us a better team down the stretch. As you can see those are the two that
made big plays today, and stepped up at big times because they had confidence,
and they have earned that confidence.  
Q. (Inaudible) tomorrow night's game?  
COACH MELANIE BALCOMB: We just lost to Georgia, so we have a bad taste in our
mouth about that game. We were very unpleased with our play and we just --
it's a game that all we can do, I think, in that game is help ourselves, you
know. So in this tournament you're playing a great team and it helps yourself
down the road. I mean, I think we can play free.  
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain playing at Georgia.  
Q. Cherish and Carla, can you talk about Coach's comments about the changes
that you have made since the LSU game?  
CARLA THOMAS: Making a difference and to make something happen in terms of
what you're willing to put into the game and put into the team, and I think
everyone stepped up a lot in that respect. I think that's why our defense is
doing so much better. I guess that's how she feels about us personally. That's
nice.  
CHERISH STRINGFIELD: Just to add on what Carla said, she just asked us to work
harder and took something that we willing to work hard at every day and work
hard, and the next day pick another thing and eventually it will all come
together. It just paid off.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
CHERISH STRINGFIELD: There are times when I was wide open. When you are wide
open, you call for the ball and stick it in the basket. That's what I did.  
Q. Talk about that second half.  
CHERISH STRINGFIELD: We came out in the second half. We had to be more
energetic and bring it more in the defensive end. We did that by trying to
make turnovers trying to create offense from our defense. I think we did that.
And that was the turnaround in the game.
